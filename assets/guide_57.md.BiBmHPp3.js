The information is great becaus it is expanding my knowledge base of criminal organizations and their capabilities."},{"Title":"Organized Crime, Third Edition","review":"As with most books on organized crime, this is a textbook. It is, in my opinion, the best textbook on this topic available. I have taught organized crime at the university level for a number of years now and have looked at a wide variety of textbooks. This book is superior to the others in a number of ways. First, it is comprehensive. There is a tendency of some authors to become infatuated with the Italian Mafia to the exclusion of all else. That does not happen with Lyman and Potter. Second, it is balanced-the authors differentiate between myths and facts concerning organized crime, something often missing in other books. Finally, the authors include both theoretical explanations of organized crime and linkages between OC, government, and honest citizens. The fact that organized crime cannot exist without the connivance of government and the public is critical to understanding the existence and success of criminal enterprises and is often ignored by authors. This relationship is a major theme of this text; one that sets it above other books."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I am so glad to find the Hardy Boys.

Even though I was sick in bed, reading it all day, I couldn't put it down. It was a little boring at the beginning through 10 to 20 pages with a little too much, \\"Ohhh daddy, you let have the detective case and were happy.\\" Let me just say, BORING!!! But overall, the whole book was a fantastic fox, but not like the movie, much better. Don't even get me started on that. Don't get that movie!!! This book did have some parts where you wondering how the heck did someone not die in that part and come to think of it now, I think I fell asleep while reading it.I would have to say this book had great, great detail and I was picturing it perfectly and clearly in my mind so congrats to the author of the book, Franklin W. Dixon. It also was too much detail. Some of the detail was hard to get. This book also doesn't take long to read so if you like good short stories, this is one of them. It was a very exhilarating story also. You wanted to read the book and you don't. I think Franklin had a good picture in his head when he wrote it also because the story kept flowing. The story on the other hand was predictable and you could tell nothing bad was going to happen to someone and in the end they will all be together and capture the bad guy. I give the book eight and a half out of ten because of Franklin's detail, thought put into it, and the story's plot line. This is a better book for young children and I recommend it."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I bought this book from the kindle store.

However, I was pleasantly surprised at the differences between the two books. Whereas the first book moved at a moderate pace, the second moved much quicker as there was a tremendous amount of action and even suspense. The Tower Treasure dealt mostly with a passive mystery which the Hardy Boys were following, picking up clues as they went. Here, in The House on the Cliff, the mystery is quite active and the boys are participants in its various stages pushing it along to its conclusion.The scene is slightly removed from their town of Bayport. An old, abandoned house looms over a cliff is where Mr Hardy suggests is a good place for his sons, and their friends, to set up a telescope to keep an eye out on the ocean to try and spot traces of a smuggling ring. No sooner have the boys done this but they begin to hear screaming from the abandoned home. The mystery is off and running...Characters such as Callie, Iola and Mrs Hardy take on a much lesser role than they had during the first book, while Pretzel Pete and a few other interesting figures are introduced. The disappearance of Mr Hardy, attempted murder, lots and lots of mayhem, culminate in a hostage situation that includes the boys, but in the end the bad are caught and the good go on to figure out...The Secret of the Old Mill."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"This set of six books is a great way to start your Hardy Boys Mysteries collection. The first six books, while dated, are some of the best books in the series. Here is a brief synopsis of each of the six stories.\\"The Tower Treasure\\"In this introduction to the Hardy Boys series, bonds and jewels have been stolen from Mr. Hurd Applegate. Mr. Applegate thinks it is Mr. Robinson, the gardener and general handyman. Fenton Hardy, the boys' father, Frank and Joe Hardy and all their friends do not believe that Mr. Robinson had anything to do with the robbery. The Hardy Boys begin their very first case!After a series of events, including the recovery of Chet Morton's stolen car, one of the boys nearly plunging to his death in Mr. Applegate's house, and the actual death of a criminal, the boys suddenly realize where the jewels and bonds might be found.\\"The House on the Cliff\\"In the second book in this series the danger is increased. Famous detective Fenton Hardy invites his sons on a case. This time Frank and Joe accidentally observe smugglers attacking a man on the ocean. Before the boys can see what happens to the man they hear a cry from an abandoned nearby house, which is perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean. Their search is fruitless, and on returning where they had left an expensive telescope, they discover the eyepieces are missing. The mystery begins.The smugglers are bringing rare drugs into the country, by means unknown. Fenton Hardy disappears during the investigation, leaving the boys with an even bigger mystery, and their mother with concerns regarding Fenton's safety.The exciting conclusion of this book involves the Coast Guard, secret passages and a mysterious cargo ship. As the battle between the smugglers, the police, the Coast Guard, and Joe, Frank, and Fenton Hardy rages on, everyone is in danger because the smugglers have guns and are not afraid to use them.\\"Secret of the Old Mill\\"Chet Morton, a good friend of the Hardy boys, and Frank and Joe Hardy are on their way to purchase a new microscope when they save a boy's life. The boy, Ken Blake, is a delivery boy for Elekton Corporation, which does top secret work on military rockets. After finding Ken's package, he is on his way to complete his delivery.We soon learn that the Elekton facility is new, and Elekton refurbished an old mill to act as part of the guard house for the new operation. We soon learn that there is something unusual going on in the old mill.As the story evolves, we learn the old mill has a unique warning system, a hidden room, and a secret tunnel. We also learn that there is more than a single mystery in this book, which makes for interesting reading as the reader attempts to guess who the bad guys might be, and what their motivations are.\\"The Missing Chums\\"At the beginning of the book the boys take their new boat, the Sleuth, out on the bay. While they are cruising on the bay another boat nearly rams them. They would have chased the boat but the steering on the Sleuth broke, and the boys ended up going around in circles. Soon the Sleuth is stolen, and good friends Chet Morton and Biff Hooper disappeared after a party. The boys not only have to learn who stole the Sleuth, but where their missing friends went, and who robbed a local bank.\\"Hunting for Hidden Gold\\"At last the Joe and Frank Hardy and their father Fenton get away from Bayport for a mystery. The boys travel to Montana through Chicago. In Chicago, men posing as their father's associates kidnap them. After a harrowing escape and stupid actions on the part of the kidnappers, the boys were able to continue on their journey. In Montana it appears their adversaries are ruthless, and their adversaries attempt numerous times to stop the Hardys from investigating their activities, including trying to kill the Hardy boys and their father. The boys fend off assassins, a fall from a cliff, and a cave-in in their most harrowing adventure yet.\\"The Shore Road Mystery\\"A string of car robberies have piqued the Hardy Boy's interest. It appears as though the car thieves regularly elude the police even when the police are hot on their trail. When the Hardy Boys put their minds to the mystery what they discover is that the car crooks are even cleverer than they could ever have suspected. There are mysteries galore as a spider-man is introduces, along with mysterious plowing at night without lights and a family mystery. A simple car theft becomes an excellent Hardy Boys puzzle.The publisher recommends the Hardy Boys series for ages 9 to 12 because the series is relatively tame for the previous target audience of ages 10 to 14. This particular book is a good fit for the new age range. Though the Hardy Boys series contains archaic information, as reading material for an increasingly younger audience they are good. Once a child has reached age 12 or so the stories may be of less interest, but given the combination of mystery and action, these books remain good safe choices for parents who want to know what their children are reading."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Franklin W. Dixion's series the Hardy Boys in the book Hunting for Hidden Gold is a book filled with action and mystery. Every turn of the page brings more and more mystery and excitement to me and other readers who read the series of the hardy boys. This fictional book is about two boys and their father are devoted crime stoppers who yet again embark on adventure filled with action, adventure, danger, and mystery. The Hardy's are assigned to assist their father (another well know crime stopper in there fictional world) in bringing down a well know brigand that has inhabited the woods in lucky lode. It is a constant race with the clock to find the brigand and his henchmen and what they are trying to find and to bring them to justice.I happened to find this book very entertaining at points it brought to the edge of my chair in some parts but it could get boring in some places. It's like they are taking it minute by minute with quick hair brain plans and still not get hurt. I think that it can be a little unrealistic some of the time. This book I think is trying to say even though you might be young or small anything is possible. My over all opinion of the book is that I found it very entertaining and interesting it made me want to find out where the treasure comes into place and find out if the brigand was brought to justice. I give the book a 4 out of five. I would also read the other books within the series of the hardy boys.GSK"},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I used to read these books when I was a child.

Frank looks through the telescope and he sees a big boat. Joe said, \\"It might be Snattman the smuggler\\". Joe looks through the telescope and a man was climbing down the side of the cliff to a small boat.They all heard a man scream from inside the house on the cliff.

The revised edition is most familiar, but this one is richer in subplots and character development. This book was originally released back in the late 1920's, and is, arguably, the best Hardy Boys book in the entire series. Admittedly this is my personal opinion, but I have read each and every Hardy Boys title (both original and revised text)in the first 58. This story was revised during the first wave revisions of the Hardy Boys back in the late 1950s. If you've never read the original text version of this story, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"The first of the revised Hardy Boys stories, \\"The Tower Treasure,\\" was relatively tame, even though there were a couple of moments of near danger.

This time the Hardy Boys accidentally observe smugglers attacking a man on the ocean.

The stories were once recommended for children ages 10 to 14. As children are exposed to more violence and seem to require greater levels of stimulation, the recommended age range has move to 9 to 12. I think any child capable of reading some of the challenging words in these books will enjoy them, regardless of how tame most of the action may be.

I started reading these books when I was seven, and eventually collected thirty or forty of them, reading them all two or three times. I recently found several in an old box in the basement, including &quot;House on The Cliff&quot; and &quot;Secret of the Old Mill.&quot; When I read one to my ten-year-old daughter, I discovered that time had not tarnished their quality nor distorted my fond memory of them. Now my daughter wants to read another.Dixon utilizes two key techniques to capture kids' imagination and keep their attention. One is action. Kids get distracted easily. Dixon never gives them the chance. Exciting, dangerous, and mysterious stuff starts happening right away in each book and continues in every chapter. The other is to end each chapter with some unresolved event so suspenseful that kids must keep reading. I can't tell you how many times I stayed up late to keep reading a Hardy Boys mystery.Every book in the series is as good as the next. Dixon created characters and a formula that worked, and he stuck with them consistently. They teach good old-fashioned values, and are fun and easy to read--the perfect step up from baby books to chapter books. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"I started reading these in 6th grade because my dad had like all of them because he was a big fan.

I've always thought this tale would make a great Hardy Boys movie. The Boys show plenty of guts and good detective ability in this one. Fenton plays a major role here and he works well with his sons.

Rating: Original: A+"},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Written by Leslie McFarlane from an outline by publisher Edward Stratemeyer, THE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF--the second book in the Hardy Boys series--was first published in 1927. In the late 1950s the earliest novels in the series were re-written to make the characters more consistent and keep the books contemporary; even so, this is 1950s contemporary, and readers will not find computers, cell phones, and the like in the original series. The characters are also very distinctly of their era, with Frank and Joe Hardy, their friends, and their parents reflecting then-popular ideas about good and bad, family relationships, and the like.In this particular story, detective father Fenton Hardy has asked sons Frank and Joe to visit the \\"Old Pollit place,\\" an empty house on a cliff that commands a view of the bay, to look for possible smugglers. The Hardy Boys books are written to a specific formula, so certain elements repeat from book to book--but even so, THE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF is one of the more unexpected books in the series. The boys encounter possible smugglers, experience a theft, run afoul of a landslide, and rescue a drowning man--and that's just the first four chapters! The entire book is written at a very fast pace, so it is an enjoyable quick read.No one would accuse the Hardy Boys books of being great literature. They are distinctly formula in both plot and style. Even so, the books are brightly written and never talk down to their target audience--and older readers who enjoyed them in their childhood will find it a pleasing bit of nostalgia. THE HOUSE ON THE CLIFF is among the best in the series, entertaining, mindless fun.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Me and my bro purchased this book.

They describe a period in American history that is much simpler (and generally safer)than most kids live in today.

Harry Potter probably pushed the outer limit for length and number of volumes.So, I'm inclined to provide my young readers with samples from some of the old series. That includes the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, Cherry Ames, Trixie Belden, Tom Swift and some older and more obscure collections.For Hardy Boys starters this particular title seems to stand up as the acknowledged best.

The House on the Cliff, referenced in the title, is an obvious metaphor for all human endeavor. The house is located there because it affords a commanding view of the bay that Bayport is named after - Bayport Bay. This allows any occupant, from almost any room, to see water.But it does not end there. The real action happens along the Bayport's bustling waterfront, Bayport Bay Port.You see, the original of this story was written before the repeal of prohibition. Rumrunners and bootleggers abound in lawless Bayport. However, two noted vintners (a thinly disguised characterization of Ernest and Julio Gallo) continue to ferment their matchless heavy wine there: Bayport Bay Port Port. How these honest, well-intentioned artists meet their comeuppance has, as you'll see, everything to do with the view afforded by the House on the Cliff.I won't spoil the ending for you.

It was good because I like houses on cliffs, or anything like that. I also like cliff climbing, and thw whole thing is as good as cliff climbing. It was a lot to read about, so I can't remember much.

It always left you on cliff hangers and you would not want to leave the book, or if you already have you would want to come back very very soon. It is very unpredictable and mysterious becuase it is a mysterious book. The book is the best I have ever read in my life and I've read tons of books. There are no bad parts that will make you bored or feel stupid reading this book. There are only good parts that are fun to read and I really truthfully recommend this book to anyone who can read."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Daniel Dipesio11/5/12The House on the CliffThis book is a mystery that Franklin W. Dixon wrote very well. He leaves you hanging at the end of a chapter, but picks up where he left off. He makes you feel like you're in the book with the Hardy's and their friends Chet Morton, and others. They all love solving mysteries together.The boys and their father are on a case of missing supplies off of a ship. the police can't figure it out, the great detective Fenton Hardy is called on the case. His sons witness a man trying to be killed by the smugglers in a boat chase. The man ends up in the water from an explosion. The Hardy boys and their friends swim and row their way to help the man in the water. they get him and bring him to an old farmhouse nearby and they take him in and help him out.The next day the Hardy boys go and check on the man, they find the owners of the farmhouse tied up and the man gone. when they untied the farmers, they told the Hardy's that people came in and took the man and drove off about ten minutes before they got there.The Hardy's drove after them, but saw no vehicles on the beach, plus the smugglers had ten minutes on them.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries and want a long series of books to read. The book says that it is for younger people, but I think it is for anyone who wants to read good books that have some suspense. These books are good for almost anyone."},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"The book was in perfect condition and was exactly as advertised. It came very quickly.

Once inside, they hear a shriek which scares all but Frank and Joe out. The Boys investigate but find nothing. They leave but a storm forces them all back to the house. They hear more shrieks, get locked in and part of the house starts to collapse! They finally get out but have problems with their motorcycles and find their tool kits stolen.They are distracted by a boat chase out on the bay. There are shots from one boat and the other boat explodes! The Boys row out to save the pilot of the boat. Finding him injured, they bring him to a nearby farmhouse to recuperate. The man gives his name as \\"Jones\\" and claims \\"Snackley got me - the rat!\\" The Boys return home and Fenton tells them that Snackley is an infamous smuggler.The next day, the Boys return to the farmhouse only to find the farmer and his wife bound and gagged. \\"Jones\\" is missing and the Boys give chase but lose him. Returning home, they find that Fenton has disappeared and a forged note left behind. They start a search and a truck driver reports he saw Fenton walking out by the Polucca place.The next day, the Boys, accompanied by Chet, Biff, Tony and Phil, go out to the old home but find it's now occupied by some seedy characters. The occupants claim ignorance but Franks spots Fenton bloodied cap hanging inside the house!They report their findings to Chief Collig, the fat, pompous leader of the Bayport PD, and his moronic sidekick, Det. Smuff. The cops dither and the Boys have to shame them into making an investigation. Reluctantly, the Chief agrees to go the next day and, of course, discovers nothing.Fed up, the Boys take matters into their own hands and go out with Tony on his boat, \\"The Napoli\\", to explore the cliffs by the Polucca place. They find a hidden cove but are chased away at gunpoint by Snackley. Hanging around nearby till after dark, they overhear the smugglers. Frank and Joe go ashore and find a hidden cave entrance. They discover that it leads all the way to the cliff top and the smugglers are stashing their booty there.Overhearing Snackley threatening Fenton, they attempt a rescue and are captured. Snackley threatens to send the Boys out to a watery grave with his partner-in-crime, Li Chang.Later, Fenton overpowers the guard and they escape, only to be spotted and chased into the Polucca house. There's a running gun battle and Fenton and the Boys are recaptured. Suddenly, the state police show up and everything is thrown into turmoil. Fenton and Snackley have a life-and-death struggle and the gang is finally rounded up.The Boys and Fenton split a $5,000 reward, we find out that Snackley was Polucca's nephew and that he had murdered the old man. With some of that 5 grand, the Boys throw a big dinner party for their pals in the barn behind the Hardy home.Comments: The best story in the canon! A dark, violent tale of smuggling, drugs, kidnapping and murder! None of the other stories can match this one for sheer exciting adventure! I've always thought this tale would make a great Hardy Boys movie. The Boys show plenty of guts and good detective ability in this one. Fenton plays a major role here and he works well with his sons. The gun battle and fight at the climax is the most thrill-packed prose in any Hardy story. If you read only one Hardy Boys book, it should be this one.Rating: A+"},{"Title":"The House on the Cliff (Hardy Boys, Book 2)","review":"Hardy boys The house on the cliff was a suspense-filled mystery that kept me at the edge of my seat.

Unfortunately, in my youth I read the 1960's version, but this version, written in the 1920's, is much much better (I'm 39 now and read it to my son).I think the most interesting thing about this book is that a lot of the problems that today's parents/teachers/politicians complain about are the main topic in this story. Without giving away the storyline, it has drug running, gangs, crime, violence and murder. I guess it just goes to show that the good old days weren't always what they seem to be.A nice bonus for this book is that for those of you who always wanted to know about Franklin W.

It is a reproduction of the original publication of this book. The original copyright is 1927 (though this Applewood edition bears a 1991 copyright). Books 1-38 of the Hardy Boys were revised beginning in the early 1960s. Some of the revisions were primarily intended to modernize the stories. Others resulted in substantial change in the plot and narrative content. This re-print of the original 1927 book is significantly different in narrative content from the revision. Having said that, the basic plot premise is still the same. In this book, the Hardys uncover a smuggling ring. But the real treat is the fact that the original text of \\"House on the Cliff\\" is probably the very best written of the Hardy boys series. The plot, and the narrative tension are quite good---especially when you consider that this was intended to be a mass appeal series book. I originally \\"stumbled\\" across the original text House on the Cliff in my school library. I kept asking to go to the library so I could read the book (no one had checked it out in years).

It is a fun and exciting read.It's age is perhaps reflected in the villains who threaten but avoid doing too much more, but also by a strong affirmation of family bonds and especially father-son relationships with the heroes openly proud and protective of their parents, and the parents regularly affirming their boys.

These practices restore balance and harmony not only in our personal lives, but also in our family and our greater community.The central theme of Tiziana DellaRovere's Sacred Fire: Rites of Passage and Rituals of Worship is that in our world today, we have lost the rituals and ceremonies that mark the initiation of each new phase in our lives. Rites of passage are crucial to our personal development, and without them we often feel a sense of confusion, meaninglessness, and lack of recognition of who we are. Due to a deep need for rituals and ceremonies to recognize and empower our growth, many of us resort to acting out in order to mark our passage in this world. The major events and turning points in our lives, such as conception, birth, coming of age, sexuality, marriage, aging, and death, are not regarded as the sacred path of the human life, but rather as frightening and stressful. As a result, there is great confusion about why we are here and what our connection is to the Divine. The transformational practices of this book are desperately needed today because they are profoundly effective in restoring our sense of self and belonging in the world.In the years since the release of Sacred Fire, Tiziana DellaRovere has continued to write and paint. On July 30, 1999, she was gifted with a series of visions of Divine Mother Mary, who entrusted her with a body of work called Adorata, a path of feminine spirituality for men and women to directly connect with Divine Mother's love."},{"Title":"Diccionario Basico de la Lengua Espanola / Basic Dictionary (Diccionarios Espasa) (Spanish Edition)","review":"This book is by the supreme authority in the Spanish language.

Thanks"},{"Title":"General Introduction to the Bible, A","review":"David Ewert's account of many aspects of the Bible's transmission down through the centuries is very interesting and much of it quite pertinent even to the average informed Christian layman. There seem to be far too many common misunderstandings about both the historic Douay-Rheims, Douay-Rheims-Challoner, and Authorised \\"King James\\" version Bibles among Christian laity and even among the clergy and scholars in the Protestant and Catholic ranks.Nevertheless, it remains true today as it has in the past that the two strongest and most faithful Bible versions in English are the Authorised \\"King James\\" Version (translated from the Masoretic Hebrew text of the Old Testament, various Greek and Latin texts of the books of the Apocrypha, and Byzantine \\"Textus Receptus\\" Greek of the New Testament), the ultimate Scriptural authority in English for Anglicans and Protestants, and the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version (translated throughout from the Clementine Latin Vulgate Bible). The comments here deal with these two great English translations (\\"versions\\") of the Bible into English.The Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version never attained the kind of near conformity in wording of editions across the years of the Authorised \\"King James\\" Version (A.V.). The A.V. Bible did benefit from its \\"Crown Copyright\\" protection from having to endure the ravages that unauthorised and bold revisions, or other changes to wording, inflicted upon other versions. The small variants which do exist in the texts of the A.V. as the university presses of Cambridge and Oxford in England (and in Scotland of the few publishers there licensed by the Crown to publish the A.V. there) are so superficial as to require rather a lot of effort to detect. They derive from various officially-sanctioned revisions, to matters only of minute detail, to the A.V. that the two leading British universities undertook, with Royal approval, in the 17th and 18th centuries. These licensed university publishers in the United Kingdom often printed the A.V. for the Bible societies, as well, in Scotland, such privileged publishers with important lines of Bible in their catalogues as Eyre & Spottiswoode and Collins. These university and private British publishers often printed the A.V. for the Bible societies in the U.K. and even abroad.The most grievous variance is the increasingly frequent omission over the years of the A.V.'s Apocrypha (and, yes, the deutero-canonical books are an authentic part of the A.V.!), due to unrelenting pressures from the \\"dissenters\\" (or \\"non-conformists\\") of Britain's various non-Anglican Protestant denominations and sects, and especially due to early opposition to the inclusion of the Apocrypha in Bibles printed or distributed by the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Trinitarian Bible Society in Britain (representing many non-Anglican Protestant groups as well as the more Apocrypha-friendly Church of England) and by some Bible societies elsewhere. This policy of the various Bible societies to exclude the Apocrypha has waned in recent decades regarding editions of the A.V. and other translations which they publish and/or distribute, although the T.B.S. still excludes the Apocrypha from editions printed for distribution under its auspices.The Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version never benefited from a Crown Copyright, the license reserved in the United Kingdom for the A.V. as the Crown's official Bible, the British Crown itself being by law Anglican and hence moderately Protestant. Even editors and publishers abroad in non-Commonwealth countries have tended to respect the textual integrity of the A.V.; most American editions of the A.V. (even though the A.V.'s British Crown Copyright is less often or so consistently enforced in the U.S. of A. as it has been in Britain and the Commonwealth) have tended to display variants only in spelling, paragraphing, extent or content of alternate readings in the marginal notes, presence or absence of \\"St.\\" or \\"Saint\\" in the titles of the various books as attributed to their various authors of the New Testament, brief summaries in italics or in small print at the start of chapters, and other such surface matters.This Christian reader has editions of the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Bible as published in the U.S.of A. by various firms and as published by the Catholic Truth Society in the U.K., which tend to have divergences in the wording which are fairly minor, but far more numerous and easily detectable than the tiny variants which occur in various editions of the the A.V. Apparently the degree to which editors chose to follow Challoner's revisions, so elegantly worded, to the wording of the Douay-Rheims Version varies from one edition to another of the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version. Such divergences, perhaps, are somewhat regrettable, but such minor divergences in editions of the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version should not be taken to deny the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Bible the status that it so richly deserves as the foremost of Roman Catholic Bible versions in English.Surely anyone who takes the effort to scrutinise the wording of the Douay-Rheims Bible in its pre-Challoner form will notice the considerable differences immediately! This reader first became aware of the matter in consulting the portion for the original Douay-Rheims Version as found in the Octapla New Testament (published to mark the appearance of the Revised Standard Version), a publication which included eight versions that either had preceded or followed the A.V. and which led before 1611 to the A.V.'s wording or which revised the A.V. after 1611, leading to the R.S.V. One truly appeciates Bp. Richard Challoner's contribution to the Douay-Rheims Bible when one struggles with the cautiously well-intended but crude and excessively pedantic literalism which was the approach of the original Douay-Rheims Bible's translation teams (one for the O.T., another for the N.T.) who together rendered the Bible from the Clementine Latin Vulgate into English for Anglophone Roman Catholics. It is Bp. Challoner's magnificently literary recasting of the Douay-Rheims Bible that has assured its ability to endure over the centuries since Challoner revised it. Certainly it is incontestable that Bp. Challoner chose to incorporate much wording which echoes that of the A.V., but not indiscriminately, and, let one emphasise, to the great improvement of the Douay-Rheims Bible's readability and literary elegance.At this point it is useful to to quote at some length the comments of one learned scholar, going by the monicker \\"AmbroseSJ\\", who very well summed up (in a Forum of the excellent WWW site, Catholic Answers) the source of the variants which occur in various editions of the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version as follows: \\"Bishop Challoner himself, produced 3 major variations of his N.T. The one of 1749, 1750, and 1752. The one in 1752 was rather a comprehensive redraft. The O.T. of 1750 always remained largely unrevised by Challoner, or later editors. The 1752 edition of the N.T. was extremely popular in the late 18th century, was often reprinted, and was used as a basis by some other \\"editors\\" that made further changes or revisions. After 1800, the 1749 edition was ascendant, and was either reprinted, or used as the basis for new editors. So that by the end of the 19th century, there is a very complex history of the Challoner Bible with its various lineages.\\"So, long live the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version of the Holy Bible in all of its glory, whatever one thinks of the relatively minor variants in which it has existed over the years! Despite what its detractors state, the Douay-Rheims-Challoner Version remains the best and most faithful, the most wholely and beautifully Catholic, of all Bibles in English. Long may the Authorised \\"King James\\" Version also endure, for its great fidelity and incomparable beauty!These comments are not meant to denigrate the scope and content of with what David Ewert in his book deals, but rather to put emphasis on what really matters most for the average English-speaking Christian, namely, about which Bible version(s) to use as authoritative for his own study and understanding of Holy Scripture."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"If you crave Arthurian stories, then you got to read this one!! It's an excellent book and fleshes out the queen's side of this old, old story. Nancy makes her characters come to life. While you know the ending, you don't want to put the book down. This is the 1st of a series and deals with Guinevere's side. The other two books (Gawain & Tristin) are also very good and each book can be read by itself"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This was a very good book, although it started out rather slow. As one reviewer stated, it had the feel of a teenage novel for girls in the first few chapters. However, as Gwen grew older, the writing matured. I also had a hard a time getting used to the first person narrative. I wonder if the story wouldn't have been a little more interesting if it had been told from several different points of view.I liked that this novel showed Gwen in a more positive light than others. The plot twists will keep you interested throughout the book.Even though Gwen was supposed to be portrayed positively in this book, there were times when I really didn't like her that much. I think she may have been the kind of woman that women love to hate. All the men around her were constantly telling her how beautiful, smart, etc... she was. Who could blame Elaine for hating her? I know the Gwen/Lancelot/Arthur love triangle is a huge part of the legend, but I had a difficult time with it. She loved both of them equally? And they knew this and accepted it? Maybe they all three needed therapy. There were times when Gwen came across as being downright selfish. She couldn't give herself totally to Lancelot, but she didn't want anyone else to have him. I suppose she expected him to pine away for her forever while she lived it up in Arthur's arms. Aisla, who was the one person who kept Gwen grounded most times, pointed this fact out to her. Last, but not least, she trembled way too much. But, I guess with her complicated love life, her husband trying to hold Britain together, and Merlin creeping around giving her dirty looks she had plenty to be nervous about.Even though I didn't think Gwen was a great or strong heroine, she was likeable at times and I felt her sorrow at the end. There were many other characters who added to the story and made it a very interesting read. If you are interested in Arthurian literature, I recommend this book. It is a lot like The Mists of Avalon, but not as gritty."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book was great in that it was different from many of the other King Arthur tales I have read. For the first time I was able to like Guenevere, because she wasn't portrayed as a helpless and religious fanatic. I loved how Gwen's and Lancelot's relationship was handled, as well as the relationship between Mordred and everyone else. Another nice thing was that the quest for the Holy Grail wasn't really a part of the story at all. This let the author focus on many of the other important and interesting aspects of the Arthur stories.I recommend this book to anyone even remotely interested. But I also HIGHLY recommend The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley. No Arthurian legends reading list is complete without that book. It is THE book to read if you're interested in anything King Arthur."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"If you are interested in books about King Arthur, read this book. This is my favorite telling so far of the Arthurian tale, and I have read quite a few. It was a page turner, which is almost essential when reading a book of this size. But don't let the length deter you, the pages just fly by and leave you wanting more when the story is over. Truly Excellent! I can't recommend it enough, and I urge anyone who enjoys reading to give a try."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I've read many books (both historical and fictional) about King Arthur and the myth that surrounds him, but this is the best fictional book I've found yet. It paints a vivid picture of Camelot, told from Guinevere's point of view. However, even though it's from her point of view, all of the male characters are distinct, believeable and real. I liked McKenzie's book much better than the Mary Stewart series. A book you will enjoy and love, even if you're not that well versed in Arthurian mythology."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"The book's greatest strength is its complex portrayal of Guinevere. The author succeeded in giving her believable strength and utilized it beautifully in the setting we know and love so well as Camelot. Arthur, a strong character himself, was not undermined and Mordred, undoubtedly a significant presence in the book, embodied the depth in which Guinevere's strength of character took. It is a fresh look at the old legend wrought with failure and betrayal.Perhaps the only weakness I could find was the *inherent* Mary Sue-ishness of the entire thing. Though it is apparent that nothing could be perfect, even in Camelot, things always work out except for the inevitably bitter end. Even the problems characters faced were handled with great grace. Make no mistake. I'm not saying this book has a bunch of Mary Sues and Gary Sues. Most of the characters are complex; imperfect, but there was still something terribly ideal about all of them in spite of it. However, I must say that I still enjoyed the book very much. In spite of the moments where everyone was just too disarmingly polite if not entirely evil, I would recommend this book for a wonderful new perception of Guinevere.Ms. McKenzie is a brilliant writer and I look forward to reading more from this series."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book was completely and utterly amazing. It is told in the eyes of Gwen, a strong and loving woman. By the end of the novel you feel as if you actually knew her and mourn her losses just as you celebrated her accomplishments. The Arthur-Gwen-Lancelot is portrayed beautifully. This book has absolutely peaked my interest in Arthurian times. I coulnd't put it down for a second."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book was by far the best book I have ever laid my hands on. I have read many science fiction and fantasy novels, and this by far out does them all! This book explains many aspects of the Arthur-tales, and it made me spend hours of my spare time reading and re-reading it. It's taken fromt he eyes of Guinevere, from the moment she was born. It shocked me how easily this book lured me into its depths! The days that I had it with me, it never left my side! It stayed on my bed stand during those few hours of sleep I could conjur up. McKenzie explains to the readers how much Guinevere really DID love Arthur, and it kept me at ease to hear that. I fell in love with all the characters in the novel, and I believed that they had come to life between the crisp pages of the book. I cried with Guinevere, laughed with her, grew angry at those who spoke ill of Arthur and had my heart captured by the High King. I fear reading it again will just remind me that I can do nothing to change their fates at the end. I'm only saddened to hear that there aren't any more books out there that are even close in quality to this one. I HIGHLY recomend this book to anyone who loves fantasy or anyone who wants something wonderful to read. NOW GO READ IT! &lt;3"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I've read MANY Arthurian tales, and was excited to find that Nancy McKenzie has taken an ancient tale and given it new life. Her rendition of Guinevere as an almost modern woman breathed new life into a character who is usually secondary to the men of this tale. I was impressed that this Guinevere possessed a quiet strength in the face of so many adversities. Written as a memoir, the book gives you a complete understanding of not only Guinevere as a person, but also of the circumstances behind the person."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This is the best book I've read about Arthurian times and my favorite book ever. It was especially interesting because you could really identify with Guinevere as a reader. I couldn't wait to read the Grail Prince (which is a must if you have read this book - it's also really good)."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book was recamended to me by a friend and fellow lover of everything medieval. The true beauty of this book lies in the fact that it takes you to another place. McKenzie mentions offhand traditions and holy days that give you clues into the culture of the times. Her portaryal of daily life for the characters is so clear, and her descriptions of detail like clothing show a lot of attention to detail, which is what I think makes a really great work of historical fiction. The chatacers are also portrayed well, so that you get the feeling that prehaps McKenzie had interviewed them about their thoughts. All of this really does make you feel like you understand the character of Guenevere so much better. I have always loved her story, and I have always loved that time-period in history, but never has it all been captured so well and at the same time."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Nancy was able to make you feel for the characters, thatsomehow you knew them and felt their pain. This was anawesome book that anyone who remotely likes the story ofArthur should read. I really did feel for the charactersand I enjoyed it to the fullest."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I confess to having had some misgivings about reading yet another version of the Arthurian legend. After reading the very wonderful Mists of Avalon years ago, I wondered why I should bother reading another woman's view of the same tale. This one answered that question, as it is an excellent retelling in its own right. Told in the first person by Guinevere herself, although the details of the plot are standard, the writing is beautiful, the episodes move quickly, the depictions of the characters are quite human and believable and, best of all, the love triangle is beautifully and compassionately depicted. There is nothing sordid or salacious in the love affair between the Queen and Lancelot, and King Arthur is clearly drawn as the lynch pin and central focus of all the action. The writing is restrained, yet lovely, and McKenzie avoids lapsing into flowery rapturous descriptions of passionate clinches and like cliches. Plus, there is enough \\"action and suspense\\" apart from the primary interaction between the main characters to keep the reader entertained. Never hysterical; always credible; very enjoyable.I am a \\"hard grader\\" but this one deserves an A - - the full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I almost stopped reading this book into the second chapter or so. The writing starts out somewhat juvenile and without much emotional depth, and I was rolling my eyes more than once for the earlier parts of the book. The child Guinevere is hated by her brother's wife because she's... blond? Guinevere's singing eases wounded soldiers and speeds their healing? Yeah, right. Along with the preoccupation with horses and too many people falling over themselves praising the heroine, Queen of Camelot at first read like an Arthurian retelling for teenaged girls.Nevertheless, I didn't want to judge a book I hadn't actually read and managed to finish it. I'm glad I did. One of the remarkable things about this book is that the writing matures visibly as its heroine does. The earliest Guinevere, the too-perfect-for-words kind of girl character I love to hate, grows into a flesh-and-blood woman who is sometimes irrational, sometimes makes mistakes, and is above all believable as a beloved companion and lady to Arthur and his knights.The ending is where Queen of Camelot truly shines. Towards the end, the writing finally finds its pace and takes on the kind of lyricism that I associate with the best of modern Arthurian literature. The central conflict and mystery of the book, of how father and son became pitted against each other, plays out as both inevitable and wholly believable tragedy through a series of mishaps, misfortunes, and human failure.The closing chapter was particularly masterful, with Guinevere coming across naturally as a nurturing and uplifting figure without the kind of heavy-handed praise that annoyed me so much at the earlier parts of the book. The emotions in the writing were heartfelt and profound. I closed the book satisfied with the reading experience mainly for the ending.Still, the greatness at the end of the book doesn't cover its flaws. There's the \\"everybody who counts loves Gwen\\" kind of myopia, where you can rank about 99% of the characters on the coolness scale by how much they love Guinevere. Just about the only exceptions I can think of are Merlin and Niniane. There doesn't seem to be much room for disliked yet respected adversaries or complexly motivated villains in Guinevere's world. I don't know if that's indicative of the author or the character, but either way it wasn't to my taste.Speaking of villains with complex motivations, the female villains were a big letdown. Some of the most interesting female figures of Arthurian literature are here no more and no less than evil witches without the least redeeming feature or the barest scrap of motivation. And, you guessed it, they really, really hate Guinevere. The reader has no clues to guess why, except maybe these women are just hateful towards the world in general or they're jealous of Gwen's perfection or something. Don't expect the kind of nuanced treatment of classic villainess along the lines ofThe Mists of AvalonorThe Idylls of the Queen. (Both highly, highly recommended.)Furthermore, the deftly skilled writing at the end of the book left me surprised that the author didn't revisit the work for major rewrites, or at least some edits. The prologue seems to be meant to follow from the ending, yet there are clear mismatches in facts and tone that left me scratching my head. It's only natural for a book to change during its writing, but it seems careless not to go back and at least edit for consistency.It's a shame, too. Had the whole book been (re)written with the kind of emotional depth and poetic, stately language near its end, Queen of Camelot would have been up there with the classics of modern Arthurian novels. As it is, I give it two stars for the beginning, three for the most part, four or even five for the ending, and three overall."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This is an absolutely amazing story of Guinevere and Arthur. I love that it is a story that centers more around her than him, but fails to leave nothing out. I have read my copy of this magnificent story so many times that I've worn it out and am having to buy a replacement copy. It is simply great!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Here is another tale of King Arthur's reign; however, this time it is centered on and told through the viewpoint of his wife Guinevere. It starts with her life from her birth when a wise woman calls her gwenhwyfar--the white shadow--who is prophesized to betray not only the king but be betrayed herself. It follows her life as an orphan under the tutelage of King Pellinore in Wales and her selection to be the second wife of King Arthur (as his first wife had died in childbirth). It then follows her years with Arthur and her struggles of not being able to give the king the child he so desperately needs and wants; her being the strength behind Arthur - she is not your typical 5th century woman who is just concerned with babies and weaving - as she helps him with the running of the Kingdom; and her love for Lancelot.McKenzie does an excellent job in creating Guinevere as the strong and loving woman behind the man, and yet makes her seem just as fallible with many weaknesses as well. It is a very convincing and realistic character. What makes this story different from the others I have read is that she encourages Arthur to take in his bastard son, Mordred, and treats him like her own child (in the other stories I've read, Mordred was raised solely by his mother for purposes in destroying Arthur). Here, Mordred becomes a very sympathetic character whom you cannot believe would betray Arthur. It was a nice touch.Overall, this was a very good book that I recommend. It is definitely more of a love story than an action novel."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I first read McKenzie's Child Queen and High Queen (combined to form this Queen of Camelot) when I was fairly young. The intrigue and beauty of her words enflamed in me a passion for Arthurian legend. This work is very different from others such as The Mists of Avalon, and portrays Guenevere quite differently -- it is of my opinion that if one wishes to be able to a voice of knowledge concerning Arthurian legend that one must read this book!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"&quot;Queen of Camelot&quot; was an absolutely amazing book! I had thought no tale of Arthurian Legend could surpass &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, but Nancy McKenzie accomplished it! The book is written with such explicite detail, you feel as though you're a part of Camelot yourself. The ending is bittersweet, I closed the book with tear tracks along my cheeks. Truly a work of art, congratulations, Ms. McKenzie, on writing such an awesome novel!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book is an absolute page turner. The hazardous and tragic love triangle between Arthur, Lancelot and Guinevere is finally plausably explained. If you enjoyed Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy, then The Queen of Camelot is an absolute must-read!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Stunning. I didn't expect to be so enthralled and captivated... I've read my share of Arthurian legend, and love the genre and age and characters... but I thought I'd already read the good ones... far better than even The Mists of Avalon, for this delves into the heart of the character where Marion Z Bradley delved into the magic (which was pretty awesome too, just saying!). Made me see Gwen in a whole new light... made me pity Lancelot... and made me adore Arthur, despite his faults, his shortcomings... We also get to meet more knights of the round tables as PEOPLE... Here is truly a world completely and lovingly crafted, with a people whom you won't soon forget. I promise you that. A long delicious read, which I wished would never end! Enjoy the read!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I have read many stories based on Arthurian legend, and I can say with certainty that this one was outstanding in bringing the characters to life. I think it was the first time I really understood who all of the characters were and how they are related to one another. For example, everyone has heard of Sir Galahad...but I never realized that he was Lancelot's son! And, really, who has ever really been able to distinguish between Morgan, Morgaine, and Morgause? In this book, though, McKenzie really brings all of these characters to life. She paints Guenevere as a strong, dedicated, honest woman who is dedicated to her husband and to her role as Queen. And she manages to make this all believable without really &quot;meddling&quot; with the traditional Arthurian legend (you know, the whole Lancelot deal). For those who love reading this genre, you will especially appreciate the way McKenzie builds into the story the &quot;factoids&quot; of day-to-day life, creating a three dimensional sense of the setting, the customs, the dress, the social mores and standards, etc., etc.This is a very long and detailed book, and will take some time to read, so be prepared. Personally, when it started feeling tedious (which it did, a couple of times) I set it aside for a few days and read something else. Because of the vivid depictions of the characters, I found that I could easily pick it up and dive right back in as if I'd just left it.Overall, a great job. I recommend it for anyone who has a passion for Arthurian legend."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Being an avid reader of arthurian books, I read this book with great pleasure. I liked Guinevere a lot, laughed and cried with her, I enjoyed her being a strong personality and what I liked the most was that King Arthur was described so impressive, often - though the whole story is in great parts his story, he is described as weak king or as almost holy person so far remote from everybody else that you don't feel him. But in this book apart from creating a real queen, how one would imagine Guinevere in life with all ups and downs, Mckenzie also created in Arthur a king you feel on every page of the book, calm and strong, passionate and very lovable, ecactly how I always imagined Arthur might have been. And the end of the book is fantastic, how she solved the problem of making a nice Modred kill Arthur all the same, I wondered the whole time while reading, how exactly this might happen and her writing is as if you would really read something long foretold, something nobody could prevent, though the different charakters tried, she tells it all so fascinating, the different incidents that happened and nobody knew etc. A great read!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I read at least 1 book a week and have done so for a long time..I LOVED this book. It's a must read..buy it and keep it, you will want to share it with your children someday.."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This is one of the greatest books that I have ever read! I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read! This is an awsome book it as one of the greatest books of all time! Along with the Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling, The China Garden by Liz Berry, Peter Pan by J.M. Barrie, Cheaper by the Dozen by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carry, and Old Magic by Marianne Curley!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I'm not a person who usually reads fantasy, and I picked up this book on a whim. And I couldn't put it down again. It's one of the best romance/historical fiction/fantasy books i've ever read--deep in scope and lifelike and real. It provides a differnt viewpoint on the lancelot-guinevere-arthur love triangle, and makes your heart pity all three. Yet in the end, you are happy for them, too. It's hard to express the emotions I felt when I read this book. But it made me wish that our society today was like those of Arthur's--where loyalty, trust, goodness, and true love could be found. And unlike many women of romance novels, Guinevere is strong and spirited--she can hold her own in any situation. This book successfully portrays the true essence of Guinevere, and shows clearly why she was worthy to be the wife of the High King. Once you read it, you want to do and act like her, to be good, kind, loving, and strong. It brings out the good qualities in a person, and is truly a wonderful piece of literature."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Good story. This is the first time I have ever read such a detailed version of the Arthur and Camelot legend. He and his knights and Gwen seem as tho they really existed in the telling of this tale... BUT the speech is nauseating. If I have to read the words \\"honor...love..my lord\\" one more time, I may have to throw it aside. Something else I am beyond tired of, seems that Gwen has ADD or something.. Always has the tremors. On every page, she is trembling with joy, lust, passion, fear.. awful lot of trembling going on. Getting old. I would also like to add, she is a very weak female in this telling. She is apparently an angel as she is queen of not only Camelot, but also of turning the other cheek. She excells at letting others walk all over almost as much as she does at trembling."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I was very very happy with this tale of Queen Guinevere! I couldn't put the book down! I was so so engaged in reading it.. It was so real. The image of Guinevere was clearly set, and wonderful. I was very excited to hear she has another book in the Arthurian legend, Grail Prince, which I recommend reading.This book is WONDERFUL! I loved it! I HIGHLY recommend anyone to read it!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book is well worth the read. I've been a lifelong fan of Arthur and Camelot, and I've always wanted a more inciteful look into the character of Guinevere (who's often portrayed as something of a bimbo). That's not the case here. The character is well-developed and admirable. Also beautifully portrayed is the passsionate and compassionate relationship between Arthur and his queen. That being said, the language of this book will make you cringe. McKenzie's denizens of Camelot too occasionally spout modern slang. (Examples: &quot;I could square things with Gawaine...&quot;, &quot;his chieftains must be hollering for more land...&quot;, and my personal favorite, &quot;What's up, Kay?&quot;) Then the author drops in a &quot;shall&quot; here and there in an attempt to make the language sound quaint. But once you get past this flaw, it's a nicely constructed novel and will make a nice addition to your Arthurian collection. I'll probably read it again."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book was so boring that I could barely get past the first 20 pages. DO NOT READ IT! If you want to read a good book on Camelot, anything else will be better!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Combines the two brilliant works by Nancy McKenzie about Arhur's Queen Guinevere and one of the best reteallings of the Arthurian legend.An extremely engaging book, full of adventure, passion, intrigue and emotion.Engages the reader evey step of the way.It traces the early life of Gunievere , who would be Arthur's bride, from her birth to the king and young queen of the Kingdom of Northgallis, where a witch predicts the night of her birth that she would live to be the greatest lady in Britain, but also that she would betray her king and herself be betrayed.What is unique about this retelling of the Arthurian legend is the deep emotional and pyschological depth of her subjects.It is the best Arthurian retelling I have read.Growing up in north Wales, to be a great and engaging beauty , together with her cousin Elaine, her life is turned upside down when she is chosen as the bride of the High King of Britain, Arthur.Guinevere's love for the King's most trusted knight, Lancelot causes her great pain. Her cousin and childhood friend Elaine, turns into a deadly rival, who out of jealousy because it was Guinevere who became Arthur's bride, will do anything to hurt Guinevere.Included in this saga are others in Arthurian legend such as the King's adopted brother Kay, Arthur's half-sisters Morgause and Morgan , the battles with the invading Saxons , and the various kingdoms in Britain in the time.We read of Guinevere's abduction by the thuggish minor king Mwelas and her rescue by Lancelot. McKenzie did her research well, while introducing an exciting take on the world of Arthur and Camelot.Nancy McKenzie makes for relaxed reading while bringing alive the true magic, colour and drama of Arthurian legend, and exploring the hearts and passions of Arthur's beautiful and captivating Queen Guinevere who captures the hearts of so many men at Camelot.In the second of two magnificent novels, Guinvere, unable to conceive agrees to raise Arthur's son Mordred born from a cursed encounter with Arthur's sister the evil sorceress Morgause.As she raises Mordred to love him like son, he will eventually be the seed of her destruction. Meanwhile she struggles with her agonizing love for Lancelot as McKenzie creates high drama and narrative from this ill fated love.And of course the shadow of the great and terrifying Merlin always hovers over all.The total effect creates a compelling and spellbinding epic which serves as an imposing example of the author's enthusiasm for her subject"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I have essentially already reviewed this book in my reviews forThe Child Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King ArthurandHigh Queen, giving them both five stars. They are two of my favorite books from childhood.However, I felt compelled to come here after reading this compilation to note that they left the epilogue that appears in the original printed version ofHigh Queenout of this compilation.As I finished the Kindle version ofQueen of Camelotlast night, something nagged at me. I could have sworn I remembered more to the story. Indeed, I checked my beloved printed copy ofHigh Queen, and there was a dozen-page epilogue that they left out. I have no idea why they would do this, because it rounds out the story and closes several loops. I bought the printed version of this compilation and it arrived today and the epilogue is also missing from the printed version.Thus, I had to give this version of the book only four stars because, I'm sorry, the ending is nothing without the epilogue, which they thoughtlessly left out. If you can, find a copy of the original version ofHigh Queenin order to read the epilogue."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"\\"Queen of Camelot\\" by Nancy McKenzie, is an absolutely fabulous retelling of the classic Arthurian legend (and in my opinion history, not legend), told through the eyes of Arthur's beautiful, Queen Guenivere. The story is a summary of Guenivere's life, beginning at her birth, and continuing until she matures into a beautiful woman who has been faced with many challenges including death and heartache.I rate my books on a scale from 1-5. Old favorites like \\"Little Women\\" and \\"War and Peace\\" fall into the 4 category. Those very special, once-in-a-lifetime books are reserved for the 5 category. \\"Queen of Camelot\\" is one of those books. Humorous yet touching, it has all the aspects that a good novel should own. It is also one of the strongest books that I have ever read. At one point I even threw my Kindle down because I was so angry at one of the characters. Upon completing the book, I burst into tears. The ending is extremely depressing, but the journey through Guenivere's life story is what makes it all worth it in the end. \\"Queen of Camelot\\" is an amazing and compelling story that can be enjoyed by anyone, and I would recommend to all, from those interested in King Arthur's story to those who are just looking for a good book.WARNING: \\"Queen of Camelot\\" is a very graphic novel and deals with many \\"adult\\" subjects such as incest. I was eleven when I read \\"Queen of Camelot\\" for the first time last year, and I learned lots of new \\"stuff\\". DO NOT NOT READ THE BOOK BECAUSE OF THIS! If you are a young adult like me, then I would recommend having your parents edit the book before you read it. I doubt many teenagers will take this advice, but it's much better to shield yourself from the trash and ask your parents about it, than learn about it from a book (even a good book).And for all the Arthur geeks out there like me, another great novel to explore is \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" by Sir Thomas Mallory. Or you might consider \\"The Arthur Trilogy\\" by Kevin Crossley-Holland. They are both great reads.Enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"My best friend practically bribed me to read this book when we were college freshmen in 2003. I kept putting her off, but by March of that year, I just gave in. I have no idea why I resisted in the first place. I am a very slow reader, but I finished this book very quickly, and it has become my favorite book of all time. The Grail Prince, the sequel, is my second favorite book. I highly recommend both. I have read Queen of Camelot every March since that first time--now 6 times--and enjoy it more and more. I will continue to read this book for years to come. It's different and the characters come alive for the reader. I really can't say enough about it. Go read it!!!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I had misgivings about this book, but overall, by the end I really really enjoyed it. At times I skipped whole chapters and didn't miss much, but the parts I read in depth were well told for the most. As has been said, the dialogue is...scary at times and the beginning drags but I liked it.The book has a striking resemblance to \\"The Wicked Day\\" by Mart Stewart, which is one of my favorite arthurian retellings. From the whole Morgause murder to Arthur choosing a new puppy and naming it Cabal after his old dog, this book is basically a rewrite of Stewart's, which in turn took a lot of pointers from \\"Once and Future King\\". But, some new things are added, which keep it new, but I was disappointed in Mekenzie's lack of imagination especially on those point, even though she does say int he introduction that she was influenced by Stewart (to say the least).My chief complaint is that Guinevere's actions do not match the other characters' supposed admiration of her. She's praised for being strong and beautiful, but every other page she's crying for some ridiculous reason and Arthur is telling her \\"you're so great, everyone loves you,\\" or \\"I could never live without you, you make me a better man..\\" and of course, it always ends with him getting laid. Pretty predictable after a few chapters of the same crap.BUT that aside, Mordred is pretty well played out, the intrigues with Morgause and Morgan are very interesting, and the Elaine subplot is well tied in. It's a nice read if you like Arthuriana, but if you're just looking for a well-rounded, nicely-developed book, then this probably isn't it."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Nancy McKenzie has created a masterpiece. Her lengthy research into a romantic historic era has definitely paid off.So why only 3 stars? Partly because there isn't a \\"half\\" star available or it would have been 3 1/2.Mainly I was annoyed by the many, many, many references to our heroine's compulsive trembling and tears. What is she? A valiant girl grown to womanhood or a chihuahua? This book could easily have been 50 pages shorted without all the retelling of Gwen's weaknesses and childlike attributes.All that said, this is a masterful read. I LOVE the author's interpretation of the characters and their relationships! She showed even Arthur as a wonderful human being, demi-god, proud leader, and tender father. He has warts, but the legend shines through.It is also nice to see Guinevere as someone other than a slutty wench. Compassionate, passionate, tender, intelligent, naive and occasionally care-free.(though that last one tends to land her in terrible straits...)Great cast of characters, particularly the Orkney boys. I can easily visualize the rowdy, dirty, rough bunch of scamps....and then there is Mordred...Some folks here say they will definitely read the Grail Prince, the continuation of Galahad's story. But the author protrayed Lancelot's son as such a single-minded freaked-out JERK that I cannot get excited enough to buy the book.All in all, a good read. Too long for its overall content, but well done!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"ok this is my mom's amazon account but watever i had to get this book for summer reading and my friend who doesnt read like at all absolutely loved it so i knew i had to read it being a great lover of books! this book is the most amazing book ever! the characters are portayed sooooo well and it really feels like you're in those times and places!!!! i really couldnt put it down even once and i dont have any complaints about it and i've also read the grail prince which is the sequel to this book and if u liked this book and want to know what happens after it and even though it's mostly about galahad it's an AWESOME book too and you do find out what happens after the queen of camelot and SO much more"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I absolutely adore this book. As others have mentioned, Guenevere is written as a fully-imagined person, with complex emotions and motivations, from her childhood through the twilight years of Camelot. Unlike in some versions, I found the love triangle between Arthur, her, and Lancelot completely believable, and my heart broke for each of them in turn. Mckenzie also manages to flesh out a multitude of compelling supporting characters, making the reader just as apprehensive as Guenevere is when the soldiers ride off to battle, wondering who will return. If you have any interest in Arthurian myths, and enjoy excellently written characters with both flaws and virtues, don't miss this book!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I bought this book, desperate for just anything to read off the paperback table in my local bookstore, but what I found was so much more than that.While you can hardly tell an Arthurian legend without an element of the mystical, this book relies primarily on the complexities of each character to carry the plot. Arthur constantly struggles to keep his kingdom (and household) from imploding. Gwen and Lancelot share a burning passion for eachother that they barely manage to quell for the sake of their even more powerful love for and loyalty to Arthur. Mordred tries to defeat his destiny, but so much and so many (including his own demons) stand in his path. And the jealousy of the queen's cousin, Elaine, will always get in the way.Mckenzie has written a wonderful tale that while covering an already well-worn lore, somehow manages to engross the reader with her own spin on things. She has managed to make not only Guineviere a fully three-dimentional character, but even some of the more obscure members of the round table and royal court come alive to the reader."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Queen of Camelot is an Arthurian tale written from a unique perspective. I origianlly purchased this book for a report in my college mythology class. I was terrified that it was going to be one of those \\"trudge through it and *make* myself read it\\" types. But I was gratefully mistaken. I loved this book. From beginning to end I had a new-found respect for a character that I had always underestimated. Not only that, the intricate relationships that are woven throughout the book are astounding. For anyone who loves the tales of Camelot, the mysteries of Arthur, and the nuance of Lancelot: this is the book for you. The author creates endearing characters, realistic perspectives, and an enchanting tale!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"The narrative was well told, and the author gave you a sense of what life might have been as the Queen to Arthur, and to live in the time of British knights. Again, great retelling, maybe not a story that will rivet every male reader, but will likely enchant most women."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I love this book because of it's language and of course many other things! I feel so connected to this novel, and when ever I read it, I can picture it in my head and basically see a movie of it while I'm reading. Not many books can do that! It is simply an amazing book!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I have read many different retellings of the King Arthur story and very few of them have left me with a postive view of Guinevere. This one was a great one for that. The author has taken the elements of many differnt tales and combined them into one. It was long but worth reading. Often I got lost in the story and could not tell how long I had been reading. When I had to stop I could hardly wait to pick it back up agian."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Wonderful book, well written, exciting and easy to read. I had to buy all in the series. Lots of romance and action. The best King Arthur series yet!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"this book is so awesome it catchs what happen to gwen in such a perfect way i loved it so much"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. It's a really good book to read if you to step into the story of Queen Guinevere's life and how she lived it with King Arthur and King Lancelot. Though some parts did make me angry but that's how book are. They make you laugh, cry, and sometimes angry only because of the person in the book does something foolish."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Beautiful beautiful telling of the story of Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot. I loved Mists of Avalon and The Crystal Cave and the rest of Mary Stewart's series, but this is my favorite of all. The love these three had for each other is so tenderly but powerfully told by Guinevere herself and for the first time I felt I came to know her. This time it was not as a sad victim, an unfaithful wife, or a woman destroyed by her circumstances. This time she was brave against extreme adversity, loyal to Arthur in spite of her love for his favorite knight, Lancelot, who he loves like a brother. Her love for Arthur is told in such a way that I will never feel the same about this wonderful legend again. The ties between these three are so strong and so easily understood in this book. The different times that Arthur handles one situation or another is the way that the author makes the reader understand what an incredibly intelligent leader he was beyond his being a great warrior. He comes across as the King of all kings. Mordred is handled in an entirely different way in this book, but then he seems to be written differently in all writings. In this book he is a sympathetic and tragic character, carried along by prophecy and circumstance to an end we all know. As the story went on, I of course, knew what would happen and know of Merlin's prophecy, but I kept thinking \\"in this book it just won't happen\\". I so did not want it to end the way of course it had to.All of the knights came alive, some in different ways than I have seen them before. After all, this is a legend, and each author can interpret the personality and agenda of everyone in the story as they see fit.I love the way this author began this story in the prologue. She starts at the end with Lancelot coming to meet with Guinevere for the last time and to tell her the details of Arthur's death and burial although she already knows he is gone. He tells her of a vision from Merlin after Arthur's burial where Merlin requests that she write her story so that Arthur and what has happened will not die but will live on forever. Thus with that farewell in mind, Guinevere begins the story in her words. I am sure this would be an amazing read for someone who does not know the Arthurian legend (does anyone not know?) or someone who has read and watched in movies the many versions. I have to say it is my favorite yet, and the author did just a wonderful wonderful job of writing this story. I cried in the prologue and I definitely cried at the end."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"The life of Guinevere before and during her marriage to King Arthur.I wish there was less of a focus on the relationship between Guinevere and Lancelot. I felt like every other issue in the kingdom centered on the two of them and the potential for \\"dishonor.\\" The reoccurring pattern of Guinevere and Lancelot acting on their attraction, then admitting the fact, then Arthur forgiving both of them got tiring after a while. I didn't find either Guinevere or Lancelot to be likable characters. The author also includes a lot of catty behavior between women. I realize that this book was written from Guinevere's point of view, but I would have like to read more about Arthur's accomplishments and acts as king."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I was highly impressed with \\"Queen of Camelot\\" having always been disappointed with other authors' portrays of Guenevere and especially of Arthur's son Mordred. Here Gwen is an intelligent woman, who is an equal to Arthur in statesmanship and in love. Mordred, my favorite character in the Arthurian legend, is treated with dignity and respect and is truly Arthur's beloved son and rightful heir. McKenzie weaves a beautiful retelling, with new insight, and added interpretations that will please you. The ending especially will surprise and move you as to how and why Mordred and Arthur finally meet in battle.If you are looking for a good and in depth novel of the Arthurian tale through a woman's perspective, look no further! \\"Queen of Camelot\\" will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This novel swept me away into Arthurian legend. The month previous to reading this, I read The Mists of Avalon and did not like it at all!!! But I was still intrigued by the story, so I starting reading this book! This is soo much better than M of A!! I cried in the end! Gwen is a queen you grow to respect and I just LOVE King Arthur in the book. He is amazing! So much better than Lancelot! I also really enjoyed getting to know Mordred a lot better. This book is truly thrilling and keeps the pages turning even though I basically knew the outline of the story! I will forever recommend this book to friends and I am looking forward to the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I have searched and searched for a great Arthurian retelling and have been disappointed with the ones I have ventured into reading. I was somewhat skeptical when I picked up Nancy McKenzie's Queen of Camelot. This two-novels-in-one compilation is based on Guenevere, from her point of view, in first person narrative, and is 623 pages long in very small print. I didn't want to waste my time reading something this big only to be disappointed at the end. I nevertheless gave the book a whirl. Glad I did! This is one of the most compelling and beautifully told retells I have ever read! McKenzie gives us a detailed story about Guenevere from her point of view. She tells us about the prophecy on the day she was born, how she spends her childhood as an adventurous tomboy, how people fear her and treat her differently as she grows up, how the knights around her battle with the Saxons, and how all of the prophecies come true. She meets Arthur, marries him and later has a love affair with Lancelot, something based on the original tale. But the novel has so much more than that. You will see how this story of magic, prophecies, love and betrayal transpires in an altered, detailed and beautiful light. There are many twists throughout the novel.Guenevere is developed in such an abundant, three-dimensional way in this novel. She is no longer just the pagan beauty who marries a Christian, betrays him and destroys all of Camelot as a result. She is a complex character with flaws as well as virtues in this offering. Arthur is also written in a more interesting, compelling way here, but it is Lancelot that once again blows me away. I have always romanticized Sir Lancelot and McKenzie does not disappoint me in her version of the loyal, chivalrous knight. Merlin and Morgan Le Fay are written with much complexity and nuance as well. This novel, however, does not focus so much on the love triangle between Guenevere, Arthur and Lancelot as much as her inability to supply an heir for Arthur and her affection for Arthur's bastard son, the traitorous Mordred. The overall story is magnificent. Once again, I say that McKenzie did a wonderful job bringing Guenevere to life. She turns this character into a strong, intelligent, complex, three-dimensional, flesh and blood woman, someone you will feel a great deal of affinity with. She is not portrayed as a simple-minded, traitorous hussy in this one! I loved the fanciful storytelling style that made me turn the pages until the wee hours of the night. Some of my friends who read the book along with me complained about it being too long-winded. I didn't think it was long-winded at all. In fact, I wish it had been longer. I loved this book and I look forward to giving Grail Prince a whirl."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Although it does not correctly correspond to the true tale of King Arthur (so says my boyfriend according to the book &quot;The Once and Future King&quot;), I, too, greatly enjoyed this bittersweet book depicting the great legend of Camelot, King Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and others. I loved the attention Ms. McKenzie put to the details of everything she wrote about. There were times that I wished the book would go faster but it kept my interest enough to be finished within three days. At the end, I mourned at the characters' fate and I wished that somehow they were real and I could change the way things ended. Nonetheless, it is a truly memorable book, though I don't think I can read the book again because it is too painful to fall in love with the characters and then bear their fate again.."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I didnt know what to expect when getting this book but Nancy Mckenzie has written it so smoothly that anyone can read it and understand it. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.... what else can I say. Best book I have read in years!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Queen of Camelot by Nancy McKenzie was a really good book, and, I know, practically everyone says that, but it is. I had to read it for school purposes. I'm glad they assigned it, actually, and now I find that Arthurian stuff fascinating. lol. I never knew much about King Arthur until I read this, and now I get it. When you finish the book, it leaves you with a sad, yet hopeful feeling. Oh, it makes me wish that Guinevere, Merlin, and all the characters were true. So, overall, I suggest you read this book, because it's so entertaining."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This book is a great retelling of the classic Arthurian legend, and it kept me turning the pages. I especially liked that almost every character that I have ever encountered from reading other tales of King Arthur made some kind of appearance in this book. McKenzie is a great author and I intend to read \\"Grail Prince\\" as soon as I can get my hands on it.My only problem with this book is the rather annoying \\"awe factor\\" that sometimes plagues the protagonists of novels such as these. I hear a lot of people saying Guinevere is a \\"three-dimensional\\" and \\"relatable\\" woman, but to be honest, I got to the point where I could relate better to Elaine... and that's not good! It seemed the only people who were not absolutely crazy about Gwen were the bad guys, and too many men were in love with her. In this book, she has brains, beauty, wisdom, wit, courage, kindness... this list goes on. It was almost painful for me to read the parts where she is alone with Arthur. It seemed half their conversations consisted of \\"Gwen, what would I do without you?\\" or \\"Gwen, I am the luckiest man alive to have found such a woman,\\" etc. etc. Her love affair with Lancelot was handled delicately, but I didn't think it was believable. Arthur was just too understanding, and Lancelot and Guinevere were too noble.In all, the pace of this story was very good and the storytelling aspect was excellent. I can tell McKenzie put a lot into her characterizations, but to me, these people were too good to be true. From what I have read, however, Galahad has a lot of potential as a more compelling hero.Still, I would reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I'm only half-way through this book and I felt I needed to say that this is one of the best Arthurian &quot;woman-based&quot; novels that I have ever read. In fact, I read Ms. McKenzie's newer novel about Galahad first, and then went back to Queen of Camelot. These are books that are meant to be savored from word to word. I have been a Marion Zimmer Bradley fan from the first time I picked up the Mists of Avalon and this is the first time I've felt that a book is even close to its equal in its understanding of the women of the Arthurian legend and their side of the conflict. Guenivere is portrayed here as a woman of the time with genuine frailties that she overcomes with courage and strength. She is as realistic to me as Morgaine was in the Mists of Avalon and yet this is an entirely different method of story-telling (and more historically accurate).I strongly recommend that anyone who has read the Mists of Avalon read this book as well. As I have said, it is written from a different perspective, but it is no less compelling in its own way."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Numerous retellings of the Arthurian legend had been published - with the exception of the Mists of Avalon, none of them can sustain a reader's attention while being faithful to the original legend. Truth be told, it must be extremely difficult to pull off a novel when its readers already know the plot back to front, and that is one area where Queen of Camelot spetacularly exceeds. Though having read many versions of the story already, Queen of Camelot is one novel I could not put down: this book shed light on Arthur's queen, who was portrayed as a weak and moral-less woman who brought about the downfall of Camelot, sculpting her into a strong and just queen. This novel also loks favorably at the character of Arthur - who was pretty much ignored in the other books. Together, the pair worked Camelot into the height of its glory, and its fall was due to a cruel twist of fate, in which Guinevere, Arthur, and Lancelot were victims of.This is the must-read retelling of the story. I suggest reading the Mists of Avalon in addition to this. I have also read Rosalind Miles' Guenever series but personally I didn't think much of it. Alice Borchardt's version, fascinating by itself, was unfaithful to the original story."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I read this book every single summer (sometimes twice in a row)! It is easy to read but a beautiful and wonderful story. Nancy McKenzie is an amazing writer. The characters are so developed and the story so complicated and wonderful.READ IT!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"There is not much I can say to convince anyone of reading this book, that the other reviewers have not already said. The story of Guinevere and Arthur with all that is Camelot is presented in this novel, but the whole story is new and not just a retell. You actually get to know the characters and love them. It is not simply about Guinevere, it is about those that she loved so dearly and those that loved her, explaining why their love as family, friends and simply human beings united them in the struggle for a peaceful and truly happy life. Of course we do not always count for the misrepresented realities of others and their hatred, which is what ruined the lives of Arthur, Guinevere, and the wonderful land that was Camelot. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will hurt with Gwen. You will understand why so many poets and storytellers including the men of her story loved her, and you will love her too, and sometimes hate her just a little bit for being so damn perfect or too childish, but she is a strong woman telling the story of all those men who have ignited the imaginations of many writers. You will love this book, the only thing that I hated was that it ended. Praise for McKenzie, and Thank you. This is one of the best Arthurian novels ever!"},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"Good Arthurian fiction seems to be a rare find these days. So much of it is inane, cringe-worthy fantasy where it seems the author doesn't know the first thing about history or the story of King Arthur itself. Historical inaccuracy, stereotypical neo-pagan and Wiccan themes, love scenes that are cheesy and reminiscent of bad romance novels, and a continuous undercurrent of despair and sorrow are at the heart of these books, all of which make reading them nearly unbearable. The authors often forget that, despite its tragic downfall, Camelot was a place of joy, justice, and peace, which is why it is still famous today.I digress. Nancy Mckenzie has presented a version of Arthur's tale that is rich with new themes while still staying true to the legend, characters that are endearing, and first-rate storytelling that is well-received. It is told from Guinevere's perspective and she is the first Guinevere I have ever cared about. She is smart, strong, kind, and beautiful, while still having flaws to make her human. The character of Arthur as he is portrayed in this novel is also one of the best I've seen him. He is the man every woman wants. Mckenzie shows him as a strong, powerful ruler that has a quiet strength and kindness which makes him so revered. Lancelot is more likeable than usual as well, his passion for Guinevere more subdued than normal, but still very alive...their love tempered only by their greater love for Arthur.The drama and action of the novel are enticing and thrilling to read without being dragged out too much. The novel is definitely more fantasy than history, although Mckenzie does present historical fact in a subtle manner.I didn't want this book to end. It is definitely one of the best books I've ever read, and certainly among the best of Arthurian fiction. I'm very excited to read Mckenzie's other works and I highly recommend 'Queen of Camelot' if you're trying to escape the repetition and corniness of bad historical ficiton."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"This entire series of books by Nancy McKenzie was spectacular. This is the first tale of Arthur that I read and I have never loved another Arthur book the way I loved this one. It was true to the original stroy while also addding its own quirks and twists. Guenivere is a woman who can turn any head with both her strength and her beauty, but doesn't let it affect her kind nature. She can ride a horse better then most men and goes hawking for fun. Gwen proves that a woman can be beautiful and still have strength. She seems so real in this book, and I cried when I read about her death in \\"Grail Prince\\" (also by Nancy McKenzie). The Arthur-Gwen-Lancelot love triangle is facinating to read about, and even though you want Gwen and Lancelot to be together so desperately by the end, they hold true to the values they've cherished throughout the book and stay true to Arthur. Arthur himself plays a very important role in this book, and is prtrayed as just and awe-inspiring. I respected him in this book, and learned to love him, just as Gwen did.This is by far the best legend-of-Arthur story I have read and will probably ever read. I loved it from the first page to the last, and I will read it over and over until my copy falls apart. I have fallen in love with the characters and the land of Camelot, and I know that if you read this book, you will too."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I was absolutely entranced by this book.

A truely delightful story with rich words, I would highly recomend it for everyone."},{"Title":"Queen of Camelot","review":"I could not put this book down. It's about time someone represented Guinivere as a thoughtful, diplomatic woman with a mind of her own. Her character's strength and love for both Arthur and Lancelot was aptly demonstrated.

The Arthur legends as told from the viewpoint of Guinevere, a beautiful, strong, courageous woman and her heartbreaking love of two men - Lancelot and Arthur. We see Guinevere grow from a young girl to the most beautiful woman in England.An exciting tale and the love she bears for both Lancelot and Arthur - and the love they both return to her made for an engrossing book.Don't pick this one up in the middle of the night thinking you'll read a couple of chapters and be able to go back to sleep.

I read the first and last few pages of each and lucky for me, very few of them are worth buying. Instead, I skim those books for their one-dimensional, five-page-worthy \\"A-HA!\\" (which is easy to do because they all follow the same formula) and then I walk out of the book store with same amount of money in my pocket as when I walked in.This book is different for five reasons...1. It has depth: unlike most business books, this one doens't struggle to stretch a point-of-view that's worth ten pages into 200.2. It's actionable: Not only does it offer a variety of insights into how to generate great ideas, it offers up actionable and realistic ways to apply this thinking within your organization.3. It's credible: It's coming out of the world's foremost thought leader on innovation: ?What if! is one of most established and inspiring innovation shops in the world.4. It's dynamic: The book feels alive. Bavez-Brown brings his content to life through quotes from visionaries, inspiring case studies, illustrations... Because this book expresses itself in so many ways, I can't imagine someone not being able to get the content.5. It's human: Too many business books sound like business books. This book not only presents more applicable insight into innovation than any of the books I've skimmed in the business aisle, it's also does so in a way that makes you want to take it home and read it.In summary: Well worth the money and the time away from your personal reading list."},{"Title":"How To Have Kick-Ass Ideas","review":"An energetic romp that leaps off the page - grabs your creativity and gives it a glorious shake.

And to Proust, the internal world was more intensely real and important than the external world. You might say that he thought the internal world was the only one that mattered. But this book is not for the type of person who likes an exciting plot, who wants to find out &quot;what happens next&quot; or witness thrilling plot twists, unsolved murders, missing treasure, or be told that the good guys win and the wicked are punished. This is about the nature of human consciousness, and about our capacity (if any) to really connect with other human beings.If you've ever been described as &quot;overly&quot; introspective or melancholy, if you've felt that you have trouble connecting with other people, and you like to read, this book may become an important part of your life. Proust has changed (or perhaps fleshed out) the way I think about love, relationships, perception, human nature, the life of reflection, and most other things that really matter. I haven't finished the work yet, because I keep starting over. While there are supposedly 7 volumes (or 6, depending on the translation and edition) in reality it is just one work, over 3000 pages long. It does seem to drag at times, so I'll find myself skimming, only to realize a hundred pages later that I missed some incredible insight he had been developing the whole time. After I do this a few times, I think &quot;what the heck, I'll just start this volume again, to see what I missed&quot; and it's WORTH IT. I see more every time, and what I see is worth the effort several times over. So when I do finish (eventually) I'll just start over again with Swann's Way.Proust's work, along with that of Dostoevsky, has assumed a significance in my life similar to the importance the Bible has for devout Christians. I'm not referring to the quoting of chapter and verse, but to the depth of understanding (and perhaps even a type of revalation) that is developed with successive, careful readings. This book is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"They say that DJ Enright's retouching of Kilmartin's translation is the superior volume, but it hadn't come out when I read the book. However, I'm grateful for the older, gray 3-volume set. Had I bought only the first volume, I very well may have stopped after \\"Swann's Way\\". With the older set, it was just a matter of turning the page and starting \\"Within a Budding Grove.\\" It grabbed me immediately, and less than halfway through it, I was already intent on finishing the whole damn thing. As for the world laid out within the pages, it gave me, if nothing else, the most complete reading experience I can imagine. If there are boring passages in Proust (and there are), it is precisely because there are boring passages in life. Its length is great, but it is in direct proportion to its ambition. It may have been even greater had Proust not died before it was completed. Its notorious difficulties are textual. Some sentences are extremely long, with many clauses and digressions, and this makes re-reading passages a necessity for most. But it can also be a great pleasure. The depth of observation is superhuman, and the characterizations are equally astonishing. After reading the novel I finally understood what Emerson means when he writes that \\"in every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts--they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\\" The quote seemed pompous at first, but I find it humbling now. Proust is so detailed about psychological processes that, reading him, you re-evaluate your thinking. It's that depth of detail that gives you deja vu, as though you're remembering the act of ignoring certain thoughts.But this is getting vague...Every reader, as with any book, is touched in a different way. Each brings him or herself to the text, and so there are a million texts for a million readers. Suffice it to say that \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" was the first book I read that actually ended up reading me."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I started reading In Search of Lost Time 2 years ago. I can't say it was always smooth sailing, but I got through the first 4 volumes (i.e., finished Sodom and Gomorrah) pretty happily, working with the Moncrieff/Kilmartin/Enright translation (not to mention taking a Proust class at night at Rice Univ. here in Houston). If you're reading this review, you probably already know that the 3 books after that (usually published in 2 volumes) were incomplete, in manuscript, at the time of Proust's death. How they were put into publishable condition is another story. But the end result, for this reader at least, was tough going. I tried both of the Moncrieff-based translations, and--true confession--found multiple phrases and sentences (and sometimes more) that I just didn't follow.I found the Penguin translations (by multiple translators with a common editor) while I was living overseas recently. I should state up-front that I am no French scholar...I'm just speaking as a reader. I'd say that the Penguin version of these two books (The Prisoner and The Fugitive) seems not quite as smooth, sometimes, as the Moncrieff-based translations. But I feel like I follow more of what Proust is trying to say. The sentences being less mellifluous suggests to me the possibility, at least, that the Penguin translators concentrated more on content than on rendering Proust's poetic (and somewhat hyperventilated) style, which is more to the good, for me at least--though I'd love to know what a Proust, and French, scholar thought of the comparison. The introductions and editorial comments are very good, as well. So, if you're at this point in the Proust-reading process, and particularly if you're finding it hard going, I'd give serious thought to giving the Penguin translations a try."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I tend on the whole to be quite skeptical of the notion that one may with confidence posit any single creative work as the &quot;greatest&quot; of its genre, but with Proust's novel I am forced to make an exception; &quot;Remembrance&quot; is not simply the greatest achievement of 20th century French literature, but is, in my opinion, THE greatest literary work of all time, period.Yes, Mann is a master of irony, and yes, I grant that Musil's &quot;Man Without Qualities&quot; is a work of genius, but no work that I am aware of - not The Magic Mountain, not Doctor Faustus, not Moby Dick, not The Brothers Karamazov - can match Proust's novel for readability, for its' sheer richness of imagery, for the profound understanding of human nature, with all its weaknesses and contradictions, displayed in the pages of the book, for the beauty of its' prose (a beauty that comes across quite clearly even in translation), and for the vast terrain of ideas covered in the course of those 3,000+ pages of text.That Proust is so little read today (supposedly, only 15,000 copies of &quot;Swann's Way&quot; were sold last year in France, of all places) speaks poorly of our age, and it is impossible to take any living American writer (not excepting Thomas Pynchon) seriously after experiencing (for &quot;reading&quot; is not the appropriate term to use here) this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I had been intrigued by Proust since early age, for one of my favourite books is Gold and Fizdale's &quot;Misia&quot; and his name crops up all the time in it. I bought the Scott Moncrieff's English version in Paris over ten years ago and I know that many soi-dissant more authoritative versions have come out eversince. Yet, a few years ago I read the version in French as organized by Jean-Yves Tadi&eacute; -possibly the best known pundit on Proust's work to date- and I have to say Moncrieff's translation doesn't stray that far from the original. &quot;A La Recherche&quot; is to me the most important book in the history of literature. Compellingly philosophical, psychological, soul-searching and esthetic, no details of life go amiss. I am alternately moved, stirred and surprised at Proust's dexterity in describing the wide range of human emotions and the complexity of human interactions. He talks about art, love, jealousy, nostalgy, ambition, social climbing, politics and you cannot fail to empathise with his prose or finding new moot questions with each new reading of his work. His book is as relevant to life as life itself."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I read this entire opus in the summer of 1975, while lounging around the local pool and tennis courts, as a young seeker of wisdom and truth. I had read Mann (MAGIC MOUNTAIN),Musil (MAN WITHOUT QUALITIES), WAS AMAZED, GAVE THIS ONE A SHOT. A lot is very slow going,but it's true this is a book that really makes you appreciate beauty, and frankly be glad that you (I) have eyes and ears. Most people, it seems, go thru life without really bothering to appreciate the everyday beauties that are all around us,corny as that seems. Walk around your neighborhood some evening.How many people will be strolling outside enchanted at the the stars/heavens? For every one,there are probably a thousand watching an obnoxious sit-com with canned laughter. You see, a great artist like Proust makes us look at the world in this way. Walk into even a do-it-yourself clothing shop,and notice all the patterns. Most of us barely pay attention. Proust' ways of seeing,and describing are like any great painter. He often invokes Vermeer, a fair comparison.He is awed by cathedrals,landscapes,you name it. And his discussions of the Great War, including some admiration for German soldiers, are a surprise. Yes, it goes on and on,and I could not make the effort now,except to browse thru it. BTW, I prefer Mann and Musil, who seem to have a better story line,and stringer narrative. Marcel's mother complex,and all the super-long interrelationships and descriptions may put you off, for good reason,but even just browsing thru this shows you this fellow had phenomenal powers of observation,even forgetting all the rest of the greatness of this wondrous, if boring at times, work of art."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"This is volume five of the superlative new translation of \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" containing the two books of the Albertine cycle, which are now titled \\"The Prisoner\\" (translated by Carol Clark) and \\"The Fugitive\\" (tr. Peter Collier). Though I haven't yet read their translations, I have found the new editions to be a wonderful improvement over those done in the 1920s by Charles Scott Moncrieff. So I have no hesitation in giving them five stars.Unhappily for American readers, current U.S. copyright law prevents Viking/Penguin from publishing the last two volumes of \\"Lost Time\\" in this country until 95 years after Proust's death, or 2018. The first four volumes have been published here in handsome hardcovers (more handsome than the British edition), but the only way to obtain this and the final volume (\\"Finding Time Again\\") is to find an imported British hardcover or paperback. -- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Along with all the superlatives written by other people - let me add something else - what a sly sense of humor he has! Imagine conversing with an aristocratic dowerger, her very &quot;modern&quot; daughter in law, and a rather naive, poorly educated girl who confuses &quot;Have you seen the Vermers?&quot; (paintings by Vermere) with some live people. Proust notices the spittle spraying out with the dowerger's enthusiastic conversation, and polite comments that are really attacks on one another's views. Proust is a master of interaction between people, a group of people venting their opinions and looking each other over! TIMELESS. Fashions may be different today. We still interact with fears and prejudice pretty much the same. Some of Proust's philosophy is pretty dark. A religious person might be shocked because he is so down to earth. I am bouyed up by his poetry, his vivid insights, his reality. Unfortunatly I can't live long enough to read enough, and read again."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"This volume contains parts five and six of Proust's huge novel; additionally, these two parts represent the first posthumous releases from A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. If there was any doubt in my mind that these parts, published without the author's oversight, could not continue the excellence of the preceding parts, this fear was quickly dispelled. The Captive and The Fugitive contain some of the most beautiful of Proust's prose, as well as insights into Parisian society, art and the inner thoughts of the narrator not contained elsewhere in the novel.The Captive, originally published in 1923, tells the story of Marcel and Albertine, now kept by the narrator in his Paris home. This co-habitation is not based on love, nor even lust, but on the obsessive jealousy of Marcel based on his almost psycopathic fear of Albertine's lesbian proclivities. By this point in the novel, Marcel has removed himself from society and is content to remain for the most part in his room. Albertine, living in an adjoining room, is allowed out of the house only with a chaperon and to destinations decided in advance by Marcel. It is the ironic twist that Proust puts on the idea of imprisonment that forms the backbone of this part of the novel. Not only is Albertine kept prisoner by Marcel, but Marcel is no less the prisoner of his own obsession.It can arguably be stated that each of the parts of the novel corresponds to one of the senses. If this is the case, the Captive surely corresponds to the sense of hearing. It is while listening to Vinteuil's septet that Marcel realizes that art is more than the mechanical manipulation of ideas by color, words or music. Just as Vinteuil has created a complex musical form out of the \\"catchy\\" phrase so admired by Swann and Mme Verdurin's little group, Marcel awakens to the limitless possibilities of artistic expression. This epiphanic moment awakens in the narrator a desire to commit himself to the life of a writer. In order to accomplish this wish, he decides that he must end his affair with Albertine. Marcel's decision to part with Albertine on his own terms is thwarted when he learns that it is she who has made the final break and has left his apartment.Thus begins The Fugitive (originally translated by C.K. Scott Moncrieff, with a freight train full of poetic license, as The Sweet Cheat Gone). The Fugitive represents the most introspective part of a very introspective novel, and in it Proust's zeal for self-examination is pursued with un-relentless fervor as layer upon layer of the author's persona in exposed to the reader.Marcel's world is turned up side down when he learns that Albertine has died in a riding accident. His obsession, so debilitating when his mistress was alive, continues unabated after her death and the narrator continues with his scrutiny of Albertine's private life as if she was still alive. He finally realizes that obsession cannot be eliminated by death and that relief can only come with the passsing of time and the ensuing state of oblivion. Although Albertine's memory has not been totally erased, the torment that she has caused Marcel diminishes greatly and he is able to resume his life and work.However, it is a different world into which Marcel emerges after his long period of grief. Just as Marcel's personal life was changed by a freak accident, the social life in which he has emersed himself is going through social changes just as fundamental. The old aristocracy, becoming more and more deperate for cash, is falling prey to the easy lure of mariages of convenience in which aristocratic titles are exchanged for hefty dowries. His two friends, Gilberte Swann and Robert de Saint-Loup, are married to each other thus accomplishing what Charles Swann could never do - have his daughter received by the Duchess de Guermantes. Even more revolutionary, a simple seamstress (Jupien's niece) marries into the aristocracy forever destroying any romantic impressions that Marcel might still hold of the Guermantes and Meseglise Ways. Clearly Marcel's world is changing, but it is the change in his friend, Robert de Saint-Loup, that causes him the greatest pain as he realizes that even friendships are all too often broken by the passage of time."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"_Remembrance of Things Past_ by Marcel Proust became a year long obsession for me. Although I had some mixed emotions about it in retrospect, any book that could be so engrossing and fascinating to keep me reading through nearly 3,000 pages had to have been pretty good. And most of the volumes within this 7-novel / 3-volume work were more than just pretty good; they were quite simply some of the most beautiful, thought-provoking, and philosophical ficticious works ever written. Keep in mind that I am not even a huge fan of fiction - almost everything I read these days is either nonfiction philosophy, theology, orpsychology. Yet these books remain high atop my best-ever list, and even when I unfairly hold them up against potent nonfiction philosophy from the same time period, they can hold their own as profound psychological commentaries on the universal condition of mankind._Remembrance of Things Past_ is the ultimate psychological realist novel ever written. Russian realist novels by authors such as Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky seem almost elementary compared to Proust. British Victorian novels come across as meaningless fluff in comparison. If you are coming from a background of reading Russian realist novels, or something like Thomas Mann, reading Proust is definately the next logical step for you to take in your reading regimen. Proust is somewhat difficult, but if you are in college and have read at least 15 - 20 good literary novels, you are probably prepared to read this.The only reason I gave _Remembrance of Things Past_ only four stars instead of five is because of the weakness of two of the novels in the series. The fourth novel, _Sodom and Gommorrah_ (AKA Cities of the Plain) is a boring and somewhat disgusting account of the demise of a high society figure, Mr. DeCharlus. Although DeCharlus is a memorable and very realistically drawn character, it becomes tedious reading about his slow, painful mutation into a pathetic, perverted old man. This goes on for some 600 pages. Equally boring is the fifth installation in the series, known as _The Captive_. I will not bore you with the details, but suffice it to say that it is a 600 page book about the follies of a love struck fool; it is a don't-let-this-happen-to-you tale about a man who allows a woman to completely ruin his life, and is some of the most boring 600 pages of literature ever written.That said, the first three volumes of the series and the last volume represent some of the finest prose ever put into print. The first volume, _Swann's Way_, and the last, _Time Regained_, are easily five star books and alone are worth the price of this set. The second and third volumes are also five-star, compulsive reading. Buy the set - just skip volumes 4 and 5."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"A work of staggering beauty and moment by moment insight.There are passages in this work you just have to go back and read again and again,such is the perfection of prousts writing.When a man has locked himself away in a cork lined room for twenty years to complete this masterpiece the least we owe him is a couple of years to read it.

It is a complex, psychological relationship to say the least. In the Captive, Albertine lives with Marcel in his apartment in Paris and in The Fugitive one wonders who is, in fact, more captive -- Albertine or Marcel. It would seem to be Albertine for whom Marcel possesses an obsessive love and concurrent fear of her sapphic penchant. But it is also Marcel who will sacrifice experience if he makes a commitment to her. Who is more free, the captive or the fugitive? Proust raises questions about how to serve best the artist's quest for beauty. In fact, how does one really ever \\"capture\\" the beauty of life in art or music or literature? Even in a masterpiece, is it not beauty the fugitive that usually dwells just beyond one's capture? Or like Vinteuil's septet or the music of Wagner or the painting of Rembrandt, is the best for which one can hope of fugitive beauty only a brief fleeting experience? Are the vast tracts of time spent to understand the beauty and meaning of life worth it? As a writer does he not habitually surrender life in order to capture it? Or is the pursuit of the capture of the beauty of life in fact where one realizes its most sublime value? One sees in Proust toward the end of The Fugitive a member of society who respects it but chooses by reasons of health not to position himself so visibly within it. Despite his family name and vast but dwindling fortune inherited from his beloved grandmother, he seems to become somewhat ultimately disenchanted with the intricacies of Faubourg-St. Germain society to which he devotes so much of his writing. He recognises society's shallow obsession with materialism and rampant snobbery but his own place in society is captured by its complex history and tacit rules and Marcel is inescapably a captive of his own culture. When Albertine is lost to him toward the end of the volume, as in the prior volumes, the story line's serial intrigue advances most. Characters from prior volumes reappear, reminiscent of Balzac, whom Proust adored, but like him they change,too, and usually for the worse over time. The great tapestry of the characters of Proust -- Albertine, Gilberte, Swann, Brichot, Bloch, Charlus, Morel, Saint-Loup -- ultimately surprise and usually disappoint him. As to nagging questions about Proust's own orientation, \\"Personally I found it absolutely immaterial from a moral standpoint whether one took one's pleasure with a man or a woman, and only too natural and human that one should take it where one could find it.\\" I found myself wishing that Proust had written more about Bloch and Saint-Loup and Gilberte, and less about Albertine. But she was, like his work, the one obsession, the endeavor of which understanding he could never escape and never quite marry -- she was his beauty and his art. She was the breath of life itself from his pen and from his experience of life as seen through the eyes of a true genius."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Attempting a review of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is comparable to being a mediocre art critic trying to critique the Sistine Chapel: one feels unworthy of the task of dissecting a work which transcends criticism and imbues the reader with a vision so compelling and profound, it will change how he sees himself, his relationships, and the world around him.

Proust is extraordinarily masterful at evoking the painful (and yet very real) feeling of gradual disaffection, which all lovers must inevitably face with each other. Marcel pontificates endlessly and relentlessly on Albertine. He loves, her (or maybe we should say him), he doesn't love her, he loves her, he doesn't love her, etc. etc. Until, finally, the moment of decision, he tells her that he does not love her and wishes her to leave, insisting that she will be happier without him. Of course, the moment Albertine departs, Marcel is in despair, he has lost has love, and Albertine is reduced to the status of the \`fugitive.' This volume is one of the most beauteous and thoughtful unfolding of the loss of love, and the painful convalescence that transpires in the subsequent period. Marcel goes to Venice, and explores that wondrous and ancient European city, and he sends help to find Albertine, only to discover that she has died in a horseback accident. In addition to the tragic loss of Albertine, Marcel grows continually disenchanted with the aristocratic world to which he belongs. Proust is brilliant in his ability to sustain this massive web of characters, as he reintroduces figures from the early stages of the search, such as Gilberte (Marcel's first love), and Mme Verdurin. This book evokes the meaning of life as it unfolds temporally, and the meaning of relationships throughout the course of a lifetime, and how they change and drift in and out of focus at different stages. It is one of the great works of Western literature."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"In his 1948 book of essays \\"The World's Ten Greatest Novels\\" (sometimes called \\"Great Novelists and their Novels\\") W Somerset Maugham states he originally intended to include Marcel Proust's \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" (he calls it the greatest novel of the Twentieth Century) in his list but it wasn't possible. Maugham was a great advocate of condensations, and each of his essays was to preface a condensation of \\"Tom Jones\\", \\"P&egrave;re Goriot\\", etc. Because of the great length of \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" he says it would \\"have been impossible , even with drastic cutting, to reduce it to a reasonable size\\". Myself, I don't like condensations (condescensions, I call them), as I find the Reader's Digest method usually cuts out the book's best parts. The idea of cutting \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" is frightening because it's not a novel per se but a series of seven novels, each with the same characters and mood, each flowing with an ever-fascinating narrative. \\"The decine of day plunging me back by an act of memory in a cool atmosphere of long ago, I breathed it with the same delight with which Orpheus inhaled the subtle air, unknown on this earth, of the Elysian Fields,\\" writes Proust, and this is nearly 1500 pages after the narrator has dipped that tremendous madeleine into his tea. The narrative is spellbinding, and I'm not certain why. Maugham again: while discussing \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" he agrees with Scott in saying of Jane Austen's style: \\" ... nothing very much happens and yet when you reach the bottom of a page you eagerly turn it in order to know what happens next; nothing very much does and again you turn the page with the same eagerness.\\" This describes Proust to a T, and comparing Proust to Austen is not as inappropriate as you would think. They both observe their characters with a dry wit, describing the dinners, the parties, the affaires d'amour, the deep concern with social status that made up their worlds. The characters in Proust are myriad, including the three women the narrator falls in love with, the femme galante Odette, her daughter Gilberte, and the coltish Albertine. Then there is the obscure Baron de Charlus, who is introduced as one of Odette's admirers and ends up paying to be humiliated by stable boys. The narrator professes to be disturbed by this; but he himself, in the 6th novel, entices a gamine to his room, giving her five hundred francs to sit on his knee, an indiscretion which earns him a visit from the child's parents, accompanied by the Sret&eacute;. As for the narrator's name, Albertine finally refers to him as \\"Marcel\\" in the fifth book. (Incidently, you can look up the entire List of Characters on-line but -- prenez garde! -- the list is full of spoilers.)Would I read this novel again? Well, life is short and \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\" is very long, but it will be a pleasure to re-read sections now and then: one of the soir&eacute;es given by the Verdurins or the narrator's trip to Venice, revealed in expressive descriptions. \\"Remembrance of Things Past\\", like so many great works of art, is a world in itself, a world as enchanting as those Elysian Fields."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"It's hard not to gush about this book, but I'll try. There's are many things that this books does, almost all of them well (my one caveat are the town name etymology discussions); I'll limit myself to two: (1) describing the indescribable - it is easy to say that some things about emotion and sensation simply cannot be put into words; while this is certainly true, Proust shows that a lot more can be put faithfully into words than you would have imagined, (2) shock of recognition - the things you think to yourself at times when you have a lot to think about and the solitude and time necessary to think them are here--I'll just leave it at that. Very shortly, this book is a world within the world, and there is nothing else like it.

It was not a waste of time. Each one of the seven volumes was a priceless experience. At 31, i am more prepared to live, and more prepared to die than i would be without having read this book. It is not an easy work, but the same applies to life.I would also like to say that, although i have read it in french, it seems a bit snobish to pretend that it cant be translated. And if you read proust in depth you will also find that there was never a more merciless critic of snobery.My grandmother is 75 now, i know that i will loose her within the next few years.

I am now two-thirds of the way through ISLT, and believe it surpasses all of these and everything else I have ever read.Before I started I was worried it was a complete con - praised by arty intellectuals with their heads up their own a**es. It isn't. The book is wonderful because it captures all of life's subtleties and replays them in slow motion so that you can see and appreciate them, sometimes for the first time.As a result of trudging (and it is a trudge at times) through this:* I now appreciate beauty much more than I did before: I am a better observer and lover of the countryside, landscapes, sunsets, buildings, flowers;* I am a sharper observer of other people, with a shrewder understanding of human motivations and actions;* I am more tuned in to my own feelings, and believe I am a little wiser.The first 150 pages are slow, and I found the description of Combray tedious. At first the 15-line sentences are difficult (some I had to re-read five times), but I got used to them after a few hundred pages.

It has influenced my whole life, particularly his portrayals of friendship changes over time. It gave me a way of looking at life different from my crisis-ridden, &quot;it's all over&quot; point of view. Proust's book is about almost everything, because it is about his whole life. At his worst a very neurotic parvenu, at his best a deeply compassionate writer. And funny! Proust is a writer who lets his frailties show along with his greatness: unlike Tolstoy or St. Exupery, whose writing shows all their wisdom and little of their frailities. Proust is especially knowledgeable about jealousy. It you are not interested in thorough examination of a feeling, in pages, you won't like this. Interesting theories of art, literature, music.

It's a comment on the quality of the paperback. I read the first four volumes of this Christopher Prendergast-edited series in the hardcover VIKING USA editions, and they were very nicely done. Acid-free paper, 12-point, readable font. My understanding is that Viking can not produce the final volumes (The Prisoner, The Fugitive, and Finding Time Again) because of US copyright laws. So we are left with these Penguin paperbacks. Cheap paper. The font is small, maybe 10 point. The thin parts of the letters almost disappear. That's all. Not such a pleasure to hold in the hand or to read, either. I was unable to find a hardcover copy of the last volumes used or new, so I went with these.

Perhaps. My lack of language skills prevents me from embarking on an experiment.At any rate, it may not matter. The English translation is one of the most powerful, beautiful, astounding works of literature of the last century. Because every novel is, in a sense, a memory made concrete (that the memory is of fictional events is no matter), memory itself is a wonderful subject for fiction--in a sense, when an author takes memory (or time, because in life they are inevitably interwoven, indistinguishable perhaps) for his theme, as Proust does, he embraces all of experienced reality as his subject matter. Through memory, Proust manages to convey the actual texture of experience, and the truth of the insights makes the constant recursive analysis of motive, perception, and the act of remembering anything but tedious.On another level, Nabokov's insight that the great writers are fantasists, creators of worlds, and master illusionists is on display here--forget, for a moment, how accurately and profoundly Proust captures what it is like to be alive. His creations, perhaps transfigured from his real life, are glorious and &quot;better than life.&quot; The Baron, Odette, Swann, Bergotte, Elstir, Bloch, &quot;Rachel when from the Lord&quot;, Albertine, the woman at the WC, and the whole population of this other reality are an improvement on, if not reality, at least out dim perception of it. Is there in life such an &quot;invert&quot; as the Baron, or has there been such a Baron?And, slow-paced as they are, the events also are wonders and marvels--the Arabian Nights are a recurring subject of the narrator's wondering mind, for good reason--the stories here are as nested and impossible as those of the Thousand Nights and a Night. Paris in the early parts of the last century is as strange and eternal as the City of Brass or Baghdad of old--and some of the musings of the narrator in Venice suggest even stranger cities, the territory just east of Borges.To enter the pages of these (this) seven (one) novels (novel) is to enter an enchanted realm, and to return ensorcelled forever, carrying the suspicion that the world around us may also be magical and true and impossible as well."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Yes, it is long. Yes, the sentences are complex. Nonetheless, this novel is a worthy investment of one's efforts, because it isolates events that are so innately human that anyone who reads this novel will relate to it. Beyond just reading it because one feels obligated to do so as bibliophile, enjoy the greatest achievement of 20th-century France because it is witty, insightful, daring, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.I recommend reading this novel quickly, rather than being bogged down by details that result in confusion or distraction. I read the novel in 15 weeks in a class at UC Berkeley, and have concluded that it must be read twice--once, to understand the plot and big ideas, and a second time to linger over the concepts that piqued one's interest the most. However, even if only reading it once, it is worth an investment of one's time and emotion."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Having just gotten my B.A. a couple of years ago I must have been in an ambitious mood or something, because I decided to read the whole of In Search of Lost Time, cover to cover, pausing only for food and sleep. It's the sort of work that looks more like Mount Everest than a regular ol' novel when you first start reading it, but it turned out to be one of the best companions I could have asked for over the past few years. Proust was a mmaster of the cooly detatched but almost unbelievably sensitive description of human motivation, and his perspective on the harmless, but decadent latter-day French aristocracy whose attitudes and practices provie most of the material for the seven books in the series, is deeply selfish and amoral, but also inexhaustibly curious and sympathetic. This constrast comes out most noticeably in The Captive and The Fugitive, which basically consist of several hundred pages of reflection upon Proust's love affair with a young girl named Albertine. The pair of novels are full of long, sustained reflections on the nature of love, and upon the deep mysteries that attend upon trying to understand what makes other people tick. There is an especially lovely passage in which Proust describes the feelings he undergoes while watching Albertine sleep. By the time of the end of the novel, though, the reader finds himself left with the curious sense that one doesn't actually know anything at all concrete about the &quot;Fugitive&quot; Albertine. Nobody was better than Proust at dissecting the motives and the mores of other people without ever gining in to the novelist's illusion that he understood them better than they did themselves. I recommend these novels to anyone who is up for a bit of a challenge (even Scott Moncrieff's lovely translation of the French could never make Proust an &quot;easy read&quot;), and who is prepared to be enlightened by the reading of a novel even if it doesn't issue in the usual &quot;payoff&quot; of a sense of superior understanding in relation to the charatcters depicted there."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"The book shown here is actually the British paperback of volumes 5 and 6 of the new translation of In Search of Lost Time.

Compare this book to a great restaurant with exorbitant prices. The cost has to affect the rating. Minus one point for the slow, boring parts of this 3,000 page book.Marcel has a philosophy about love. He believes love is kindled by pain. No pain, no love. If he is free to take a girl for granted, he'll never love her. But if she's unavailable and he misses her intensely, or if she goes to another lover and breaks his heart, then he's in love. I'm not suggesting this as a workable philosophy. It's just a clue to Marcel.The love of his life is Albertine. His jealousy is constantly inflamed. She has roving eyes for other women, and this drives him to distraction. Since pain equals love to him, he's in love. Marcel is afraid to tell her he loves her, thinking if she knew she'd step all over him.Albertine is a lot more conservative, in her heart, than Marcel thinks she is. She yearns to give up her promiscuous life and marry him. Her fear is that he will never forgive her past, and will never propose. So what we have here is a failure to communicate.There's no room to mention all the other great characters, or even to say any more about Marcel and Albertine.

I read the first two volumes at the age of 22, and was overwhelmed by the density, complexity, and beauty of Proust's style (magnificent even in translation), but I could not appreciate the book's deeper emotional resonances because I had not lived long enough or loved intensely enough. Although I am only five years older now, I have suffered through two intense, beautiful, and sorrowful relationships, and these experiences have made rereading Proust one of the most rewarding activities I have ever engaged in. I am half-way through &quot;Le Temps Retrouve&quot; and look forward to starting the whole thing again as soon as I have finished this first reading. Even if you don't have the patience to read the entire cycle, at least read &quot;Du Cote du Chez Swann/Swann's Way,&quot; which perfectly encapsulates the effects, styles, and themes of the entire work. If you have ever fallen in love, the section &quot;Swann in Love&quot; in this book will make you really think about this sensation. Proust's style may seem long-winded and pretentious at first, but once you become accustomed to it, you will realize that Proust's way of looking at the world seems to explain much that is mysterious in the human mind and heart. I have no words of praise high enough for this book. It will shock you into realizing how terrible and beautiful life really is, and how complex people are underneath the mask which we present to most other humans we encounter. The paintings of Vermeer (which play an important part in the novel) are the closest visual equivalent to this book - the sheer poetry of everyday existence is deftly and exquisitely communicated. Unlike many novels which are considered great because they deal explicitly with &quot;great themes&quot; - sex, death, and politics - &quot;A la recherche du temps perdu&quot; appears to the casual reader to be about nothing at all - a bunch of descriptions of ordinary phenomena or gossip about society figures - little more than a glorified soap opera. There is not a single word here that is not absolutely necessary, however, and the careful reader will note how many times crucial events happen for which the reader has been prepared by a seemingly trivial incident several hundred pages earlier. Somehow, this book recaptures the experience of being alive more fully than anything I have ever read, including the Bible! Read this book and I guarantee that you will not think the way you did before Proust came into your life."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Proust's great novel does not need to be read all at one time. I read it one volume at a time and usually took six months to a year off between volumes. I was always able to pick up right where I left off with nothing lost, like visiting old friends. I think it is OK to think of Remembrance of Things Past as a series of novels. I know Proust would disagree with this. It was very important to him that his readers consider carefully the unifying theme and symmetry to which he aspired in the novel, but I think that aspect became less and less tangible as his manuscript grew from 1000 pages originally to 2000, and then from 2000 to the 4000 odd pages it ended up being (he continued to expand the manuscript right up until the time of his death). In any event, the grand theme he designed will not be lost on you if you stay with the novel until the end and it is wonderful when you consider it, but it is not the reason I love the novel so well. Swann's Way, Within a Budding Grove, and The Guermantes Way are decisively the best volumes and, fortunately, they are the first three in that order. If you like Swann's Way but are intimidated by the gargantuan size of the entire series, then plan to read at least the first three volumes. In this way you will have experienced Proust's best material. The entire novel is essentially a fictional autobiography or memoir. It is narrated by a man whose name we are never given, although he does hypothetically suggest the name \\"Marcel\\" for himself on one occasion about three-fourths of the way through. The story is inspired by events and people from Proust's life, but it is strictly a fiction. Swann's Way is the only volume in which the narrator is not the central figure in the story. It is, ultimately, a conventional story with several fascinating characters and humorous, razor sharp dialogue. There are several recurring, ingeniously depicted themes in the novel, not the least of which is involuntary memory, and it often reads like a deeply philosophical essay, with Proust wandering off on one of his famous digressions. The philosophical digressions are the best part for me, but I could see why they could be distracting or tedious to some. Proust's sentences quite frequently stretch to 10, 20, or even 30 lines, with multiple subordinating clauses. It can be dizzying. Some have claimed that this makes him a stream-of-consciousness writer. I flat out reject this notion. It is never, ever pretentious or unnecessarily wordy. Literary historians love to bracket Proust in the same category as Joyce (like art historians like to couple, for example, Van Gough and Gauguin), but the two writers are as different as night and day. Every sentence is worth the time in Proust, there are no word games, there is no obscurity, and it is all essential and rewarding. The only complaint I have is that he spends too much time on the theme of jealousy in the later volumes, a theme he covered quite well in Swann's way. Those volumes are worth reading too, but they have a tendency to drag out in a way that the first three volumes don't. Things do pick up a bit with the final volume, Time Regained, where everything comes full circle."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I'm afraid I cannot really quantify &quot;A la recherche dutemps perdu&quot; in terms of a star rating, although I have had togive it 5 stars because I couldn't submit my review otherwise! It took me the best part of two years to read Proust's magnum opus and the question I find myself asking is: was it time well spent? I'm really not sure, even two years later.The first and most important thing I will say is that the novel is unlike anything you will ever read, and Proust is totally unique among authors. If you thought Tolstoy or Eliot were insightful, Proust digs beneath another ten layers of motive and counter-motive to reveal his truths: there has never been a writer prepared to go to such exhaustive lengths. I'm still not sure exactly what the book is about, either. Nominally it is an exploration of the perception of time and its effects on the mind. Proust shines this light on his protagonist's early years and the high social circles he finds himself moving in. Some of the characters are memorably bizarre - principally the Baron de Charlus, whose incredible arrogance and self-deception will certainly provide the reader with a few surprises.... Proust's other fascinations with lineage and place names may not be to every reader's tastes but are revealing insights into his incredible pedantry and appetite for minutiae.The writing itself is often astonishing - Proust's ideas about love, betrayal and jealousy are sometimes diametrically opposed to received wisdom, but when he concentrates his unmistakable genius on these themes it is hard not to agree with his reasoning, however cynical it may be.Overall, I wouldn't recommend &quot;A la recherche du temps perdu&quot; lightly. Many people won't get past the opening ruminations over the effects of Marcel missing his mother's goodnight kiss. However, for serious literary buffs it is a must. END"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"A star system doesn't work for Proust, any more than it would for Shakespeare. Both are too big, although in very different ways.I started reading SWANN'S WAY when I was twenty and thought it boring. I got through the first two volumes and quit. When I turned thirty-eight I felt a strong need to read it in its entirety; I wasn't sure why. It took two years but I finished it before I was forty and felt refreshed in a way I never had on completing any other book. I saw that I was ready to enter the stage of my life when memory transforms all current reality. I pursuaded my husband to give it a try, and although he only read the first four volumes, he called it &quot;everyone's autobiography&quot;, a perfect description. Nothing that has ever been written compares with this long, extended daydream on memory, love, loss, and the transforming power of art. As a painter, I learned new ways to look. (Proust is the only fiction writer I've ever read who understands and can express what a painting can say.)Admittedly this very great book is not for everyone. Perhaps that's because it's so unlike other reading experiences. You have to read it with discipline and dedication, just as you approach meditation.More than twenty years have passed since I finished it. Now I am re-reading it. Time lost in one's own life transforms this masterpiece so that it offers up new treasures, new insights, and becomes a different book. It's an organic, living, unique work of art that goes far beyond praise."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"If you're here reading this review, then you're presumably thinking of reading Proust. Given that, you also probably know that it's supposed to be one of the greatest works of literature ever written, an opinion I happen to agree with. But what makes it so great? And should you give it a try?To answer the first part, while different people will find different things, what I enjoy most is Proust's tremendous psychological insight, and his ability to move from the specific to the general. The work is full of small events which Proust uses as springboards to illustrate general characteristics, many of which you will read with the shock of recognition that true insight provides.And Proust tackles the big questions: love, art, and memory are all major themes, just to pick the most notable examples. But it is not all heavy, serious drudgery. Proust is also a very funny writer, and there are large sections which show a wonderful comedy of manners or social satire.So should you try it? I would definitely recommend it, with a few caveats. First, while I think his reputation is a bit overblown, Proust can be a difficult writer. The biggest hurdle is his style; he writes very long, involved sentences that pile clauses upon clauses. But given this length and intricacy, it is remarkable how clear Proust's prose actually is. Only very rarely will you have to stop and recatch the drift of a sentence. And when that happens, it's usually because your attention has wandered, not because of any inherent opaqueness. And after you become accustomed to it, Proust's writing style becomes one of the charms of the work, immersing you in a different world every time you pick up the books.It is also unfortunate in a way that probably the most difficult section of the book is the very first, &quot;Combray.&quot; However, even if you find that tough going, things pick up with the second section, &quot;Swann in Love.&quot; (Although it is never a page turner in the usual sense.) And if you can read and enjoy the first 50 pages, then you can make it through the whole thing.The length also puts many prospective readers off, but I wouldn't worry about that so much. The total cast of characters is relatively large, but not huge, and they are so well presented and disntinctive that I never had any trouble keeping them straight. And because the work is not driven by details of the plot, it can be set down and picked up a little later without losing much, if your motivation lags. (This is a last point to keep in mind: the work will not carry you along with the plot or keep you guessing about what will happen. Instead, it will captivate you with the detail and insight it brings to present the everyday occurences of life.)Obviously, there's much more I could write, but hopefully this will give you some idea of the work and whether you would like it, which is what a review is all about..."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"This book is unlike anything I have ever read. Proust's basic premise is that we do not fully appreciate an experience when it happens because we are hampered and distracted at the time by the experience itself. It is only when we remember and relive an event that we are truly able to extract the most from it and thus, in remembrance, experience it more vividly than we ever could at the time it happened. So Proust, a sickly asthmatic ex-socialite locked in a cork lined room, remembers and relives his entire life, and the seven volumes of Remembrance are the result. And his remembered and relived life is rich indeed, perhaps unsurprisingly, even more so than his actual life was. This is total recall with enhancement.But the book is much more than that. It is paragraph after paragraph and page after page of the most perfect prose and Proust the perfectionist is also the funniest and wickedest writer that ever lived. His characters: the pompous bores, self righteous clergymen, overrated diplomats and talentless but currently fashionable artists, the dandies, hypocrites, proud servants and relentless social climbers are all stripped bare by his subtle observations and unbelievably brilliant dialogue. And then there are his justifiably famous descriptions; of landscape, flowers, gardens, and of course, insomnia. All drawn so beautifully that you can almost see and taste and smell and feel everything he writes about. Indeed it's enough to make you want to curl up in a cork lined room and spend the rest of your life living vicariously through Proust's remembrances.Good writing alters your perceptions and the better the writing the more lasting the affect. Proust, with his incredibly detailed analyses of love and desire, self delusion and human emotion will change the way you think for ever. Remembrance of Things Past is better than therapy. There's just one small problem: the sheer volume of writing and the weight of the thing. But do not despair, even if you never finish all seven volumes, and few ! have, you will at least have some idea of the monumental scale of this masterpiece, and if you are very determined there is, supposedly, a support group to give you any encouragement you might need to complete the task. Once you have completed the books of course, you can impress others forever. And if you need even further challenges you can read the entire thing in French and that should keep you busy for a while. So while you may never climb Mount Everest, and might not even make the summit of this book, I would still urge everybody to try to read at least a little of Remembrance of Things Past."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"This is the ultimate novel. The best. Too bad we only have a five-star limit. This one deserves a solid 10 stars. This novel's beauty, depth and impact will stagger the patient, persistent reader. I read the first volume, Swann's Way, about 25 years ago and was totally taken by it. Ten years later, I finally got around to the rest of the book when I ordered the wonderful Random House boxed set. I read it all summer, totally hooked to the point where I would drop duties and social invitations just to keep reading and reading. There were a few points, like the long section about &quot;Name Places&quot; that tested my patience, but the rest of it, oh my God! Like streams and rivers that trickle, run and rage to the vast ocean. Its sensuous details involve all the senses, its characters you will know better than people in your own life, the obsessive mental and emotional meanderings of the characters become hypnotic. The weather, the scenery, the rooms, the bee-hive hum of conversation, the loves and betrayals, it's all there and then some. It's a complete world, infinitely imagined and re-imagined, unto itself. There is nothing whatsoever like it in all of literature. As someone here said, it's THE book to take to the desert island. I am so glad I read it and hope to live long enough to read it again. More than any other book, it's the one worth re-reading. Please read it! Please FIND the time to read it! You will be forever grateful you did."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"A friend of mine had a teacher who died recently. Before the man died, he made a list of \\"things to do before you die\\" for his students. One of the things on the list was \\"Take the Time to Read Proust.\\" So I started doing so, finishing the first of seven volumes just recently. It does take time, but there's nothing like it that I've read.Many of the reviews I read before actually diving in to \\"Swann's Way\\" mentioned something along the lines of \\"get past the first 30 pages and you'll be off and running.\\" This is largely true. I was a tad infuriated by the endless rambling of the opening section, which is about a boy attempting to fall asleep despite the insomnia which troubles him when his mother hasn't given him a good-night kiss. But after I weathered this section, I started to get accustomed to the style, and even began thinking how beautiful it was to recreate so many tiny mental details about an experience, or an object such as a church, a country lane, and yes, a flower (there are many flowers in Proust). When we leave Combray (the boy's summer abode) under Proust's guidance and see through Swann's eyes in Paris, the book becomes difficult to put down. Musical phrases overheard at Paris salons become \\"divine captives\\" that we hold hostage unto death, and death in their company is \\"somehow less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less probable.\\" There are many such beautiful and unique descriptions. If you believe you have the patience to slow down enough to absorb and fathom the tiny, wonderful details of life that Proust brings to light, buy the whole set and read it over the years."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"This is really a review of the first three volumes (how far I've gotten). Proust's intricate difficult prose makes you work - but it is so worth it. On one level, the books are full of insight into the nature of artistic and literary perception, memory and imagination. This is what I expected from Proust - and it is all provocative, mind expanding stuff. On another level, they are a touching, funny, sometimes sad account of childhood and adolescence, sexual awakening, the loss of a beloved grandmother, etc. etc. This was unexpected. Also unexpected was the heartbreaking meditation on love that is Swann's Way, and the delightful - almost Jane Austen-like or Dickensian - social comedy that is much of the 3rd volume.Many people are probably put off by the first 70 or so pages - the extended memory reverie that doesn't seem to be going anywhere. But if you keep going, the rewards - intellectual, emotional, and just plain fun are all there!"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Moncrieff/Kilmartin's translation is still the best. Proust's life-work is the most psychologically acute novel ever written, and a perfect match between form and content. His form is the memoir, conceived as a piece of music, with themes and variations, codas and recapitulations. The content is a list of evolving concerns, from love (in all its forms) to aesthetic creation and appreciation, as well as a sort of living autopsy of the aristocracy of his time. His motives were manifold, but it seems Proust primarily wanted to get in the final word on those people he knew throughout his life, and show he both understood them (better than they themselves) and that they had little inkling of his amazing inner life. For all his encounters with and criticisms of snobs and poseurs throughout the work, and his tendency to fully absorb himself in his experiences, Marcel the narrator risks coming off as a snob himself; but quite the opposite, he denigrates himself constantly with reference to his own writing abilities, up into the very last section of &quot;Time Regained&quot; when the structural idea for the novel we have just read comes to him. He's disappointed many times by his own experiences, when they are is measured and conditioned by the background of his keen aesthetic imagination. His salvation is both the Idea for the novel, and a theory of time/identity which has been &quot;calling out&quot; to him with his famous episodes of &quot;involuntary memory&quot; (the most famous of which is the tea-dipped madeleine). As one reads on, there are times when it seems Proust has suspended all action and narrative in favor of impressions which resonate against one another. It may seem gratuitous or self-indulgent, but he is &quot;performing&quot; his theory at the same time he's telling you about it. They each have a purpose, and it seems he's trying to enact a philosophical theory of identity and experience: as if we the subject are nodes of activity that blend memory and present conscious experience.&quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot; can be a difficult work to read, but it is so very much worth it. One needs no guide to read this work; it's not as allusive as &quot;Ulysses&quot; nor esoteric like &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot;. Proust's style is very reader-friendly (albeit he spins very long sentences). He respects the reader, and wants her to understand exactly where he's coming from, for this novel is like the map Borges once described in one of his &quot;Ficciones&quot;: it's a representation so large and subtle and complex that it is as big as what it depicts.If Proust were alive today, he'd probably be kibbitzing with Hollywood stars or the world's billionaire elites...And not much of this book would change!"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"How much happier one feels in the world, having waded through &quot;In Search of Lost Time.&quot; How greatly enriched ones appreciation of the brevity and humor in the language of tax forms or hand-drier instructions; how swift and direct the dentist's drill; how breathlessly fast-paced the wait while a cop writes you up a speeding ticket. If boredom were heroin, this book by itself would sustain the most craven junkie blissfully to his death of old age. The core &quot;project&quot; of the book is to describe in excruciating, fine-comb, microscopic detail every single sensory impression, thought, feeling, memory, and fleeting bit of moronic philosophy (together with all the motivations behind these) in the life of its narrator. Of course, even if the subject had led an exciting, interesting life, this would still be a ridiculous idea. But when the subject's life essentially revolves around flowers and tiny cakes, the result is about two feet of bookshelf space that could be put to better use, say, storing cigarettes for distribution to children."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"The Albertine episodes make more sense if we assume this is a homosexual ralationship. Albertine's independence, and her being allowed to live in a young man's apartment, and other aspects of her social life do not seem likely for a young woman in the nineteen hundreds. Marcel's (and incidentally this is the only volume where he refers to himself as Marcel) suspicions then become the gay lover's fears that his lover prefers heterosexuality. Albertine is the only female in the Recherche who never gets married.Apart from these external clues there is quality about the the affection Marcel feels that suggests a gay rather than a straight relationship.This volume marks a turning point in the narrator's fascination with the aristocracy. From here on disenchantment sets in, and the references to homosexuality become almost homophobic."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Attempting a review of &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is comparable to being a mediocre art critic trying to critique the Sistine Chapel: one feels unworthy of the task of dissecting a work which transcends criticism and imbues the reader with a vision so profound and compelling, it will change how he sees himself, his past, his relationships, and the world around him. And so,in lieu of a typical review, here's a bit of advice for anyone thinking of devoting time to this monumental book: read the whole thing, then read it again, read a couple of pages for the rest of your life"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"In response to the reader in Chicago (20 Jan 1999), I would recommend Terence Kilmartin's revision of the C.

It is certainly impossible to go to a classical concert without finding at least one person nodding their befeathered head in ecstasy!At least read about Swann and his jealousy over Odette, or the moving section on his grandmother's death, and you will surely be hooked."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I read Proust's masterwork over a period of several years and only now, in my thirties, do I understand what he was on about. His work is a profound examination into the human condition and man's contigency with the world. In recreating his life through memory, Proust has in magnificent prose, tried to understand what confronted all great writers: what is truth, what is reality, what is illusion. The only writer/thinker to surpass Proust in this was Nietzsche. His idea of eternal recurrence is the corollary of Proust's recreated world via remembering and deja vu. Simply wondrous!"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I've found that listening to Proust (by way of full-text cassette recordings of ISLT) is far more palatable and meaningful than trying to read his work.

It's a very difficult book ( 8 volumes) to read. It is not a autobiography nor a representation of reality, nor a interpretation of the world, but it's a book about us, human beings, about our innerselves, about time and space and the relationship we all have with those two realities. And all this in the most beautifull and perfect literary form. Proust writes about life like a microscope looks at reality: tiny little details we all experience but are not realy aware.This book is a masterpiece about us."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"The Captive is volume 5 of 7 in Marcel Proust's \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" series.There's not a lot of action in this book. Marcel keeps Albertine with him in his home in Paris, restricting her freedom so much that she is nearly a prisoner. He goes back and forth emotionally over her. Sometimes she makes him jealous and he becomes obsessed with her, feeling that he must love her. Then when she is docile and obedient, he feels he is becoming bored with her. He wonders if she has actually made him a prisoner, and he would be better off without her.The other plot line involves Baron de Charlus, Morel, and the Verdurins. The Verdurins become angry with the Baron. To get even with him they decide to cause trouble between him and Morel.That's it as far as the plot is concerned. But once again you have Proust's beautiful prose, filled with many memorable passages.

Would we then, when midnight sky dispensed its mist on sunflower fields, crow with delight as we feast on fresh seeds of love?After feeding me with tender prose and sprinkling my solitary woes into tickling fits of laughter, he, like Cyrano de Bergerac of Roxanne, proves to be the mouth watering dessert my fork hitherto I let linger on the table had ever penetrated. Without certainty as to the true identity of the narrator in the past volumes, Marcel finally introduces himself. What brings about this revelation is the ecstacy of once and for all discovering his true love in Albertine. This guileless love regrettably turns into mania when Albertine becomes a captive in his house. He restricts Albertine from meeting her friends thereby the latter webs all sorts of mendacity just so behind his back she is able to frolic with women whom she has the most propensity in getting herself aroused. As the old adage goes \\"free someone if you must love her\\", Marcel goes through agonizing pain in setting her free in the hope that one day she comes back to him. He falls in and out of love just like we do. And thanks to the fugitive we liberate to cross pollinate from one flower to another for he produces an exotic kind of bloom we find in our garden on a beautiful day of spring to pick and offer to the person we love afterward.The Captive and the Fugitive is the penultimate volume of In Search of Lost Time. It is the continuing saga of love and deceit in all forms and the healing that comes later on. M.

Though one must admire Proust's sheer anthenticity, the work seems to rely more on the complexity of the narrative than it does the power of the actual writing. Much like Faulkner, Proust capitalizes on his sentuplative talent for description, which is admittedly stunning. Even in translation, Proust's prose retains is almost ethereal quality. However, Proust proselytize so long on everything from his childhood bed to his lover's eyes that any beauty in the language is lost. Once the reader has been stripped the illusion that skillful use of language must convey some profound insight, they are left to face the grim, hackneyed subject matter: once careless bon vivant realizes the emptiness of his ways. The work is not one of literature, but of self-flagellation."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Pretentious, boring, obscure, obscene (though definitely NOT erotic - no matter what your sexual orientation is), and self-glorifying, (or self-delusional). And extrememly poor insight into the motives of other people. Other than that it is a pretty good book.His endless recounting of the incredible (to me anyway) attentions and flattery lavished on him by the &quot;upper crust&quot; leave me feeling the descriptions are not true - the only question being if he was deluded or if he was lying.His explanations of the motivations of others aren't consistent with the facts and events actually described. And the motivations that he ascribes to people are amazingly uncharitable and &quot;catty&quot;. As I read it I just had to keep going to myself &quot;miaou! &quot;.On the plus side the landscape descriptions are terrific.Unfortunately his word choices frequently seem unnecessarily obscure (is the use of 'syncope' instead of 'faint' really necessary ? ).The lack of notes by the editors frequently leave one baffled by references to minor french historical figures and events.

Some of it is boring, slow reading. Marcel, how about submitting this to an editor and whittling it down to size? We don't all have seven months to kill. But even with this serious complaint, I give this book 4 stars out of a possible 5. The characters are great. The protagonist (let's call him Marcel for argument's sake) is quite a character. His sweetheart Albertine is unforgettable. He loves her but is afraid to tell her so, fearing that if he reveals his vulnerability to her she will step all over him. But she already knows that he loves her, so he's completely off the mark. She fears that he will never forgive her for her sexual experiences, particularly for her bisexuality, and will never marry her. A marriage proposal from him would solve both of their problems and would end her days of sexual promiscuity, but Marcel blows it. When he is told that she's gone for good, in more ways than one, he is heartbroken. And yet, the funniest part of the book occurs years later when Marcel is vacationing in Europe and receives a letter bearing the signature of Albertine. By this time, Marcel is interested in another cute girl, so he tosses the Albertine letter in the garbage. After all those tears! Another hysterical and ridiculous character is Charlus, social lion and seducer - of young men. His reappearance later in the book as an old man getting tortured is pathetically funny. It reminds you of the old joke Ow! Don't! Stop! Don't stop! The recurrent theme of the book is that love is born of pain. We don't fall in love with someone until that person causes us pain or abandons us. Love is agony. Leave it to Marcel Proust to come up with that one."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"&quot;Swann's Way,&quot; like each book in the series, is pure bliss. &quot;Oh rapture,&quot; I found myself whispering, entirely entranced from the first.

Proust wrote about the relationship between characters and their experiences with memory. The entire novel is itself written memories, linked together by precise narrative and lush detail. Marcel Proust worked on this monumental epic in the late 19th century, and finished the work in the early 1920's. Think of all the events that shaped the emerging twentieth century. The Edwardian Era in England was ending, in France the Belle Epoque was ending, and World War I destroyed much of Europe. Proust wrote about the Belle Epoque, the decadent society and its morals, its stuffy and fastidious etiquette, its innocence and its corruption. Like those long novels we used to hate in English class \\"War and Peace\\" and anything by Dostovyesky, \\"Remembrance\\" is a challenging, overdone work of historid fiction. It's length, however, is worth reading because of its great themes.Swann is of course, Marcel Proust himself. He is portrayed here as a disabled man (he has very little respect from French society because he is an imsomniac and slow), but he goes through adventures in reality. Walking the streets of Paris at night, he encounters upon a mysterious, self-absorbed and fascinating courtesan named Odette. She becomes his muse, his true love, eventhough Odette is a free woman without any desire for the deeper bonds of love. The descriptions of France, both its ambiance in Paris and in the countryside of Provence, is very exceptional. The book is a time capsule.Generations from now, French novels will continue to be part of our tradition. It is something that never really goes away. If you think about it, the influence of French Impressionism and writers writing about epic events still hold strong today. They fuel romance novelists, historic fiction writers, period pieces or costume dramas in the movies, and even musicals. Moulin Rouge has definately the elements of a cliche 19th century melodrama. Remembrance Of Things Past is the greatest work of French literature, right up there with Gone With The Wind for Americans."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Before we are going to lose ourselves in superlatives, a few pointers might be in place: (1) Prousts novel had been published this side of the turning century and therefore it counts as Frances contribution to the modernist movement of the 20th century. It is not. It still belongs to the Victorian three deckers of the 19th century, in a class with Tolstoy and Eliot, the English novelist, whom Proust admired most. (2) When going through Jean-Yves Tadis monumental biography of Marcel Proust I found little evidence that Proust actually cared very much for Montaigne. Given his time and curriculum it stands to reason that Montaigne had been a must read, too familiar to fuss about. But with both, I feel the same warm hospitality oozing from the pages, just to sit down for a good gossipy read. (3) This is a French novelist, with a French education, a French perspective on things, a French sensibility, and a French delight in surrounding absolutely everything in an iridescent halo of words. And by the way! Should you ever try to read the thing in one go, make sure you have plenty of leisure. Sell your telly and dont go to the movies; keep your sex life to a minimum. And should you not speak French, you have a problem. Against all appearances, Prousts Gallic, gently malicious wit, his belle esprit is really there, but in this translation it tramples along on heavy feet. My French too is not quite up to the task of reading Proust the way he should be read, so like many I depend on Moncrieffs translation -- there is only his, in several editorial revamps, none of which has much to speak for itself. For instance we read in &Ograve;Swanns Way:&Oacute; &Ograve;... a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner like a butterfly poised upon a flower.&Oacute; This is Victorian imitation kitsch. And what did Proust write? &Ograve;... a reflection of the sunlight had made its yellow wings slip in and remained motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a folded butterfly.&Oacute; Less of cheap glitter, more sensuality. Am I nitpicking? Is this not a trifle of little consequence? Well, Im sorry, but if you really want to read Proust, this is the meat of the matter. Whatever else it might be, Prousts novel is a complete world in itself, projected and laid out in the most elaborate mosaic ever; and every little majolica shard counts. Every author creates his own pedigree, says Borges somewhere and Proust took great pains to establish a huge family tree that reaches down all the way to Rousseau and St.Augustine who provided the overall form for Prousts novel, the analytical confession. Most of us, especially in the translation, will miss out on all the little touches and mocking voice imitations of countless French authors, nobody outside of France has ever heard of. Ventriloquism is an act of comedy and this element is surely lost. Personally I think of Proust, as a great French essayist. Try to forget for a moment that the &Ograve;Recherche&Oacute; comes as a novel: we would still be left with a whole plethora of essayistic genres: character sketches, explorations into the world of plant and beast, meditations on sexuality and the nature of time, all of which could exist independently of its context. Another French, Emile Zola I believe, characterized art as &Ograve;nature seen through a temperament,&Oacute; and Proust exactly fits the description. Sometimes we heard Proust insisting that his novel had the architecture of a Gothic cathedral -- which reminds me of a heated debate we students once had, whether it was possible to build a cathedral or the pyramids like bees construct their hives. I really dont know the answer, but I suspect Prousts cathedral might support the honey-comb theory. I mean once we get to the bottom of his multi-layered technique there is not much of a story left to go anywhere. James Joyce is one of the few authors in English who received an education very similar to Marcel Prousts, and even roughly at the same time. There was not much else the two had in common, Prousts family swam comfortably on the upper end of Frances bourgeoisie, while Joyces Irish parents were most of the time broke and struggling. But by and large he of all contemporaries certainly had the credentials to pass judgement; and he characterized Prousts sentences as &Ograve;predictable.&Oacute; Geniuses alone in their rarefied atmosphere -- lesser mortals like us, are not included. I for once, rather enjoy the surprises. And of course, Proust did create real characters, as real as anybody I know in the &Ograve;real world,&Oacute; but they seem not much to be doing, except for having pleasant conversations, frequent aristocratic dinner tables, fret over their latest crush and occasionally visit the museum. Thats alright, most of us dont do much else, especially after retirement, but do we really need 3.000 pages to read about? Even Proust seems to agree that we dont, so he regales us to countless batches of his Gallic pastiches, and they are sure worth reading, though they lack the sinuous muscle of Voltaire. Proust can be flabby at times. But so did Montaigne and once you feel comfortable in your armchair, you dont really mind and just enjoy the hospitality. Ok, this might not be quite fair. Only the first two volumes had been published during Prousts own lifetime. These volumes in fact do show considerable unity and architecture. Proust was every publishers nightmare and liked to edit copiously the galley proofs, who knows what this could have done to the other 4 volumes. As it is, we see a warehouse full of fluffy stuff, wrapped in plenty of scented cotton wool.

(everything) How this po-faced humility would amuse him!"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Yes, one more review of this monster, only because I have some different views on a few of its features. But first, to reinforce what others have written, it's a tremendously satisfying read. I read it twenty years ago and am now almost finished for the second time. I picked it up again because I was so tired of flailing around looking for something worthwhile to read--with all the jillions of books out there, the number of truly rewarding ones is remarkably small.But it's amazing how different the experience is the second time around. The first time, I was so completely enchanted by the style alone, and gave my concentration to it so completely, that I missed a lot of the &quot;story&quot; (if it could be said to have one). Now I'm beginning to think that that is part of Proust's enormous joke on the reader.Here is a narrator who succeeds wonderfully in rendering every character in his story--every character, that is, except himself. Even his girlfriends--given what we now know about Proust's having modelled them after men he was obsessed with--come across as quite believable females, even if they are a bit hazy around the edges compared with, say, the vibrant and robust portrait of Robert de Saint-Loup that fairly leaps from the page. And in Mme Verdurin and Baron de Charlus he creates two of the great characters--the great people--of all literature. But he fails to create a believable person in his narrator! For despite the narrator's claims that his company is ardently and constantly sought by everyone from soldiers in their barracks to dukes and duchesses in their drawing rooms, he never--NEVER, in the course of thousands of pages--gives us one instance of his wit or charm when interacting with others. In fact, he impresses one as a rather repulsive little creep, neurotic and neurasthenic in the extreme, and rather cruel. This is not to say that he fails to be witty and charming as a narrator--far from it. First of all, there are the marvelous characters mentioned above. And if the reader can somehow weather the tedious, meticulous, seemingly endless analyses of his &quot;love&quot; for Gilberte and, even more remorselessly, for Albertine, one encounters passages of great lyric beauty, sentences that are entrancingly serpentine, metaphors stunningly original and transitions masterfully seamless."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Four-fifths of this novel takes place inside a madman's head. I don't just mean that he is a first-person narrator looking back over his life; he stays in his room, literally agonising over his lover, the captive of the title, wondering where she is, who she's with, unable to sift any kind of truth from a welter of lies, misinterpretations, suspicions, half-clues. Above all, he's terrified she's a lesbian, and sees willing accomplices everywhere. So there's more than one captive in this novel.this cramped, interior, labyrinthine novel doesn't just range on jealousy - the narrator muses on time, art, place. The governing motif is music, and there are some beautiful sections on the sounds of the street as an orchestra, the epiphanical premiere of a septet at a soiree, or Albertine playing on the pianola.For relief there is a 100-page escape from the house (and the narrator's obsessiveness), at the soiree, where we meet all our old friends, the Verdurins, Brichot, Morel, and the incomparable Charlus, heading for a terrible fall. The move from interior psychologising to observational social comedy is literally fresh air - the whole sequence is beautifully modulated between comedy and melancholy.And yet it all comes back to this madman and a woman he doesn't even really love, becuse the freedom that made him love her in the first place has been stifled by him."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Very well....I'm finally, after years of putting it off, writing a review of a work of Art that can't be reviewed in any meaningful sense of the term, a work of Art that approaches the sacred. As another reviewer puts it, if you think you have read literature with \\"depths\\" before, this opus will make ANYTHING you've ever read seem, in comparison, like one of those vapid books one picks up at airports during layovers. It is a work by which other novels, poems, paintings are to be judged rather than the other way around. In fact, after reading Proust, one can immediately tell if other \\"great writers\\" have read him almost from the start. Recent Booker Prize winning John Banville's The Sea is a good example of this.The first time I read this work, about ten years ago, it was the ONLY thing I did, so enraptured was I. For a month, all I did was lie on my bed or, alternately, on the sofa downstairs and read, putting a dash mark at the end of one of the two-page paragraphs when I had to get up to eat or to check the mail or to feed my dog or to answer the phone or to get some shuteye, and then dive back in as soon as possible. - I don't use the term \\"dive\\" lightly - That's the only metaphor that comes close to expressing what it's like to read this book. You dive in and plunge deeper and deeper than you thought any Art could ever take you and, if you make it to the end, arise out of the deep cadences of philosophical reverie that constitute Proust's spellbinding meditations on love and time to behold a world rich and strange. - Proust truly does change your life. One never really recovers from reading him.A few comments on what some of the other (serious) reviewers have said: 1) A La Recherche du Temps Perdu is not untranslatable and I don't know why exactly the English translation wasn't In Search of Lost Time instead of Remembrance of Things Past, taken, of course from the Shakespearian sonnet. But there it is. 2) I am in complete agreement with the reviewer who avers that unless you have been in love and suffered, which critic Harold Bloom remarks, commenting on Proust, means, eventually, everyone who has ever been in love, you will miss Proust's deepest apercus and regard them (as one reviewer does) as \\"silly.\\"I'm not sure what else I can say. I've probably go on too much already. If you are a true lover of Art in its highest sense, please pick up this Holy Grail of literature, even if you are intimidated, as many reviewers admit to being at first. For, as Proust says:\\"Thus, it is in states of mind destined not to last that we make the irrevocable decisions of our lives.\\"Reading Proust is one of these decisions you won't regret"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Proust's prose is unmatched in its ability to express the richness of both inner and sensory experience. Furthermore, Remembrance of Things Past (better translated as In Search of Lost Time) is full of philosophical insights of which most professional philosophers can only be envious. Proust is fascinated by the phenomenon of involuntary memory: a smell, a taste can suddenly transport an individual to the past, to the person he or she was and is no longer. The simultaneity of experience (it is always a present sense that triggers the memory) and consciousness of experience (it remains, after all, a memory) shatters the illusion of integral identity. An individual dissolves in the waves of experience that traverse through time. The English translation does an excellent job of conveying the beauty of Proust's words."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"Twenty some years ago I read these books frombeginning to end over a year's time. Proustreveals his characters' personalities, as well asthe fictional world around them, at a depth I never thoughtpossible. Ever since that time I have beensearching for a reading experience as enjoyable andmagical as this one and have yet to find it. It takes a book or soto get into the rhythm of Proust's glacial pace and metaphorically dense style. But in the end, life is long, and&quot;Remembrance,&quot; believe it or not, too short. Bythe way, I much prefer the loosely translated butpoetic &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot; to the moreaccurate but mundane &quot;In Search of Lost Time.&quot;Sorry but the latter sounds like a Jules Vernenovel!"},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"The greatness of this book in my belief is not anything having to do with the title. The French title In Search of Lost Time refers to Marcel's endeavor to recapture a lost past. Strictly speaking all great fiction does this. Proust's memory does prove important but it is not his theory of perfectly recapturing the past which makes for a sumptuous read but his effort to do so which is quite a different thing. Proust reimagines things in a way they could not possibly have occurred. He imagines a thing in the way a child dreams a thing. The fact is that a child usually finds his imaginings are far better than anything the world suggests. Proust chose to believe differently and thats fine with me because what he imagines his past to have been like is something I believe no one has ever lived. To my ears his theory of recapturing time is just a necessary illusion for creating great fiction. And he does that. The first book of this multi volume set is the story of Swanns love affair with Odette told in such a way that we all know that this is a modern fiction writer who is writing a modern piece of fiction with as much self consciousness as Manet had when he painted Luncheon on the Grass. Later in this grand and intricately woven set of novellas we find Marcel at the Opera. And we find him enjoying this Opera in the way only a Flaubertian student of fiction enjoys fiction. Don't be fooled but don't miss the pleasures afforded in time spent here. This was the decadent era after all and authors were given free reign to invent. He writes like a Prince. Of that you need no proof of lineage. Buy this because nothing else like it exists. It is a document, though forged by a romanticist, of turn of the century France. Everything here is superbly written and entirely fake. Why do people write fiction? To make things right in the second draft."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"The greatest masterpiece of our century. Nobody will NEVER write anything similar. It's a celebration of senses, memory and life; it's misterious and sarcastic; it's amazingly beautiful and sometimes sadly cruel. It simply changed my life, nothing's the same since I read this book. Now the Duchess of Guermantes, Charlus, Odette, Swann and the others are a part of my life, just as my family or my friends. Thanks God, Proust was born and decided to become a writer."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"If you've read the first four volumes of the Penguin Modern Classic, Proust's In Search of Lost Time, then don't let the publication restriction in the US stop you from buying the British text versions. Except for minor presentation, they are exactly the same that will be published in the US when the copyrights expire. The only differences (which are hardly a great obstacle to the enjoyment of reading the novel), are the footnotes in back and the original French lyrics which Proust occasionally quotes from in the body of the work -- apparently the British assume we colonial philistines do not know as much French as they do.The introduction to The Fugitive I found hugely welcome -- British translator Carol Clark is unapologetically direct in summing up for us what the previous 4 volumes have been about -- a long wished for insight as I have been dying to know up to this point whether or not I have been truly getting Proust all along.The curse and the blessing is that Proust died before he could give the final sign off on these manuscripts before publication. A curse because he most certainly would have removed or resolved many errors, and extended or rewritten many parts which are its weakest sections. A blessing in that, to be sure, there are in this and the next volume several obvious errors which a good copy editor would have detected and eliminated, but with time have become such a part of Proustian lore that they can no more be removed than say Jimmy Durante's nose shortened or Richard Burton's pockmarks removed or Marilyn Manson's makeup wiped clean.And if one has lasted this long, the addiction to Proust's peregrinations from the plot to discuss seemingly unrelated topics and issues in minute detail - as seen from the other end of binoculars, as Roger Shattuck writes in Proust's Binoculars- one will not be at all bothered about any perceived sloppiness in these last two volumes. On the contrary, one will feel proud to detect them for oneself, and have a private chuckle about it as Proust is forgiven for what would be unacceptable by today's publishing standards.SO don't wait four more years - you'll not care by then or have forgotten much of the threads of the protean plot which keeps all volumes tied into one - for most of what is written in these last volumes is the rich reward the reader deserves after having hung in there until the end, to discover the final fate and full identities of all the rich and lively characters we have come to love - Charlus and St Loup, Albertine and Gilberte, oh, and Mme Potbus' maid - remember her?The Prisoner and the Fugitive translated by Carol ClarkQuick summary: This is almost a novel within the novel as it deals in two parts with the final resolution of the narrator's relationship to Albertine, this character who, more so than any other, the narrator has kept directly from the reader's curious view and desire to know her in her own voice.Finding Time Again translated by Ian PattersonThe fates of the rest of the characters are revealed, and the narrator in this last volume himself ages (or catches up to the age at which he began telling this long story -- and we will learn why he had to write it all before his death, as the line between fiction and reality between Marcel the narrator and Marcel the famed French writer nearly disappears). This is the volume where, winding down at last from what was always a nebulous plot to one last social scene,like a curtain call, all the characters take their final bows together in old age (either still alive or in the narrator's memory of them). And there are some great surprises left to discover, which hopefully too much reading of Proustian criticism, biographies, and reviews hasn't already revealed to the \`well informed but too reluctant to read A la Recherch&eacute; du Temps Perdu for themselves' lover of literature."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I have been told that the Viking editions of the 5th and 6th volumes of the Proust series cannot be published in America for at least 12 years due to copyright issues. So you may want to snap these up.None the less, these are excellent books and I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"The Captive (Remembrance of Things Past, 9)","review":"I am trapped somewhere in the first half of this chef d'ouevre and I don't think I'll live another book quite the same way. It took a few hundred pages to get into the paragraph-long sentences about flowers, but presently I am smelling hawthornes, chrysanthemums, and the notorious *cattleyas*. I am also marking my pages with flower petals, it is truly like a waltz of garden, this book!Another added feature of this edition is the addendum and synopsis at the end of each volume, which allows you to find your location in Proust's frequently dense folliage. The translation is also good; I anticipate reading the French version, and this makes good practice. There are no words worthy of describing Proust, except the million and a half in this text."},{"Title":"New Plays from the Abbey Theatre: 1996-1998 (Irish Studies)","review":"Okay. I am slightly biased in my review of this book, for reasons which will become clear later on. First off, it should be said that it looks great; glossy and well-manufactured, on acid-free paper, it will last a good long while (though don't put it in your windowsill - I put my copy of the first volume there and it's paled noticeably.)Judy Friel's short essay on Patrick Mason's tenure as artistic director of Ireland's national theatre is very good about Mason's sense of historical mission. He opened the theatre up to younger writers and actors, giving lucrative and welcome jobs to the many talented people that had arisen from the fringe theatre scene that exploded in Dublin in the early 90s. He also brought plays such as &quot;Angels in America&quot; to an audience that might never otherwise have seen them. (Not many saw &quot;Angels&quot; - scared off by the rumour of Gay People On Stage, they stayed away in droves and it bombed, which was a shame as it was a fine production, albeit only of Part 1.)Michael Harding is an Abbey regular and &quot;Sour Grapes&quot; is his jaundiced look at the modern priesthood. Not entirely unexpectedly, he finds it riddled with cynicism, abuse of power and faithlessness. The play was intensely topical, because at the time it went on, the country was swamped with revelations (sic) about sexual abuse in the clergy. I find Harding's tone a bit dour and depressed, but there's no doubting the power of the piece, and it certainly reflects a changing attitude in Ireland towards the Catholic church.Thomas Kilroy's &quot;The Secret Fall of Constance Wilde&quot; is an elegant meditation on the marriage of Oscar and Constance. It's a bit of a shadowplay, highly stylised, with masked puppetteers manipulating all the bit parts - the only speaking characters are Ozzie, his lady wife and his nemesis Lord Alfred Douglas, a handsome devil but by all accounts a truly appalling human being. (A recent biographer thought differently, but then said biographer was only 21 when the biography in question was published, so me may forgive him his youthful...well, ignorance.) Kilroy's conclusion is that Constance was a woman well and truly wronged, and it's hard to argue with that, although I don't know if this piece has the richness and conviction of some of his earlier work.Alex Johnston's &quot;Melonfarmer&quot; is a sprawling monster of a piece that goes on much too long, but then it's a first play. (That's no excuse, mind.) I think the author spends a little too much time showing off his neat ear for the evasions and ellipses of youthful speech patterns, but there's a basic emotional honesty and a certain beady-eyed unsentimentality that readers may find refreshing. It has some moments of completely bizarre humour and an extremely nasty scene involving a bullet in the foot, both of which were thoroughly up my artistic street. If this writer worked a bit more on his stagecraft, he could get somewhere. I liked it a lot, but then, like I said at the top, I'm biased, cause - I wrote it.Lastly, Marina Carr's &quot;By the Bog of Cats&quot; is a truly weird, slightly kitschy attempt to rewrite the Medea story as a domestic tragedy set in the Irish Midlands. This would be a great idea, except that Carr goes on to mess it up with a lot of musty sub-Yeatsian symbolism (black swans, ghosts, bogs) and a plot that is so plotted that you only really need to see the first scene to guess how it's all going to work out. But then, this kind of thing is just not for me. Carr is one of Ireland's leading playwrights, but the ends to which she uses her great gifts are getting increasingly obscure to me.Anyway, I thought it might be interesting to have one of the writers review the book. All of these plays are eminently stageable, but I'll bet there's not a theatre out there that would want to do every one of them - except the Abbey, bless it."},{"Title":"New Plays from the Abbey Theatre: 1996-1998 (Irish Studies)","review":"NEW PLAYS FROM THE ABBEY THEATRE, Vol. 2, 1996-1998 is a welcome offering from editors Judy Friel and Sanford Sternlicht and from Syracuse University Press. Ms. Friel is a native of Derry, an alumnus of Trinity College, Dublin, and currently the literary manager of Ireland's National Theatre. Mr. Sternlicht is a professor of English at Syracuse University who also teaches Modern Irish Drama each summer at Trinity College. He has written extensively about English and Irish writers, and has many works in print, including A READER'S GUIDE TO MODERN IRISH DRAMA.In NEW PLAYS... Vol. 2, the editors have provided a brief but informative introduction to modern Irish theatre. Ms. Friel gives an account of the revitalization of the National Theatre of Ireland in the 1990's by its artistic director, Patrick Mason, who examined the direction of the institution and returned it to its roots (those established by earlier Irish writers such as Yeats, J.M. Synge, and Lady Gregory), focusing on the responsibility of the Abbey Theatre to its Irish playwrights, who(to quote Yeats),&quot;bring to the stage the deeper thoughts and emotions of Ireland.&quot;The book contains complete plays by four of Ireland's greatest modern playwrights - in this volume they are Michael Harding (SOUR GRAPES),Thomas Kilroy (THE SECRET FALL OF CONSTANCE WILDE), Alex Johnston (MELONFARMERS), and Marina Carr (BY THE BOG OF CATS). Mr. Sternlicht provides concise biographical information on each playwright as well as a brief overview of each of their plays. The copyright and contact information for performance rights is listed on the last page.SOUR GRAPES (Harding) is a fascinating but very sad play about pedophilia, homosexuality and the abuse of power in a Roman Catholic seminary setting, and how it drives a young seminarian to suicide. The young man's case is defended by a sympathetic priest, but the priest, not adept at investigation on a good day, is thwarted by all the other priests in the play including the Bishop and the Canon. The reader is forced to think about the effects of enforced celibacy, and the unholy attitudes/actions of most of the clergy are upsetting. The play jumps around a good deal in a sort of Joycean style. Its realism is jarring(but not surprising, as Harding is a former Catholic preist). The plays powerful statements leaves this reader feeling rather beaten down and exhausted. It certainly speaks to modern issues.THE SECRET FALL OF CONSTANCE WILDE (Kilroy), written by one of Ireland's most distinguished writers is a sensitive historical accounting of the tragic downfall of Oscar Wilde and his wife, Constance. She is brought out from beneath the shadow of her famous and brilliant husband, and the play clearly elucidates her grief -- over her own past (suggestions of abuse at the hands of her father); over her loss of Oscar to his lover, the cruel and unstable Lord Alfred Douglas; over Oscar's very public prison sentence and her own fall in society's eyes; over her own torment at keeping their own two children away from Oscar, who desperately wants contact with them. She died at age 40, a broken shell, and Oscar followed her in death two years after. The play is presented with a chorus of attendants, Greek-style, and with some scenes including puppetry and some Kabuki effects, as in Noh theatre. It is relentlessly honest in its portrayal of the love triangle, the ambiguities of sexual identity, and the pain caused when families are broken. It is a sad but very moving work.MELONFARMER (Johnston) is not at all about melon farmers. It is a cinema-verite look at 1990's life in urban Ireland for eight young adults, all trying to find their way in our faster-than-light, information-drenched world. They are negotiating as best they can the new sexuality, the loosening hold of the Church and the old traditional values .. and getting by in life as best they can, which sometimes means just getting by. Sean Spencer, the central character, a would-be comedian, gradually descends into drink and depression. The play is fast-paced, and has moments of hilarity. The opening had me laughing out loud. The play is tragicomic, like life. Playwright Alex Johnston is the grandson of the O'Casey-era Denis Johnston,and his talent shines through every scene. As in the other plays presented in this book, the realism is gritty and in-your-face.It stays with you. As Sternlicht states, it's a revelation to a middle-class, middle aged reader such as myself. [Note: the script presented is the 1997 original version for the Peacock Theatre. It has since been revised for a 2000 production, and the latter is the definitive version, per the playwright.]Last, but not least at all, is BY THE BOG OF CATS (Carr). Ms. Carr is Ireland's leading woman playwright, and a most successful one. After reading her play, I am not surprised. Its power was so strong as to be assaulting. I was horrified by the plot and the bloodiness, but mesmerized despite myself, and I quite literally could not put it down without finishing it.I can only imagine how powerful this would be on stage, after having it jump off the page at me from a book! It gives you chills. I don't want to give the story away. I will say that it is as strong as a Greek tragedy, and is written that way. But the characters are so real!This is a most welcome addition to the study of Irish theatre."},{"Title":"I Love Animals : Wild, Scary, Cute or Cuddly, We Love Them All!","review":"This book has lots of big colorful pictures of various animals from around the world.

What is it that makes it truly extraordinary?Lucidity, clarity, and topical broadness make this work particularly impressive. Though it looks like a standard college freshman text, it doesn't read that way. You're not likely to read it cover to cover like a novel, but it's perfect for grabbing off the shelf after having watched that jingoistic Hollywood production of American history, or as a primer for indulging in more penetrating American history scholarship.It's not perfect. The regional sympathies of the primary author (Morison) are revealed from time to time. This book belongs to the Plymouth Rock School of history--the branch that teaches that everything lasting and good in American history came to New England around 1620, after St. Augustine, after Roanoke, after Jamestown. The 1840 map of the United States given on pg. 447 makes a gross error in misrepresenting the population of New Orleans, third largest city in the country at the time. Something tells me that Boston or Philadelphia would have never been overlooked in such a case.

Pick it up any time you need some perspective on events troublesome or puzzling in American public life. You will not be disappointed.

I found these books to be more interesting and easier to enjoy than the general textbook. They go more in depth and offer a greater understanding.

Anyway, they're good books - ROCK ON COMMAGER!"},{"Title":"The Growth of the American Republic","review":"There are two volumes of this and both are very large but worth the read. Both volumes have been reprinted over and over again and has stood the test of time. It was originally published in the 1930s. It is textbook-like, however, it contains SO MUCH information. It is a great resource for historians, history buffs, and people who are interested in American history. It is a highly regarded book by many and it contains almost anything you wanted to know. The first volume deals with the early years of the republic up to about 1865. The second volume starts from 1865 to what we now know as modern america. There are pictures, graphs, a bibliography and appendixes. Like I said before, this is a great resource and a really nice addition to any collection. I really enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Dialogue with an Atheist","review":"Excellent book for introduction to islam..

Although there are many biographies about this wonderful human being, this book is the closest one that can answer the questions that all Anne Frank fan has. I did for many years just read the Diary over and over but I wanted more! This book is definetly more! It tells you more about the relationship she had with her family and the rest of the people in hiding. This is a girl who could hardly see the light coming from her window and the only green thing that she could think about was a huge chestnut outside the Annex. This book describes this little things that she cherished and that she no longer had....her freedom. She didn't either had freedom of speach inside the Annex due to the critics about her attitude. This book develops more information about why Anne acted like she did and why she had an open opinion about everything. It also gives you a bigger idea of why she didn't like her mother and develops more about her childhood around her family and her friends. I hope all readers that enjoy the Anne Frank writings will enjoy this description about her persona. Is a total different thing to read her diary knowing more about her life and early aspirations. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Anne Frank: Life in Hiding","review":"I came upon this book at a used bookstore and immediately snapped it up! I love Anne Frank'sThe Diary of a Young Girland for the last two decades have been collecting any book that I can find about Anne's writing, her life, and the Holocaust. This book provides some insights into Anne Frank's life, but it's more suited for young readers ages 7-12.There are some illustrations throughout the book by artist Vera Rosenberry. This should prove interesting to young children who like visuals to go along with the text. The author, Johanna Hurwitz has written in a style that makes this biography easily accessible to young readers and the book itself only numbers about 53 pages in length with some additional pages covering important dates, the author's note, and an index.The book provides some brief facts about Anne's life with her family prior to the Second World War, but the majority of the biography focuses on Anne's life whilst in hiding, and explores her feelings at being cooped up in a constricted space with the other Jews and her yearnings for the open space and a chance to life a normal life and realize her dreams. It also briefly covers the period after the group's arrest and how Anne and her family are first sent to Westerbork, a transit camp before being sent to Auschwitz and finally, Anne and Margot's transport to Bergen-Belsen, where both sisters died before liberation. The significance of Anne's diary is also covered here. In all, this makes a good introduction to Anne for elementary school children."},{"Title":"Anne Frank: Life in Hiding","review":"The summary on this book is this is a book about Anne Frank.

It tells how Anne was a very energetic girl who had fun with friends and was very social. However, it also describes how hard life was for her, being Jewish, going into hiding and being captured and being transported to different concentration camps. Anne was born on June 12, 1929 in Frankfurt Germany. During her time in hiding she kept all her secret thoughts in a diary that her mother and father (Edith and Otto Frank) gave to her the day she turned 13(June 12, 1942). Anne had a very strong bond with her father and sister (Margot) but not as strong with her mother but she still loved her dearly. This is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested about Anne Frank."},{"Title":"Anne Frank: Life in Hiding","review":"This book is magical, because it shows you and makes you feel like you are the scene. It made me think how hard it would be to live like a young Jewish girl called Anne Frank living a life with guns being shot and having to move so much.I can not imagine living like Anne that can only go to shops that have the Jewish signs, and not much of the stores had them. Anne was very brave to put up with this stuff every day. She is unbelievable, she was a great person. You should read this book because it can give you information and show how lucky we are that we have freedom to go anywhere we want to go.I had a lot of fun reading this book and it showed me how lucky I am to be here in the United States.

However, I felt this book is more down-to-earth and real than One Child. To tell you the truth, I felt One Child was like a fairy tale. In One Child, Ms. Hayden was a god-send teacher, with superhuman patience and love. Although the book was very captivating, I was not able to feel strong affinities with her. However, in Tiger's Child, we are able to glimpse her shortcomings and all. I respect her for being so open and straightforward in telling about Sheila and herself.

But it was still worth reading to find out what happens to Sheila, and to spend some more time with her."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Child (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"In \\"One Child,\\" Hayden first told the story of Sheila, a seriously abused, violent six-year-old who was placed in her special ed classroom as she awaited placement in a state mental hospital for setting a younger child on fire.Although just about everyone else -- including her own alcoholic father -- had given up on Sheila, Hayden realized the little girl was keenly intelligent. Doggedly, she began testing and teaching Sheila, all the while showing her patience, love and understanding. And despite the occasional setback, within months, Sheila was an entirely different child.Then the school year ended, Hayden took a different job out of state, and she lost touch with Sheila. Despite searching for her former student, Hayden was unable to connect -- until a coincidence reunited the two when Sheila was 13. Hayden was ecstatic -- and Sheila claimed not to remember the time they'd spent together.Undeterred, Hayden persisted, inviting Sheila to help out with a summer program for disturbed children she and another clinician were running. Soon the bond they'd once had seemed resurrected. Yet each time Torey and Sheila's friendship seemed to be going smoothly, something happened to test it fiercely -- interference from Sheila's father, or a facet of Sheila's own unpredictable adolescent persona. Despite her best intentions, Hayden often wondered why she persisted -- was there any point? Was she hurting Sheila more than she helped?Hayden's experiences with Sheila and her other students serve as complex and engrossing material for this book, a simple yet realistic portrait of the world's ugliness -- and the few, stubborn individuals who are determined to make a difference in others' lives."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Child (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a follow up of One Child, I could not put this down.

If you read \\"One Child,\\" then you must read this one!Karen Arlettaz Zemek, author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\""},{"Title":"The Tiger's Child (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I first read One Child when I was thirteen, and it was a powerful force in my life, impacting me more deeply than any other story I have ever read. I related somewhat at thirteen to her life at six, and have read the book millions of times since, always wondering what became of Sheila and what her life might be like now. So when I discovered this sequal yesterday, it was like a goldmine. My biggest emotional reaction was deep sorrow, because One Child WAS like a fairy tale that had led us to believe that Sheila would probably be all right now that Torey had given her the wings to fly. But reality tended to beat Sheila up one side and down the other like a spiked club, and she no longer had anyone to help her through it. I look at Sheila as having lived her life very much alone with the exception of the five months in Torey's classroom in Marysville. Is five months really enough to build a sturdy enough platform for this kid? All kids need constant care and attention; kids in healthy households living comparatively idyllic lives still clamor for more and more attention, love and care. Six is not really big enough to take on the world and conquer it and all its horrors alone, it is barely big enough to tie one's own shoes and remember where your mittens are! I can completely see Sheila's point when she accused Torey of offering her a world full of color and warmth and then sweeping it all away. Sheila was abused before Torey came, while Torey was there, and after she left. Torey's subsequent disappointment at finding this relatively human teenager, including dyed hair and common teenish speech patterns, is naive on her part. What did she expect? She hadn't been there; when Sheila was being abused and shifting around in foster homes, where was Torey, and what right did she have to judge Sheila now, at a still-tender thirteen? What right did she have to expect ANYTHING? Sure, it appears as if Torey is this wonderful goddess-type teacher that goes the 800 extra miles for Sheila, but Torey had never had to deal with Sheila's life on a day-to-day basis, could have no idea. The real hero is Sheila, who IS a survivor, who did remarkably well with herself considering she's sprung from horrors most of us can hardly imagine experiencing ourselves. She shouldn't have to feel grateful for what Torey's done for her; as a child, it was the least she could expect from somebody. It is Sheila who created herself, and what an extraordinary person."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Child (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Having read One Child over and over and over again starting at the age of ten, I was euphoric to come upon The Tiger's Child in a bookstore 15 years later. I had wondered about Sheila my whole life, worked for several years in a preschool in great part due to that astonishing tale. I believe all the magic that was in the first book, because that is the truth about the reality of children. The Tiger's Child was somehow more sad, even if in much subtler & less horrifying ways than the first book. Sheila had left her childhood, and Torey L. Hayden (who was just 24 in the first book!) was not in a position to help her to quite the extent that she had been able to in the earlier years. Torey L. Hayden writes very honestly and does not attempt to soften any of the difficulties in this later period. Her work as a teacher is remarkable & awe-inspiring... I just wish that somehow the world had continued to provide for Sheila as much as Torey had been able to in One Child. I ache that the extraordinary, brilliant light that was Sheila was not left with as purely a happpy ending as the first book leads us to believe is possible...but I strongly recommend reading both stories."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Child (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Normally, I do not buy hardcover books. I wait until they are released in paperback or become available at the library. But when I saw the sequel to one of my all time favorite books, \\"One Child\\", at the bookstore right after its' release, I snatched it up immediately and ran to the cash register! That night I read the whole book from start to finish without stopping. For years I had wondered what became of Sheila after Torey's last glimpse of her through the school bus window, and now that I had the answer in my hands I could not put it down. It was heartbreaking to learn that the happiness and love that Sheila discovered in Torey's classroom did not last after she left. However, the story of she survived despite her many hardships, even finding some of that happiness again when she and Torey were reunited, was fascinating and often tearjerking. I have read and loved all of Torey Hayden's books. This is one of the best.

I was not disappointed. I found that Sheila had carried a great deal of anger around with her all these years toward Torey for \\"showing her the good life and then deserting her just like her mother had.\\" This rather dumb-founded Torey, because she was just doing what all teachers do at the end of a school year--saying good-bye to her students and moving on. Torey had to work very hard in this book to build up a trust level again. Sheila was not going to make this easy. However, the ending was satisfying; and we are left knowing that Sheila will be all right. I don't know how Torey makes her writing such compelling reading.

Her words are so well-chosen and that made this book easy to read and follow, yet the story itself carried my emotions on a roller-coaster ride that was certainly worth the price of the ticket!Just as ONE CHILD left me wanting to know more, years ago, THE TIGER'S CHILD answered many old questions, yet still left me wanting to know more about how Sheila fairs throughout her lifetime!I highly recommend reading this book, either as the sequel to ONE CHILD or even as a stand-alone book!"},{"Title":"The Tiger's Child (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is the sequel to &quot;One Child.&quot; Both Torey Hayden and former pupil Sheila are pioneers who did indeed blaze a trail towards higher standards in special needs education and general acceptance.For several years, author Torey Hayden made good faith efforts to locate her former pupil, Sheila. They do reconnect after a series of &quot;lucky flukes&quot; some seven years later. Sheila, then in middle school has more or less discarded any memory of her past; she is contending with living in a different town and is coping with her father, with whom she seems to have a better relationship. In &quot;One Child,&quot; readers are made aware that both father and daughter had been wronged by the Social Services system. This book helps readers to see how they survived the bureaucracy and made the best with what they had at the time.Torey Hayden opens new doors for Sheila; she even recommends Sheila for a job in the clinic where she works one summer. Sheila bonds with a young boy there because both share a common history of maternal abandonment. The relationship between former pupil and teacher is certainly a roller-coaster ride; Sheila, now in the &quot;terrible teens&quot; is clearly feeling her way out towards independence and self identity. She expresses these feelings eloquently and in action; she dyes her hair extreme colors and puts together exotic outfits.Over time, as Sheila matures and contends with bad placements and more moves, she is able to come to terms with her past.

She should have reported the sexual abuse of Sheila to the authorities there and then, the Uncle with the knife for example. Any human would report this to the social work department, never mind a qualifed Special Needs Teacher ????Miss Hayden seems to think that Sheila and the world owe her something. As far as I can see Miss Hayden is not wanted by Sheila or her father in Tiger's Child, who can blame Sheila, Miss Hayden showed her the light and then left the state ! Leaving Sheila in danger.

Tiger's Child was invaluable in that it allowed Sheila to interpret her earlier behaviors to the readers of One Child. I've been fostering and have adopted several abused children. I think this should be required reading for social work students, foster parents, and adoptive parents of older children. Sheila is a remarkable survivor, the exception, not the rule with these children. One reviewer mentioned that Sheila didn't turn out the way Torey expected. If Sheila was functional at all, she turned out better than most with such histories. A testimony to this child's intelligence and tenacity for life against the ruthless odds of abandonment and rejection."},{"Title":"The Tiger's Child (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I've read the last book of Torey Hayden, Tiger's child.

I have been a little bit disappointed by what Sheila has become. At the end of One Child, I was expecting a great life for her.

A talented writer, Hayden boldly portrays the harsh realities of what happens to so many of our children, abused at an early age. Sheila didn't turn out the way Torey wanted, but she found herself and found a little peace along the way. Most of the children in Hayden's stories are young. This was an awesome portrayal of adolescence mixed with the results of early childhood abuse.

All grammatic points are well explained. From a short introduction on the history of the language till complex grammar structures. The use of the International Phonetic Alphabet helps a lot in the pronounciation (if you don't have acces to a native speaker). It's topics are not boring as many grammar books are, and although it is written in a very academical way, you'll be delighted to learn with the help of a direct, communicative and fun methodology."},{"Title":"Standard Albanian: A Reference Grammar for Students","review":"This book is hard to find and is a rather large item. (It's better to photocopy it in reduction and travel with the photocopy). It's more like a reference grammar rather than something which teaches early learners. I personally found the many examples of complex sentences useful. Serious students of Albanian should go through it."},{"Title":"Sharks Are Caught At Night.","review":"I first read this in High School because I was captivated by shark fishing at the time. It is really much more than that as the author relates his experiences with the many interesting characters he encounters. I recommend it partly because of this but also because of the 50s style and topic, almost certainly enhanced by the English translation of a French text."},{"Title":"The Marquis de La Fayette in the American revolution: With some account of the attitude of France toward the war of independence","review":"Gilbert de Motier de Lafayette, in honor of whom our National Guard is named, was truly the first knight of America, pure-hearted, and altruistic. This book chronicles the beloved \\"adopted\\" son of George Washington, who at 19 barely escaped arrest by King Louis XVI to come to fight for our cause. He was the key link in securing French aid that made the critical difference in our victory at Yorktown. Read how Washington had implicit trust in his talents as a great general charging him with cornering Lord Cornwallis in the southern campaign of the Rev War, with the future of our country at stake. The book clearly states Lafayette's role. A friend of Alexander Hamilton, Lafayette gave his fortune, his valor and his heart to the cause of our freedom not as a Frenchman, but as an American General. Read how he commanded with love and the example of his own leadership. Allow me to further enhance the value of Lafayette to our American heritage that the book omits, but is well detailed in Harlow Giles Unger's \\"Lafayette\\", which I recommend as a companion book. (Available on Amazon.com) Unger brings to live endearing stories that illuminate the personality of Lafayette and his value to America. While this book gives other specific accounts not detailed by Unger, especially the political dynamics of the time, Unger provides other details not covered in the writing style of Tower, typical of his time.( Eg.Upon Lafayette's visit to America in 1824, thousands of people thronged the streets to see him. Arches were built in the then 24 states and banquets were given in his honor; his picture was printed on everything from dishes, ladies gloves, arm bands and money. Upon his death America mourned him more than Washington, for more than a month officially. John Quincy Adams gave a 3-hour eulogy to a black-draped Congress, comparing Lafayette's pure heart to being a little below the angels.) Childhood heroics and teen-age antics and disdain for the frivalty of the French courts add to Lafayette's charm in Unger's book, as well as his military savvy and ingenuity, but again,this was not the style of wrting in Towers'day,yet Tower gives other insightful accounts and is held to be a valuable author. I most highly recommend this book for the serious reader, as well as the reader looking for an over-all view of Lafayette's time in America(not going back to Lafayette's formative years in France.) I have many books on Lafayette, and consider this a very valuable asset.Lafayette's importance in our history and therefore why this book is beneficial,is reflected in the fact that the ship on which Lafayette returned to America with French aid, the Hermione,is being reconstructed in France and is scheduled to sail to America in 2012. Ask yourself why over 600 America schools, organizations, cities, streets, counties etc. in America are named for Lafayette.(Eg. Lafayette College, The American Friends of Lafayette, the Massachusetts Lafayette Society.) This book will illuminate the fact that the name of Lafayette should be near and dear to our hearts and lips as is the name of George Washington, whose reputed stoic heart was won over by the endearing Lafayette. Together with Unger's book you will feel great American pride in claiming Lafayette as a founding father and an American treasure."},{"Title":"The Marquis de La Fayette in the American revolution: With some account of the attitude of France toward the war of independence","review":"I have the original two volume 1895 edition of this work. And of course, like all books published then, the overall quality of the book is terrific. Not the cheap quality of hardbacks we get today. Anyway, the work itself is superb. The author got access to never before seen letters of LaFayette and the French foreign minister ( the Compte deVergenes) and others in the French government. Fortunately, voluminous amounts of correspondence had been saved and the author has written a gripping account of the lead-up to the french involvement in the war and especially that of LaFayette and other French soldiers. The correspondence between Washington and the French generals (LaFayette, d'Estaing, DeGrasse, etc) is wonderful as it shows the level of intimacy and mutual respect they had for each other. Also what is revealed in this book is a level of commitment by the french government under Louis XVI that was far greater than I imagined. And I've read a great deal on this subject. This set should be required for anyone interested in this period of history and especially those who dismiss French contributions as insignificant. It was FAR from insignificant."},{"Title":"Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860","review":"Prior to the War for Southern Independence, the South had its own great debate. The secession debate in Georgia was probably more important than the Lincoln-Douglas debates of a few years before; without Georgia, it is likely that the Confederate States of America would never have been formed and the War for Southern Independence would never have happened.Collected here are the speeches of the particulars, both secessionist and Unionist Georgians. All the speeches are fascinating and enlightening, particularly the Unionist speech of Alexander Stephens, as cogent and impressive a declaration of conservative principles as has ever been written or uttered by anyone. This book is worth buying for that speech alone."},{"Title":"Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860","review":"With Georgia attempting to determine what type of flag reflects the state's soul, Freehling and Simpson's &quot;Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860&quot; would be a valuable resource to every Georgian citizen. The book contains speeches and letters from individuals on both sides of the secessionist battle, after the Lincoln election. Each speech or letter is given in its entirety, with useful footnotes to explain now obscure terms or allusions. The editors also provide short biographies of the protagonists (which in some cases could have been longer). Pictures of the various authors would also have been appreciated.The book is highly recommended. Indeed, it should be read by all Georgians prior to selecting a new flag design, lest they find themselves with symbols that reflect the worst of the state's history, instead of its best."},{"Title":"Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860","review":"Freehling is a scholar with a track record on the history of secession, having written a history of South Carolina's Nullification Controversy. His thesis then was that nullification was the start of the secessionist movement.However this book does NOT repeat that thesis, but is a re-printing of speeches given by Unionist and secessionist Georgians at a convention called to debate secession (before Lincoln's inauguration). The historical background and biographies of the speakers are provided. This may well change your viewpoint on what motivated secession. At least it will add to your knowledge of politics of the period.Valuable stuff: primary sources!"},{"Title":"Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860","review":"Anyone who has read antebellum American history needs only to notice the editors of this book to see the necessity of having it and reading it. Prof. Freehling and Professor Simpson are the brightest of the stars in the history galaxy. The book brings together the unioonists and Secessionists in one short volume. The speeches are not abreviated by the editors, and are for sure a good reason for having this book. It will introduce the casual reader to the great thinkers of the separation movement in the South. We owe these two scholars a great deal for this work."},{"Title":"Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860","review":"Messrs. Freehling and Simpson are to be commended for taking time out from their productive academic writing careers to produce this edition of valuable primary sources. I've had good luck assigning this text to undergraduate students at an elite university, and I think that laymen with general knowledge of the period will find that this book disproves some of the common notions about secession's causes. If you care about the War of Northern Aggression, this one's for you!"},{"Title":"Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860","review":"I'd urge all those interested in learning more about the cause(s) of the Civil War to get this book. A terrific read."},{"Title":"Secession Debated: Georgia's Showdown in 1860","review":"Secession Debated should be rquired reading for everyone, starting in high school. The book is a collection of seven speeches and public letters given or published during the Georgia secession debates in November, 1860. Like Virginia, Georgia was a pivotal state. South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida and Loiusiana were pretty much givens when it came to secession. Had Georgia not seceded, the Deep South states would have been divided geographically, making the ultimate success of the secessionists much less viable. The speeches are approximations of the actual speeches, since there were no verbatim transcripts, often relying on newspaper accounts. Some participants preferred not to speak, but instead submitted letters. The final letter was actually printed a month later after the legislative debates had ended. The content of the secessionists arguments is enlightening. Ninety percent of the arguments are justifications for the Southern way of life -- slavery. States rights are of course part of the argument, but what is the state right that they are seeking to uphold -- the then constitutional right to own human chattel. Tariffs and the maritime laws get a brief mention, but are clearly secondary to slavery as the issue that brought about the need to secede. The secessionists argued for immediate secession by legislative vote. The cons to this argument strongly affirmed the right of southerners to own slaves in perpetuity and the right of secession, but argued that such an extreme step was premature and/or needed to be put to a vote of the people. There was no argument that slavery was archaic or immoral. Perhaps the most prescient argument comes in the final chapter, a letter written by Joseph E. Brown, later governor of Georgia. Brown pretty much accurately describes the sharecropping and tenant farming system that grew up in the South after the war. The notes by the editors provide a prelude that provides the background of each speaker and a postscript that describes the subsequent life of the speaker, a number of whom died or suffered significant wounds in the coming war. I highly recommend this book as a primary source for anyone who wants to understand the background of the war as opposed to the myth of the Lost Cause."},{"Title":"Learnables Hebrew Level 1 Listening Book & CD","review":"I just finished this course and am thoroughly impressed by it. I have used many other language learning programs and listening comprehension was always my weakest skill. The Learnables focuses on listening comprehension and teaches it step by step in a manner that is easy, stress-free, and builds confidence in your progress.I initially became interested in the Learnables series because I had learned that its methodology was based on significant scholarly research into the most effective means of learning languages (the creator of the program was a research professor of Speech Science and Psychology at the University of Missouri). It is a deceptively simple program that differs significantly from most other language programs which are not based on a scientifically verified methodology. Rather than repeating and memorizing words and phrases, you hear words and phrases in Hebrew and look at pictures which clearly illustrate the meaning. It is a complete immersion process in which everything is in Hebrew - no English. By this process, the language is internalized, one learns to begin thinking in Hebrew, and a solid foundation is laid upon which one can grow towards fluency.I already have the next book in the seriesHebrew Learnables & Basic Structures Level 1coming in the mail and am excited about digging into it soon!NOTE: as a warning - when buying this product from one of the Amazon sellers, make sure it comes with the corresponding audio CDs. The product is useless without them.

I read it in one night!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Success Secrets of Super Achievers","review":"Success Secrets of Super Achievers by Jim StovallUnlike most books that touch on the 'success secrets' or 'the ultimate success formula' (USF), this book takes a seemingly broad-based & light-hearted approach to the subject. Best of all, it doesn't pin down to a specific formula but rather chooses to give readers an opportunity to explore diverse perspectives.To cap his clever approach, the author even draws on the candid viewpoints of a relatively disparate sampling of ordinary people who have lived or are living great lives, with goals, vision & passion - 82 of them to be exact, widely known & admired in movie entertainment, music, politics & law, business, sports & even religion. A lot of these people, to my surprise, are not the traditionally rich & famous but, as the author puts it, these people have been \\"to the mountaintop\\" in their respective field.As an award-winning broadcaster, the author has abundant access to these successful people - or super-achievers - in the real world. To his many personal & frank interviews with these people, he has asked two compelling questions:- How do you define success; and- What does it take to be happy?This inspiring book certainly captures the 'strategic heartbeat' of most of the interviewees' inspiring responses. Their advice is very simple, straight-forward, & effective, with no ulterior motive other than to help those who seriously want to join them on the mountaintop.The author is in fact a super-achiever himself & despite his failing eyesight & eventual blindness, he has been an Entrepreneur of the Year, a national champion Olympic weightlifter, a successful investment broker, an accomplished musician/songwriter, a marketing consultant, & a professional speaker, an author & president/co-founder/host of a television network.As a matter of fact, I understand that one of his best-selling books, \\"The Ultimate Gift\\" is now a 20th Century Fox major motion picture, starring James Garner.In a nutshell, & collectively for readers, I am very confident readers can find numerous startling answers as well as unusual perspectives in your continuing quest for:- Becoming the best you can be;- Changing your life;- Turning your dreams into reality;- Taking action starting today;- Finding & fulfilling your destiny regardless of your circumstances;Many of the super achievers whom the author had interviewed, especially those from movie entertainment, also brought forth many sweet memories of my childhood times in the late fifties & throughout the sixties, during which I had spent much of my spare time going to the movies & watching the black box.Here are some of my unforgettable movie/TV characters with their winning insights in the book:- Eddie Albert (played a big city attorney - who long desired to become a farmer - opposite Eva Gabor in 'Green Acres' TV series): \\"I really don't care how I am remembered as long as I bring happiness & joy to people\\";- Joseph Barbera (creator/producer of 'Tom & Jerry', 'The Flintstones' cartoon series for TV, among many others): \\"Without persistence, it is impossible to experience success.\\"- Ralph Bellamy ('Frontier Justice', 'The Eleventh Hour\\", 'The Survivors', but I remember him best as the rich Texan J W Grant in 'The Professionals'): \\"Never back down on your dreams!\\";- Pat Boone (for me, his original rendition of 'Speedy Gonzales' is the best!): \\"I define success as somehow having a positive effect on the lives of others.\\"- Chuck Connors (as rancher Lucas McCain - with his modified Winchester - in \`The Rifleman' TV series): \\"Concentrate on the fun-damentals!\\"- Jack Elam (memorable supporting roles in 'High Noon' & \\"Gunfight at OK Corral'): \\"Never say die! You can make it by just trying & trying & trying...& taking chances!\\"- Douglas Fairbanks (often played the debonair character in slapstick comedies or adventure yarns e.g. 'The Legend of Robin Hood'; best remembered from his role in 'The Prisoner of Zenda'): \\"Only when we rise above our current circumstances & escape from the day to day can we really explore the possibilities.\\"- Peter Graves (as Jim Phelps in 'Mission: Impossible' TV series): \\"Success in life means...a goal that you have an eye on...that goal...something you must do & persevere until you got it done or got a start at it...then you stay on top of it, & keep punching & pushing & striving all the time to go in the directions that you want...\\"- Katharine Hepburn ('The Philadelphia Story', 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner & \`The African Queen' are three of her most memorable films): \\"All of us need to find that passion in our work, or find work where we can experience the passion.\\"- Charlton Heston ('Benhur', The Ten Commandments, 'The Omega Man', & \`Solyent Green'): \\"Spend your time wisely!\\"- Shirley Jones ('Oklahoma', 'Elmer Gantry', and \`The Partridge Family'): \\"If you know how to get along with people, you are a lot more likely to succeed in all the areas of your life.\\"- Deborah Kerr (a captivating portrayal opposite Burt Lancaster in 'From Here to Eternity'): \\"...There are some limitations that simply cannot be overcome. But instead of giving up on all your dreams just because your first dream can't be true, transfer your enthusiasm to a new endeavour.\\"- Dorothy Lamour (I will always remember her roles in 'The Road to...' pictures, a series of movies with Bob Hope & Bing Crosby): \\"The world takes itself far too seriously; laughter is something there's far too little of. Whatever one does, they should always remember to laugh.\\"- Jack Lemon ('Mister Roberts', 'Some Like It Hot', 'Days of Wine & Roses' but his role of Jack Codell in 'The China Syndrome' in the late seventies was the most memorable): \\"Achieving success can be thrilling, but it is a lot more satisfying if you can make a worthwhile difference in someone's life on your way up.\\"- Robert Young ('Father Knows Best', 'Marcus Welby' TV series): \\"You have to have enthusiasm.\\"- Joseph Wambaugh (creator of the classic anthology series for TV under 'Police Story' in the seventies): \\"The only thing I have learned about success is that if one is willing to listen, really listen, to things that are said, as well as to things that are not said, that person will be miles ahead of the competition.\\"Other successful people interviewed in the book include: The Dalai Lama, Alexander Haig, Robert Schuller, Charles Schwab, Robert Shapiro (remember O J Simpson?), Ted Turner, Denis Waitley, Art Linkletter & Gary Player.To conclude my review, I would like to paraphrase what the author wrote in the Introduction, which I thought really accentuates the essence of his book: \\"...I have now read the biographies of more than 1,500 great & famous people. One of the traits they have in common is a sense of expectation & destiny. They always believed that they were destined for greatness. I trust that you believe that you are destined for greatness, & that this book will be a launching pad for all that is yet to come...This book & the success secrets it contains should be your constant companion on the road to success. Don't try to reinvent the wheel. Simply follow the trail that has already been blazed, & you will find that your success is not a mystery, but a certainty.\\""},{"Title":"Success Secrets of Super Achievers","review":"Wonderful book!

You can smell the attempt to dominate or be coy with the reader. Not Croft. Her voice is strong and instantly engaging, but not pretentious or faux-English like so many of her contemporaries. The way the stories inside unfold is almost lyrical, but not in the sweeping, Jeannete Winterson way, and not as dense as Boyle, though fulyl as engaging. Croft's style is earthy and warm even when the story is not pleasant, and this book is like a blanket of ideas and just the right words at all the right places. Simple, but always digging into you slyly.My only ocmplaint about the book is the overly-long last piece, the novella. It's still in that great voice, but the story isn't as engaging as the others. There are other stories and characters in earlier stories that I would have liked to seen treated to this length outside of this particualr one, so I don't think the problem actually lies with her, but with me as Engaged Reader: we always want more of the right thing when we find it.Read the 4 stars as more of a 4.5 and get this book.

We follow Fell, a gambling boss, as he checks himself out of a mental sanitarium, regains the power he was in danger of losing, and then goes over the top into manic psychosis. Kill is well-written and believable, but it's not very entertaining, or even very interesting. Part of the problem, I think, is the cold, clinical tone -- it feels more like a psychiatric case study than a novel. The other part of the problem is that there's no one to root for in the book: we never care about Fell, so ultimately we don't care what happens to him. That could have been dealt with if the book was more racy/lurid -- one would read on just to have one's sensibilities shocked -- but this is so quiet, it only manages to inspire indifference. Don't bother hunting this one down, and don't believe the hype."},{"Title":"Kill the Boss GoodBye","review":"Imagine a crime book without any compelling characters, snappy dialogue, or surprising plot twists and you should get a pretty good picture of 'Kill the Boss'.

It is the story of Thomas Fell, a SoCal crime boss recently released from a sanitarium, who returns to his turf to find his reign threatened by Pander, an ambitious, up and coming hood who wants to take over the action. The story centers around a horse race that Fell fixes to leave Pander owing a lot of money to bad people. Fell, meanwhile, is seeming to act erratically, but yet doing the right things to oust Pander and reclaim his ground. As manic as he's become, the head bosses decide to give him one more chance, but the hit has been put in. Will he make it out in time?I enjoyed it. A different kind of crime book, but with the usual tough guy posturing, fights, chest thumping and stacked dames. Took me about two hours to read. KInd of a milder Jim Thompson style, and it's interesting to see Fell seemingly manic and out of control, but still manipulating events to his advantage.

The book is clinical, that part is true, but I definitely wouldn't call it cold, or monotonous for that matter. More like minimalist.The novel is intelligent, poignant and, in it's own way, moving. What Rabe does is to acknowledge the hard-boiled cliches that are expected of him, strip most of them away, as they would have otherwise stood in the way of him telling the story, and then use what is left of the gangster novel/roman noir vernacular to communicate directly with the reader in the clearest and most succint way imaginable.

The vernacular of the book often felt dated to this reader, based it is on the inner workings of the British Empire, but that in no way took away from its overall impact and timeless message. This is a marvelously honest and insightful, also delightfully sardonic, look at how human nature and institutional politics really work on a grand scale.The book starts with the most well-known of Parkinson's laws, which is, \\"work expands to fill the time allotted to it.\\" But there are several other chapters in this very short book with other wonderful information as well. There's a whole chapter devoted to how to phrase a help wanted ad in order to get only one perfect candidate for the job. One chapter explains why bureaucracies grow at a standard rate of 5% a year regardless of workload. There are also wonderfully complex formulas concerning how to calculate the correct age of retirement, which has a lot to do with the age of the person who is hoping to edge you out and take your place as soon as possible. The mathematical analysis of at what time the truly powerful people arrive and leave a cocktail party was also a lot of fun.While most books about management talk in highly idealistic utopian terms, this is one of those rare books that tells it like it is and makes you laugh at the same time. Its closest relatives areMachiavelli's Discourses on the First Decade of Titus Livius, Bertrand Russell'sUnpopular Essays, and Justin Locke'sPrinciples of Applied Stupidity (How to Get and Do More by Thinking and Knowing Less).While this is a fairly short book, my version was only 101 pages, I found I could not read it straight through because each chapter was so enlightening, I had to take a break in between. But that is hardly a complaint.It's not so much the specific information that makes this book what it is. What makes the book is its honest appraisal of human nature. A wonderful thing to be reminded of as you go to that next meeting. A now somewhat forgotten classic, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Parkinson's law, and other studies in administration","review":"Here's a gem of a book which I came upon while researching the \\"Bike shed syndrome\\" (See [...] - reload the page a couple of times if the initial colour scheme hurts your eyes).Expanded from a 1955 article in the Economist magazine, Parkinson's Law states that \\"work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\\" I've know about this book for years and the article on the bikeshed syndrome finally prompted me to buy a second-hand copy. I was expecting a serious business book, but what I got is a witty, sharply observed series of ten essays on why bureaucracies function the way they do. It may be satire, but there's a grain of truth in the observations nonetheless. Parkinson's law is as relevant today as it was half a century ago.

I was fortunate to have the experience of hearing Parkinson speak to our department when he was visiting professor at our university fifty years ago. His thoughts on the birth, maturing and eventual withering of organizations was scary in that we were just achieving his pinnacle indicator, a new building.

Rather than being just another coffee table book with pretty pictures, Liz Gilbert intersperses her photographs with insightful essays documenting Maasai history, rituals, and traditions such as marriage, male and female circumcision, coming of age, and even a lion hunt with spears.Gilbert has clearly done her homework regarding the Maasai, spending many years in Kenya to gain the trust of the tribesmen who allowed her to document their most intimate rituals. The black and white photographs she has assembled have a museum quality about them, especially the portraits.The author took serious personal risks to achieve these photographs, with the lion hunt at the end representing but one example of her courage. Clearly, the book documents not only the vanishing society of the Maasai, but also a personal journey for the author. This book should be an inspiration for anyone interested in Africa."},{"Title":"Broken Spears: A Maasai Journey","review":"Most photographers either see the members of the noble Maasai tribe hastily when they are tourists or as photojournalists with limited time. Their images don't get far below the surface. On the other hand, photographer Elizabeth Gilbert worked many years, carefully and slowly to gain the Maasai's trust and understand who they are. The result of her efforts is abundantly clear in this moving book that documents their world in a great detail. We don't see flashy events performed for visitors but intimate milestones in their life like the passage to manhood and the rite of marriage. The book leaves us with a clear sense of who these people are and where they came from. In addition, Gilbert has given us a breathtaking view of the country in which they make their home.

A vision of a wide open sex district in the heart of turn of the century New Orleans has inspired a great deal of fictional writing (some donning the mask of history) and the movie Pretty Baby. Alecia Long peels back the layers of this fascinating vice district and reveals a world far more interesting than Hollywood could ever imagine. Love across racial lines, upright citizens trying to control vice, and business minded women carving a role for themselves are all discussed.

An entertaining, informative, and enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Great Southern Babylon: Sex, Race, and Respectability in New Orleans 1865-1920","review":"In 1903, a guidebook promoting New Orleans&#146;s Storyville red-light district provided a directory of elite prostitutes. Entitled the Storyville 400, the guide offered practical information for those in search of such services. Many of the guidebook&#146;s readers may have also chuckled at the sly parody of the &#147;First Four Hundred&#148;--the famous roster of New Yorkers prominent enough to be invited to parties thrown by socialite Lina Astor. Astor&#146;s ballroom, it was said, could only accommodate 400 people. A list of prostitutes that lampooned Fifth Avenue snobbery must have been a matter of some hilarity for the &#147;sporting men&#148; and tourists who frequented New Orleans bordellos. But while the guidebooks spoofed Americans&#146; turn of the century obsession with respectability, the men who frequented Storyville also willingly paid a premium to visit brothels that affected Victorian refinement.In The Great Southern Babylon: Sex, Race, and Respectablity in New Orleans, 1865-1920, Alecia Long vividly recreates the tempestuous Storyville-era when increasingly conservative national values collided with New Orleans&#146;s decadent culture. For Long, colorful and conflicted women like Mary Anne Deubler epitomized this period. A former prostitute, Deubler went on to become one of Storyville&#146;s most successful madams. Her success was, in part, due to her ability to combine the trappings of high society with the lascivious entertainment of bordello culture. Her Basin Street brothel--the Chateau Lobrano d&#146;Arlington&#151;mimicked the elegance that typified Victorian domesticity. But while the oak paneling, heavily draped windows, and fine furniture might have resembled the drawing rooms of Garden District mansions, many &#147;gentlemen of taste&#148; preferred the services of Deubler&#146;s &#147;cultivated&#148; girls to the respectable company of their wives. Long argues convincingly that madams like Deubler &#147;sagely manipulated the idea of respectability that permeated American culture&#148; and, by so doing, amassed impressive fortunes. Yet, even Deubler grew embarrassed by the source of her wealth and longed for entrance into polite society. In an effort to reinvent herself as a Victorian lady, she purchased a splendid residence on Esplanade Avenue, toured Europe, wore the latest fashions, and summered in Pass Christian and Covington.Although Deubler may have craved respectability, Long argues aptly that unlike many other cities in the United States, New Orleans never fully embraced the Victorian ethos. While the city had prominent and outspoken reformers such as Philip Werlein who pressured officials to stamp out vice, lawmakers responded with conflicting or half-hearted measures. Officials did move against the concert saloons on Royal Street where bawdy burlesque and minstrel performers entertained working-class crowds. Those boisterous saloons were, after all, only a short distance from some of the city&#146;s most respectable dining and shopping venues. And even politicians who frequented the saloons felt obligated to respond after notorious incidents such as bar owner Otto Schoenhausen&#146;s conviction for drugging and robbing one of his own patrons.In another effort to appease reformers, in 1897 councilman Sidney Story (for whom Storyville would be nicknamed) introduced his famous ordinance that created an officially sanctioned red-light district on the edge of the French Quarter. Because the ordinance banned prostitution in most of the city, Story could claim to be a reformer without shutting down the sex trade that drew thousands of visitors to New Orleans each year. Story&#146;s ordinance, Long argues, made the city unique and notorious. Although other cities had de facto vice districts, New Orleans was alone in &#147;the frank and direct way the city&#146;s leaders chose to delineate its vice district through municipal ordinance.&#148; In 1897, Long writes, &#147;in an extremely direct and decidedly non-Protestant fashion, New Orleans city officials, acknowledging their belief that sins of the flesh were inevitable, looked Satan in the eye, cut a deal, and gave him his own address.&#148;For the next twenty years, men like Mayor Martin Behrman protected Storyville from those who railed against it, particularly evangelical reformers from the northern part of the state. Behrman viewed himself as a realist. &#147;You can,&#148; he said, &#147;make prostitution illegal in Louisiana but you can&#146;t make it unpopular.&#148; To be sure, some prominent businessmen and local politicians hoped New Orleans would, instead, emulate &#147;New South&#148; cities such as Atlanta that emphasized manufacturing, banking, and commerce. But as long as Storyville flourished economically, others were happy to promote the city as a bastion of decadence and difference.Intertwined with this struggle between sex and respectability were equally contentious matters of race that arose, Long contends, because some of New Orleans prostitutes were women of color. New Orleans had had a long history of tolerating relationships &#147;across the color line.&#148; The system of plac&#261;ge that flourished during the antebellum era clearly set New Orleans apart from the rest of the South. And many men and women of different races fell in love, had children, and lived together out of wedlock. Although these relationships faced significant social and legal constraints, they remained prevalent throughout the nineteenth century. During Reconstruction, interracial marriage was even briefly made legal. As the forces of white supremacy gained ground after 1877, however, race relations grew far more rigid, even in the Crescent City.For Long, it is no coincidence that the ordinance that created Storyville in 1897 came on the heels of the United States Supreme Court&#146;s infamous 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson that sanctioned legal segregation. Although Sidney Story&#146;s ordinance did not prohibit white men from visiting black or mixed-race prostitutes, it did move those activities into what had been a predominately African-American neighborhood and out of the eye of respectable white society.Some pragmatic Storyville madams, Long notes, managed to use these increasingly rigid racial mores to their advantage. Self-described &#147;octaroons&#148; like Willie Piazza and Lulu White marketed their brothels as exotic destinations where white men could find light-skinned mixed-race women who were refined but &#147;skilled&#148; in ways more prudish white women were not. Since romantic relationships &#147;across the color line&#148; were no longer as acceptable as they were in the antebellum era, commercialized interracial sex became highly profitable in New Orleans. By allowing men to violate a central taboo of the Jim Crow South, Long contends, Storyville brothels served as a &#147;safety valve&#148; where southerners came to &#147;escape racial, religious, and behavioral strictures.&#148;Storyville&#146;s heyday was short-lived. By 1909, Louisiana conservatives from Shreveport and other northern outposts, successfully urged the state legislature to target prostitution. New state laws banned musical instruments in saloons, prohibited blacks and whites from drinking together, and barred women from establishments that sold liquor and not food. To circumvent these laws, some brothels added tamale carts and other food concessions to their dance halls. But other restrictive measures soon followed and in 1917, as America mobilized to fight World War I, Storyville suffered a fatal blow. Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels, convinced that the district posed a threat to troops stationed nearby, ordered a reluctant Mayor Behrman to close the district down. Although some brothels survived Daniel&#146;s assault, Storyville&#146;s boom years were over. By the mid-1940s, the district had fallen on hard times and the city razed most of its buildings to make way for the Iberville Housing Project.In The Great Southern Babylon, Alecia Long provides a dazzling account of the cultural forces that created and destroyed the infamous Storyville district. She also provides a skillful and thought-provoking analysis of the lasting impact the district has had on the city. She argues convincingly that Storyville helped New Orleans to resist the homogenization that most of the nation embraced. Story&#146;s ordinance gave the city a unique &#147;reputation for tolerating, even encouraging, indulgence of all varieties.&#148; Although this reputation may have been in place long before the advent of Storyville, the creation of a legal authorized tenderloin district marked the moment when civic leaders began to exploit New Orleans&#146; decadent image &#147;in order to profit from it and draw people to the city.&#148;Since its demise, Storyville has become part of New Orleans lore. The unpleasant and degrading aspects of prostitution have been filtered from collective memory and replaced by images of Jelly Roll Morton, the early days of Jazz, and smoke-filled nights nights in ornate bordellos populated by colorful characters. &#147;More than a century after Storyville was established, and more than eighty years after it was abolished,&#148; Long concludes, &#147;the city&#146;s reputation for sexual liberality, sensual tourism, and laissez-faire morality remains intact. It also remains indebted, at least in part, to the romanticized mythology that has developed about Storyville.&#148;"},{"Title":"The Great Southern Babylon: Sex, Race, and Respectability in New Orleans 1865-1920","review":"An interesting book about the history of prostitution in New Orleans.

An unintended legacy of Ariel Sharon's Peronist-style authoritarian government, he maintains, is the victory of Hamas in the January 2006 elections to the Palestinian Authority Legislative Council. To all appearances the situation thus remains as deadlocked as ever. As an inevitable consequence of Israel's hard-line policy the PA Legislative Council is now dominated by a faction which in its turn endorses politicide, that of the Jewish state.The very nature of the Zionist undertaking, according to Kimmerling, must logically entail the politicide of the Palestinian people. The democracy which Israel has evolved is, in fact, a \`Herrenvolk' democracy; that is, existing for the benefit of a privileged caste lording it over a subject population. The chauvinism of Israel's leaders is all the more suspect for being religion-based. Kimmerling does not recognise the 2,000 year-old \`exile' from the Holy Land as favouring the Zionist cause. Indeed, most of the Jewish people who fled the East European pogroms of 1880-81 entertained no concept of a Biblical homeland to which they should return, choosing instead to move westward. The rigid adherence to scriptural fiat is thus seen as a crime against reason. Those guilty of it include the Gush Emunim settler movement and an obnoxious Christian fundamentalist clique in America which brooks no criticism of Sharon and his ilk and holds that the post-\`67 capture of Jewish holy places by Israel was divinely ordained.The narrative is organised around three landmark events, according to the author's interpretation, in the history of Israel's politicide against the indigenous Arab population. The first of these is the 1948 ethnic cleansing initiated by General Yigael Yadin's Plan B which advocated the destruction of Arab villages and the expulsion of their populations. Although formerly denied this is now recognised as historical fact. Kimmerling mentions Jewish revisionist historian Benny Morris who has demonstrated in his writings how the idea of population transfer figures largely in mainstream Zionist thinking, but he is criticised for failing to connect these ideas with the 1948 war. In fact Kimmerling's book predates an appalling interview (\`Ha'aretz' January 2004) in which Morris admits the truth of the 1948 ethnic cleansing allegations made against Israel but insists that, in the interests of state-building, even the carnage of Deir Yassin was justified. \`You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs', is his oft-quoted remark. Only a little less candid is Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon's description of the Palestinians as a \`cancerous manifestation' for whom \`chemotherapy' would be the appropriate remedy. He is possibly advocating their expulsion rather than actual physical annihilation, and Kimmerling notes that when public figures in Israel call for the enforced transfer of Arab communities as a plausible solution to the conflict few eyebrows are raised.The second major episode dealt with is Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 when Sharon was Defence Minister. For an extended treatment of the tragic events Noam Chomsky's masterly, harrowing \`Fateful Triangle' is highly recommended, but here Kimmerling is concise and to the point. Despite the Israeli cabinet agreeing a plan to allow the evacuation of the PLO, Sharon, hoping to destroy Arafat's organisation rather than allow it to leave, instigated a 7-hour assault on Beirut which resulted in 300 mostly civilian casualties. When the PLO finally did leave Sharon refused to grant Arafat's request that multinational forces be brought in to protect the Palestinian refugees from the revenge of the Lebanese Phalangist militias whose murderous reputation was well known. After the militias' entirely predictable genocidal rampage in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila the Kahan inquiry commission found Sharon \`indirectly responsible' for the massacre. We are reminded of an earlier chapter in which Kimmerling discusses the behaviour of Sharon's 101 unit during its 1953 assault on the Palestinian village of Qibiya where houses were detonated with the inhabitants still inside. Members of the unit subsequently denied their commander's claim that he ordered them to evacuate all dwellings before commencing the attack. As for the Kahan commission's recommendations, these were not heeded to the letter. Although resigning as Defence Minister Sharon continued to hold public office and, of course, would later become Prime Minister. We may note, in passing, how this highlights the issue of public as opposed to private morality in different societies founded on the Western democratic model. Whereas here in the UK sexually indiscreet behaviour can rebound catastrophically on holders of public office, in \`democratic' Israel collusion in mass murder has no such damaging effect on the political careers of those held responsible.Thirdly, Operation Defensive Shield was undertaken after a sucide bomber claimed the lives of 29 people in the town of Netanya in March 2002, although the operation had in fact been pre-planned and only required a pretext for it to be carried out. The relevant chapter focuses on Israel's destruction of Palestinian radio and TV stations, databases, documents, water-treatment facilities, power-generating plants, clinics, schools and universities. According to the terms of Kimmerling's analysis all this constituted a \`politicidal' act on the part of Israel under Sharon's Premiership because, in destroying infrastructure and civilian institutions, it went well beyond the stated aim of \`wiping out the Palestinian terror network'. The various phases of Defensive Shield including the battle in Nablus, the Jenin events and Arafat's virtual \`last stand' in the Ramallah compound are gone over briefly. Kimmerling also considers Israel's policy of so-called targeted killings, not so finely targeted that they avoid civilian casualties and, significantly, even some members of the Israeli public now openly condemn such actions as war crimes. As a reminder of the first major incident of \`politicide' discussed earlier there is a quote from a \`Ha'aretz' magazine interview in which Sharon states that the 1948 war was \`just one chapter' in the \`War of Independence' which has yet to be concluded. Ever the discreet tactician Sharon does not elaborate but, given the events of that fateful year which have since come to light the implications are, to put it mildly, sinister.This is not so much a biography of Ariel Sharon as a condensed history of the Middle East conflict, but Kimmerling's compelling and lucid account considers the salient points of Sharon's career and his role in several key events. Running to a concise 230 pages it will serve as an easily digestible, though challenging, antidote to the public image of its subject fostered by George W Bush's anodyne \`man of peace' rhetoric. Finally, it should be emphasised that the author is clearly a man of compassion and, as such, quite undeserving of the cliched \`self-hating Jew' brickbat which will inevitably be thrown at him by his least perceptive critics. Rather than end on a gloomy note he discerns the beginnings of an understanding on both sides that painful compromises will have to be made, something which, in the light of current events (June/July 2006), unfortunately does not seem imminent."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"In this extremely useful book, the Israeli historian Baruch Kimmerling shows how the Sharon government is committing politicide by destroying the Palestinian public sphere, including its leaders, schools, universities and hospitals, destroying the Palestinian private sphere by making everyday life unbearable for people, in an effort to dissolve the Palestinian people as a legitimate society, polity and economy.Kimmerling details Sharon's record as a warrior against civilians, and his consistent use of a strategy of provocations: the 1953 massacre in Qibiya, the 1955 Gaza raid into Egypt, his forces' killing of 1,000 civilians in the Gaza Strip between 1967 and 1970, the 1982 invasion of Lebanon which killed 18,000 people, his connivance in the Sabra and Shatila massacres, and how he provoked the September 2000 Intifada.Kimmerling describes Israel's growing fascist tendencies: he says it is becoming \`a Thatcherite and semi-fascist regime', with reduced freedom of expression, all opposition smeared as treason, the army's growing involvement in politics, one-man rule, the demonising of Palestinians and Arabs, and the destruction of Palestinian society through economic privation, violence and terror.Menachem Begin admitted that Israel attacked Egypt in 1967, in the war that led to Israel's brutal and illegal occupations. Now, in re-occupying Palestinian territories, Israeli forces have killed 250 Palestinian children, and 72 Israeli children have been killed. Since September 2000, 2,546 Palestinians and 892 Israelis have been killed, and 23,930 Palestinians and 5,973 Israelis have been injured. 2,202 Palestinian homes have been completely destroyed, and 14,436 partially; one Israeli home has been destroyedSharon's strategy is failing: killing Palestinians and destroying their society is not protecting Israeli citizens from terrorist acts; Jews are safer anywhere else in the world. The only way forward for Israel is a two-state settlement, whereby the two peoples accept each other's existence, renounce violence and commit to cooperation and peaceful coexistence."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"Professor Kimmerling's book is an important contribution to the understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian war and should be read by everyone who is concerned about the future of our country. America's Middle East policy is at this time not evenhanded but clearly favors Israel's wishes over those of other countries in the region. Since Kimmerling documents the oppressive policies of Israel toward its conquered Palestinian population Americans need to read this book which presents the proverbial other side of the coin.This is especially topical now when guns are blazing again in Gaza and Israel uses the pretext of freeing a kidnapped soldier to punish the Palestinian people for democratically electing a Hamas led government. The current situation clearly proves Kimmerling's point, that a viable Palestinian state will not be tolerated by Israel's government.The book discusses the \\"pre-emptive\\" 1967 war which led to the Yom Kippur war and the ill advised invasion of Lebanon for which Sharon was mainly responsible. He was also the main architect of the settlement program in the occupied territories which has now become a millstone around the neck not only of Israelis and Palestinians but also Americans because neither of the parties can see a just solution to this increasingly vexing problem. Kimmerling's excerpts from \\"Machsomwatch,\\" which detail the conditions Palestinians are forced to live under are especially poignant.When one reads this book it becomes clear why the rest of the world does not trust America at this time and only when America will begin to support, instead of vetoing, resolutions in the UN which demand an end to Israel's current practices will there be a semblance of hope for peace."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"This is a good book. It's not a perfect one - because, focussed as it is on the blaming of Sharon, it often forgets what the Israeli Labour party was able to do against Palestinians when it was its turn to hold power.But this book is a timely one. Already in 2003, Baruch Kimmerling was able to point out to the risk that, should Sharon go on unhampered, he can reach his next objective: the expulsion of Palestinians from the land they live on. This can be obtained not only &quot;by the sword&quot;, but by making their life impossible. And this is exactly what's happening: at the beginning of April, UNRWA had to stop the feeding of Gaza strip, because Israel had been successful in blocking its activities. Secondly, this book is prophetic for another reason: because it signalled that what Sharon wished to build up was a Palestinian &quot;state&quot; made up of non-communicating encalves. This is the project Bush signed, not many days ago. And the risk is that Palestinians, since this is a plan that none of them can approve, carry out other suicide bombers - alienating more and more the Israeli opposition, and intellectual public opinion overseas, away from them. The day public opinion only sees the suffering of Israeli civilians, and forgets about Palestinian deaths and hunger - the moment public opinion turns a blind eye on them - Sharon can do what he wishesThis is what we can read quite at the end of the book (p. 211): &quot;All of these conditions are, according to Sharon, designed to lower Palestinian expectations crush their resistance, isolate them, make them submit to any arrangement suggested by the Israelis, and eventually cause their &quot;voluntary&quot; mass emigration from the land&quot;. So, Sharon's plans, and the way he wants to implement them, must be fully known; and this book must be read and widely distributed"},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"The late Baruch Kimmerling's slim volume brought to light the dark side of the Israeli experience, as lived through its longtime \\"Lucifer,\\" Ariel Sharon. Do I do him injustice comparing him to the 1990s' other infamous war criminal? Possibly - to Sharon's credit, he was not a mere banker-turned-politician, like Slobo, but a career blood and thunder war-maker who could have appeared before the UN, pistol on hip, as credibly as Yasser Arafat. And unlike his Balkan counterpart he remained untouched, even blessed, by the \\"international community\\" - being on the right side of power always conditions the \\"right side of history.\\"But Sharon was more directly responsible for the mass murder at Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon, than Milosevic for the tragedy of Srebrinca: the attacking forces were under Sharon's overall command and could have been stopped at his word. Sharon patronized the Israeli settler movement just as Slobo did his \\"chetniks,\\" encouraging the assimilation of the Serbian Jerusalem (Kosovo) into Eretz Serbia. One can imagine Sharon addressing a crowd of West Bank settlers paraphrasing his counterpart: \\"They'll never beat you again.\\" Sharon may never have uttered his promise in those exact words, but his career was a fulfillment of their principle.This was forever shaped by the original \\"Operation Horseshoe,\\" the Kosovo-style expulsion of Palestinian Arabs within Israel's mandated territory in '48. No outright repetition of this was ever possible, as long as there was no all-out war upon Israel. But there was always the next-best thing: provoke the \\"illegal occupiers\\" into resistance that could be crushed, to make their lives a prison unless they sought freedom elsewhere. A West eager to appease could always be counted on to applaud him for stopping just short of real ethnic cleansing, though his thoughts were honestly spoken by his Chief of Staff Moshe Ya'alon in describing the Palestinians as a \\"cancer\\" requiring \\"chemotherapy.\\" A very chilling reminder that genocide - the \\"war against the weak,\\" to use author Edwin Black's phrase - is still possible in a world of moral arrogance and weapons of mass destruction."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"This book is by the late Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling. The paperback edition, which I am reviewing, was published apparently in early 2006.Kimmerling goes over a few of the major events of what he calls Israel's attempted \\"politicide\\" against Palestinians. First obviously was the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians that helped facilitate the creation of Israel in 1948. Kimmerling cites the \\"Plan D\\" formula written by General Yigal Yadin in the spring of 1948 which called for the Israeli military to destroy all Palestinian villages near Jewish settlements and military installations. A few massacres of Palestinians like at Deir Yassin by Menachem Begin's Irgun also encouraged Palestinians to flee. Sharon came to prominence in the early 1950's as the commander of IDF unit 101. After 1948, Palestinian victims of 1948 were in the habit of infiltrating back into Israel to retrieve belongings or commit violence, including the killing of Jews. Attacking a supposed base of these infiltrators, Sharon led an expedition in 1953 against the Al-Burg refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, killing 15 Palestinians, \\"mostly women and children.\\" Kimmerling quotes an account by Sharon biographer Uzi Benziman to the effect that Sharon desired to maximize civilian casualties in the operation. The Al-Burg operation encouraged Egypt to endorse the organization of Palestinians into Fedayeen groups to conduct raids inside Israel. Sharon told his soldiers that the women killed at Al-Burg were all whores who serviced the \\"terrorists.\\" Then came October 1953, when after three Jews were killed by Palestinian infiltrators, Unit 101 attacked the Jordanian village of Qibya, killing 67 Jordanian civilians by blowing up the village's houses. Soldiers claimed that, contrary to Sharon's claim, they were never instructed to warn the village's inhabitants to leave their homes. As a paratrooper Commander Sharon led a raid on an Egyptian military base in Gaza in February 1955, killing 40 Egyptian soldiers, and compelling Egypt to turn to the Soviet block for military aid.Sharon's career took off after the 1967 war. In a footnote, Kimmerling quotes Yitzhak Rabin, Levi Eshkol and Menachem Begin as stating that Israel was not in danger of imminent attack by Egyptian forces in the Sinai, contrary to Israel's patriotic version of history. But after the 1967 war, Israel began its ongoing construction of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, measures which are illegal under international law, as Kimmerling reminds us. Sharon was extensively involved in supporting these settlements, of course. Sharon oversaw the pacification of the Gaza strip in 1970 with great brutality, under which 1000 Palestinians were summarily executed and massive numbers of Palestinian homes destroyed. With Moshe Dayan's support, he cleansed Bedouins out of their homes in the Sinai.Sharon's biggest effort to commit politicide against the Palestinians took place in 1982 when as minister of defense in Menachem Begin's government, he planned and executed Israel's invasion of Lebanon, where the PLO had long established its headquarters and led the Palestinian refugee community in the country. Kimmerling writes that the Begin government wanted to start a war in Lebanon to destroy Syrian military power in Lebanon and to destroy the PLO. Kimmerling writes that Israel constantly bombarded Lebanon from early spring to July 3rd 1981 hoping to induce a PLO rocket attack on northern Israel so as to justify an invasion of Lebanon. The PLO refused fall into the trap of responding to these provocations until July 1981 when it sent rockets on northern Israel to which Israel responded by bombing Beirut. This Israeli bombing killed around 100 people, mostly civilians, according to Kimmerling, citing the book on Israel's Lebanon war by Ehud Ya'ari and Israel's leading military analyst Ze'ev Schiff. Then Philip Habib negotiated a cease-fire and both sides adhered to this cease-fire according Kimmerling. Then the Abu Nidal group, a violently anti-PLO Palestinian terror organization wounded the Israeli ambassador in London in an assassination attempt in June 1982 and the Begin government bombed Lebanon in response though, of course, the PLO hadn't been involved in the assassination attempt. The PLO responded by bombing northern Israel and thus Israel had its justification to invade Lebanon, in alliance with the thuggish Lebanese Christian militias, killing close to 20,000 people.The pinnacle of Sharon's career, of course, came with his assumption of the premiership in 2001 and the intensification of murderous and massive violence against Palestinians in order to further the politicide of Palestinians. Sharon came to advocate a Palestinian state but Kimmerling observes that Sharon defined this \\"state\\" as several clusters of Palestinian population centers that have no territorial contiguity and are broken up by Jewish settlements and by-pass roads. According to this book, Sharon's plan envisioned bridges and tunnels to be built to connect the Palestinian cantons.There are a few instances in this book where Kimmerling seems a bit vague or inchoate in his coverage of major issues. It is hard to be completely sure but he seems to think that the Oslo accords, in spite of their many problems of which some he describes, had some legitimacy as a vehicle for the securing of Palestinian rights but I disagree.Kimmerling chastises the Meretz party for being unwilling to break with the Labor-Likud-Kadima militarist consensus and especially the Party's unwillingness to support the refusenik movement. At the end of the book he provides several excerpts of accounts by activists describing on the ground conditions in the West Bank. One such account is from an Israeli Jewish peace activist who describes being part of a delegation attempting to help Palestinian villagers harvest their olive crop. Jewish settlers have regularly destroyed Palestinian olive trees, the source of economic sustenance for many Palestinians, while the Israeli army pretends not to notice.Kimmerling expresses great concern about the erosion of Israel's democratic qualities in recent years as militarism and far right political currents have been strengthened. Also he expresses worry in this book about growing economic inequality in Israel, in particular the substantial growth in child poverty under Sharon's government and its neoliberal economic policies"},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"Politicide by Kimmerling, is in many ways remarkable as both Israeli historiography and as an Israeli political event: this detailed history by an internationally known member of the Israeli elite (Professor Baruch Kimmerling holds an appointment both at Hebrew University and at the University of Toronto, he is a sociologist) of Ariel Sharon is both an engaging portrait of a famous Israeli officer turned politician, and a succinct characterization of the politics of the Israeli right; the role of successive raids and many military provocations by the Israeli army that preceded all of their wars (with the Arabs); and, therefore and by extension, a description of the inherent violence of the Zionist state entity in its many faceted dealings with the Arabs, since 1948.Details are provided the reader, as well, of IDF approved, or permitted, massacres of Palestinians in their refugee camps and villages , and other politically motivated murders: these events few of which are known outside of Israel are regarded (in context) as an integral part of the making of an important military career (within both the early culture of the IDF and that of Israeli popular culture too). This career is made visible by the present prime minister of Israel. Details of Ariel Sharon's early growing up and how this may have presaged the choices of the future man are also introduced .The strategic Israeli plan that is presently being implemented now on the ground to create and maintain a kind of Bantustan out of all the West Bank areas (and Gaza too) is described as long held planning by some in the Israeli political and military elite, and as a personal \`vision' of Sharon and those in the Israeli Right, among them the settlers and their political parties. A vision which if fully implemented would mean, according to Professor Kimmerling, the extinction, for all practicable purposes, of the Palestinians as a recognizeable, historical entity. Kimmerling introduces to his readers the sociologist's technical term 'Herrenvolk' (roughly translated as \`master race' ) to describe present day Israeli (state) relations to all Palestinians, both those within , and without, the present Israeli borders. He frequently uses the term 'military settler society' to characterize present Israeli society (he has written about such things in professional journals) With a decent bibliography and a useful index."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"This is a very well written analysis of the career of Ariel Sharon & modern Israeli-Palestinian history. from the Qibiya massacre in 1953 to Sabra and Shatila in 1982 and the present day's war crimes during operation defensive shield of spring 2002, his determination to wipe out any functioning Palestinan political and/or communal entity cannot be any clearer. In his own words, the war of 1948 is not yet over, and the danger of further ethnic cleansing (aka 'transfer')has never been greater."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"That an Archameadean point which makes an objective reality possible does not exist means simply that all we know is based on our perceptions, that nothing exists 'out there' which we can understand in its total, \\"massive\\" otherness. If this is so, whatever we know about an entity is constrained, shaped, defined, and deterimined largely by several other entities, conceptions, perspectives, etc., as well as by our individual cognitive abilities (presuming these exist even if one is able to break free of all other constraints). It is this why we would find the above reviews of Kimmerling's \\"Politicide\\" varying from those considering it as an excellent diagnosis of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict to those seeing it as outright anti-semetism (though usually the label 'self-hating Jew' would be the choice when the dissident voice is Jewish).Obviously, a 'Palestinian' perspective is missing here.But even from a Palestinian perspective, there are still many possible readings of the book that correspond to varying levels of analysis and considerations. For example, if the author of the book were Palestinian, he or she may be criticized rather harshly by most Palestinians. The author, however, is an Israeli Jew, which brings us to a second crucial determinant; the predominant Zionist discourse. This hegemonic discourse has systematically rejected and denied the collective Palestinian narrative, even their very identity and existence as such. This discourse, backed up by American Nazi Christians (the next on Hitler's list (would?)have been the Arabs, next on the so called 'Zionist Christians' (is) the Jews- hence Nazi Christians), is so predominant that any other view is automatically relegated to the discourses of dissent- by definition not shared by the collectivity. The book seen through this prism is a giant leap. But do we really have to consider the book as related to the prevaling Zionist narrative? Is this how far can a conscientious objector stray from established (non)wisdom? Isn't the real politicide done by this Zionist discourse and hegemonic culture that set the parameters within which Sharon simply identified his g(l)ory path, and which is the real enemy of Palestinians and Israelis as well, and which should be fought, first and foremost, by Jewish conscientious objectors themselves? If this is true, Kimmerling's book shouldn't be evaluated in relation to mainstream Zionist perspectives. It is not a giant leap.My more specific contention with the book does not stray from the above argument. Kimmerling seems to blame it all on Sharon. Again, its the prevaling norms and institutions, many of which were already fossilized long before poor Sharon-in-a-coma was born. Consider, just for instance, Jabotinsky's idea of presuming the survival of the Jewish state as contingent on Jewish military power, the iron wall, the garrison state. Sharon's life was dedicated to that ideal, he even started buiding a giant physical wall to complement it. Again, there is the presumption that an Israeli public opinion was at odds with Sharonism, when it is evident in the book that he became (in)famous with every massacre he'd committed. Sharon is but a Zionist construction, and now that he is gone, and now that Zionism is still thrust deep into the very recesses of belligerence and intransigence, a thousand Sharons may lead the way(st)."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"_Politicide_ by Baruch Kimmerling is a highly controversial work dealing with the politically charged conflict in the Middle East between Israelis and Palestinians. In the wake of the tragedy of September 11, 2001 many Americans have turned to Israel and its leader Ariel Sharon as a fundamental ally in a conflict with what is perceived as a terroristic menace arising out of the Arab world. President George W. Bush has declared a \\"War on Terror\\" and has enlisted the support of the Israeli regime under the control of Sharon in his fight against Arab terrorism. However, as this book shows total and complete support by Americans for Israel may be highly problematic. Baruch Kimmerling argues from a particular point of view and presents Sharon as a right wing dictator who is attempting to politically neutralize the Palestinian people. Kimmerling traces the history of Zionism and Sharon's particular biography in his rise to power from a general in the Israeli army to a political opportunist. On February 6, 2001 Ariel Sharon was elected Prime Minister of Israel. Since that time according to Kimmerling, a systematic attempt has been made by Sharon to root out the Palestinian people and remove their political presence from Israel. Kimmerling shows by examining the history of Israel and the military career of Sharon that various crimes have been committed against the Palestinian people. In retaliation, many of these Palestians have been forced to engage in terrorist tactics - \\"the last weapon of the weak\\". The Middle Eastern conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is perhaps the most geopolitically charged conflict in the world today. It continues to result in tragedy for all concerned and oppression. Various religious \\"fundamentalisms\\" (including Christian Zionists) regard the return of the Jews to the Holy Land as a fulfillment of prophecy and the first step along the way towards the Second Coming of Christ. In addition, many Jewish and Christian fundamentalists (including former President Bill Clinton) believe the Temple of Solomon is located beneath the Temple Mount. However, this Temple Mount is currently the location of the mosque al-Aqsa, the third holiest shrine in Islam. It is within this mythically charged situation that the conflict between world religions and indigenous peoples of the Middle East exists. Individuals such as Sharon believe the Jews have a mandate for the Holy Land and believe in the continual expansion of the borders of the Jewish Israeli state. However this presents a particularly troublesome demographics problem in that it would result in Jews becoming a minority within their nation. For the Israeli \\"right wing\\", this is a troublesome issue. On the other hand, Palestinians continue to feel oppressed by a people who they do not recognize as having rights to their land. I do not believe there will be an easy or even any solution to this question; however, the potential travesty that can and continues to result within the Holy Land may one day escalate to apocalyptic proportions. In the meantime, the United States continues to face the menace of Arab terrorism and the Israelis and Palestinians continue to do battle with each other."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"Prof. Baruch Kimmerling's new book about the checkered career, heinous war crimes and diabolical treachery of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon is of such critical importance to understanding the expolsive Middle East crisis, that one would think it would make the cover of Newsweek, and be the subject of discussion and debate from the New York Times to the CBS Nightly News.

As far as an indictment of the State of Israel, its leadership, its policies, and its \\"strategic relationship\\" with the United States goes, this is hardly the best book available. Kimmerling does a good job at defining what his title blurb \\"Politicide\\" means--the attempt to eradicate any influence a religion, ethnicity, nationality, etc., has in its own political affairs. To whit, this is what the State of Israel, especially as personified in the Ariel Sharon regime, is perpetrating on the native Arab Palestinians. The problem with _Politicide_ is it does not exactly define what kind of book it is supposed to be. Kimmerling states that he is writing an essay to get his point of Israel's tyranny in the Holy Land across, which is fine except that if his essay was not over 200 pages long. It would have been more interesting as a history, citing its sources, rather than presenting information as assumed knowledge. This is particularly important, as this subject should not be dismissed as the ranting of ultra-left, pro-Islamic fundamentalist, anti-American, pro-terrorist or Nazi apologist ideologues. Better books for those interested in the topic of Israel's relationship to the United States and its position in the Middle East (especially why the Islamic world is monolithically distrustful of Israel) are _Jewish Power_ by J.

It was written as a polemic against Ariel Sharon in 2003 when he was busy smashing the Intifada in Operation Defensive Shield. It was written at a time of worldwide hyperbowl and accusation against ISrael, where daily academics were comparing Israeli actions to Nazism and Israeli leftists and other worldwide leftists were busy 'saving' Palestinian children. ISrael was said to be committing genocide and contemplating transfer. And the father of all this was said to be the Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who was sopposed to have led an entire life trying to slaughter Palestinians from Unit 101 to Sabra and Shatilla.And then everything changed. Israel pulled out of Gaza and Sharon went into a coma. Suddenly there was no 'genocide' and the operation in Jenin didnt kill 1,000 people, but some 28. Suddenly the foreign workers and protestors who had colonized the West Bank went home, not all of them, but most.So this book is a tad out of date. When Ariel Sharon had the chance to commit genocide and transfer he didnt do it. So unless there is an update here somewhere this book is better read as an interpretation of the Israeli left's view of itself and as a view of the level of polemic created by the 2nd Intifada.Seth J.

Here it should be remembered that Kimmerling is a scholar of very questionable credentials whose major achievement is ignoring the actual history of the Arab inhabitants of Southern Syria ( As they thought of themselves until Arafat et al. in the early sixties provided them a new name , a national identity, and a way of bamboozling the world. Here Kimmerling tries to prove that Ariel Sharon is involved in destroying that new national Arab identity .However since this book has been published Ariel Sharon withdrew Israeli forces from Gaza, and went before the United Nations to openly support a Palestinian state, even though he firmly believes that historically the Jewish claim to the Holy Land is a far more legitimate one.Kimmerling ignores totally the eighty -years plus war the Arabs( Not only the Palestinians ) have waged to drive the Jews from the Middle East. He ignores the fact that the Palestinian Arabs have refused Great Power offers of a state within the Holy Land five - times. He of course ignores too the fact that Ariel Sharon , the villain of this piece, is in favor of the Bush road-map plan calling for a Palestinian Arab state.Kimmerling has devoted his academic life to constructing Palestine for the Arabs, and destroying Israel for the Jews.He will have his own small chapter in the book of Jewish self- hatred ,Torquemada to Chomsky.It is not the worse thing in the world to be pompous, as the writing in this book is. However it is one of the worse for a historian and sociologist to ignore the evidence of history and present reality,and to create a text which is a tissue of myths and lies."},{"Title":"Politicide: The Real Legacy of Ariel Sharon","review":"Ariel Sharon has been responsible for evicting all the Jews from Yamit. Now he's declared that he'll evict all the Jews from the Gaza strip. And I suppose that's ethnic cleansing. But it is hardly politicide.However, that isn't the charge Kimmerling makes. In Kimmerling's story, it is the Arabs who are being destroyed. By Sharon and Israel! The fact that Arabs are increasing in numbers both in Israel and the West Bank does not seem to make any difference to the author. And even if Sharon were expelling Arabs, that would hardly count as \\"politicide\\" against the Arab people.The point of this book appears to be to confuse us readers and distract us from real human rights violations in the region."},{"Title":"So Swift the Storm","review":"Although this book was a bit slow in starting, once it finally got going, I rather enjoyed it. It is the story of a young girl who is forced by her cold and distant mother to travel West with a family she does not trust. She knows she is expected to marry the son, and she is afraid to because he is such a vile person. On the other hand, she is afraid not to, because she doesn't know what would become of his infant daughter (the child's mother has just died). She makes many discoveries about herself and her history, some of which were rather obvious, though others were very surprising. Some twists were a bit too coincidental to be believable, but the book certainly doesn't end the way the reader expects. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy pioneer romances, because, although the book did not really suit my own taste, it was good for what it was."},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of the Arctic","review":"Again an encyclopedia about the Arctic, I thought, when I saw the three volume set, but three volumes!!!, that was new and must be special, I've been in the Arctic a few times and having hundreds of books about the Arctic and Antarctic, I took a gamble and bought the volumes still wondering whether it would bring any extra, things I didn't know or still have to discover, maybe it was a book I'd only read once and never again.How wrong I was, I soon found out when I got the books. Don't expect beautiful colorful pictures but instead the book brings a huge amount of information about the whole Arctic region.Yes, there were items I knew all about, but I found out so many new things I'd never heard of, explorers, regions in the Russian Arctic, I think I can go on for hours, and that's what you can do. This really makes it all up for those of us who'd expected color pictures, for that there are many many other alternatives. The information, that's why you have to buy it.You can use the book as a reference guide but also wander through it and start reading, it's like web surfing, you wander from one item to the other. Not only the articles are great but also the literature listings are worth while and brings you deeper in the items you're interested in. The fact that the book is so new comes back in articles about climate change and changes in the Arctic in general. If you want the latest on the Arctic, this is what you needThis book is absolutely worth buying, when you are a newcomer in the Arctic world or an experienced Arctic traveler or reader. The fact that it is written by well known and respected scientists makes this book a \\"must\\" for all Arctic lovers."},{"Title":"Garden Lighting","review":"At last, an up-to-date replacement for Ortho's 1984 \\"How to Design & Install Outdoor Lighting\\". This is a thorough overview of lighting techniques, system design and the variety of lamps and lampholders used in both line voltage and low voltage outdoor lighting. Despite the usual disclaimers (the Brits must be as litigious as Americans) about having only a qualified electrician install garden lighting there is useful information for the DIYer.This is not an installer's manual but it does provide sufficient information to enable one to grasp the essentials of lighting design's dependence on the proper lamp type as the key to success. After all, lighting fixtures are just lamp holders and the effect is in the lamp not in the fixture. Many well-photographed illustrations of lighting techniques are provided with explanatory captions and backed up with colored drawings to reveal detail. I was surprised to see charts of lamp types drawn out-of-scale but there were accompanying photographs to put them back in perspective. Credits were in source order so it is difficult to track a photo to its source i.e. if you want to know who was responsible for a photo on page 107 you have to scan the entire acknowledgements section. No equipment credits are given although some of the photos look like catalog pix and the experienced eye will detect products not currently available in the US. The book cover shown above is not the cover on the book I received which shows a rather pedestrian garden walkway with pagoda (!) lights and a faucet and coiled garden hose instead of the sumptuous Japonisme entry."},{"Title":"Garden Lighting","review":"A year or so ago, we did some major garden renovation, painted the exterior of our house and the perennial garden had its fifth birthday and celebrated by exploding into blossom. Summer evenings on the patio became a habit and I began casting around for lighting ideas. Professionals wanted to add enough light to do brain surgery at enormous expense, and solar lights weren't bright enough, no matter how many we installed. Kits didn't contain the right combination of components (no landing strip pagoda lights, please) and there was the color issue--we both really dislike the bluish tint of a lot of big box store lighting, and some of our friends had horror stories about the expense and durability of some brand name kits. So what to do?I did some research and two books were repeatedly recommended; this one and another that sells for just under a hundred dollars. Being cheap (which is why I'm doing this myself) I purchased this one, and I can't imagine that the other one containes any more useful information than this one. While most of the pictures are of very elaborate landscaping, some taking lighting to an unnatural extreme, the real juice of this book is in easy to understand explanations of electricity, wiring runs and types of fixtures. Referring to this book, and using the pictures only as illustrations of what different fixtures can do, I was able to lay out a low-voltage lighting plan for the patio and yard in about three days. All the components are readily available, either through home improvement stores or the internet, and if you know what you're looking for, at a much higher quality and only slightly higher price than some of the brand names kits. I'm looking forward to enjoying some rather (ahem) innovative lighting effects next summer!This is that rare bird; a genuinely helpful do it yourself book (though it recommends having a licensed electrician do the work, my plan is low voltage, and since I can't electrocute myself, why pay big $$$?). It won't do the work for you, but is a terrific investment if you have the time, inclination and patience."},{"Title":"Modern Japanese coins with prices by date and grade: Complete with latest available mintage figures","review":"and mostly interesting as a historical document.I stumbled upon this one, no picture, and no real description and took a bit of a chance purchasing it. It is a pamphlet type booklet, with just a few pages of old style typewritten ruminations regarding Japanese numismatics by the author/coin seller. Very amateurish appearance by today's slick computer generated world, but for the period, typical. The content, other than the ruminations, is a listing of the Meiji era 'modern coins' through to the Showa 1964 coin types and price listings by quality. I think most interesting and worthy of note are the mintage figures as known for the day.An interesting document for the numismatic nerds (myself included). Interestingly when I googled the authors name I did find a pdf of the book. If you are considering this item, look that up and you can decide if you want/need the paper version. I think it's cool, but not needed for a core collection.JTG"},{"Title":"Under the crescent moon: Rebellion in Mindanao","review":"Do you want to know about the origins of the modern war in the Southern Philippines?Beginning with the Jabidah Massacre that has not been written about since the 1960s to the signing of the Peace Accord with the Moro National Liberation Front in 1996 that brought some quiet in Sulu and Basilan. The book was just available at bookstore shelves as the conflict with the MILF renewed in Central Mindanao and the later kidnapping and hostage ransom drama that brought Jolo and the Southern Philippines back to the worlds attention.From the back cover of the book--\\"The story of Mindanao is truly much more than a story of war. But war's very persistence on that great island suggests that the peace and progress Mindanaoans crave- Muslims, Christians, and Lumad--cannot be reached without first revisiting the sources of conflict and retracing its tortuous path to the present.This book is an exhaustively researched, evenhanded, and briskly written report on the Mindanao that most Filipinos read about everyday but have never really known. It holds great value for scholars and pedestrians alike: a sifted mass of detail that often reads like a political thriller.All the characters of great drama are here--upstage, downstage, and in the shadows--and all the powerful emotions; courage, betrayal, anguish, and even the occasional flash of humor. To read it is to begin to understand, after all these centuries, what Manila, Mindanao, Malaysia and Mecca have integrally to do with one another.\\""},{"Title":"Suzuki Outboard Shop Manual: 75-225 Hp Two-Stroke : 1992-1999 (Includes Jet Drives)","review":"Bought this for my husband for his birthday.

I looked forward to this book and rushed through things to get to it. I then read it and read it, when I should have done other things. I finished it in a day where I did very little else. This testifies how Paris After the Liberation is a great and interesting read.Yet, I think this book is unfocused. Beevor and Cooper really needed to decide whether they were writing a book about the City of Paris in the Liberation and life and events in it, or a history of France from 1944 until 1968. The focus shifts in too many places from goings on and life in the city to the national political alignment in France, international events affecting France, and relations between other countries dealing with France, political events in France outside the city, etc.Likewise Beevor and Cooper's view of the city of Paris tends to be unbalanced. They focus on the city of tourism and myth rather than the city most Pariseans live in. They give us only a few pages of description of the misery, poverty, disease, starvation, and neglect in the outer working class suburbs. They provie a paragraph about the prison-like experience of workers at Billancourt where Renault is. They have not one word about the working class and poverty-stricken faubourgs inside the city. Instead, Beevor and Cooper concentrate on the life of major intellectuals, upper class socialities, and above all the English-speaking diplomatic circles and returning exilesIf you want to know the details of the life of British Ambassador Duff Cooper, his various extra-maritial affairs, taste in decoration, friendship, advice to French politicians, advice to the British government, this is the book for you. If you want to know what it was like to live in Paris from 1944 until 1952 as an average working class or lower middle class citizen who is not a writer or a painter and who does not socialize at embassies, world class restaurants, or hotels, you need another book. This is about the Paris of public myth,the Paris of politicans and millionares, and not about the Paris that the great bulk of its people lived in and continue to live in.I think this book would be very hard to understand for someone who does not understand French, is not familiar with the city of Paris, and is not familiar with the array of political, cultural, socialite, and artistic figures that Beevor and Cooper present without explanation.I speak French, have spent time in Paris not as tourist, and have studied and written about French History and politics for decades. Yet, I found this book both exhilarating and hard to keep up with as names and places whirled past me and had to stop and remember the city's geography. I don't know what someone who can't read French would make of the many statements in French produced with no translation?One of the interesting aspects of this book is Beevor's use of documents unearthed since the fall of Soviet Union about the French Communist party. In doing so, he provides a good picture of the utter contempt Stalin and his bureacrats had for the working people of France and the world, and Stalin's continued determination to use the PCF not as a tool for social change in France, but as a puppet to secure diplomatic advantages with the imperialist leaders of Europe and the United States.Beevor and Cooper explain that the PCF began to lose its support in 1944 when it became clear to French workers that the party was not going to lead French workers and farmers to power. Once connections with Moscow were restored and exiled leader Maurice Thorez returned, the PCF organized itself to increase production, \\"stop strikes,\\" as Thorez was wont to stay, and allowed the peaceful return of French capitalism.To be sure the PCF remained a major political party, but as Beevor indirectly explained, this was due to middle class intellectuals flocking to the party as workers left. Later in the late 1940s when the PCF aimed at spoiling actions whose purpose was to disrupt the Marshall plan and stiffen France's opposition to the West's plan to build a strong West Germany as a military bulwark against the USSR, the PCF brought about disaster.What I found the most interesting was Beevor and Cooper's pictures of the lives and intellectual development of Jean Paul Sartre and Simon De Beauvoir, Camus and other Paris intellectuals during these years. Though I think Beevor and Cooper tend to have a bias against De Beauvoir, I would loved to hear more about them and less about the sexual affairs of various English socialities and diplomats.The final chapters takes the reader through the 1950s and 1960s very quickly. The focus on the city of Paris is really lost, so we don't know anything about the big changes in life and lifestyle, the explosion of new art, film, literature, and politics that happened. As the book goes on and loses focus, inaccuracies unworthy of Beevor and Cooper start to appear. Rather than describing life in Paris, Beevor and Cooper seem to end this book by trying to settle political scores with a generation of the French who were barely born in 1944-1950.I would have loved a book focused on real life in Paris during these years with the necessary background in French and global politics, a picture of the real city and not just the tourist city. On the other hand, a political history of France from 1944 to 1950 by Beevor and Cooper would have been a wonderful work. Perhaps, a book on the social world of the upper classes, the intellectual elite, and foreign dignataries and diplomats might also be interesting. However, this is the best we've got from Beevor and Cooper on this topic, and it can be enjoyed.See Paris like a native, not a tourist!"},{"Title":"Paris After the Liberation 1944-1949: Revised Edition","review":"Paris after the Liberation has captured the imagination like no other Nazi-liberated city (sure, there's \\"Roma, Citta Aperta\\", but can any non-Italian mention any intellectual or politician living in Rome in 1944?). Maybe it's because the French are better at self-promotion. Maybe it's because their history is more dramatic than others (4 major revolutions- 1789, 1830, 1848 and 1871-in less than a century), or because Paris is a better setting for a good story (remember Les Miserables, or a Tale of Two Cities), but the happenings in Paris in 1944-1949 are compulsively readable.The scene is dramatic: it moves from avant-guard theatres to banquet halls, from smelly bistros to worker tenements, from Les Champs Elysees to Saint-Germain-Des-Pres. The cast is outstanding: doddering Petain, haughty De Gaulle, decent Mauriac, ambitious Malraux, brilliang Sartre, Camus, Hemingway, Picasso, Celine, Brassillach, Drieu, plus a large cast of fanatical communists and anti-semites, ignorant American senators, well-connected British spies and hairy proto-Kerouacs. Everything comes together: military and political matters, social and artistic trends, intellectual developments. Paris, in 1944-1949, was shabby and run-down, its people hungry and ill-scrubbed (although that's perhaps a recurring theme), but it was the mecca of the world. Anyone who was anyone was there.Beevor and Cooper tell the story well. They are able to add much flavour to the well-known facts by judicious use of diaries and private papers. One feels like one was there. I wouldn't have minded it myself."},{"Title":"Paris After the Liberation 1944-1949: Revised Edition","review":"I like all of Beevor's books I've read so far, and this one is no exception. My only real criticism is that he has a nasty habit of quoting people in their native tongue (French in this case) without translation, which I found very annoying. Besides that, I thought the subject was brilliant and presented well. What I took away from this book is that the French, perhaps more so that other European nations, were a series of paradoxes both during and after the German occupation; simultaneously collaborators and resistants, arch-conservatives and communists, openly hostile to and embracing the influx of American culture. No one term can be used to pigeonhole them."},{"Title":"Paris After the Liberation 1944-1949: Revised Edition","review":"This is a interesting joint project from husband-and-wife team Antony Beevor and Artemis Cooper. As one reviewer has noted, this book has somewhat of a split personality -- there is a lot of history on the strength of the Communists in postwar France and their subsequent repudiation by most mainstream French as a result of the show trials, but there is also a great deal of kind of celebrity history. The two make for an odd mix and prevent the book from feeling very cohesive, but nonetheless one does learn a lot about Paris (and France) in this era.The authors do want to make the most they can from their access to the papers of Duff Cooper (he was the British Ambassador at the time; Ms. Cooper is his granddaughter), so that also makes for an uneven focus, but shines a light on yet another aspect of the postwar years.Overall -- unbalanced focus, but you will learn about the period, and the writing itself is good."},{"Title":"Paris After the Liberation 1944-1949: Revised Edition","review":"This is definitely worth reading, covering an ill-understood time in French history. I really enjoyed Beevor's the Fall of Berlin and Stalingrad, and was expecting much from this book. For the most part, it delivers. However, it could have used a more sharp-eyed editor. Some examples: Personages (like Juliette Greco) are introduced without any background, (the background appears later in the book), the index is flimsy, (many people referred to in the book are simply missing from the Index), and Simone de Beauvoir is intermittently (and for no evident reason) referred to as \\"Castor\\"(I understand it was her nickname). Ultimately, it is a good means of understanding France's difficulty in coming to terms with German occupation and the Vichy government."},{"Title":"Paris After the Liberation 1944-1949: Revised Edition","review":"I have enjoyed many books by Mr. Beevor, and this one is as well-written and infornative as his others. Everyone knows, at least in some way, the story of WWII and the Occupation of Paris, but most of us do not know what happened in that city, and in France, after it was liberated. This book fills in our gap in that knowledge quite well, and it shows that France was really on the front lines of the Cold War during the latter part of the 1940's. We read of the humanitarian and generous contributions of the US to the initial recovery of France, and how its leadership strove mightly to regain a stable government while. at the same time, trying their best of overcome the stigma of Vichy. What amazes me is that there is such a lack of gratitude among the French to the US for all that we have done for them in the 20th century. This book shows that, once again, \\"No good deed goes unpunished\\"."},{"Title":"Paris After the Liberation 1944-1949: Revised Edition","review":"After reading Beevor's history of the Spanish Civil War, I had high hopes for this book, and it did not disappoint. Today we have largely forgotten the crucial events of the immediate post war period, and the role of France and Paris in those events. This book brings that period back. As a former resident of Blvd St. Germain, I especially enjoyed the recounting of the role played by people, clubs, restaurants, and publications of the Left Bank."},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"I am a big fan of Mothering Against The Odds, and anyone undaunted by the stellar line up of scholars, academicians and therapists - mothers all - will be richly rewarded. I was worried that this would be an academic workout of a read, but was drawn from page to page, spellbound by the stories of mothers, each searching for her truth and resisting further marginalization in doing so. The book feels like a conversation among friends in a way that includes the reader as a mother resistor, empowering her with the light of truth telling and consoling each of us not only with the sameness and horror of our collective shadows, but the power to resist more marginalization. This is a perfect Mother's Day or any day present for every mother in all of our lives. It was a real gift to me, both elevating the conversations with mother friends held out of the coach's or teacher's or doctor's auditory range and validating them, as well as welcoming me into a thoughtful group of mothers, adding a new layer of oomph to my own resistance. There were many chapters I approached with the expectation that I would be a reader experiencing an &quot;other,&quot; and instead I was moved by a deep seeded commonality. Knowing what I know about real dialogue with pediatricians, (all of my children's, but especially my son's) coaches, school administrators, teachers, (especially the teachers of my adolescent children) - even as a privileged mother in a conventional heterosexual family, I feel more sameness than difference with the &quot;special&quot; categories of mothers in each chapter of your volume. All mothers do experience marginalization, a relegation to the sidelines of our growing children's lives with the concomitant shame undermining our pride when loving involvement persists. A careful reading of this volume also invokes shame that comes with significant enlightenment for any way that I may have contributed to shoving &quot;other&quot; mothers into the shadows. With the wisdom of this volume, I can see myself as a confident mother resistor and truth teller and not simply the persistent nuisance I fear some of my children's teachers and many of their friends' parents perceive me to be. Each chapter carries a strong message for each of us, not for &quot;others.&quot; I am empowered by the bravery of teen mothers resisting the mold with which their welfare workers try to choke them. As a consummate letter writer, many of them unsent, I am empowered by Dr. Cynthia Garcia Coll and her colleagues' account of an incarcerated letter writing mother who stayed connected with her child and her own truth in writing letters that likely never reached him. I am emboldened by Miriam Greenspan's conviction born of many mothers' experience: &quot;ours is...an emotion phobic culture,&quot; as I recall the pathologizing of my emotionally attuned children by well intentioned teachers when my children's' fears and sensibilities did not mesh with convention. I am liberated by Dr. Janet Surrey and her colleagues' careful unfolding of the adoptive experience and the enlivening picture of adoption &quot;as much a recovery from loss as it is loss itself.&quot; I love the conviction presented as part of Dr. Laura Benkov's description of families headed by lesbians and gay men, but also as a truth woven throughout the volume, that &quot;it is the quality of our relationships rather than the structure of our families that matters most in human development.&quot; And the most chilling truth of all, from Dr. Phoebe Kazdin Schnitzer, apropos single mothers, but easily applied to the actual story of any mother, and in fact, the shadow side of this volume: &quot;This is marginalization up close - moving from stereotypes to inhibited interactions.&quot; And when each of us settles down and recalls the ways in which our mothering life has been constricted by cultural norms, or when each of us joins in our own rich conversations with other mothers or the rich conversational markers throughout the volume, it is a dark reality that confronts us, both more and less frightening because it is a shared one."},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"I was pleased when I encountered Mothering Against the Odds as I was selecting course books for my undergraduate class. And, my pleasure increased when I realized how stimulated my students were with reading and discussing it. They could see in a new way the full meaning of marginalization and resistance through the development of the &quot;liberatory voice.&quot; The authors' lucid definition of marginalization and the sociopolitical act of resistance served as a guiding analytical principle for the reading and discussion about women's lives as mothers. The diversity presented was eye-opening. The new ways in which the students could encounter their own mothers was quite moving. The opportunity this reading gave these women to voice their recognition of margenalization in their own lives and their desire to engage in the social task of re-valuing motherhood and acts of mothering was unique. After this successful academic experience, I featured Mothering Against the Odds as a Book of the Month on the Wise Woman Productions website. In response several of our members requested a discussion group to consider the many provocative issues raised by the book."},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"This is a stunning volume of maternal voices that are usually ignored. We hear from poor mothers, mothers of color, homeless and incarcerated mothers, single, lesbian, adoptive and teen mothers. These mothers, taken together are the true face of American motherhood. I really love this book."},{"Title":"Mothering Against the Odds: Diverse Voices of Contemporary Mothers","review":"The lives of the women we meet in Mothering Against the Odds provide the reader with a new awareness of the complexities of child-rearing in the United States today. The editors of this volume, clinicians, researchers, educators, theoreticians and writers, were initially drawn together by their common interest in establishing a community where they could share their experiences in parenting. Their own sense of personal and intellectual isolation as mothers spurred them to examine the multiplicity of mother-roles faced by all women; the resulting volume is the work of eighteen writers and scholars. Garcia Coll, et al frame their discussion of mothering in a format of personal narratives which reveal the individual challenges faced by those who mother at the so-called margins of society. The editors' choice of these narratives of women mothering came from their awareness that the diverse experiences shaping mothers' experiences are untreated in contemporary discussion of society's problems. The chapters illustrate a variety of mothering experiences: stories of women with biracial and exceptional children, mothers with HIV/AIDS; immigrant, homeless, single, adoptive, incarcerated, and teen mothers. Three conversations with the editors are interspersed within the text which highlight themes emerging from the individual stories of mothering. Each chapter stands alone as moving account of a mother's struggles and triumphs in a particular instance; all the chapters are tied together by the common thread of the voice of the mother's experience in each instance. The reader is left with a sense of the formidable tasks faced by those who are so often invisible in our society and yet who are coping and contributing successfully in many ways that leave one humbled. The voices of these mothers are the voices and lives that sociologists, psychologists, and of course educational policy makers, need to consider as they pursue ways to improve the lives of our children and of our families. While this is an academic book it also is a highly accessible and readable book for all those who have an interest in children, women and families. Above all, the stories told here represent lives of triumph, lives of women quietly confronting many problems usually hidden from the public view. And the editors state their intent to continue their study of mothering and the varied contexts women live in; we certainly hope they will. While the reader is left with many troubling questions, we also hope that through a consideration of the dignity of the lives of these women we can bring about change. Mothering Against the Odds is a must read for all those concerned with issues related to families today."},{"Title":"Common Good--Common Ground","review":"Reading through this book is like visiting old friends or acquainting myself with new ones.

Dr. Jones uses his significant research ability and powerful writing skills to craft a very convincing argument. Rich foundations, working under a 501(c)(3) cloak, funded research into an &quot;aesthetically acceptable&quot; contraceptive to market to Catholics. This issued in the estrogen-progesterone pill, which was shilled by a Catholic physician, John Rock. At the same time, Fr. Hesburgh and other academics, hungering for the foundations' research money, set up Notre Dame and other universities as centers of dissent from traditional Christian (not just Catholic) teaching on artificial contraception.The description of the destruction of Philadelphia's inner city by block-busting, intentionally engineered by East-coast liberals, is worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"John Cardinal Krol & the Cultural Revolution","review":"How did Charles Curran disrupt Catholic U?

Without this kind of background, those who attempt to read Machiavelli's most famous work, THE PRINCE, will find their efforts to be frustrating and futile. Strathern's little book is best seen as a useful adjunct to and preparation for Machiavelli's works, not as a kind of CLIFF'S NOTES which provides a systematic delineation of his contribution to political thought (although Strathern does help the reader to understand Machiavelli's view of political theory &quot;as a kind of science independent of morals&quot;). Strathern offers a good contribution with his brief comparison and contrast of Machiavelli's THE PRINCE and DISCOURSES ON LIVY, alerting the reader to the more temperate and considered contribution to political theory provided by the latter work. As Strathern notes, in THE PRINCE, Machiavelli writes from the ruler's point of view, providing guidance for the ruthless consolidation of power. However, in DISCOURSES, he writes from the citizens' point of view, giving them advice on how to run things, &quot;especially how to achieve freedom within the state.&quot; In relation to the latter, Strathern cites Machiavelli's seemingly out-of-character assertion that &quot;people are more prudent, more stable, and have better judgment than a prince.&quot; All in all, Strathern writes clearly and engagingly, although he tends to indulge in a bit of historical gossip (e.g., his discussion of Cesare Borgia's sister, Lucrezia, daughter of Pope Alessandro VI). In sum, this book is useful as an introduction to Machiavelli's contributions, but is not an adequate substitution for a reading of Machiavelli's works."},{"Title":"Machiavelli in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"Even though you should be able to read it in well under 90 minutes, it does deliver what it says. More a biography of the improtant world-view shaping events in Machiavelli's life. Thin on what Machiavelli actually said and what it means. Maybe the author assumes you already knew. Nevertheless, a good read and worth the few dollars it costs."},{"Title":"Machiavelli in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"Strathern's book provided a concise account of Machiavelli and his ideas. The book contained numerous selections from Machiavelli's writings, including a brief list for those who wish to discover more. At the end of the book there was a chronology placing Machiavelli within his own time and the broader scheme of philosophy.Strathern did a phenomenal job of explaining a potentially confusing man in a few pages. I loved this book because it was short and to the point. Strathern wrote so well that he even makes the reader like Machiavelli. The book was the best brief overview of Machiavelli that I have ever read, and I have already written two papers on the great philosopher."},{"Title":"Machiavelli in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"There is an error on page 56. Thomas More's Utopia was first published in 1516, not 1513. He is correct that Thomas More coined the term utopia with his book of the same name and that this was published three years after The Prince was written in 1513, but he then says that Utopia was published in the same year.I had thought I found a second error but I just had two names confused. On page 68 it says that Giuliano de' Medici no longer ruled Florence (his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici took power) in 1513 (but before The Prince was finished) and then on page 73 it said that in 1523 Giulio de' Medici relinquished his rule of Florence to become Pope Clement VII. [In 1523 while Giulio was still in power he made Machiavelli the official historian for Florence, which resulted in his book Florentine History (published posthumously in 1532, this not mentioned in the book) where he tried to write a history of Florence without putting any blame on the Medici family.] It was a little while before I noticed that Giuliano and Giulio were not the same name. I forgot that on the bottom of page 71 it says that in 1519 Lorenzo de' Medici died and then was succeeded by Giulio. The author did say to not confuse Lorenzo de' Medici with Lorenzo the Magnificent, who became leader of Florence the same year Machiavelli was born (1469) and then died the same year Columbus reached America (1492).Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and I will definitely read The Prince to hopefully better understand despotic rulers."},{"Title":"Machiavelli in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"As with all the works in this series this work is clearly written and provides a good outline of the life and the work. Machiavelli is seen by Strathern as a wily and subtle man of action and tells the story of his political career well. The turning point comes as it sometimes does in life with a failure. When Machiavelli loses his political position he retires to his Tuscany estate and there writes the masterpiece for which he will be infamous and famous. As Strathern understands him Machiavelli is above all a keen observer of the political world he knew who described what he saw and understood in the Italian Renaissance world of political in- fighting. 'The Prince's is the handbook which tells the Ruler how to maintain his power. And the ruthlessness, lack of Christian sentiment, required is essential to the prescription. Better to be feared than to be loved, though of course desirable to be both. The formula Machiavelli gives for ruling requires ' virtu' which Strathern perhaps incorrectly likens to Nietzsche's will-to-power. Keeping the ruler in power according to Machiavelli also requires other measures such as not relying on mercenaries, and seizing opportunities for compromise as his native Florence failed to do when it might have in doing so preserved its freedom."},{"Title":"Machiavelli in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"I'm perplexed by the people who write angrily about the &quot;90 Minutes&quot; series because they are disappointed not to find a serious, in depth treatment of the works of these philosophers. The books obviously don't purport to be anything but what they are: an entertaining, high level view of basic concepts and life history.The author shows in this book how Machiavelli's life and times may have affected his writings. I have other books that delve into Machiavelli's philosophy, but none of them mention his personal circumstances and history, which surely would affect his writing and philosophy. These books are good in that they put these great thinkers in a social and historical context which many books fail to do.I enjoyed the books I've read by this author a great deal."},{"Title":"Machiavelli in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"It is impossible to understand Machiavelli in 90 minutes, or even 90 days, though I have no doubt that books like this sell.

The wide range and the abbreviated nature of the books allow us to better understanding each of these philosophers within the context of the others. My only suggestion is that he put dates on the spines, so the series can be more easily arranged in chronological order on a bookshelf.Bruce Glass--author of Exploring Faith and Reason: The Reconciliation of Christianity and Biological Evolution"},{"Title":"Machiavelli in 90 Minutes (Philosophers in 90 Minutes Series)","review":"It was such a pleasure to read about a historical figure in 90 minutes and get a solid picture and the essence of Machiavelli without having had to go into an in-depth study. It changed my view of the man knowing that the environment and historical period in which he lived were responsible for forming him into who he was. In addition, his basic character which was intelligent and very perceptive would probably have been better and more positively highlighted under different circumstances. He was not what he wrote by accident but witnessing his environment sharpened him to be the best, at least in theory if not practice, of hostile political statecraft."},{"Title":"The Rebel: Johnny Yuma","review":"As a kid, I was a rabid fan of the old TV series, \\"The Rebel\\" starring the late Nick Adams. As an adult, how could I possibly resist a novel based on that series, especially when it's written by the man who created and produced the series, as well as writing episodes and writing the theme song! (Any true fan of the show can probably still sing you that song, originally sung by no less than Johnny Cash.)Are we talking about the great American novel, here? Not even close. This book, which picks up the story of Johnny Yuma towards the end of the Civil War and then follows him on his journey home, has a very episodic feel to it. The author is clearly a man who's more used to writing acts of a play or episodes of a show instead of authoring a cohesive book. By itself, the writing and the story would rate 3 stars.Let's face it, though: if you're buying this book, it's probably because you have fond memories of the show. This is your chance to read the story of Johnny Yuma by the man who created the character! As a side benefit, it also retains the feature of the show that made it stand out from the other Westerns of the day, Johnny Yuma's journal. The nostalgia factor and the use of the all-important journal hook earn the book it's fourth star.Try it - - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Rebel: Johnny Yuma","review":"It was a very nice book to listen to on my I-phone!

Stanley Jones","review":"This biography follows upon the heels of Graham's previous work on Jones's theology (The Totalitarian Kingdom of God) and it is the first serious biography done on this major figure in twentieth century Christianity. Ordinary Man, Extraordinary Mission is a careful, chronological account touching on the major events of Jones's life and drawing from an extensive collection of private letters and papers. Graham is a political scientist and brings detailed coverage to Jones's political activities, especially in regards to Indian independence and then later in the Pacific tensions preceding World War II. Graham details Jones's consistent anti-racist views and actions, and his impact upon the early Civil Rights Movement in America. We also get a clear sense of the personal interest Jones had in his Federal Union of Churches plan, which now seems so dated and quaint in conception. Graham does a wonderful job of laying out the development of Jones's Kingdom theology and his attempts to apply these principles in the real world. Jones's commitment to the \\"Inner Voice\\" and his daring obedience to it is consistently put forth. Jones's openness to interreligious dialogue and yet his maintenance of a clear Christ-centered commitment remains a relevant model. Graham doesn't do much with the private Jones. We get little sense of who he was behind the scenes. For example, what was his marriage like and how did it bear up with his frequent travels? Graham gives the impression, perhaps unintentionally, of a very private man with few close friends. I am more curious than Graham about the hundreds of evangelistic crusades Jones preached: How were they organized? By whom? What kind of follow-up took place? How might their lasting impact be measured? Finally, how does one explain the radical political trajectory of Jones's vision given his conservative holiness training, his limited reading and study, and his folksy style. If it is true that Jones should be seen as a \\"proto-liberation theologian\\" (David Bundy) then how did those views develop? What can explain such a unique (and I would say compelling) Christian vision during a century when the American church was so polarized between conservatives and liberals?"},{"Title":"Creative International Cookbook","review":"I was originally given this cookbook by my grandmother 20 years ago, and I used it so much it completely fell apart.

Carnap's \\"assimilation\\" of Tarski and Goedel's limitative results with respect to the logical syntax of language did not cause him to completely abandon the habits of mind he had accustomed himself to, but led him to write a series of books on semantics. And in this third volume, his last major work on the philosophy of language, Carnap extends his analysis to include modal phenomena (possibility and necessity) which were formerly intellectually distasteful to the Vienna Circle. The volume is rounded out with a number of papers, including Carnap's famous \\"Empiricism, Semantics and Ontology\\" and a discussion of Charles W. Morris' tripartite division of semiotics.Although Quine (whom Carnap engaged in a spirited correspondence with concerning these topics) spent a great deal of time during the '50s and '60s demonstrating the logical inconsistency of Carnap's analysis, this book is very much an \\"implementation\\" of Carnap's Principle of Tolerance concerning modalities and their role in semantic analysis: although Carnap is usually understood as a slightly lax Fregean, here he presents a formalization of Frege alongside multiple theories of his own. Furthermore, all subsequent work in intensional logic and the semantics of modal logic owes something to Carnap's treatment of \\"possible worlds\\" in terms of state-descriptions: contemporary modal logic has rather less to do with the metaphysics of modality than with the issues of descriptive adequacy raised by possible-worlds semantics and addressed at length in Barwise and Perry's *Situations and Attitudes* (a book which would not have existed but for this one, as perhaps could be honestly said of many linguistic works informed by \\"generative semantics\\"). All in all, an important document of postwar intellectual life and a model for genuinely critical analysis -- an excellent buy."},{"Title":"Meaning and Necessity: A Study in Semantics and Modal Logic","review":"This is the OLDER Edition!!!

Unfortunately, it also provides some examples of the weaknesses.The description from Booklist (above) provides a good summary of the size and scope of the work (although the publisher claims 900 rather than 875 articles). According to the publisher's Web site, \\"Articles range from 500-word entries on inventors, theoreticians, and industry leaders to overarching, 8,000-word essays on markets, industries, and labor. ... The general conceptual categories of the work are: Geography (entries on cities, countries, and regions); Agriculture; Production Systems, Business History, and Technology; Demography; Institutions, Governments, and Markets; Macroeconomic History and International Economics; Money, Banking and Finance; Labor; Natural Resources and the Environment; and Biographies.\\" Here are a few samples of article titles: Linen Industry: Overview, Technological Change; List, Georg Friedrich; Literacy;Livestock Leases; Living Standards; Local Banks; Local Public Goods; Lombardy; London; Philips Family; Phillips Curve; Pigs; Pilkington Family; Piracy; Pirenne, Henri; Plantation System; Poland: Early and Medieval Periods, Early Modern Period, Modern Period. There are frequent images, diagrams, graphs, and thematic maps, most of which add significant information.Some people have wrung their hands over the alleged \\"Eurocenticism\\" of this encyclopedia. As someone who has a real need for good information about the economic history of non-European parts of the world I can sympathize, but I think the criticism is very misplaced. Economic history and analytical history in general is a subject invented by Europeans and until recently practiced almost exclusively by Europeans and people of European culture living in former colonies of European settlement. Even with scholars from other cultural backgrounds now entering the field in some numbers we cannot look forward to any quick fix, simply because the Europeans seem to have left a great deal better records than most other societies. In many cases it is going to take a lot of delving into very obscure fragmentary records coupled with painstaking archeological work to improve our state of knowledge measurably.Most articles are very good and some are masterful. The best, naturally, tend to be written by deep and renowned students of their subjects. Some articles are mediocre, and there are a few real bombs. The articles dealing with Europe and related subjects tend to have the most meat. Some of the non-European articles are very good, however, like Robin Yates' on Ancient and Feudal China and Kent Deng's on the Tang, Song, and Yuan Dynasties. Others are limp owing to lack of good information or lack of skill in presenting what is known. Most frustrating, some present one side of an important and fruitful on-going scholarly debate, leaving the reader with a seriously distorted impression and giving him or her no leads to follow for real enlightenment. This does not happen a great deal, but much more often than it should, given the ambitions and claims of this work.Nevertheless, I am glad to have access to a library with this encyclopedia on its shelves, and urge other libraries to follow the example.

The author's style and syntax is pure Victorian, through and through with wonderfully convoluted sentences, and indeed, paragraphs. This work, which takes place during the mid 1800s, circa 1840, is the story of a young man in a English Public School (which, unlike in the U.S. is actually a private school to which only the elite can afford to attend). This story takes off after Tom, our hero, has graduated from Rugby and is now attending Oxford. Tom is oler now, and as to be expected, his social consciene, and envolves all the entails. While not absolute, this work is obviously autobiographical in nature. When this work is read, the reader must keep in mind when it was written, the society in which it was written and most importantly, the attitude of the society in which it was written. I was first introduced to this work well over forty years ago and have given it several reads since that time. I strongly suspect that many young readers of today may find the syntax difficult at first, but if they press on, there is so much to learn from this book. As another reviewer well pointed out, some of the events addressed here are not what you would call \\"politically correct\\" by our standards to day in this country, but then we must remember when and where it was written. Any student of the history of literature or a student of our language will most likely be fascinated with this work. I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Tom Brown at Oxford: A sequel to School days at Rugby","review":"This book is the sequel to the English school-boy classic Tom Brown School Days. However, while Tom Brown School Days has been continuously republished since its first edition in 1857, Tom Brown at Oxford has not been republished since 1910. In this edition, the protagonist is again an incarnation of Thomas Hughes' own life, this time his experiences as an athletic and rambunctious undergraduate at Oxford in the tumultuous 1840's. Tom Brown, like Hughes, is drawn into the upheavel of his times, specifically the socialist uprisings that found a more popular literary voice in several of Charles Dickens' works. Brown is also a commited Christian and his socialism is tied up with his faith. I have made this book an annual read because I find that the compromises and the ambitions of the times have not changed as much in the last 160 years as some people might have thought. Hughes' challenges the modern reader to look past our proclivity toward passivity and cynicism and to believe that real change, both individually and as a culture can happen. He also paints a pretty compelling vision of why this is desireable."},{"Title":"The Odyssey of Homer Illustrated in Slipcase","review":"The Heritage Press edition of the Odyssey features the historically significant Alexander Pope translation and illustrations by John Flaxman.Elegant and restained, this edition has a matte gold-colored slipcase, a navy exterior blindstamped with rules in a Greek key pattern, and gold details to the spine.Flaxman, almost a contemporary of Pope, was born in 1775.

It is still one of the most used cookbooks on my shelf, and I own over thirty cookbooks. I needed to buy a new copy because the one I have is slowly falling apart from constant use. So my thanks go out to the publisher for releasing this wonderful treasure. The best feature of this book is that each entre comes with a suggested side dish. This is helpful to beginners who aren't sure yet what goes with what. It takes some of the pressure off of needing to figure everything out all at once. The other wonderful thing about this book is that the recipes result in meals that are a pleasure even to the most advanced gourmets. I recommend this book to anyone interested in cooking great meals at home for themselves as well as for thier friends and family."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"I got turned on to the \\"60 Minute Gourmet\\" columns in the NYT 30 years ago by my then-girlfriend, a wonderful cook. I was amazed that I could produce such excellent and sophisticated dishes that were really simple to make. Best of all, the ingredients were all readily available at a regular grocery store. Franey's brief and informative recipe introductions were also interesting. Basically, he made quality French cooking accessible to amateurs like me.I bought the original \\"60 Minute Gourmet\\" and its sequel in hardcover back then, and still treasure and use them when I want to produce an impressive meal. My teenage daughter even likes the recipes! Since then, I've given the paperback versions as gifts to friends, and will give it once more this Christmas to my current girlfriend.

As a newlywed attending graduate school I was too poor and too time deprived to cook and eat. This book saved my life! Not knowing a thing about cooking... I happened upon perfection as a guide! Now, almost forty years later I am an accomplished cook and avid entertainer and it's all due to the foundation this book provided! I still think Jacques Pepin is the best celebrity chef on TV today.I just ordered the newer copy so I could give it to my niece as she embarks on her own cooking start. It is what I call a foundation book. There are five or six of these that never leave my kitchen no matter what new cook book may try to abscond their place in the hierarchy of my inventory.

But I still reach for this cookbook. Why? because it contains excellent recipies.This book is incredibly easy for a novice to understand and it will give a \\"seasoned\\" cook instructions how to prepare any dish in a new delicious way.I simply can't praise this cookbook enough.Another excellent cookbook is The Doubleday Cookbook by Jean Anderson & Elane Hanna.Actually, this book should be called the cookbook bible.Owning both these books will easily turn bad cook into a master chef!"},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"I bought a copy of the 60-minute Gourmet when I was a college student in the 1980s.

It doesn't have any nice pictures. It is not trendy in any way. But I think this is the best cookbook ever written. I first read Pierre Franey's NYT column while in university and it opened my eyes to the delights of good cooking by making me realize I could do it myself. His recipes are straightforward but elegant and whether you cook for one or for company, the results will always be pleasing. To cook Franey-style requires a minimum of time and ingredients but will inspire you to concentrate on the quality of your raw materials, the presentation and development of your own skills."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"The large print book is quite nice. The print is bold but doesn't \\"shout\\" at you, so it's easy on the eyes.

This was a much needed replacement."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"I have used most of the recipes in this wonderful cookbook of Pierre Franey's recipes. I have the 1979 hardcover edition with the intro by Craig Claiborne and it has been so well-used and loved that I decided to look for another copy for when my original falls apart! SIMPLE, EASY, yet still GOURMET dishes are the keywords for the recipes in this cookbook. I'm a mom to three kids under age 15 and even they enjoy these recipes. Franey has each main course on a double page spread, and includes suggestions and recipes for side dishes. There is a short intro paragraph for each main course with details and sometimes background as to how he developed the recipe and any tips for preparing/cooking the meal.I can't say enough good things about this cookbook, and it is one of the very few (less than a dozen) that I've kept after I downsized my cookbook collection."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"French cooking is not my real favorite and I have not really tried related recipes been to a French restaurant recently. But I have the 1979 version of this book. I had not tried this book for along time from my collection.( infact I think my wife bought it). Nevertheless while looking around for hamburger recipes, I found one in it that was quite good. 9.4/10 which included placing a fried egg and anchovies on top of the burger. Different. He also shows you how to set up his kitchen pantry. His recipes also cover Fish, soup , eggs, shellfish, beef , pasta and much more. His information about different recipes give you an insight into not only the recipes So I will have to try more. The recipes are not that difficult to make and there are quite a few to try. You might want to try some French recipes as I started to do ."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"Really, you just can't go wrong. There are no 'vanity' recipes in here (you know the ones, with 87 ingredients and impossible-to-find spices), only simple and flawless dishes that have been proven over time to be winners. I first got this book on the recommendation of a professional chef, and was very suspicious that it would be completely beyond my meager abilities. I was pleased to discover that everything about this book is straightforward, and no matter what your cooking level is you CAN make EVERY SINGLE RECIPE even if you are a cooking novice. It's a little heavy on the cream in some recipes, so I recommend more for special occasions and weekends than every day cooking - although there are quite a few healthier recipes in there as well.Favorite recipes? Chicken Scarpariello (took me all of 25 minutes, start to finish), Shell Steak in Vinager &amp; Cream sauce (will impress big-time)."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet by Pierre Franey was the first cookbook I ever bought for myself--literally. Now I own about 7 cookbooks or so, and this one is still by favorite.Every dish I tried from the book was enjoyable, and in most cases absolutely delicious. And remember, before this book I knew NOTHING about cooking. (Well, I did know how to fry water.) The directions are easy to follow, and recipes for great tasting side dishes are included with each entree.My guests usually raved about the dishes I prepared, including both main and side dishes. For some strange reason, as instructed in the recipes, I enjoy having to add a specific ingredient, wait a couple of minutes, add another one, etc. and etc. until every element of the dish is &quot;just right.&quot; Kinda adds a bit of fun to the process.Some of Franey's dishes can be calorie laden, however, which can be especially trying for Americans with large appetites. But just cut back a little on that portion of the meal (eating some fat, but not too much, will hold you a lot longer).One of my favorites: His spaghetti dish with large shrimp and capers. My guests went bonkers over it!Does it really take only 60 minutes to create one of Franey's meals? Well not me, as I tend to overthink the process, or just lose things behind the stove. But if you are an experienced, well-organized cook (or chef), a 60 minute preparation time for wonderful, interesting meals sounds totally right by me.Wolfy"},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"'60 Minute Gourmet' and \`More 60 Minute Gourmet' are collections of New York Times columns written by the prominent French born and trained chef Pierre Franey, who attained celebrity by being the executive chef at La Pavilion, considered by Craig Claiborne at the beginning of his New York Times career as the only truly worthy \`haute cuisine' venue in New York City.On the surface, it may seem that these volumes are simply precursors to Mark Bittman's \`The Minimalist' columns in the same New York Times or to Rachael Ray's very successful 30 Minute Meal genre. While there are strong family resemblences between these three writers, there are also significant differences. Most of these differences arise from the fact that While Bittman and Ray are journalist / educator / writers, Franey was a classically trained chef.This distinction is crystal clear in the way Franey describes his audience and how they live their lives. With the greatest of respect, I sense that Franey sees his audience as just stepping out of a \`New Yorker' cartoon of upper West side coop dwellers who shop at Zabars and who may expect the likes of R. W. Appel or Ruth Reichl to drop in for a quick bite on any given Thursday evening. One may be tempted to say \`this is not me', but give yourself a chance to believe that you can put yourself into this picture. Franey is saying that you can be prepared to entertain elegantly with even a minimal amount of time.Franey is crystal clear from the introduction of the first of these two books that he is not simplifying gourmet dishes, he is picking and choosing those classic French dishes which can be made in the home within 60 minutes. His message is that contrary to expectations, a lot of French cooking, even \`haute cuisine' can be made very simply. And, I have no argument with this. After browsing Escoffier's big book of recipes, I find about 50 different recipes for saut&eacute;ing chicken, every one of which can easily be done in 30 minutes or less.The most valuable lessons in these books are things that a professional chef does to expedite his own work. One of the hidden tricks behind Miss Rachael's speed is that she spends no time whatsoever looking for her ingredients. Franey reveals the technique that makes this all possible. He exhorts us to always have a place for everything and keep everything in its place. The easiest way to experience the value of this lesson is to try cooking in someone else's kitchen. His second big lesson is cleanliness, as much for efficiency as for hygiene. He says clutter and debris distract from efficiency.It is important to note that these two volumes have virtually identical tables of contents, so the \`More 60-Minute Meals' is literally more of the same. It's only additional topics are on appetizers and desserts. And, unlike his La Pavilion colleague, Jacques Pepin, I suspect Pierre is not as skillful with the pastry as is Jacques. Like Rachael Ray, a very large number of the recipes in these books are for grilled, saut&eacute;ed, or fried chicken, with an enormous variety of sauces. In fact, Miss Rachael just did a version of chicken Veronique that was remarkably similar to the recipe on page 22 of \`60-Minute Gourmet'. I honestly prefer Franey's version, as it uses white grapes while Rachael used red, and, Franey's instructions are written in plain English while Rachael uses her Rayspeak culinary dialect for a lot of basic terms. I would suspect that Miss Rachael had cribbed this recipe from Franey except that she made a major point of stating that the recipe was acquired from her future mother-in-law.What Rachael lacks in sophisticated technique, plain speech, and deep knowledge of French cuisine, she makes up by addressing the two of the three major issues I have with Franey. First, even 60 minutes may be a bit more than a tired Manhattenite may be able to manage, especially after a subway ride and a 5 block walk from the local supermarket. Second, Franey makes much of planning and prepping ahead of time. The fallacy of this and practically every other \`quick cooking' advice is that the problem is not only that there is little time at the end of the day, there is little time throughout the week. A third potential objection to Franey's books is that if there is so many \`haute cuisine' recipes which are really pretty easy, why not simply go to the mother lode and get a copy of Escoffier or Pellaprat for their 39 ways to poach eggs and 52 recipes for saut&eacute;ed chicken. The problem with this solution is that the search for the good recipes takes more time and investment in studying the techniques needed to prepare the short recipe description in these texts.Like Wolfgang Puck in a very recent book, Franey cuts down on the time required to prepare a recipe by combining into a single narrative all the steps and techniques you need so you don't have to seek out and learn a lot of ancillary recipes. Also, the classic French texts don't have the entertaining headnotes you can recite to impress your dinner guest(s).Thus, I really think Franey's books are best used as a resource for recipes for entertaining where the plan and prep ahead time will garner big rewards with your guests. I would therefore strongly recommend Franey's books for young professional ladies or gentlemen who are out to impress a potential partner over a home-cooked dinner. I would not use these books to replace my copy of \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking', as there are great realms of French cooking technique which simply lie outside Franey's 60 minutes, the most important being braising and roasting techniques.These books are excellent introductions to how French cooking can be easy. Recommended."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"I have had this for 20+ years and I rank it my #1 favorite cookbook tied with Cook's Illustrated \\"Best Recipe\\". The recipes are truly simple, easy, fast, & delicious. And elegant.These are not \\"low cal\\" recipes but are so packed with flavor that you could pair the main meat or seafood dishes which will probably include cream & butter, with low-cal, low-fat sides.This is a very instructive book & is great for beginners, which I was when I first bought it. Basically each recipe calls for fresh, high-quality cut of fish/meat/poultry which is then cooked with several complementary herbs, spices, aromatic veges, & that's it.I have found that this may not be the best everyday family type cookbook because the high quality may be expensive. But I think many of the recipes are transferable to other more available fish, etc."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"I'm so happy they have reissued this book! I cooked many of these recipes when they were first published in the New York Times, but my yellowed clippings were hard to keep track of. Now with these recipes all neatly in one book I can jettison the stacks of paper. These are tasty and easy recipes, and call for ingredients you have on hand or can find easily. These are the recipes that taught me how to cook. Each selection features an opening comment from Mr. Franey, including advice on timing. He also suggests simple accompaniments, including the recipe when necessary, which is a great help since I am usually in a hurry and don't have time to think of side dishes. Together the suggested menu can be produced in an hour! Try the Filet Mignon in Madeira sauce, Veal with Mushrooms in Cream Sauce, Shrimp Greek Style with Rigatoni (the first time I cooked with feta cheese!), Grilled Chicken with Mustard Sauce and Curried Chicken. I have made these dishes regularly and now don't refer to the recipes!"},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"My copy of this book is falling apart from the use it has had, so I would like a new copy. Can we get the publisher to reprint it? It has by far the highest proportion of great recipes of all the cookbooks I have seen.

All recipes for a single meal are laid out on 2 facing pages so no turning pages while you are cooking."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"Quite simply, Pierre Franey taught me how to cook - that is - how to combine ingredients that together transcend the sum of the parts. I came across Pierre Franey's column in the NY Times in the early nineties, and the recipes were a revelation. The techniques I learned from the recipes in this book, his column in the NY Times, and the follow up book, I use repeatedly. Unlike many other recipes, I continued cooking Franey's recipes after my kids were born. As youngsters, they would eat many of the things I prepared from this book, including the Poulet Saute Beausejour (chicken with wine and herbs) and the basic saute of fish. Franey also raised my standards of what to expect from a cook book! Very rarely does anything from his cookbooks fail to be delicious when I cook it."},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"Pierre will help you to prepare the juiciest chicken you'll ever taste.

The recipes are easy to make, don't require a lot of ingredients, and the results are outstanding. Many of the recipes use common ingredients, so I can look at the stuff in my refrigerator and flip through the book to find a recipe matching the ingredients. It's surprising how good the recipes are and the variety of flavors even though the instructions are so simple.Admittedly, some of the recipes take longer than 60 minutes, but I've done enough cooking to know that many other cookbooks have recipes which take much longer for only ordinary results.

One caveat - this book is NOT the same as &quot;Low Calorie Gourmet.&quot; You might want to try substituting a few spoonfuls of creme fraiche every time a recipe calls for a quarter cup (or more) of heavy cream.It might be nice for somebody outside of Bellevue, WA, to review this book, though!"},{"Title":"The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet","review":"This book has all the flavor and variety you would want from a cookbook.

They are for you chocoahlics, but not me. I choose almost anything else from the dessert menu, not just chocolate. Not that I don't like it, but I don't crave it like some.Like my wife, for whom the saying is true: Give me all your chocolate and no one will get hurt. Thus, this addition to the cookbook collection to make for her.It appears from this elegant and lush work an abundance of great chocolate based recipes. The author used sixty pounds in making them. There are some grand ones: Chocolate Pecan Turtle Tart; Grilled Chocolate-Stuffed Bananas; Chocolate, Dried Cherry, and Pistachio Bread and Butter Pudding; Crisp Chocolate Chip Cookies with Dried Cherries and Pistachios; Chocolate Creme Fraiche Ice Cream.With more than 65 recipes covering dessert gamut, this is worthy collection of an accomplished chef, chocoholic, and gourmet writer.

And my resident chocolate expert says this is primo!Not the creativity of say, a Marcel Desaulniers, but seems in this offering to provide luscious Choco-Hall-of-Fame favorite collection."},{"Title":"Luscious Chocolate Desserts","review":"First, the layout is moronic. You think you're at the start of a recipe only to find out that part of it was on a previous page without any separation from the preceding recipe. Second, the recipes are idiotically written. For example, I tried making \\"Mom's Chocolate Angel Pie- And Then Some,\\" which should be amended to be called \\"...And Then Some Wasted Ingredients and Time.\\" Maybe the author didn't remember the recipe from her mom correctly, but it starts by telling you to cook the meringue at 225, which is just warm enough to leave you with sticky egg white pudding. Then, and this is the real crime: It actually tells you to melt the chocolate in a pot with 1/4 cup water! Everyone who knows how to cook knows that this would make the chocolate seize up. You'd think an editor, or someone, would test these recipes out before printing a book like this."},{"Title":"Luscious Chocolate Desserts","review":"I have only made 2 desserts from this cookbook, but they both turned out HORRIBLY. I have never had problems following recipes, so I was surprised and disappointed when the first two recipes I tried turned out terribly (Chocolate Turtle Tart and Chocolate Decadence). The Chocolate Turtle Tart was inedible, due to the caramel being hard as a rock. When my husband (a professional baker) reviewed the recipe, he laughed b/c the caramel recipe was incorrect! I served this at a birthday party and was very embarrassed. What a waste of time and money!I was really hoping to love this book, since I am a true chocoholic. Maybe I will try one more recipe..."},{"Title":"Luscious Chocolate Desserts","review":"This is a terrific cookbook, even for people like me who are not trained bakers. I have succeeded in making three recipes already--they work great. Have a long way to go to try a lot of other really inviting recipes. Her book also serves as a great reference for anything chocolate.I was quite impressed with the fact that Ms. Lonbotham pays an historical homage to Chocolate Decadence (page 42) as being a seminal contribution to chocolate lovers worldwide. Living in Berkeley at the time, I well remember what a sensatation it caused."},{"Title":"Luscious Chocolate Desserts","review":"I discovered Lori Longbotham when I found a copy of Luscious Lemon Desserts at a friend's house. That book has a recipe for, hands down, the most amazingly good Lemon Curd that I have ever eaten. So when I saw that there was now a Luscious Chocolate Desserts, I had to get it. I've already made three things: the Luscious Chocolate Layer Cake and the Quickest, Easiest Chocolate Mousse Pie. Both excellent. For the third thing I made, see below.What I really liked about this book is that all the recipes look like something you could walk into the kitchen and make without a lot of difficulty. You don't have to search all over for fancy ingredients, you don't need a lot of know-how. You just follow the very clear instructions, and you get cake (or cookies, or pie, or ice cream) like you're a professional baker. The Lemon Book is like that, too.But my favorite thing in this book is that, besides all the cookies and brownies and the usual stuff, there is chocolate stuff that I had never even heard of. Buy this book if only to make one recipe: Bicerin. I had never heard of this before but it's an Italian drink of melted chocolate, coffee, and milk. I read about it and I thought, \\"I have to taste this.\\" And I had some good Belgian chocolate in the house, so I walked into my kitchen and I made bicerin and in some ways, it was a darn shame, because now I've been drinking a cup of it every day and this book is going to make me gain 10 pounds before I'm done with it.

The recipes are enticing and very well written. Even the rich chocolate souffle recipe tells you to boil the water so that it can go into the pan surrounding the souffle dish!

You feel like she's there in the kitchen with you. You like Lori, and you trust her. I suspect it would be no problem trying any recipe out of this book the first time around, even if I were making it for an important dinner party.I loved the author's previous book, Luscious Lemon Desserts, and this chocolately follow-up is just as good as its tart sister. Right on, Lori."},{"Title":"Evolution: A Beginner's Guide (Beginners Guide (Oneworld))","review":"Burt Guttman's book is a good introduction to the topic of evolution. He's especially adept at stripping evolutionary theory of many of its most common misconceptions--such as \\"survival of the fittest,\\" a newer idea often wrongly attributed to Darwin, or the notion that evolution is a ladder leading inexorably to \\"higher\\" forms of life. I honestly struggled at times with some of the writing--particularly in the area of genetics--but overall Guttman makes the subject approachable and understandable.I didn't find any of the condescension that troubled the previous reviewer. It is true that Guttman spends a fair bit of time comparing and contrasting evolutionary thinking with creationist thinking. I appreciate his writing in that area. In the 21st century it would be irresponsible to write a book introducing evolution without addressing creationism or its better dressed cousin, intelligent design. Both are dangerous to the general population's understanding of the world, and as part of a world view of a great many people who would turn America into a theocracy, both have sinister political implications. Creationism and intelligent design are to biology what astrology is to astronomy; evolutionary biologists observe phenomena, hypothesize about their causes, set about to disprove their hypotheses, and continue the process ad infinitum to add to the human storehouse of knowledge. Creationists start by assuming they know the causes of things, cherry pick those phenomena that support their view, and then too often close the \\"book\\" on the subject for good.As for the author's assertion that the general public is woefully ignorant about biology (not to mention many other areas of knowledge), I fear that fact is about as scientifically sound as they come."},{"Title":"The Prisoners of Time (Lone Wolf, Book 11)","review":"With the Lone Wolf series going off the rails a bit in the New Order Series, it is nice to see a real masterpiece of fantasy gaming like this which has been written by an author still in his prime.

Without a book like this and adequate understanding, that could be quite harmful. However, people should be aware that the book does not cover the therapeutic effects of the oils, nor give an adequate discussion of the issue of impurities and adulterations and how to minimize the risk of these. This book is a must for anyone practicing aromatherapy, as is a reliable supplier of essential oils who tests all their products by gas chromatography and other methods."},{"Title":"Essential Oil Safety: A Guide for Health Care Professionals","review":"It is nice to find at last a book that shows the safety guidelines for essential oils. While this is by no means a full list, it is a good start. With the number of people who are self proclaimed in the science of aromatherapy, and not knowing fully the contraindications of their use, it is nice to see a beginning in bringing aromatherapy to the healthcare field where it can be more widely studied for medical use rather than a good smell. This book helps to bring some credability to a field that has been ignored for so long."},{"Title":"Essential Oil Safety: A Guide for Health Care Professionals","review":"This is a well written and comprehensive book on the safety of essential oils for all practitioners.

Still a worthy investment."},{"Title":"Essential Oil Safety: A Guide for Health Care Professionals","review":"The book contains a lot of scientifically based information about essential oils. Quantitative composition and description of the main components with toxicological data are presentedMany components of essential oils are presented with chemical formula and possible metabolism.

Nevertheless this book is a very good scientific approach to the character ofessential oils."},{"Title":"Essential Oil Safety: A Guide for Health Care Professionals","review":"Any aromatherapist must of course make certain that safe practice is the foundation for her/his work. Though this book is now quite old, it still fills a gap in the market, and is, to my knowledge the only reasonably priced book which focuses only on safety - contraindications and cautions for conditions and specific client groups, specific oils and specific chemical constituents within specific oils.It is certainly one of the most well thumbed books on my groaning aromatherapy shelf, the first one I turn to when working with clients presenting with health issues which I suspect have led to compromise in the actions of liver, kidneys, the skin itself, or are on prescription medication which may affect the safe choice of specific oils. Nor would i add a new oil to my extensive kit before starting my research into it via the EOS bookThe elderly date of last revision of the book, and the absence of a body of information about recent positive research studies prohibit the final 5th star; however I can't afford Bob Harris's EORC database (several hundred pounds)Until Robert brings out a revised version (I believe this has been planned for MANY years) my battered EOS will continue to suffer the wear and tear of constant handling"},{"Title":"Essential Oil Safety: A Guide for Health Care Professionals","review":"Good safety information but overly cautious if you believe in the French method of taking it internally.

It is well written and provides such depth. Everyone practicing aromatherapy or using essential oils in any application should have this resource.

Essential oils are an invaluable tool for health and healing, but they are made up of chemical constituents that can have powerful impact on the body both good and bad.

Well, that's like selling a book about Andy Griffith during \\"Matlock\\" reruns. Too easy. So, a truer test was to pound a pint of schnapps and read this bad boy. Color me unimpressed and a little hungover, boys. Just wasn't that interesting. A few cool things, but not that cool. Probably was fun to write though.

Get Stoned and Read This Book by nom de plume Gordon G. Gourd is self-described as &quot;the coffee table book for stoners. A compilations of images and stories conceived and executed while under the influence of marijuana- lots of marijuana.&quot;If the notion of &quot;art&quot; doesn't scare you, then you will love this book!The book is 72 pages of high-end glossy stock and the quality leaves nothing to be desired. If I told you that the book was primarily made up of images, I'd bet you would expect to see lots of photos of buds, bongs, and blunts. Not so! While there are some great shots of things 420- including the first photograph of a brass hookah, this book deals more with the non-sober experiences of the author and those around him.This is a book that you can't put down until you've read every page. If you try to stop in the middle, you'll keep wondering what's on the other pages until you grab the book and finish it. But for all of the stoners who can't read anything over two sentences and blame it on ADD, don't worry- there aren't a lot of words. Most pages have few, if any, words.Like I said, this is art, so I can't really review this book. Art is very personal. While I think this is an incredible book and a must-have, some people may not agree. I thought the dung-laden painting of the virgin Mary was great while plenty of people thought otherwise. My suggestion is to view some of the sample pages on the book's website.There's no preaching in Get Stoned and Read this Book. It's not advocating marijuana use- it's not condemning it. It's pure. It shows that people who smoke pot are normal people and they can have normal jobs and do great things.My only problem with the book is that people can't put it down.

This book is also a fabulous conversation piece, and a must-have on your coffee table at any party. Everyone I know (all well-educated, gainfully employed individuals) absolutely loves this book. The other reason that I think you should buy it is because it was self-published.

If you are therefore interested in reading three-to-four-hundred pages about death, rape, cancer, murder, abortion, hate, bigotry, mental illness, and similarly distressing topics, this is a book for you. This was a class textbook, so I was obliged (?) to read it, but by page five hundred, the selected depressing passages far overshadowed any value I might have otherwise gained about creative writing. It is implausible to me that she could not find equally good examples of a more pleasing nature. I cannot recommend it."},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"This book has great insight into what it takes to be a creative author. My only complaint is the content of some of the sample stories. I realize they are very well written and serve the intended purpose.

The reason is that when I brought it home and started to preview the pages, I started reading one (non-fiction) story she had included which I found upsetting. It was \\"Inside the Bunker\\" by John Sack. The story is about a writer who attends a Holocaust denier convention and his viewpoint to the attendees is sympathetic. In the piece, the writer has agreed to speak to the convention about a book he has written. The writer makes no mention in the piece that the book he wrote is about Jews in Europe who he proposes took revenge on Germans in Poland after WWII, which found a receptive audience in the holocaust denier community, the majority of whom (according to Sacks) were Germans.His book was poorly received in the Jewish community and it seemed (to me) that the article he writes is in \\"revenge\\" for the bad reviews he received. He describes the holocaust deniers as normal, harmless people and wonders why the Jewish community and the world cannot be accepting of them, since the deniers are accepting of Jews and others, they just don't think Germans killed Jews. This hypothesis is in dangerous contrast to the role holocaust deniers play in the rise of neo naziism around the world and to other antis emetic causes. I read this book at night and when I finished the article I dropped it as if it were on fire.My question is: why this article. The article is meant to be an example of dialogue. But, why choose this article with such a controversial and potentially hurtful message.? I would very very much like to ask this of the author of the Norton book. The article was not so artful with the use of dialogue and I don't know that a reader would focus on anything but the astonishing content of the article, not the dialogue or other writing skills."},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"Seems like a good book for those starting out. Don't know really why I bought it. It doesn't seem to have much to say outside the nine dots"},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"Alice LaPlante's \\"The Making of a Story\\" is textbook-length (well over six hundred pages), and should appeal not only to serious writing students, but also to teachers and readers who would like more insight into how writers create. Creative writing is not for the faint-hearted; that is clear from the outset. It is easy to feel overwhelmed when staring at a blank page or screen, trying to come with original ideas and fresh ways to express them. LaPlante gently and slowly guides her readers through the entire process from getting off the ground to putting the finishing touches on the final draft.LaPlante's scope is encyclopedic. She includes such topics as: making the ordinary extraordinary, employing imagery effectively, writing a good opening, developing plot and characters, choosing a point of view, writing believable dialogue, generating suspense, and revising one's work. She also discusses the strengths and limitations of writing workshops. The author emphasizes that there are no hard and fast rules; rather, she is passing on \\"conventions\\" that have worked for many but not all writers.How does this work differ from others of its type? \\"The Making of a Story\\" covers more territory than most writing handbooks. Part of the book's length results from the inclusion of quite a few full-length classic stories, such as Tim O'Brien's \\"The Things They Carried,\\" John Cheever's \\"The Swimmer,\\" James Baldwin's \\"Sonny's Blues,\\" and a non-fiction piece, Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"Welcome to Cancerland.\\" Each work is followed by thought questions such as \\"How do the opening paragraphs set the tone for the story?\\" and \\"Can you point to some sections of narration that are convincing because of their specificity?\\" There are also dozens of exercises sprinkled throughout the book. For example, the student should pretend that she is a camera and record everything that she sees in a place rich with visual stimulation.\\"Reading Like a Writer\\" by Francine Prose is another excellent work of this type; in fact, LaPlante quotes Prose and even uses the phrase \\"Reading as a Writer\\" repeatedly. \\"The Making of a Story\\" is well organized into fourteen carefully constructed chapters. There is a useful table of contents, a glossary of literary terms, a bibliography, a list of stories, and a thorough index. This guide cannot be absorbed in one sitting. It should be savored slowly and kept as a ready reference book. Used judiciously, it can serve as a source of inspiration to help writers bring out the best in themselves."},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"Buy this book!! I have always wanted to write fiction, but didn't know where to start. A professor at a local University raved about this book so I purchased it immediately. It has literally changed the way I look at writing and has provided me with the structure and knowledge I needed to write. The most amazing part is it teaches you in a way that is easily understood and applicable, something that other similar books I have read have not been able to accomplish. This is a book that you will buy and keep near to you because you will reference it constantly. I am going to purchase a dozen more and give them to my daughters in college, as well as the sons and daughters of my friends and family. Great job Ms. La Plante!!!"},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"The Making of a Story by Alice LaPlante is the BEST BOOK I have read on creative writing--a truly \\"modern\\" version of older books like Janet Burroway's Writing Fiction and John Gardner's The Art of Fiction. The book is broader and deeper than previous books: for example it contains information on writing creative nonfiction as well as fiction; it describes the traditional models of shaping a story (conflict-crisis-resolution model, epiphany and change models) but is inclusive, allows for a wider, organic, more creative definition (stories must surprise us and convince us at the same time Alice says); it contains 26 complete short stories from outstanding writers (Baldwin, Carver, Cheever, Chekhov, Cooper, Didion, Ehrenreich, Hemingway, Johnson, Lamott, Oates, O'Brien, Packer, Sharma, and others) AND has exercises for writers at the end of each chapter--and examples of each exercise completed by students from Alice LaPlante's classes whose writing excellence is equal in many cases to that of the published authors in the book. What is really helpful is the ability of these exercises, or \\"constraints\\" as she explains, to help writers (beginners or advanced) access their personal, authentic, most inspirational material. This book teaches how to combine method (craft) with madness (inspiration) and is fascinating to read! I recommend it to anyone who loves stories--readers and writers."},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"I've been trying to get a handle on stories for years. Eight years. In that time I've read lots of writing guides: guides on fiction-writing, novel-writing, screenwriting, and myth structure. In my opinion, Alice LaPlante's \\"The Making of a Story\\" is the BEST BEST BEST. I'll be keeping it on the bookshelf near my desk, and it will be the first place I go to for guidance, reminders, examples, and encouragement.Before I get into the unique strengths of the book, here's a brief, incomplete description of its contents. It offers thorough discussions of the foundational elements of written stories: point of view, dialogue, characterization, scene vs. narrative, specificity, etc. You'll also find fantastic sections on the aspects of storytelling that are harder to define and exemplify. For example, the chapter titled \\"What's This Creative Work Really About?\\" discusses the idea of \\"truth\\" in fiction. The chapter entitled \\"The Shapely Story\\" provides the best answer I've ever seen to the question, \\"What is a story?\\" The book also contains excellent writing exercises. I find that some other books suggest rather prescriptive writing exercises, about a specific situation or set of characters. I love LaPlante's exercises because although they set you to the task of focusing on a specific point of craft, in terms of subject matter they are generally quite open-ended, so that the exercise is not just an exercise, but also potentially a journey into your own particular subject matter du jour. Finally, the book contains the entire text of many well-known stories and essays which give the reader/writer an idea of what's possible, what's been done, and what to shoot for.As you can see, this book provides all the basic information and tools an aspiring writer would like to find in a guide to writing stories. But LaPlante goes above and beyond. She doesn't ever settle for the easy answer, choosing instead to take the time to explore many answers to one question. You can get a sense of this from one of her chapter titles alone: \\"Why You Need to Show *and* Tell\\". It's a fabulous, fabulous chapter. In the chapter entitled \\"The Shapely Story,\\" LaPlante takes on the question, \\"What is a story?\\", refusing to settle for a simple rule or set of rules. Instead, she offers a number of different ways to express what a story is. (If you've ever workshopped a story you're proud of, only to have everyone say, \\"but this isn't really a story yet,\\" you'll really appreciate this chapter.) One of my other fave chapters is \\"Learning to Fail Better,\\" about first drafts and revision.Alice LaPlante is such a thoughtful, experienced, wise writer...and generous, too. Her book is full of quotes from other writers. Some of these quotes are examples from fiction and nonfiction that exemplify the techniques or qualities being discussed. Some of the quotes are from other writers who have written brilliantly on writing. The voices of E.M. Forster, Charles Baxter, John Gardner, Flannery O'Connor, Raymond Carver, and many others are heard here.LaPlante is to-the-point whenever she can be, philosophical when necessary, down-to-earth at all times. Her friendly voice paired with her careful, intense scrutiny of the craft of storytelling make for an outstanding book. If you're a serious student of the art and craft of telling stories, you will find a wonderful teacher in \\"The Making of a Story.\\""},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"Although it checks in at a pretty hefty size (677 pages), Alice LaPlante's 'The Making of a Story' has hardly a wasted word in its entirety. Each chapter deals with a separate aspect of writing (primarily covering character-driven fiction, but also creative non-fiction), including high-level concepts such as the true meaning and goal of writing as an art form, but also more rudimentary aspects of writing, such as characterization, dialogue, and point of view.Of course, this isn't the first, and certainly not the last, book to cover this material. Classics of the genre include Sol Stein's 'Stein on Writing', John Gardner's 'The Art of Fiction', EM Forster's 'The Aspects of the Novel', and many others (Stephen King's 'On Writing' comes to mind).'The Making of a Story' stands up to all these works, and in many ways eclipses them, particularly with respect to accessibility. Where Gardner, Stein, and Forster are prone to esoteric pontification, LaPlante prefers the practical; this only enhances the value of what she has to say. Each chapter concludes with a few writing exercises that reinforce the chapter's material, and these exercises are followed by one or two pieces of published writing that further illustrate the topic. These examples, unlike those of Gardner or Stein, are excellent examples, and include a wide range of authors, from ZZ Packer and Denis Johnson to Chekov and Tim O'Brien. The net effect of the three-part form chapters (her narrative, then exercises, then published writing) combine to create an immensely useful guide.I consider it one of the best (if not THE best) books I've read on creative writing."},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"I've been waiting for this book for years, and it does not disappoint! A friend of mine has taken classes with the author at Stanford University, and has long been telling me about the amazing exercises she creates to help her students come up with thrilling ideas for stories, poems, and essays, as well as teach them about important points of craft. This book collects these in one place, along with the most practical, hands-on, and easily understandable explanations of creative writing that you'll find anywhere. All of this is backed up further with carefully annotated excerpts from some of the best contemporary stories and essays.But it's the exercises that are the crown jewels of this book. Not only does LaPlante tell you the purpose of each exercise, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to complete each one, she gives you examples of how her students have completed the assignments. This is wonderfully inspirational as well as practical, as it gives you a concrete jumping-off point for your own work. My only quibble is that there aren't more of them!"},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"This is a very readable, insightful, and well structured guide to the fundamentals of writing. It is really, really good.Inspirational books on writing are cheaper by the dozen. Many are wonderful (On Writing,Writing Down the Bones: Freeing the Writer Within (Shambhala Library)), while still quite high level. _The Making of a Story_ is the first text I've found that breaks writing down into its nuts and bolts, examining one element at a time (e.g. point of view, scene versus narrative) till you really get it well enough to deploy skillfully in your own work. And it \\"inspires\\" too - lots of great exercises to get your creative juices flowing.As a little bonus, the author includes writing samples from her past students, with attribution, to illustrate key points. They're often great fun, even more so than the \\"famous\\" writers' works.In fact, my only quibble about the book is that many of the short works included as examples are rather dark - but that seems to be the literary fashion of the times.Full disclosure: I am taking the author's writing class at Stanford, using this text.

But so one day you come across a young sparrow-like bird that has fallen out of its nest, or has it? Then suddenly that book of yours isn't enough. Then you wish that the book of yours was a tome, big enough to make tables creake and with all the facts about birds you would ever wish for.Books about writing tend to have a have a length of 150-300 pages. You can make a story and even get it published by reading \\"How to write damn good novel\\" / \\"Writing the breakout novel\\" / \\"Writing Science fiction & Fantasy\\" / \\"The little red writing book\\".\\"the making of a story\\" is twice as a big as the usual book about writing: 677 pages.Just holding it gives one the feel of holding the phonebook of old and when you open it you will be greeted with text and just text.Other books barely mentions things like second person point of view, for good reason no doubt, here you can read about it on page 265 to 267.Most books tells about working shops and editors, how harsh they can appear to be and how valuable they are.In \\"the making a story\\" you have the chapter \\"Learning to fail better\\" that like other chapters in the book ends with some short stories, one of these 4 is named \\"The Carver Cronicles\\" and tells the story about Raymond Carver and his editor Gordon Lish. And that is a lesson how harsh old-time editors could be and how much difference that could make. Stephen King mentioned that second draft = first draft -10%. Lish could cut away 40% of Carvers work and even rewrite endings and beginnings entirely with his editing. Eventually Carver did break free and did some of his best works. But without Lish it is doubtful he would have been known in first place.It is a story about the dangers of depending too much on an editor, but it ends with Carver quoting Pound: \\"It's immensenly important that great poems be written, but it makes not a jot of difference who writes them\\". After saying that Carver paused and said: \\"That's it. That's it exactly.\\"That essay is just one of many in the book. Cut away those and you STILL have a complete book about making a story. It might look like a phonebook but it is anything but.True to its name it is focused on storytelling, dealing with agents /getting published and such are left out. Then again such chapters are usually focused on US market. This book is for everyone."},{"Title":"The Making of a Story: A Norton Guide to Writing Fiction and Nonfiction","review":"Because I'm busy I shop at Amazon. In fact, I shop almost exclusively online, though mostly at Amazon, and books comprise a fair percentage of my purchases. I guess it's been thirteen, fourteen years now that cyberspace has freed my time from harm's way where the ravages of everyday errands erode one's gossamer vision of life and eventually become the hat rack of dreams awaiting to be vested and taken on a stroll. I'm still busy, only my time is invested on the playground of my passions. I've read a number of extraordinary books over the years, too many to name, but you know the titles, as you've read them, too. By word of mouth--by Amazon ratings--the magic of their stories became widely known, pulling in readers from diverse corners of the world. Immersed in their pages, I've laughed and cried among other things, though no response was casually lent to the work in my hands. The inner critic who reads over my shoulder demands authenticity, searches and savors the artistry when it's found, and I, the recreational reader, must be wrestled from the critic's grasp to escape into a character's skin and experience his or her emotional plight. In Kite Runner, for example, the critic didn't stand a chance. I'll have to reread the book because my inner critic travels a path with emotional potential equal to the surrender yielding to an author's magic. Still, all the same, not once have I rated a book. It strikes me suddenly as selfish. But no, I stand by my disinclination. You see, I've never felt the need to rate the pages that have passed through my hands, as you already knew. You beat me to the book and were a part of the cognoscenti whose reviews brought it to my attention.However.Perhaps I have beaten you to \\"the making of a story\\". The book has won my willingness to diverge from my obsessions if only to say, this is one you do not want to miss. Not if you're a student of writing, a teacher of writing, a critic.... Not if you are a writer.For two decades, I have been all three of these and in some fashion I will remain all three for the duration of my life. And though forever a student of writing, it has been eons since I have purchased a book on the craft.\\"the making of a story\\" is a large volume--a resource to turn to, right? Well yes, it is that. I will return again and again to thumb through the pages and pick and choose according to timely interests. By the look of the volume, that's all I assumed I'd ever do. The assumption was made upfront at the time of purchase, something I didn't intend in the first place, as the classics from back in the day when I took up the craft equipped me with the tools, a rather defined set of tactics--wielding active voice, strong verbs, detail, showing verses telling, avoiding wordiness, the rhythm of the written word and the imitation of speech, parallel expression and pattern variation, usage, style, originality, imagery, editing--that transform correct writing into captivating snapshots of life.But I had in my hands a copy of Alice LaPlante's book. No, I didn't dribble away my time at a brick and mortar (sorry Borders). I attended the San Francisco Writer's Conference and waiting to meet with an editor, I visited the book table. Again, I didn't intend to purchase the book. I simply picked it up. I'm a writer, which is to say I'm curious. I picked up nearly every book on the table and rustled each of their pages in quick survey. What sold me on Ms. LaPlante's book was a heading, a single heading. That's all I read, the bold print line that said, Write what you know about what you don't know. Hunh? The angle started spinning plates in my head, one of them saying that if there are just a few similar nuggets in this text, which is 1 inches thick, then I've struck gold.Since I had to fly home, I didn't buy the book on the spot. I wrote down the name, went to my meeting, and returning home, now seated at my computer, I clicked on the blue \\"e\\". Good old Amazon delivered \\"the making of a story\\" to my door a few days later. Again, I flipped through it, thinking, Voila! I found a nice addition to my reference library, and decided that I'd set aside my novel and read a bit before tucking it away on its shelf.That was a week ago, and like a good novel, I can't put the book down. Can you imagine? An instructional book? A reference? And you can't drag yourself away? Unheard of!I write about ten hours a day. As I'm trying to finish a novel, I'm at my keyboard seven days a week. I haven't put a dent in Ms. LaPlante's book, but I can tell you that it's already made its way to my pages. Just moments ago, I was showing what a character saw when, instead, I \\"showed\\" by describing what he heard. Yes, I knew to draw from all the senses, but Ms. LaPlante raised what I knew to a new level. I am certain my writing will follow.This book is a rare find. Whatever stage in your writing career, you will profit immeasurably from the insights, examples, and inspiration contained in its 650-plus pages.

Two British guys do not want to settle down to everyday post war life just yet so they convince their rich fathers to buy them a boat and they set sail to see the world. As their funds dwindle and returning to England seems imminent they meet two American girls in Florida who get by living off of rich men. The girls thinking the guys are wealthy convince them to take them on a trip to the Caribbean.One of the girls trips over a human skull on a deserted island and after some digging they unearth a multitude of gold bars. Knowing before they can become rich they must first sell the bars poses problems as they can't just walk into a bank so they take one bar back to Florida to see if they can sell it. Of course underworld figures prefer to just take gold rather than pay for it. Also interested in the gold is an ex Nazi sailor who buried it there in the first place and he's not just going to stand by and let others have it.Pattinson novels are quite simple and light reading. They do very dramatically in quality though. Skeleton Island is one of the best Pattinson novels I have read. He does write in a style where his characters use words that show Pattinson is obviously an old man but that does add something to the novels. Other quality Pattinson novels worth your time and money are Blind Date, Obituary for Howard Grey, Crane, The Animal Gang and Life Preserver."},{"Title":"Africans in Colonial Mexico: Absolutism, Christianity, and Afro-Creole Consciousness, 1570-1640 (Blacks in the Diaspora)","review":"The concept of identity in the Atlantic world is fraught with paradoxical layering, divided sensibilities, and downright compartmentalization.

In early New Spain (colonial Mexico), a highly complex racial society attempted to balance the needs of absolutism with Catholicism's unending devotion and the highly sensitive demands of master and slave. In the process, a very typical Atlantic creolization process blended race and culture thoroughly. And this, Bennett suggests, created a significant population adept at navigating the complex nuances of colonial slave society with a great deal of ease.In plain terms, 'Africans in Colonial Mexico' attempts to demonstrate African and Afro-Creole agency. The fourth and most successful chapter (\\"Christian Matrimony and the Boundaries of African Self-Fashioning\\"), for example, rather brilliantly demonstrates the complex kinship ties that Africans and Afro-Creoles used in the matrimonial process. Additionally, and more importantly, the author unpacks the overlapping and often opportunistic identities seized by the African petitioners to complete the formal process of Catholic marriage. Bennett finds, somewhat surprisingly, that they actively sought out other members of their own ethnic (or perceived ethnic) group. Even more, the same said Africans relied on these kinship connections that frequently extended over a significant time period, despite the many obstacles that slavery posed.Those familiar with the pioneering work of Ira Berlin will recognize some of Bennett's terminology as well as an immediate point of contention. For Bennett, colonial Mexico's cultural \\"need\\" for slaves qualifies it as a slave society (p. 30). In 'Many Thousands Gone' and again in his 'Generations of Captivity,' Berlin (building, as Bennett does as well, from the work of Frank Tannenbaum) gave a clear definition of the process in which \\"societies with slaves\\" became \\"slave societies\\". \\"The transformation generally turned upon the discovery of some commodity...that could command an international market.\\" In addition, as Berlin suggests, the slaveholding class then attained nearly total mastery over the socioeconomic process.The question of colonial Mexico's categorization is, at least in Bennett's somewhat ambiguous presentation of the region, somewhat amiss. Part of the ambiguity results from the author's treatment of colonial Mexico as a unified whole. The urban-rural landscape, for all purposes, seems to blend almost neatly without much distinction. One is left with the distinct impression that all of colonial Mexico functioned in identical manners, regardless of locale. The reliance on the Matrimonios at Mexico City's Archivo General de la Nacion, of course, likely privileged urban applicants over their rural counterparts. Even still, it is not altogether clear from Bennett's evidence what key commodity transformed New Spain's economy and effectively strangled the post-charter generations in a distinctly \\"slave society\\".Despite any weaknesses in presentation, 'Africans in Colonial Mexico' is illuminating and powerful for its portrayal of cultural fluidity. In terms of the African Diaspora, it goes a long way in addressing the complicated juggling of multiple identities. Far too often scholarly portrayals take for granted the external modifiers that determined slave identities. This one-sided portrayal does not allow for the ongoing process that an identity undergoes amidst the pull of various cultures and contexts. In other words, it is fixed in time and place. Bennett's real contribution is in understanding identity as a process and that Africans and Afro-Creoles necessarily assumed any number of identities given the peculiarities of his or her context (demonstrates agency). The fluid quality that the identities collectively assumed greatly advances the scholarly portrait of the labyrinth that is the Atlantic world mentality."},{"Title":"Africans in Colonial Mexico: Absolutism, Christianity, and Afro-Creole Consciousness, 1570-1640 (Blacks in the Diaspora)","review":"Bennett takes on a formidable task of combing the dispersed Mexican archives for information about Blacks in the first century after Cort&eacute;s' conquest and the structuring of \\"New Spain.\\" His use of secondary sources is laudable, but I'm having trouble with his definition of the term \\"creole.\\" This is not a Spanish term, but rather an English one, and I suppose I should give him a \\"by\\" on that. I'm troubled however that he defines the term as \\"Africans born in New Spain, as creoles were known.\\" By whom? The Spanish term \\"Criollo\\"(from which I'm assuming he has taken \\"creole\\")NEVER meant Africans exclusively, but rather SPANISH people born in the New World. I am troubled that he never gives any citation for this, which is clearly at odds with everything else I've read for 25 years. Such a novel use of a term should have been more carefully explained. Although I'm impressed by his otherwise wide-spectrum knowledge of colonial Mexico, I'm wondering how much this misinterpretation of terminology impacts his conclusions. I would like to know of other Colonialists who use the term this way--certainly no one living in Mexico in the seventeenth century used the term as Bennett does."},{"Title":"The Gospels of Mary: The Secret Tradition of Mary Magdalene, the Companion of Jesus","review":"Since the discovery of The Gospel of Mary in the late nineteenth century in Egypt and the Nag Hammadi texts in 1947, the figure of Mary Magdalene has gained prominence in religious scholarly circles as well as popular culture.The first to bring Mary Magdalene to a wider audience was Elaine Pagels' groundbreaking text, The Gnostic Gospels. Though, interestingly, it was the popular thriller by Dan Brown, The Da Vinci Code, that really caught the imagination of a wide readership, sparking many texts, both scholarly and otherwise, to be published.Marvin Meyer, editor of the Gospel of Thomas, has written and compiled in this text a selection of extracanonical literature, including the New Testament Gospels, revealing the central role of Mary Magdalene in the formation and history of Christianity. However, Meyer points out, that, The New Testament obscured the importance of Magdalene's role through the interest of the author's who...\\"advanced the cause of the male disciples (especially the Twelve) and the place of Peter.\\" (iiv) There is no doubt that Mary Magdalene, after reading this brief though informative selection of texts, was the beloved disciple to Jesus, and for many reasons, culturally, politically or otherwise, her importance was suppressed, and only now, over two thousand years after the birth of Christianity, has her central role as apostle and teacher, is gaining prominence once again.Meyer's has compiled a selection of Christian literature, including segments of the New Testament, Mark, Matthew, Luke and John, The Gospel of Mary, Thomas, Phillip, The Dialogue of the Savoir, excerpts from the Gnostic text, Pistis Sophia and segments from The Manichaean Psalms of Heracleides, that all mention Mary Magdalene in one context or another, emphasising her close relationship with Jesus and her pivotal role in Christs crucifixion and resurrection.Close examination of the numerous non-canonical texts along with the New Testament, to my mind, will only strengthen one's belief and spiritual insights into the divine. There are many reasons why the figure of Mary Magdalene has been marginalized from the \\"official\\" church, however, her emergence as the beloved companion to Jesus in our modern times from the \\"shadows of history\\", can only nurture our spiritual natures, guiding us on our personal journeys.This book is a short though quality addition to Christian literary scholarship."},{"Title":"The Gospels of Mary: The Secret Tradition of Mary Magdalene, the Companion of Jesus","review":"Anyone who has heard of the Da Vinci Code (which is, by now, much of the world) will likely also know that the central idea is that Mary Magdalene was a rather different person in actual life than the person portrayed in church tradition and the gospel extrapolations.Indeed, as has become better known in the past generation, there were many more gospels floating around the early Christian world than the canonical four (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John), most of which were lost to the world through various processes. Among the stronger early traditions that later got branded as heretical was the Gnostic tradition, and in this community, Mary Magdalene had a place of honour.Drawing from the four canonical gospels, as well as writings such as the Gospel of Peter (in fragmentary form), the Gospel of Thomas (a collection of sayings), the Gospel of Philip, the Pistis Sophia and other texts including the Gospel of Mary, Marvin Meyer presents a new look at the importance of Mary Magdalene as being one of the most important figures in early Christianity. The Eastern church has preserved her memory of prominence, often referring to her as the Apostle to the Apostles, the first to announce the resurrection and the first to witness the risen Christ. These recollections are preserved in the canonical witness.The Gospel of Mary exists in a fragmentary form among the Nag Hammadi documents, discovered in 1947. Many pages are missing, including the beginning, middle and ending. However, the character of Mary is highlighted in many gospels; Meyer selects texts throughout the various gospels to show an extensive interaction between Jesus and Mary, the other disciples and Mary, and Mary's own prominence as a witness to the outside world.This text presents a more realistic way of viewing the character of Mary Magdalene than sources such as Da Vinci Code/Holy Blood, Holy Grail/Woman with the Alabaster Jar present. According to Meyer, 'the sources about Mary Magdalene published here may not be as flamboyant as some of these later legends, but they are more trustworthy as witnesses to the figure of Mary and literary traditions about Mary.' Indeed, Meyer speculates that Mary might not have been only 'a' beloved disciple, but perhaps 'the' beloved disciple referred to not by name but by relationship in the canonical gospels.This is a short text, consisting mostly of Meyer's own translations of the primary documents; Meyer's commentary is kept to a minimum, useful in its way, but he permits the texts to speak for themselves. He gives a useful index and helpful scholarly notes.This book will be of special interest for those who want to dig deeper into the realities underpinning modern novels and explorations about the subject, and of general interest to those who want to see the diversity in Christian belief, practice and writing in the earlies centuries."},{"Title":"The Gospels of Mary: The Secret Tradition of Mary Magdalene, the Companion of Jesus","review":"The Gospels of MaryMarvin MeyerIf you are looking for a history of the discovery of the Gospel of Mary Magdalene, it's not here. There are no answers to where, how, by whom, when, its journey, its translation, and its ultimate publication. Professor Meyer is an expert in the Coptic language in which the gospel was written and we do have the benefit of his direct translations. For that we are grateful.Marvin Meyer includes the complete translation of The Gospel of Mary Magdalene as well as passages where Mary is mentioned in the Canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Along with these gospels are his interpretations of their symbolism. He also gives us the complete translation of Thomas (10 pages) and Philip (15 pages), although these gospels include Mary in only a few passages.A fragmentary second half of The Dialogue of the Savior, a Nag Hammadi text in which Jesus is quoted as saying, \\"Whatever is from woman dies,\\" \\"Pray in the place where there is no woman,\\" and \\"Destroy the works of the female...they should stop [giving birth],\\" is also included. Meyer makes excuses for this metaphorically, but it is still hard to swallow. However, we must still accept that it is a Nag Hammadi document and perhaps come to understand the dilemma that faced Bishop Irenaeus as he pared down the dozens of gospels that were in circulation in AD 180.The Pistis Sophia is presented as an Egyptian Codex from the fourth or fifth century. Its origin is unclear. It is explained that Jesus becomes one with Sophia or Pistis--a female manifestation of the divine--and emits an androgynous light. Here Mary is acclaimed by Jesus as being the most devoted to heaven's kingdom. Peter cannot endure her. Mary sensing this says to Jesus, \\"I am afraid of Peter because he hates me and threatens our gender.\\" In the end Jesus proclaims her as a \\"pure, spiritual woman.\\"The Manichaean Psalms of Heracleides is included as two pages of songs from a third-century religion extending from Europe to China that included Christian and Buddhist principles. Meyer presents them here because they mention Mary several times. She is referred to as the one who, \\"...catches the other eleven who were lost.\\" She is proclaimed to be the, \\"Spirit of wisdom...capable of speaking with authority to Simon Peter and the others.\\"In conclusion Esther A. De Boer, minister of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands, who published her Ph.D. thesis Mary Magdalene: Beyond the Myth, writes twenty-two pages of her stance on Mary: female leadership, imagery, Gnostic writings, male-female dualism, and the New Testament Gospels.It is a compilation heavy in academia but relevant, nevertheless, in that it reinforces the important role of Mary Magdalene as chosen and closest companion of Jesus.By Elizabeth Wallace, author & illustrator of Jesus Christ In His Own Words:a Compilation of the Canonical and Gnostic Gospels[...]Jesus Christ In His Own Words"},{"Title":"The Gospels of Mary: The Secret Tradition of Mary Magdalene, the Companion of Jesus","review":"A rivetting read.

While irrelevantly touting feminism, the editor of this book promotes the sexist hedonism of Dan Brown, who fictionalizes a female French cryptologist bowing to a male New England professor's absurdly misrepresenting the etymology of the French word \\"Sangreal\\" before saying Jesus had children with the Magdalena. And the book ignores the role of Saul of Tarsus in selecting and editing the New Testament canon, to pervert the teachings of Jesus into a superstitious promise of eternal life Paul could sell for money, after he said women shouldn't talk in church. And, despite its clear presence in the few remaining pages of the Gospel of Mary, the editor of this Da Vinci Code promotion ignores the monism that's the foundation of Hinduism while Paul's Roman church calls it the pantheistic heresy. Meyer also, while failing to mention that the Church retracted in 1969 Pope Gregory's claim that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute, misrepresents the Gospels in support of that sixth century slander. He also says that the materialistic Gospel of Philip is beautiful and that its inspiration was a candidate to head Paul's Romanism. Pecuniary Paul took his profiteering to the money as does mercenary Meyer. Mary was spiritual while neither Meyer nor Esther de Boer are. They, like pedophile priests, think love is sex. HITRT"},{"Title":"The Gospels of Mary: The Secret Tradition of Mary Magdalene, the Companion of Jesus","review":"The idea of putting together all the texts for the Mary Magdalene tradition is an interesting one; if you're really interested in that subject, you might find this book worth your time and money.I am, however, losing patience with the misdirection and disingenuity of the growing \\"Gnostic Gospel\\" racket. Dan Brown is rightly criticized, as a novelist, for playng fast and loose with history; as a scholar, Meyer ought to care primarily about historical fact, which is more remarkable in this case than the fantasies. But he shows a soft spot for the merely sensational.Meyer introduces his texts as follows: \\"This book presents English translations of the earliest and most reliable texts that shed light on this remarkable woman and the literary traditions about her.\\" In fact, only the canonical Gospels (some would add parts of Thomas) have any claim to telling us about the woman; the rest are about the tradition - as Meyer and every serious scholar knows. (Like Karen King, whose parallel book on Mary plays similar, but less blatant linguistic games.) But unlike King, Meyer allows his readers to glide through the entire text of his book without once honestly marking the line between history and legend.Meyer does draw a line between canonical and extra-canonical works: \\"Within these texts Mary Magdelene plays a leading role, but often, particularly in the New Testament, the centrality of her role may be obscured by the interests of the authors of the Gospels, who advance the cause of the male disciples (especially the Twelve) and the place of Peter.\\" So it seems the NT texts \\"obscure\\" the truth about Mary for political gain, while the latter are more willing to give her a fair shake.What could it possibly mean to say the Gospels \\"obscure\\" a \\"fact\\" that would not be invented for decades, or centuries, after they were written? Did they have time machines with which they went forward a century, read the Gnostic texts, and returned to the 1st Century to deconstruct them?Meyer repeatedly commits such gross anachronism (first among deadly sins for historians). His eye for detecting \\"spin\\" is selective: he finds it in the canonical Gospels, but not in the \\"Gospel\\" of Mary. But in the Gospels, the followers of Jesus are shown in all their flaws, none more fully than Peter. In Mary, by sharp contrast, the favored disciple is presented (as King put it) as a \\"model disciple,\\" while Peter, her orthodox foil, is intentionally undermined. So Meyer detects manipulation in texts that describe the \\"pillars of the church\\" in all their perversity, pigheadedness, and lack of understanding. But he sees none in later texts that present heroes and villains in bright, shiny white and black hats, nary a flaw in the one, hardly a virtue in the other!I have no reason to doubt Meyer's competence as a translator, and the texts themselves can be interesting. (Though most are readily available elsewhere.) The \\"Manichean Psalms of Heracleides\\" was most interesting to me, partly because I had never read it before, but also because it is a nice poem about Mary at the resurrection of Jesus. Philip, Thomas, Mary, the Dialogue of the Savior and Pistis Sophia are full of metaphysics, but fortunately in small doses. The final essay by De Boer is a lot better than I expected; actually a rather balanced discussion of how both Gnostic and orthodox texts treat women, sometimes with some misogeny, but better than the norm for the times. The reason I expected worse is because earlier, Meyer repeats the ludicrous argument De Boer made elsewhere that the \\"beloved disciple\\" was Mary M. John obscured the fact, and then, after 2000 years of misunderstanding, De Boer finally figured out the truth. I am always amazed when a scholar calls the author of a Gospel a liar, then feigns to \\"read between the lines\\" of his work and tell us \\"what really happened.\\" This seems particularly unfair in the case of John, accused by Elaine Pagels of undermining Thomas in a similar way, since in fact John treated male disciples much more roughly than the ladies, and gave us a picture of everyone far more rounded and realistic than any of the Gnostic texts.All in all, this has the feel of a book Harper & Row hopes for a healthy return on a small investment of capital, time, character, or cottonwood fiber.author, Why the Jesus Seminar can't find Jesus, and Grandma Marshall Could"},{"Title":"HP Open View (McGraw-Hill Series on Computer Communications)","review":"This book is out of date...It's great if you are a manager contemplating the purchase of HP Openview...but you can get that from HP for free!..It is pitiful if you are trying to implement Openview from a technical standpoint....save your money.

Archie Comics proved it, too, could generate national publicity with their own major storyline. Namely, after over 50 years of a love triangle battle, Archie was finally going to choose between Betty and Veronica! You can imagine how much interest this generated among long-time fans. Often overlooked is the fact that Archie and the gang had been among the longest running comic book series in history with legions of fans, young an old. Could it be that the love triangle that started before WWII would finally be resolved? The tale would play out over the course of four issues in 1994: Archie #429, Betty #19, Betty & Veronica #82, and Veronica #39, and they are all collected in this one historic volume. As noted in the introduction, fans were clamoring for months, begging for hints as to who would finally win Archie's affection.The tale begins as Archie is seeing hearts over a love letter he received. Betty and Veronica demand to know who sent Archie the letter but Archie is having so much fun seeing them squabble he decides to make them wait. Betty and Veronica each think the other sent the note and so begins a no-holds-barred battle for Archie as we've never seen before. The under-handed tricks fly fast and furious! Veronica fools Betty with some tickets to a charity dance with the wrong date. Veronica ends up at the dance with Archie while Betty is fixing his car! Betty crashes the party in style wearing one of the skimpiest dresses ever seen in an Archie comic. Veronica fights back in her own \\"dress to kill\\" style, eventually leading two a duel of super soakers between the two long time rivals. But in the end, Archie has a big surprise for both of them.This was just a fun story from beginning to end. Betty and Veronica are at their most \\"catty\\" with claws fully extended as they go after each other like never before. And one cannot but laugh as Archie sits back, watching the pair fight over him, knowing he has a huge ace up his sleeve. Absolutely hilarious! Reggie, of course, makes an appearance and stirs up as much trouble as he can and Jughead makes a brief cameo as well. Archie Comics proves that in 1994, and now in 2005, that they can still delight their fans, young and old. The great thing is that even if you have not picked up an Archie comic in decades, you can still read this story as it is truly a stand-alone classic for the ages. This is a 48 page Prestige format comic with the beautiful Archie-style art that you've cometo know and love."},{"Title":"Archie Comics Presents: The Love Showdown Collection (Archie Americana)","review":"This comic is so poorly reproduced, that the text and linework is blurry. It's published on high gloss paper, which only makes the blurriness worse. Unusual for Archie TPB's, which usually have good reproductions. After the build up, this story disappointed right out of the gate. Archie Comics was trying to jump on the crossover bandwagon, Paul Castiglia admits it in his Intro. However, they obviously know nothing about how to create a crossover. One refreshing change, they actually give credit to the artists and writers of the comics. Something Archie should do more of.The first chapter, from Archie 429, is an awful attempt to set-up the \\"Love Showdown,\\" the plot is contrived, centering on trying to find out who wrote a letter to Archie, a task they never complete - and thru some pretty boring plot twists, Betty and Veronica decide to finally settle things between them regarding Archie. We all know this is where the story is going, but they take 11 unhumorous pages to get there, and it is so contrived, it's hard to understand what, exactly, is it that made the girls decide that this was the last straw. The art by Stan Goldberg is disappointing, considering he is a master artist.The next story is better, with a more modern look to the art by Doug Crane, which, tho a bit jarring at first for us old timers, is actually refreshing. The story is not very humorous, but the plot finally gets moving, and there are some interesting plot twists. The third story is by far the funniest, and is drawn by the great Dan DeCarlo, and he does an amazing job. Interestingly enough, the writer for this story and the very unfunny first story is the same, Dan Parent. The more I read about behind-the-scenes production of comics, the more I learn that the artists have more to do with plotting and story writing than the credits would lead one to think. DeCarlo obviously injected his trademark humor into this story, with plenty of physical comedy, which at this point was sorely needed in the crossover.But Archie's inexperience with crossovers really shows between the second and third stories, as continuity goes out the window. Archie and Veronica leave for a dance, dressed in gown and tux in the second story: the third story opens with them at the dance wearing different and more casual clothes. Out of anger Betty returns everything she ever borrowed from Veronica in the second story, and shows up at the dance wearing a dress Veronica gave her in the third????? Betty finds out Veronica purposely gave her tickets to the dance with the wrong date on them, so she could take Archie, and she is determined to expose Veronica's scheme - but in the third story the scheme is never mentioned again.The concluding chapter is all right, with the story building to a super soaker showdown watergun fight between the girls. It should be funnier than it is - it seems like it has all the ingredients to be hilarious, but it just rates a few chuckles. The climatic moment is predictable, and even tho sometimes the funniest comedy can be seen coming, this ain't it. Archie should stay away from crossovers, it is obviously not their thing,And oh - this TPB is a pretty slim volume - it's basically a long comic book with glossy pages. Five bucks is on the high size for something this slim, and giving it glossy pages doesn't make up for it. An easy one to skip, you won't be missing anything earth shattering, believe me, and there are plenty of other good Archie TPB's - the Americana Series, the Josie and the Pussycat TPB, The Betty and Veronica Summer Fun TPB, and I have heard that the Katy Keene TPB is good too.

Ever since then, his work has been controversial to say the least. Historians on the whole have been highly dubious of the book, because it is manifestly inaccurate in its historical details, yet we have been unwilling to give it up since it is virtually the only source we have for very early Norman history. Recently, however, some scholars have begun to cut Dudo a little more slack, realizing that he should be seen not as an objective historian of the 10th century, but rather as a propagandist of the 11th century, and that he should be appreciated for what he was, not condemned for what we wish he had been.One problem is that Dudo's work has been largely inaccessible. The only edition of his Latin text was published in 1865, and by modern standards is not very good. The History of the Normans has never been fully! translated into any modern language. But now, that lack is being redeemed in spades. Not only is a new critical edition with translation into French in the works by Dudo's leading modern historian, Pierre Bouet, but Eric Christiansen's English translation has just been published.This translation is doubly valuable. First, the translation itself is both fairly true to Dudo's often pompous, bloated style while at the same time being readable - a nifty trick. The story comes to life, and is accompanied by copious notes (regrettably at the back of the book, rather than at the foot of the pages, no doubt because of the notes' length) which elucidate the historical and intellectual background of the book, and explain obscure references that otherwise would slip right by the modern reader. And second, the introduction is as of this writing the best brief introduction to early Norman history and its intellectual milieu. Christiansen fully recognizes Dudo's unreliability as a! historical sources, while fully appreciating his ability a! s a literary author of the Carolingian age. He also argues (to my mind convincingly) against the view many historians have of early Normandy as a Carolingian principality, with the Viking settlers (Norman is simply the medieval Latin word for Viking) quickly assimilating into Frankish culture; Christiansen is much more willing than most scholars to acknowledge the Scandinavian side of the early Normans. His overview of the early Norman world is sane, balanced, and indispensable.In short, Dudo's History of the Normans is essential for the Norman scholar, valuable for the medieval historian, and entertaining for the general reader interested in the Middle Ages. My only regret is that the book is priced so that only libraries and desperate specialists will be able to buy it; one hopes that Boydell &amp; Brewer will recognize its potentially broad appeal and some day issue a more affordable paperback edition."},{"Title":"IMAGE BEFORE MY EYES: A Photographic History of Jewish Life in Poland Before the Holocaust","review":"&quot;Image Before My Eyes,&quot; a book built around an astonishing selection of photos and linked to an even finer documentary of the same name, is a brilliantly conceived and executed introduction to the history of Polish Jewry and an extraordinarily moving monument to that community's creativity, vitality, and complexity."},{"Title":"IMAGE BEFORE MY EYES: A Photographic History of Jewish Life in Poland Before the Holocaust","review":"A REAL PITY that this nice re-edition has been published with softcover!

Deirdre dons a priest's robe to conceal her royal identity and hides the legendary sword of her ancestor, King Kieran, under it for safety. The rest of the treasure, she and her companions stow in a wine cask, but things go awry and Deirdre is found out to be a princess.When Alric discovers her royal cloak with the Glenmora brooch among the ransom meant for Cairell with the same symbols on the cloak that his late mother had made for Alric when she prophesized his earthly kingdom would be won by love, he is shaken. Alric's mother was a Scottish slave whom his father Lambert loved dearly, but his political marriage to the wicked queen Ethlinda made their son Ricbert, a conniving serpent if there ever was one, the rightful heir to Galstead.Raised in a court of bitterness and deceit, it's no wonder that Alric is so distrustful of everyone but his faithful dog Tor, and his aged nursemaid Abina, and the men who seek their fortune with him at sea. Consumed with a burning ambition, the illegitimate prince feels Deirdre might be the key to the birthright his mother spoke of in the prophecy. With the calculated decision to make her his bride to be, his life is turned in a new direction.Deirdre is a feisty woman who is used to being in control of those around her and has a very sharp tongue that she isn't afraid of using. She knows she will do whatever she has to do to get her brother safely back and she uses Alric's sudden interest in marriage to achieve this end, enlisting his help in the terms of the wedding contract. Of course Alric has a few terms of his own, but the Lord has a master plan in store for this special pair's destiny and his love is the firm foundation.This is a beautiful and exciting story of how wonderfully the Lord uses the imperfect to bring about his perfect and everlasting love. DEIRDRE is filled with colorful characters, as well as the emotionally stirring story of Deirdre, a devout woman whose faith in word and deed under the direst of circumstances conquers her conqueror, winning his heart and his trust in her God.

The author, Philip Katcher has been a reenactor and student of period uniforms for many years and his text is a good, basic primer. Gerry Embleton is one of the better illustrators for this series. The information on the U.S troops, both militia/volunteer and Regulars came primarily from the works of James Walker and Samuel Chamberlain. These two sources were eyewitnesses to the war, and while Chamberlain is cocky, and self centered, his comments on clothing and equipment are accurate.Its significant in that photography was coming into use at this time and provides a &quot;first hand&quot; look at some of the uniforms. Katcher and Embleton relied on the late Joseph Hefter for sources on the Mexican Army. At the time this book was first published, Hefter was THE source on the Mexican troops but new information has come to light and I'd like to see the text updated and have Embleton do more detailed plates, but as is, this book is useful.Very few photographs exist of &quot;soldados&quot; from this period.

Reed Lessing has written a sleeper.His Concordia Seminary doctoral dissertation starts off reading like a cross between confessional screed and a too conventional presentation of biblical form criticism. Before long, however, the careful reader finds himself immersed in a compelling interpretation of one of the book of Isaiah's most difficult \`oracles against the nations'. Lessing understands the difficult text of Isaiah 23 not as a fairly inadequate redactional stitching together of disparate sources, but rather of an intentionally ironic piece of prophetic satire that uses the incalculable power of irony to bring low one of the eighth century's (!) most potent economic powers.Along the way, Lessing credentials himself as one of a growing number of capable younger scholars who are willing systematically to press questions regarding several of the key dogmas of form and tradition criticism as biblical scholars practice them. These include the insistence that prophetic oracles begin as small, exclusively oral, utterances that are subsequently-and not very impressively-joined together by redactors with very different things on their mind.One is reminded of Brian Jones' 1996 dissertation, published as Howling Over Moab: Irony and Rhetoric in Isaiah 15-16. Curiously, Reed lists Jones' work in his bibliography but does not interact with him in his text. He might have discovered in Jones a cheerful fellow traveler.In chapter one (\`Introduction', pp. 1-38), Lessing asks the single important question that his dissertation then attacks with admirable tenacity: In an oracle like this one, what does discontinuity *mean*? The answer of form and tradition critics is well known, but Lessing wants to make a claim that this nearly \`assured result' is in fact wrong because it underestimates the prophetic author and overestimates the rigidity of genre. A single prophet, in Lessing's view, is capable of a kind of ideological and literary multitasking that creates what tradition critics regard as the celebrated \`seams' that justify their craft. Lessing thinks they are something else.Chapter two (\`Redaction criticism', pp. 12-38) explains how form criticism produced and then ceded prominence to redaction criticism, or what some specialists might prefer to call \`tradition criticism'.Reed swings into \`worthwhile reading' gear in his third chapter, where he presents three well-known twentieth-century practitioners of redaction criticism upon the book of Isaiah (\`The Redactional Reading Strategies of Otto Kaiser, Hans Wildberger and Marvin Sweeney', pp. 39-65). One hastens to add that, happily, Marvin Sweeney is still with us in the 21st. This is the beginning of Reed's creative contribution to the conversation, for he deftly lays out how what each of these scholars has made (or chosen not to) of the \`discontinuities' thrown up by the book of Isaiah's twenty-third chapter.By today's more chastened standards, the self-confidence of these scholars as they reconstruct an ancient text may seem breathtaking when it does not seem quaintly archaic. Lessing nicely maps out the major (including ideas that allegedly date the document according to standard critical reconstructions of Israelite religion) and minor criteria that orient these redaction critics as they work on the Isaiah text.Chapter four (\`A Redactional Translation and Commentary on Isaiah 23', pp. 66-98) analyzes the results that Kaiser, Wildberger, and Sweeney have produced as examples of redaction critics performing their respective close readings of Isaiah 23. Anyone interested in the history of biblical criticism-as is this reviewer-will appreciate Lessing's work here, notwithstanding its role as polemical setup to his own \`rhetorical' reading of the same text two chapters later.First, however, Lessing introduces rhetorical criticism, a method with which biblical scholars invariably link the work and name of J. Muilenburg (chapter five, \`Rhetorical Criticism', pp. 99-132). The author is careful to credit rhetorical critics with the \`emancipation of the text from the oral situation'. It is not that Lessing wants to discard orality at the genesis of biblical texts; rather he is arguing against a reductionism that would limit the biblical prophets to an oral (and therefore, presumably, a briefly enacted) role. Susan Niditch is at this point brought into the discussion for her work on the coexistence and mutual interaction of orality and literate culture.Lessing introduces the theoretical foundation that will undergird his own rhetorical criticism in Isaiah, including surveys of the notions of persuasion in rhetoric, pragmatics, illocutionary force and perlocutionary intention. \`It will be argued', he explains, \`that the illocutionary force of Isaiah 23 is a warning. The oracle warns Judah not to emulate the pride of Tyre. The perlocutionary force is to persuade Judah not to enter into alliance with Tyre against Assyria.'It is clear from these programmatic statements that Lessing will place the bulk if not the entirety of the text in the time of Isaiah ben Amoz, a matter to which we will return briefly in due course.In this rich chapter, Lessing begins to build a case for a coherent literary reading of Isaiah 23 that discovers in the text a satire upon the established genre of the city-lament. Schadenfreude is not so rare a sentiment in the Hebrew Bible as sensitive souls might wish. Lessing finds in his text a particularly biting manifestation of it.The rubber hits the exegetical road in chapters six and seven, where the author takes his theory and method to the text (\`A Rhetorical Translation of and Commentary on Isaiah 23', pp. 133-168; \`A Rhetorical-Historical Analysis of Isaiah 23', pp. 169?-197). Lessing attempts a reading of the whole chapter as \`an oracle delivered in the Jerusalem court in 701 B.C.' In this reviewer's judgment, he does so to good effect, with the exception of his insistence that the \`in that day' prose colophon also comes from the mouth (or pen!) of Isaiah ben Amoz. It seems more consistent with this phenomenon's recurrence in the Oracles Against the Nations to see it as a subsequent elucidation of circumstances based upon the prophetic word and the circumstances which in due course fleshed out its meaning in space and time.When Lessing turns to the detection of satire in his text (chapter eight, \`Determining Prophetic Satire in Isaiah 23', pp. 198-209), he does so by means of Ricouer's emphasis upon context as a broad and necessary determiner of the meaning of words. The author wants to argue that the Tyre oracle-like some biblical parallels-is an oracle about a future event couched in terms of the past. He is at pains to demonstrate how the oracle's volubility and energy serve the prophet's satirical purpose. This purpose is further illuminated in chapter nine (\`An Analysis of the Rhetoric of Isaiah 23', pp. 210-240) via a verse-by-verse examination of Isaiah's rhetorical tools in what Lessing regards as a prediction of events that will occur in the near future from the perspective of the eight-century prophet.Chapter ten is worth the book's price and could well be used as stand-alone reading for a course on hermeneutics or biblical criticism (\`A Debate Between Redaction and Rhetorical Methods', pp. 241-267). It is not that Lessing achieves stunning new insight here, but rather that he manages pithy critique of the logic and method of redaction criticism while arguing that rhetorical criticism avoids similar pitfalls. His argument for simultaneity where others would prefer to see discontinuity and a longer horizon for the words \`in that day' than in the oracles upon which they follow is unconvincing in the light of the judgment/restoration pattern that this phrase appears to mediate. Nevertheless, he does present a plausible argument that a chapter like Isaiah 23 represents a \`one-time speech act'.In this reviewer's opinion, plausibility in such matters of historical and literary criticism is no empty result. Over against Lessing's considered reluctance to tie text fragments to historical moments about which we know-dare we say it?-extremely little, some of the older, classical, and almost \`canonical' twentieth-century critics seem rather sure of themselves in the light of the paucity of data with which they labored.Chapter eleven (\`Conclusions', 268-272) is what is says.Reed's book is plagued by formatting infelicities (uneven spacing where Hebrew text appears and inverted Hebrew clauses mishandled by the author's word processor) and spelling errors. The latter include a persistent inability to get authors' names and books' titles right (Christiansen/Christianson, Osborne/Osborn, Huffmon/Hoffom, Kuntz/Kunz, Sheppard/Shepherd; R.P. Gordon, \`The Place is Too Small'/\`This Place is Too Small') and a not victorious struggle with the Hebrew gentilic \`chasdiym'. Alas, these deficiencies are joined by redundancies (\`an earlier precursor') and footnote vertigo (ch. 2, fnn. 129, 130, ch. 8, fn 34 and corresponding text). This is sad, since it detracts from a fine argument otherwise presented with verve. It might have been ironed out by another week of editing.Nevertheless, Interpreting Discontinuity is a valuable contribution. Lessing has worked hard to show that a text like the Tyre oracle goes back in its entirety to the eight-century prophet.Does he succeed? Not entirely. But monographs like this one are not adequately apprized by a two-column win-loss chart. Rather, this monograph adds cumulative evidence to the affirmation that satire is both part and parcel of a rugged and even jarring manner of writing and speaking in the oracles against the nations. In the face of such literature, Lessing might suggest, a historical \`over-reading' gets the text wrong on the one extreme. On the other, \`ahistorical' rhetorical criticism is vulnerable to the charge of not getting it at all."},{"Title":"A Laodicean (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A Laodicean may be Thomas Hardy's weakest novel, but his mastery was such that it is more than worthy and quite respectable. Fans should read nearly everything he wrote before coming here but should definitely stop eventually, while those who have read a book or two and not found Hardy to their liking might consider skipping to it. Hardy put it with his \\"Novels of Ingenuity,\\" and it not only differs markedly from most of his work but is also experimental to a large degree. This will likely disappoint those who like his other novels, though there are other attractions, while those not usually keen on Hardy may well be pleasantly surprised.These differences are the book's most immediately striking aspect. Hardy had made himself known for rural settings, specifically in Wessex - the part-real, part-dream country, based on his native Southwest England, that he made world famous. This initially seems another entry - and indeed is in part, though not considered a Wessex novel -, but quickly expands to cover much of Europe, while events in various other parts of the world loom large in the background. Some initial readers were disappointed, as some current ones may well be, but this is notable as an overlooked example of Hardy's diversity. A master of place, he brings European resorts and casinos as fully and stirringly alive as rural England. That said, this is not so much unusual per se as unusual for him; such jaunts were near-obligatory in Victorian fiction, especially among Europeans, and this does not particularly stand out. One critic indeed commented that it must be the dullest European trip ever detailed in fiction, and it is easy to agree. Hardy made good use of his own vacation in describing the scenes, but the action is prolonged and strained - a problem to a lesser extent with the plot generally; he sometimes seems to lose focus and continue from obligation only.The time is also noticeably more recent than usual. A Laodicean was published in 1881 and seemingly set not long before, while most of his fiction is set around 1830 or earlier. As such, we see technology - telegraphs, photographs - usually not present in Hardy. His work has generally been noted for showing modernity's ache - how modern technology's intrusion drastically changed a rural agricultural society that had been virtually the same for a thousand years. This novel does so in a different and perhaps more overt - if not more interesting - way than most, especially as symbolized in the great early scene where Somerset follows a lone telegraph wire through the middle of proverbial nowhere. Perhaps even more surprising is how Hardy uses such elements to advance fantastic plot devices - fake telegram and photo, etc. - of the kind seemingly abandoned in Desperate Remedies, an entry in the then popular sensation genre and his first published novel. An even stronger development in this way is the character of Dare, an embodiment of pure self-serving malice even more highly-wrought than Desperate's Manston. The portrayal is so melodramatic that it almost has supernatural overtones and clashes oddly with the general realism. Hardy was always unusual among Victorian writers in mixing high seriousness with what might anachronistically be called pulp elements; this made him as readable as he was important and was key to his success as well as one of the major reasons he is still so widely read. However, some may think this goes too far, sacrificing literary value for entertainment. The showdown between Dare and Mr. Power is the height - or nadir, depending on one's view - of this, almost proto-James Bond. The scene where de Stancy stands with his ancestors' portraits, which is so implausible that it borders on farcical, is another case in point. Such things will disappoint those who admire more typical Hardy and can hardly win over those who do not but are fairly well done as far as they go. Less excusable as experiments are contrived digressions about tangential topics like infant baptism and gambling. Hardy usually excelled at working commentary into storyline, but here he seemed to hardly try.To be fair, we must remember that Hardy fell desperately ill shortly after beginning the book and was bedridden for six months while financial and other considerations forced him to painfully and laboriously dictate the rest. There is a definite falling off where the illness began; the first few chapters are consistently superb, the rest hit and miss. The novel would certainly have been stronger had he been at full strength, but inherent limitations would probably have always kept it from his top tier.It is easy to focus on eccentricities and faults, but A Laodicean also has many classic Hardy strengths. For example, the large rural England sections are on par with his usual excellence in regard to place, and his castle evocation is particularly noteworthy. Characterization is also very strong. Somerset is one of Hardy's most underrated heroes and quickly sympathetic, but the main interest is clearly heroine Paula Power. Hardy is well-known for his heroines, and she is one of the most overlooked. Like many of them, she is unusually well-educated, capable, and independent for a Victorian women in addition to being beautiful - a fascinating combination that makes highly engaging dramatization. The titular Biblical reference to a person neither cold nor hot applies to her in several ways, and the novel is perhaps above all a character study. However seemingly meandering and purposeless, the plot consistently shows this, and the unforgettable final sentence epitomizes it. Whatever the plot's shortcomings, it does vividly show the effects of pairing such a personality with contrary ones. She allures everyone she meets, but only the placidly easygoing Charlotte is never frustrated. Somerset and de Stancy love her to distraction but find her ambivalence exasperating, as do relatives to various extents. We are likely to feel the same - as, it is easy to think, Hardy did also -, admiring her independence and strength while sometimes shaking our heads at her indecisiveness. Capturing this type was surely Hardy's main intention - a seemingly obvious conclusion that critics have always missed. Though extremely well-done, it is of course not enough to hold a book, and most think it fails to atone for other weaknesses, but it is one of Hardy's unsung accomplishments and deserves more attention and praise. The nuanced de Stancy is also interesting; he is overshadowed but could have easily been the tragic hero of another Hardy novel. The same is true of Havill, who is sympathetic, even pitiable, despite - or, actually, because of - all-too-human faults. Hardy is also known for notable preacher characters, and this has one of the more distinguished - all the more so in being Baptist. The reverend's flaws are so obvious as to sometimes veer on laughable, but essential good-heartedness and the subtle depiction make a well-rounded and very remarkable character. As for Dare and Mr. Power, however over the top, they are certainly intriguing.What really puts the novel below Hardy's best, aside from a relative dearth of the emotional profundity always at the core of his masterpieces, is a near lack of the meaningful themes for which he is known. It does not deal with fate, humanity's cosmic significance, or other large questions like most of his work; the book is essentially a very basic courtship story with a small hodgepodge of typical Hardy elements thrown in more or less haphazardly. Yet there are at least a few minor successes. Perhaps most obvious is the portrayal of the Baptist Church in rural Victorian England - a truly underground movement then gaining power. Anyone even remotely familiar with Hardy knows his many problems with religion, but this depiction of Baptists, though somewhat critical and even satirical, is highly nuanced and not without sympathy - another instance of unexpected diversity. Hardy also explores his perennial class concerns through the courtship of Paula by the impoverished aristocrat de Stancy and the upwardly mobile Somerset. As always with him, the class system and other Victorian standbys are harshly criticized, and the upper class as usual comes out badly. Along the way he touches on paternity and other familial issues in a way that is both moving and thought-provoking. His points are valid and well-made, but the surrounding story is significantly less absorbing than usual. As for the empathetic treatment of women's issues that have made him a feminist favorite, the book has few, but the voyeuristic scene where de Stancy becomes infatuated with Paula, which has a near-pornographic feel, is notable for pushing the era's sexual standards and also for showing what was a very unusual view of gender roles. Those interested in Hardy's life will be far more keen on the book's many autobiographical elements. Hardy said it has more of his own life than any of his other novels, which is easy to see. He was an architect for years, which shows up in all his novels to varying extents but never so thoroughly or integrally. Much of Somerset's work parallels Hardy's, and there is a wealth of other relevant architectural elements. Finally, Dare and Mr. Power show Hardy grappling with the problem of evil and how it affects human affairs. He usually let unavoidable chance and change - and, it soon became clear, fate - wreck lives but is content to let these villains do it here. This is yet another noteworthy difference and, however less successful or preferable, is at least comparable in execution to other writers' similar efforts.Hardy's Preface suggests that the novel had \\"a predetermined cheerful ending\\" even before his illness, which is another standout feature from a writer famous for tragedies. The book has considerable darkness, and the ending's happy union is far more hard won than usual, but the close - and indeed the whole - is much gentler than was Hardy's wont. There is good reason to think Somerset and Paula will be happy, and we certainly hope so for the former's sake, but it is important to remember that, like Hardy's early novel Under the Greenwood Tree, the impression stands only because the plot stops almost immediately after marriage. Hardy once wrote that love thrives on propinquity but dies on contact and has many a work showing this, most of them highly critical of the marriage institution with little faith in his success. Again as with Under, he may well have stopped the story here because it was the only way he could maintain an even ostensibly happy end, but Paula's enigmatic last statement is somewhat worrying in any case. It hardly surprises - is indeed inevitable given her personality -, but probably startles the somewhat nave Somerset and may well mean the marriage will not be as smooth as he envisioned. The ending first struck me as somewhat abrupt, but I have come to see that it is not only perfect but virtually unavoidable - the fullest and most representative expression of Paula's personality and thus of the book's main concern. It may not be the most satisfying conclusion for those expecting either a fully happy or tragic end but works quite well on its own ambivalent terms - much like the book as a whole.As for this edition, it has a wealth of supplemental material, making it ideal for serious readers: Hardy's Prefaces to the novel and a collected edition of his works; an excellent introduction giving substantial background on Hardy, the book, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; a chronology; extensive notes; an overview of critical reaction to the novel; further reading suggestions; and chapter summaries. One could hardly ask for more, making this perhaps the best paperback version."},{"Title":"Replique Quilts: Applique Designs from Favorite Photos (That Patchwork Place)","review":"If you have wanted to create pictorial quilts but feel you cannot draw, this book will solve your problems.

Most of their books are very good, with some genuine classics. This one, unfortunately is not among their best. Give it a miss."},{"Title":"Power Play","review":"This book is a fast and easy read and is the story of a beautifull young girl, Belinda, and what it would be like if a member of the female sex were to behave as a male.Belinda as a young girl was tricked and seduced by an older neighbour, and, when she decided that she really liked it found that she could get what she wants by being an agressive 'alpha male' rather than a shrinking violet.As such, of course, our heroine has begun to enjoy picking up men at parties or bars, seducing them into frenzied sex and then discarding them just like old news by popping money into their pockets as she shows them her heels.Course when that just didn't cut it any more, Belinda found that male prostitutes did just as well for her.There is a story in the book that ties it all together, but let's not kid ourselves, the fun of it is watching Belinda behave just as a man would and take the sex wherever she could find it under her conditions.It's a 5 star light read, the sex is tame and the eroticism of the moment usually isn't there either. It's a wham bam thank you 'sir' kinda book ...."},{"Title":"The Fate of a Gesture: Jackson Pollock and Postwar American Art","review":"Jackson Pollock is seen as the greatest American artist ever, because of his poured paintings of the late 40's and early 50's. Dying in a drunken car crash in 1956, he left behind a legacy of American artists who weren't driven by European art tastes. The Abstract Expressionist movement, large canvases, and Pop Art are all traced back to Pollock.Also includes chapters about Rauschenberg, Johns, de Koonig, and Warhol, among others"},{"Title":"The Fate of a Gesture: Jackson Pollock and Postwar American Art","review":"Give me a break. This mish-mash of secondhand information is little more than easily readable. With little regard to chronology, Ratcliff separates the various artistic trends of postwar America using representative artists. All of the stories in this book have been told before, and better, by the artists and critics themselves. This kind of 'art journalism' (not unlike Calvin Tomkins' work) is informative, to be sure, but in quite a superficial and unsatisfying way. I suggest reading Irving Sandler's 'American art of the 1960s' for something as informative and enjoyable but with some opinions and insight."},{"Title":"The Fate of a Gesture: Jackson Pollock and Postwar American Art","review":"If you have any interest in Abstract Expressionism and New York school of painting, pick up this highly readable and well written book. The book traces the origins of American modern art to the expressive gestures of Jackson Pollack in his drip paintings. In some ways this gesture is replicated in the book, as chapters seem to jump/ merge from one subject or painter to another without reason, yet, in fact, is building up a glorious picture of the New York artists world at a particular point of time. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stravinsky: The Composer and His Works","review":"I really leaned on this book when I took a course on Stravinsky in my studies at the University of Michigan School of Music. There are later books that contain deeper analyses and penetrating discussions of aspects of Stravinsky, his composing process, and his works, but this remains a very fine single volume discussion of Stravinsky's life (a brief overview) and a really useful introduction to each of Stravinsky's works. Not only did I turn to it countless times during that course, I have used it many times over the years to find out this or that about certain works and to fine my way to other sources.The book is organized as many useful music biographies are: a discussion of his life and then a discussion of the musical works. There are many really nice illustrations, a solid bibliography (but a bit dated by now), and a most useful index.If you are interested in Stravinsky, and you should be, this is a great resource to have on your shelf and refer to as you investigate his works and life."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I THINK IT WAS A GREAT BOOK AND IT WAS FUN TO READ!BETH IS A GRATE PERAON!"},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I do agree with a previous reviewer that this video is not for beginners. I've taken yoga from live instructors for the past year and am able to successfully follow most videos with no problem. I would say instruction does not seem to be complete enough for a complete beginner. It's fine for me and I really enjoy this video. It has a no nonsense format to it in that it goes from one pose to the next quickly (but not too quickly) but I'd almost not call it a vinyasa flow. It's not as difficult as some of the other videos I own but I still walk away really feeling as if I'd worked hard. She includes chair, table, bridge, common standing poses, chatarangas (spelled wrong?), plank,inverted poses, etc. for a short, to the point workout.

But then again I wouldn't recommend any video for someone who hasn't attended a class. It's impossible to demonstrate every single aspect of a pose in a video when there's no one live to correct you. However, if you already know the poses well and want to practice at home...this is great. It's a lot of fun, the poses are great and challenging, I like the choreography and the music is really good.

For those who are more advanced, it gives the very basics of a practice, which are good to review, but does not go into further detail. YogaFit is a course unto itself. Therefore, if one wants to continue on it their practice, one must seek a YogaFit-based class and/or teacher training."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"As someone who has been practicing yoga for years and teaching for almost two years, I can sympathize with a lot of the issues that Shaw surfaces in her book. In a nutshell, many people who are curious about yoga and want to take advantage of its physical benefits are either intimidated or turned off by what they perceive to be the rest of the &quot;yoga lifestyle&quot; and feel as if Yoga with a capital Y is an all-or-nothing proposition. To the extent that Shaw's book opens the door for those people, I applaud her. I also find her statement that she feels she has a mission to contribute to society by sharing yoga admirable.However, I feel like she unnecessarily insults &quot;traditional yoga&quot; several times in the course of the book. For instance, she writes in her preface, &quot;What separates YogaFit from other forms of yoga is that YogaFit speaks directly and without pretensiousness to everyone, but especially to the needs of amateur and professional athletes.&quot; And later in the same paragraph, &quot;...YogaFit holds the answers to all of these [sports-training] problems without boring you to death.&quot; Reading these words, I can't help but get the impression that Shaw is convinced that she is the only one who can deliver the goods to athletes and fitness enthusiasts; Baron Baptiste will be interested to hear that.One of the other notable aspects of the book is that Shaw can't seem to decide whether YogaFit is a form of yoga or something else altogether. She refers to it as an accessible, demystified form of yoga, then later has a full page chart contrasting the difference between YogaFit and yoga. Curious, since she went to great pains several years ago to have her training program recognized by Yoga Alliance, a registering body of yoga instructors and schools.The most glaring inconsistency presented by the book is that while Shaw's focus is clearly on the postures, her instructions are lacking. While I don't think one needs to spend paragraphs describing how to enter and hold a pose, some things are worth mentioning, like hip placement in the warriors and not locking your elbows in postures such as Tabletop and Upward Dog. Finally, the instructions that she gives for some of the sequences are difficult to understand in some places, and she appears to work sides unevenly (for example, in the YogaFit Classic sequence, you're doing more Pyramids on one side than another).Having said all of that, I do like the postures that she chose- most of them are basic and appropriate enough for both beginners and more advanced students."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"A few years ago, I was at my local gym when I noticed a group of people practicing yoga on the aerobics floor. I wandered over and asked what they were doing, and Beth Shaw looked up at me and said, &quot;I am teaching these people how to instruct Yogafit classes Do you want to join us?&quot; I'm not a fitness proffessional, but It looked like fun. I filled an empty space in the class, and for the next two days I was emmersed in Yogafit. Initially, I worried about not being as &quot;in shape&quot; as everyone there, but Beth explained that everyone regardless of fitness level, or age could benifit from Yogafit. She was right. It was a great workout and for the first time in years, my back stopped hurting. I had been seeing a chiropractor for low back pain for years, but I didn't go back after my Yogafit weekend.I didn't end up teaching Yoga, but I assist at a local martial arts academy and use many of the stretches and poses to warm up the class. Yogafit is wonderful for preparing your body for higher impact activities. When I saw Beth Shaw's book in the store, I bought it immediately even though I already have her training materials. The photos are great and she explains the poses really well. It is a great tool. Beth Shaw is the real deal and Yogofit is an awesome way to take care of yourself."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I really like this book. It is a great supplement to my yoga videos. I have found Yoga a great source for relaxation but also for sculpting. Beth Shaw's book really allows you to know which muscles you are stretching and/or strengthening with each pose. I guess the only draw back is that it is a bit short on poses. Only 50 which were mainly familiar to me from the videos I use. I hope she does another book with more advanced poses. THis is a great resourse!"},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"Beth's YogaFit Second Edition is one of the most comprehensive well written and useful book about Yoga I have found on the market.

Some reviewers are just being cruel. I have nothing but respect for Eric Shiffman, Richard Freeman, Sean Corne, Baron Baptiste, and Rodney Yee, but I don't see any of them giving away free books/classes/seminars/videos-DVD's, just for the sake of teaching their form of yoga. Beth is being attacked for something that anyone in the yoga field is doing by writing a book, etc. They are making a living. This is a wonderful book to start anyone out in learning about basic yoga. As in the physical aspects of yoga. It is a starting point, so if someone wants to move on to the more spiritual aspects they can. Or if they just want to feel comfortable walking into any yoga class, they will with confidence from what Beth has put in this book. By the way, YogaFit is part of the Yoga Alliance, so it is a legitimate form of yoga."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I found this book easy to follow, fun to read and inspirational as a new fitness yoga person.

They obviously never matured past 7th grade if they feel the need to post negative things about Beth Shaw on AMAZON of all places. She has never had liposuction (obviously someone is very jealous of her abs) and she is not anorexic. Unless you know anything about anorexia...anorexics don't eat enough to put on the amount of hard muslce that Miss Shaw has. So GROW UP PEOPLE.The book is fabulous and gives a very detailed break down of all yoga poses and the video is just the same. If you're into old fashioned yoga-this isn't for you. If your into yoga explained like a fitness pro and without all the \\"sanskrit\\" language...then this is your ticket.

We have one person who has never read the book and only states bad things because her \\"Supposed\\" friend didn't get a refund from Ms. Shaw's studio \\"allegedly\\". I would like to see what the person has to say about the GAP or Target if they don't offer her friend a refund either. Seems a bit immature to me.Then we have someone who also didn't read the book and just says that Beth Shaw is a rude person even a \\"Monster\\"...sounds like someone didn't get what they want from her? If she's so rude then why do people adore her and follow her around the country to her trainings no differently than Baron Baptiste or Rodney Yee (whom has been accused of sexual harrassment but I don't see a negative posting about him anywhere.)? She has the largest yoga school in the country and her people keep coming back for more. That says something. Beth Shaw is the only yoga person so far that has bent over backwards to make a program that allows everyone to feel like they belong and all the while donates to multiple charitites and empowers others to do the same. We should all take a lesson. She really is a visionary in a very judgemental and harsh world (as some of you have shown us with your unyoga-like and borderline creepy postings). If you want to talk trash about someone then go to an AOL chatroom. Shame on all of you."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I think it's a bit weird that people are posting personal information on this book review. Makes me wonder if someone has a personal vendetta? For starters, the book is great and so is Beth Shaw. I was a student at the YogaFit stuido in Hermosa Beach (not Redondo Beach) before I moved to Denver. Beth Shaw doesn't even work at the studio and there is no such thing as a \\"150 pack\\". She just comes in long enough to teach her killer classes and that's it. She doesn't even manage the place because she has a manager. So whoever mentioned that insane info about her selling someone a 150 pack got incorrect info. She is also the only Yoga instructor I have ever taken a class by that holds donation classes for local non-profits and even offered every student a free 5 pack if they donated to UNICEF after the tsunami in 2004. I LOVE the fact the she requires all her Level One teacher trainees do 8 hours of community service because people need to give a little more and stop taking from this planet. She is all about \\"giving back\\" and I would like to see some of these other people like Rodney Yee and Anna Forest do the same. I went to a lot of other yoga studios while is LA County and nobody-not even YogaWorks- did anything even remotely close to YogaFit for their local community."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I thought the book was fabulous.

It's user friendly, detailed enough to not confuse me too much and doesn't invlove any of the traitional yoga words or chanting. I like that's it's in a fitness format and so I give it a thumbs up!

I found that not only is the book great at giving a very user-friendly detailed description of common yoga poses but it was so great that I decided to take a YogaFit teacher training. I am trained through Level 3 and let me just say...Beth Shaw is NOT anorexic. I met her after a Master Class at a Spinning Conference. If I had to take a guess I would say she weighs about 150lbs and she is pure muscle. Obviously someone out there is anorexic and likes to believe everyone who is in shape is anorexic too.

To me, a genius is not soemone who necessarily invents something, but someone who does something better or more effectively. Example, Apple Computer deposed and reinstated CEO Steve Jobs would tell you invented the GUI (graphical user interface), hence he's a genius in his not humble opinion. Wrong liberal Steve, Bill Gates brought the system to the masses, so he is the genius (and thus the target of protectionists like Eurotrash (Mario Monti) & US government regulators and business crybabies such as Real networks Rob Glaser, Larry Ellison, Scott McNealy, etc.) (Jobs wins big for the iPod however. Although, he should watch out for \\"video iPods\\" and cell phones with MP3 capabilities.) (Special mention for the great Steve Case & Marc Andreesen (sp?) of AOL and Netscape here).In Yogafit, Beth Shaw ignores the obscure aspects of yoga, and instead focuses on its exercise related qualities. This is in direct contrast to many in the yoga community (excluding the great Baron Baptiste and a few others). If there are three components of fitness--flexibility, strength training, and cardiovascular work--Ms. Shaw knocks out two of those. Unlike the Ashtanga/Power Yoga crowd, she does not claim that Yogafit will satisfy your cardio needs. The Ashtanga/Power Yoga leaders maintain that due to their focus on tai-chi like connecting moves, the bandhas, and heat, that their workout is satisfactory for a cardio workout. I respectfully disagree.Ms. Shaw uses 50 postures, which is a great start for someone beginning a fitness routine. Clearly, as someone who does Hatha yoga, I don't feel that is a satisfactory asana sequence for an advanced practioner. However, her workout will certainly be a challenge for most.Ms. Shaw chooses not to use the Sanskrit names for the postures, which I think is a great idea and less intimidating to new practioners.As a workout, I feel that by adding dumbbells for poses like Warrior and chair, you can greatly enhance the effects.Overall, a terrific book. Ms. Shaw should publish a new, improved version.Finally, the shrill response from some of the more militant members of the yoga \\"community\\" who ostracize Ms. Shaw (paging Yoga Journal magazine) (and the great Steve Ilg of \\"Wholistic Fitness) is entirely inappropriate.

I see it as no different from what other Yoga instructors have done around the country by using English translations of poses and focusing on communication of the health and energetic benefits of Yoga poses.And, by the way, YogaFit teachers do train in the esoteric aspects of Yoga (meditation, Chakras, philosophy, ancient texts and Sanskrit) when they participate in Shaw's Yoga Alliance approved program.Shaw has built quite a following, with people traveling all over the country to take classes with her.

She calls it a program for a more powerful, flexible, and defined physique. YogaFit is based on a vinyasa flow style of yoga that provides a challenging physical workout.Her book provides a comprehensive, user-friendly introduction to hatha yoga and guide to the YogaFit system, clearly and concisely.The first part of the book is called \\"Preparing for YogaFit.\\" Here the basics are covered including a discussion of yoga's benefits, the philosophy of yoga, how to prepare for doing yoga, required yoga equipment, breathing concepts and the YogaFit approach to yoga pose sequencing. It also includes a review of The YogaFit Seven Principles of Alignment, an integral aspect of the YogaFit system. The Seven Principles of Alignment, coupled with the fitness based format of warm-up, workout, and cool down help to make YogaFit a safe, accessible style of yoga. Modern exercise science is applied to the ancient mind-body practice of yoga to help keep you safe and avoid injury. Something too often overlooked in many of today's yoga classes.The second part of Beth Shaw's YogaFit is all about yoga poses. More than sixty basic yoga poses are covered. Each pose includes photographs and instructions for getting into the pose, holding the pose, and suggested pose modifications. Poses are categorized into the following chapters - core strength poses, standing poses, forward and back bending poses, twists, and deep relaxing poses and inversions.Part three of the book puts it all together into a variety of fitness focused yoga workout sequences. There is also an exhaustive list of suggested yoga routines for various special athletic requirements including swimming, running, cycling, golf, tennis and many more.The book concludes with chapters on diet and nutrition and an introduction to meditation.Beth Shaw's YogaFit is a book I intend to add to my yoga resource shelf. It is a helpful guide and resource to beginners wanting to practice at home and athletes looking for suggested yoga routines to support their cross-training efforts. Yoga instructors looking for simple alignment principles and suggested sequencing to help yoga students practice safely will also find it helpful."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"Beth Shaw's new YogaFit 2nd edition is a comprehensive introduction to the practice of the eight limbs of yoga. She details safe execution of poses and how to sequence them, but also discusses other important aspects of the practice, including meditation, energy systems, philosophy, and nutrition in a clear and concise format. What does it really mean to be well? to be 'fit'? With this book, we learn about holistic fitness and wellness from the yogic perspective. This book is now required reading for my university yoga course."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"Other than doing yoga poses when I was pregnant, YogaFit was my first exposure to yoga poses. I took a college course, and our course book was the first edition of the Beth Shaw's YogaFit book.The second book is so much of an improvement over the second book, in that the second book has delved into the philosophy of yoga, a bit more detailed information about special populations of people, who might enjoy practicing yoga, details about YogaFit's Seven Principles of Alignment, which are essential in one practice of safe yoga, and excellent descriptions of the poses with photographs and great worded explanations.A bit of a bonus, which I really like, are visual diagrams of the YogaFit varied workouts. From Beginning Yoga, to Flex and Flowing through your poses, to a core version of yoga, to ending with a diagram of poses to do in a power yoga format.There are some nice additional sections in the book about diet and nutrition, meditation, and information about the chakras. Plus at the end a list of the different pose, and where they are optimally placed in YogaFit Mountain format.I've been pleased with the Human Kinetics books, and Beth's second edition book is wonderful.Gail Pickens-Barger"},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I loved the breathing exercises particularly. And i also enjoyed the principles which really helped me put my life in perspective."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I recommend this book for those who are going to take the YogaFit teacher training. I took the Level 1 training and this book was a required reading. It not only gives a great introduction to the style of YogaFit, but a simple introduction and explanation of what yoga is, its roots, etc. It also gives great breakdowns of the poses. I definitely recommend reading the first 5 chapters to get a good idea of the philosophy of YogaFit."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"Hail to all the teachers of yoga, for the world is certainly a happier and healthier place thanks to them. Beth Shaw has earned her place among the ranks of notable yogis and her latest book, Yogafit, is worthy of her dedication to the path. With just enough preliminary direction and information this is a great book for yoga initiates, and with a volume of poses of differing intensities, this is a great book to keep one practicing or to challenge your existing practice. Basic instructions accompany each pose, alongside a photograph of someone demonstrating the pose. The series of yoga movements offered in Part III--workouts that incorporate a warm-up, practice with peaks and valleys, and a cool down, at varying levels of difficulty, comprise the Yogafit program. With this structure, one can customize a workout not only for fitness level, but also in response to how your body is feeling on any given day.The benefits of yoga to mind, body and spirit are numerous and far-reaching; the best reason to do yoga is because you will feel better. How you will feel better is a personal experience, but feel better you will. Just ask anyone who does yoga on a regular basis. Best of all, with modifications, yoga is suitable and beneficial for everyone from three to one hundred, for super-athletes or couch potatoes, for the housebound or wheelchair-bound. If you are breathing, you can do yoga. And Yogafit can help--yes, with the breathing too!"},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I really got a lot out of this video, as a new yoga instructor I found this video to be very helpful.

It is a blend of Iyengar, Hatha, Ashtanga and Vinyasa yoga."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"This is an outstanding reference for those new to yoga as well as a more seasoned practitioner. The information is clear, concise, does not confuse and overwhelm you with too much detail. There is enough information provided to move you safely through the asanas and suggested sequences at the end. I especially find the book layout quite handy for quickly locating the pose I am interested in. All the photos appear on the left page, with the text information on the right so you can fan quickly through the book to locate what you are looking for. The back section includes complete sequencing for three levels of practice, and the final portion shows asanas that will particularly enhance several sports activity that you may be engaged in. Having personally heard some of the really weird ideas people have about what yoga is and does, I applaud Beth's fresh and unintimidating presentation of the physical benefits of this practice."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"I liked the book a lot. It's a great reference. I noticed some of these books reviews refer to silly negative postings but I didn't see them anywhere. Sounds like some jokster posted a bunch of silly stuff so kudos to Amazon for taking action. They sounded hilarious though.Anyway, great book. I like YogaFit a lot. It's just a basic Yoga practice for people like me who need some help with the lower back and hips without all the philosophy behind it . I already have a philosophy about life and like to reap the benefits of hatha yoga without necessarily subscribing to anything. I think YogaFit is a genius program."},{"Title":"Beth Shaw's Yogafit","review":"It's good stuff.

I could not put it down. Please do another or update this one."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"After many years of being a wrestling fan I became a professional wrestler. Like any other business it has it's ups and downs, it's good and bad, it's rewards and punishments. Show me any other job that does not have these and I'll show you a liar! Nothing in this book is uncommon. Not every promotion, promotor, wrestler, manager, etc. is a ruthless gangster with devil horns. If an office worker refuses to do his or her job they get fired. If a wrestler refuses to do his or her job they get fired as well.Wrestlers are independant contractors. We can work for any promotion at any time. Most of us do not work for the big WWE so we pay for our own travel, lodging, meals. Most of us get paid very little if at all depending on the promotion, the event and the names on the bill. Most of the promotors see us as talent filling the slots to book a full show and not much more. The bumps, injuries, pain is 100% legit. We know all of this going into the business. The reason we do it is the same as the reason the fans watch it...we love it!There are many positive things about being a wrestler. Many of us do care about each other, watch out for each other and help each other, as do many promotors. Meetings fans is not looked at by most of us as anything negative...most of us see that as a privilege. Just like the acting or music business, many go in wanting to be a star but few ever get there. For those that do there are many waiting to be the next star, etc.My career has never made me famous or rich but that was not my intention when I got into it. I am not bitter or angry about some of the few negative incidents I have seen. This guy is obviously one who went into it thinking he would be the next Hulk Hogan and ended up another nameless \\"ham-and-egger\\" taking bumps at the local high school gym. His claims and stories are overblown, key issues and events are taken out of context and are very one-sided. The book sounds like the biggest \\"Poor me\\" whine I've heard."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"I don't know if Jim Wilson was blackballed or got hurt patting himself on the back. It was very interesting to read the behind the curtain things and about what the boys go through, however I had to skip page upon page as it was just Jim talking about himself and how great he thinks he is. Good book if you don't mind speed reading over Jim's love of himself."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"Who is this guy? Has anyone ever heard of him? NO! He is just another bitter failure who couldn't cut it and instead of accepting his failure, he cries out a book crying conspiracy. Professional wrestling isn't for everyone and this guy is unknown. He needs to get over himself and get a life. This book is a joke!"},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"Chokehold is a very well researched work. In fact there has been nothing preceeding it that has even come close to the details that Wilson has in this book. I commend and thank him for that. I found it very interesting indeed.The only problem with this work is Wilson's view of his own pro wrestling career, as well as the careers of Ron Pope AKA The Magnificent Zulu and Claude &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Patterson.Wilson starts out the book by claiming he was a fan of pro wrestling while he was growing up, saying that he watched it on TV sometimes and went to the live matches twice. TWICE!!! Big deal. A true fan in that era watched the TV wrestling every week and went to many live shows. Wilson was never a serious fan judging by his statements (which was actually a failed attempt to prove otherwise).Wilson also says that he got into wrestling in the early 1970s to &quot;make money&quot; during the off season from the NFL.He also claims that Atlanta promoter Ray Gunkle basically promised him the NWA world title. Both of these statements are more or less outrageous, to say the least.First of all, every rookie breaking into the business, including NFL former All-Americans, were always told over &amp; over again how they'd never make any real money in wrestling and most never did. The pay scale for newcomers was low. Read Ole Anderson's new book &quot;Inside Out&quot; for a real look at how things ran and how pay was figured.You had to be a top main event star, usually in more than one territory, to ever make real good money. The promoters were the ones who got the richest and Wilson more than acknowledges that in his book, so I don't see where he got the idea that he was going to accumulate great wealth from working in pro wrestling.Secondly, Jim Wilson was NEVER a big name in the business. I am a wrestling historian and fanatic, and an ex-wrestler myself (from the same period that Wilson tried working in the business) and to be honest, if it hadn't been for Wilson's lawsuits and TV expose of wrestling, I don't think that I'd have ever heard of him.He wasn't a main event star and from those I've talked to that saw him work matches, he didn't have the ability to ever be one. He didn't draw any money at the gate (and his book more or less proves that point as he himself admits that an outlaw show he tried to promote didn't draw a single fan). I'm not holding that against him as far as Chokehold goes, as it's a very good book overall.The other problem I have with this book is Wilson's slant on racism in the business. Sure, it was prevelant and even blatant at times, but Wilson's examples to prove that point fall flat.He mainly uses Pope &amp; Patterson as his examples. Now Thunderbolt Patterson was a big name in the business throughout the 60s &amp; 70s. He worked on top in numerous territories and he was great on interviews, but his ring work was just average.He was a decent and very entertaining performer, but was NEVER of world championship caliber.Wilson doesn't see that because he is unable to judge who is talented &amp; who is not.Wilson proves this by using Ron Pope as his next example. Pope was not talented or entertaining and couldn't even do a decent interview. The only thing that Pope had going for him was his tremendous look. He was huge and muscular but that's it. He never knew how to work.If Pope had been white he'd never even been given a chance in the business, but Detroit promoter Ed Farhat AKA The Sheik gave Ron his start and the gimmick as Zulu, but even that gimmick didn't save him from being exposed in every single match he had as a horrible worker.Pope was a real nice guy with a great personality &amp; body, but he was never able to transfer that personality to the ring and his muscular build kept him in the business far longer than he would have lasted had he been white.So realizing that, I have to take just about everything Wilson writes with a grain of salt.Had Wilson cut out the continual whining about himself, Patterson &amp; Pope, I would have given this book 5 stars, because it's that good otherwise.This book should hold the interest of any fan of wrestling's &quot;Golden Era&quot; as well as anyone who wants to learn about the NWA and how it ran. Even a know it all like me learned a lot from Chokehold. I was surprised just how much I really did learn by reading it.I strongly reccomend this book and I strongly suggest reading Inside Out right after finishing Chokehold. They go well together. This book gives you a lot of information while Ole Anderson's book give you the straight, hard facts."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"This is simply the best book on pro wrestling ever published, and I've read virtually all of them. Chokehold is not another wrestling comic and picture book of fluff and puff, but a beautifully written and documented history of the pro wrestling industry from the late 1940s to the present. It's no accident that wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer called this book &quot;the most important book on pro wrestling covering the second half of the 20th century.&quot;Chokehold is very much an insider account of the wrestling industry's shoddy business practices and labor relations. The book deals honestly with pro wrestling's &quot;unromantic underside,&quot; the authors call it &quot;a secret world of exploitation, abuse and illegality.&quot; In telling pro wresting's fascinating history, the authors present countless stories that cast light on the industry's long tradition of conducting its business in secrecy where there isn't much public notice or attention. The book's viewpoint is that of a former NFL player turned pro wrestler who was later blacklisted, Jim Wilson, one of the book's co-authors, and it is a compelling viewpoint that conveys the pain and pathos of all those wrestlers, past and present, who left the wrestling business with only broken bodies and shattered lives. Chokehold, unlike other wrestling books I've read, describes in detail the backstabbing wrestling life backstage, after the arena lights and TV cameras are turned off each night.Serious wrestling fans are going to love this book and the wrestling promoters will hate it. And all the old, retired wrestlers living in poverty and pain and the widows of dead wrestlers will be grateful that somebody finally had the courage to tell the whole story about pro wrestling."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"\\"Chokehold\\" is no ordinary wrestling biography. It is the story of one man's attempt to challenge the Powers-That-Be for fair wages and benefits. He could have been a superstar of the mat world, and I remember him distinctly being pushed for such a position, but his integrity and ethics prevented such a future. They also may have saved him from an early death from the wrestling lifestyle that has left so many other victims in its wake.Along the way, not only is the story of Jim Wilson told, but the seamy world of professional wrestling is exposed in all its faded notoriety. The fact that shady and illegal shenanigans happen from time to time in sports is nothing new to most readers, but the fact that these very same doings have been part and parcel of the way professional wrestling has been doing business since its inception should give readers cause for concern. Behind the glitz of the television camera and the character angles is a business that sees many of its most talented performers pass away at relatively early ages; a business that treats its workers like serfs on a feudal estate, telling them to win or lose, how to win or lose and where to appear, all the while calling them \\"independent contractors.\\" This, of course, to deny them health and pension benefits available to most other workers. And, most astonishing of all, while Congress and the Justice Department have vetted boxing and other sports over the years, the image of pro wrestling as an unbelievable sham has kept it protected, except for a brief period in the 50's, when pro wrestling was convicted of Antitrust misdeeds, which were quickly forgotten by all parties concerned a few years later.Instead of wasting your money on prefabricated biographies of WWE superstars, where the only things you really learn is that wrestling is wonderful and Vince McMahon the most wonderful of all, read this book, for it is the closest wrestling fans will get to the truth that underlies the circus-style atmosphere of that strange hybrid of athletics and entertainment."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"I agree with parts of every review of this book I've read.I'd have never heard of Jim Wilson if not for his efforts to reform the wrestling business--I was too young to know him as a football player, and he wrestled in the early cable days, so I wouldn't have seen him on TV while I was growing up in Alabama. Therefore, I don't know anything about him as an athlete/performer. However, he seems to think enough of his own abilities that he doesn't need any corroboration from me.Be that as it may, the well-researched stories he tells of the wrestling business make me wonder if I shouldn't be ashamed to be a wrestling fan (but not so much I won't watch it next time it comes on)."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"When I first read Chokehold in 2004, shortly after it was published, I thought this was probably the best pro wrestling book I'd seen. Two years later, after reading all the other wrestling books that have come out in the past two years and re-reading Chokehold again, I am convinced that Chokehold is clearly the best thing yet published on the mat game. It's an unprecedented (and possibly unappreciated) triumph in its breadth and depth and, unlike any other wrestling books I've seen, it has documentation in chapter notes and includes a name index. It's also more intelligently written than anything else out there (despite a few minor errors that are inevitable in any 500+ page book). By comparison, this book is a joy to read and it is the one book that other writers and publishers in this genre ought to study as a model. If there were Pulitzer prizes for wrestling books, Wilson and Johnson would have one."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"Chokehold reveals the dark underworld of professional wrestling. The National Wrestling Alliance is revealed as pro wrestling's mafia, controlling the business through dirty tactics over the years. In some ways, it makes me very sad to be a pro wrestling fan.But at the same time, there's hope for the business and hopefully some reforms will happen, especially with a union for pro wrestlers, pensions, health insurance, and a drop in the fatalities of wrestlers from drugs and alcohol.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is a serious student of pro wrestling's history."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"My compliments to Johnson and Wilson on a terrific book!!! CHOKEHOLD dispels conventional publishing wisdom that all wrestling books are written for juvenile, mouth-breathing fans. CHOKEHOLD appeals to the savvy wrestling afficionado on several levels --first, as a compelling story of a wrestler crusading for professional dignity and second, as a riveting history of a corrupt mega-business. A great read all around and a great Christmas gift idea!!"},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"A MUST BUY for every wrestling fan's library and a GREAT holiday gift for the committed wrestling fan. Finally, an intelligent and captivating book about pro wrestling, filled with fascinating characters, which describes how the wrestling game became what it is today, warts-and-all. CHOKEHOLD is more than the personal tale of one sorry wrestler. CHOKEHOLD entwines Jim Wilson's story with an insider's view on the tumultuous wrestling promoters' turf wars of the last half of the 20th century which eliminated competition in the wrestling industry and created fertile ground for pervasive wrestler abuse. Masterfully written in painstakingly researched detail. I read it and re-read it several times."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"I've been a wrestling fan since my dad took me to the matches, in late-1970's San Diego. My 9 year old brain instantly realized: a)The action inside the ring was for fun, not for fighting; and b)I absolutely loved the heels (bad guys). The main event that evening, which took place in a barn-sized building and couldn't have held more than 600-800 bodies, was the continuance of a feud that had raged up and down the Cali coast for over a year-top babyface (good guy) Chavo Guererro vs despised (by everyone but me, it seemed) mega-heel Roddy Piper.While the bouts were in session, various wrestlers would stand around doorways that led to the dressing room presumably, so they could check out the other workers and the crowd. I had my little green autograph book and had already gotten the scribbled 'names' of such less-than luminaries as Butcher Vachon, Porkchop Cash, and Hector Lamas. However, these did nothing for me; everyone was allowed to walk up to the ring just before the bell and get the good guys to sign their name. More than halfway through the evening, however, my wandering eye caught the one guy whose John Hancock I would have prized: Yep, the \\"Rowdy One\\" himself was standing with another worker in the corner of the room. Mustering up every ounce of courage, I meekly approached the \\"Scot\\" and asked. I distinctly recall how tall he seemed-surely this was one of the biggest, tallest guys on the planet! \\"I dont, uh...suppose you would give me your autograph...sir?\\". Without saying a word, Piper simply looked down upon my pitiful countenance and slooowwlly shook his head: No.I mumbled some words of wisdom like \\"oh, uh, thanks\\" and quickly walked back to the safety of my pops. When i told him the story, he just seemed mildly amused. Later, when i told my mother and grandmother, they practically recoiled in disgust. \\"How could that jerk turn down an innocent, little etc etc etc...\\". Meanwhile, it was slowly dawning on me: The way Piper treated me was..well, it..was..AWESOME! I mean, would i rather have some meaningless scribble inside a kiddie autograph book that i'd surely lose at some point-or would i prefer a cool little tale i could regale younger rasslin' fans with for the duration of my existence? No contest.I told you that to tell you this: If stories like this remind you why you love this crazy pseudo-sport, and how much the over-sized personalities of yesteryear are as much a part of your memories as your own family highlights...then you'd be better off skipping Jim Wilson's \\"Chokehold\\".When i finally purchased this whistle-blowing, controversial tome last year, I was already numb to the 'angles' and 'programs' (storylines), and thanks to the slick, corporate style of modern-age pro wrestling (or sports entertainment, as megalomaniacal WWE owner Vincent K McMahon, Jr would prefer it be called), I no longer got enjoyment from what had always been my favorite part of the whole show-the 'heel promo'. (Which is basically when the villain barks various insults into a microphone, while looking directly into a TV camera). In other words, I was ready to read a business buzz-kill on the order of Wilson's diatribe.Thanks in part to the author's real-life credentials (All-American at Georgia U, NFL starter, and eventual United States Senator), I found myself soaking up the first half of Wilson's work with gusto, involuntarily giving him the benefit of the doubt when he would describe yet another of several personal beefs with local wrestling promoters and bookers (a promotion's 'head writer'). Although the tone was often self-congratulatory, with an air of martyrdom, soaked in superiority, I was hardly a virgin when it came to the seedy backstabbing (sometimes literally!) and soul-selling that went on in this strange universe. Wilson often simply re-enforced beliefs i'd held for years, and occasionally justified my personal loathing of certain notorious individuals.But the more i read, the harder it was to shake the uneasy feeling that this supposedly important work exposing the greedy owners and, hopefully improving all aspects of the business for the hard-working men and women of pro wrestling, was simply using that facade to grind some old axes. In wrestling parlance, I began to believe Wilson was just playing the role of the babyface in order to get himself over.And, in fact, after finishing this massive 'Gotcha!', I realized that the one document i had assumed was the only truly honest thing written about professional wrestling was, in fact, just another WORK, with Wilson using his relative fame to give some imagined long-overdue RECEIPTS out to all the promoters, bookers, and fellow workers who either didn't give him the PUSH he thought he had been promised, or who had the gall to take pride in their job, despite never having been a 'real National hero' like Senator Wilson.Read it if you have to, and believe what you must. But remember, when you think you maybe feel the tone of \\"Chokehold\\" transitioning from an inspiring tale of the only man brave enough to call out the system in which he and thousands of others toiled, to a self-important whine-fest...don't doubt yourself."},{"Title":"CHOKEHOLD: Pro Wrestling's Real Mayhem Outside the Ring","review":"I have not finished reading the book, about half way. So far some new things have been brought to my attention. I am a fan of pro wrestling, even though I know it is not \\"legit\\". I never knew how poorly the men were treated by the promoters. Someday I hope these guys will get the benifits they deserve."},{"Title":"The book of Monelle,: By Marcel Schwob; translated by William Brown Meloney v; with preface by John Erskine and an introduction by the translator","review":"This short work of literature has had a profound effect on me that few other works can rival. I've only just finished reading it but it certainly will not be the last time. I'm positively amazed that this book has been out of print in English translation since 1921. Having come to Schwob as a fan of Alfred Jarry and Jorge Luis Borges, both of whom professed their allegiance to Schwob, I was still astounded by the freshness and originality of Schwob's prose. This is the kind of book that the New York Review should have published years ago. The translation is still supple at about 85 years of age, and the introduction extremely informative. However, it is harder to see the contemporary parallels in \\"The Book of Monelle\\" than in Schwob's other works. \\"Imaginary Lives\\" would provide Borges, Danilo Kis and J. Rodolfo Wilcock with a model for their historical reveries, while the supreme \\"Children's Crusade\\" employs the narrative strategies that would make Faulkner's \\"As I Lay Dying\\" famous. \\"The Book of Monelle\\", on the other hand, is a fiercely personal allegory containing equal parts philosophy, poetry, fairy-tales and memoir. It is simply a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that has suffered tragic obscurity. Unlike many such works of obscure literature, which can at times be obtuse or arcane, \\"The Book of Monelle\\" is simply a joy to read, and still begs the reader to be challenged and enraptured by the shifting surfaces of its form.Divided into three sections, Schwob transfigures the memory of his deceased former lover until she lives as a poetic apparition and as an echo in the lives of others. The only predecessor to \\"Monelle\\" that I can identify is Gerard de Nerval's \\"Sylvie\\" and \\"Aurora\\", but Schwob's stylistic innovation, the extremely varied and experimental techniques of story telling, and his shockingly modern, musical use of rhythmic language place \\"The Book of Monelle\\" far closer to our cultural grasp. The effect is one of intense intimacy and beauty.\\"The Book of Monelle\\" deals primarily with children, or with the impossibility of innocence and ignorance of the world. In that sense it is of a piece with his equally astounding \\"Children's Crusade\\", which should be read before or after \\"Monelle\\". In both, he conveys at once the fantastical appearance of reality in the eyes of children, and the grief-stricken view of that innocence seen from an adult perspective.The meanings are tentative and ambiguous, the nature of the allegory unstable, but the brilliance of the language cultivates a potent experience. His language is quite beautiful but it is never belabored. I would compare it to Buchner's \\"Lenz\\" in the way it reflects a variety of mental states in the concise descriptions of nature and atmosphere. Comparisons are difficult with such a diffuse and unique work of literature, but \\"The Blind Owl\\" by Sadegh Hedayat also comes to mind, for its musical repetition of motifs and its phantasmagoric view of femininity. Schwob's structuring of the material is even more radical than Hedayat's, which actually makes the work less oppressive. Moreover, Hedayat's grim tale is far more nihilistic than Schwob's, which is hardly joyful, but nevertheless offers moments of sublime beauty and tenderness. This should be reprinted, along with \\"The Children's Crusade\\", at once!"},{"Title":"The book of Monelle,: By Marcel Schwob; translated by William Brown Meloney v; with preface by John Erskine and an introduction by the translator","review":"I have not had the pleasure of reading this, as it has been out of print (as noted above) for some time, but I know of a new translation done by a dear friend who goes by the name Schluter.

I have used several different texts in my quest to become competent in Latin. I first signed up for a university correspondence course which used Wheelock. Mistake. The pace of a college level course for someone with no experience with an inflected language is far too fast. I gave it up as a bad job. a few years later I taught a group of homeschoolers using Latina Christiana, keeping 2 or 3 lessons ahead of them. Latina Christiana is a gentle program for memorizing verb forms and becoming familiar with some vocabulary and cognates and derivatives. It is good for youngsters but doesn't go very deep. I bought Ecce Romani for one of my children some years after that and used it myself a little. It was okay, but I still did not know how Latin \\"worked.\\" I then purchased the first level of Lingua Latina (the natural,immersion program). My son and I used it together and I got discombobulated because I could not make sense out of how or when to use the vocabulary because I wasn't getting formal grammar rules. Lingua Latina got me further toward my goal than anything else but things still did not click. And THEN...a friend gave me a xeroxed copy of Scott's First Latin Lessons. Too bad you can't see the flashing lights and hear the tinkly music! This book has allowed me to study on my own and UNDERSTAND! I think that the key for me has been composition. This is the first book that has had me compose in Latin so that I have to use what I've learned and make the information my own. You cannot build if you don't understand the material you are working with and this text teaches the material! The thing is, you have to memorize, memorize, memorize. I'm not going to lie and say it is easy. But if I can do it, anyone can. Just be prepared to work hard and keep at it. I have to add that my oldest daughter who used most of the books I used fell in love with Latin when she used this text in high school. She went on to take it in college. She used Cambridge Latin there and said she knew more than any of the other students because of the Scott text. She now tutors several high school students (who use yet another text-Oxford, I think) and says that there is nothing better than First Latin Lessons. The only real drawback is that there is no answer key available. But said daughter completed the book with no way to check her answers and managed to ace 2 semesters of college Latin. Just work carefully and go as slowly as you need to in order to absorb the material."},{"Title":"The Great Year: Astrology, Millenarianism, and History in the Western Tradition (Arkana)","review":"I do not have this book at present, thus I can only write what I remember.Overall I would say that anyone interested in history, particularly milleniarism, should read/buy &quot;The Great Year.&quot; The book is an engaging, comprehensive survery of milleniarism along with a great deal of history to boot.&quot;The Great Year&quot; and &quot;The Great Week&quot; are views of history that have been accepted by many cultures/religions - Hebrews, Christians, Platonists, etc. According to this view, history is predetermined and fulfills itself in phases of various lengths. In the Hebrew book of Jubilees a &quot;year&quot; is 49 years, for example. In another culture a 4-phase historical cycle may involve completely different time scales. The Hebrews tended to see their &quot;Great Year&quot; cycles as successive renewals with God's covenant through prophets like Moses, with alternating cycles where the covenant is broken and people suffer, the explanation given as not following God's laws. Everyone is certainly familiar with how Christians believe their destiny will be fulfilled!The author of &quot;The Great Year&quot; argues that history is not predetermined, that human behavior and events are not so predictable, and that historians often bias their accounts using various filters, especially the theory that history and humanity are always progressing.Very broadly speaking, what the author seeks to accomplish in this very large survey are three things: 1) To define &quot;The Great Year&quot; concept and pinpoint how and when it manifested itself in various cultures. Millenarian movements in Christianity and other cultures are discussed thoroughly. Some readers may be surprised at how widespread and pervasive milleniarism has been over time in many cultures and religions. 2) To show that historians who view history in terms of progress are in error. Karl Popper wrote a book called &quot;The Poverty of Historicism&quot; that Campion and others have cited to show that historical accounts are often biased by false preconceptions. 3) To demonstrate that a number of currents in history, such as Marxism, are actually millenarian movements themselves, describing history in their own terms of fulfillment of their predetermined goals.I feel that the author suceeds very well with these aims. I was particularly impressed with his insight in observing that adherents of the more modern movements such as Marxism and Nazism indeed act exactly like those who claim that a select group of people will be &quot;saved&quot; because they believe in a &quot;Saviour,&quot; that history is following their version of a predetermined conclusion.In the end, however, I found parts of this otherwise excellent book unsatisfactory because the author, while accurately depicting the fallacies of other historical views, himself falls into what I would call the trap of reason, that reason and material &quot;proof&quot; are the sole arbiters of &quot;truth.&quot;In the first part of the book Mr. Campion critisizes Jung for the latter's writings which stated that excessive materialism had corrupted mankind and made it more bellicose, hence 2 world wars in an era of great technological progress. He claims that there is no &quot;proof.&quot; It's a shame that Dr. Jung can't defend himself, as I'm certain he could. But let me say, if the lack of spiritual values - compassion, tolerance, humility, a bond with something Divine, etc., which have in no way kept up with our material development in this century - is not one of the major causes of our almost total preoccupation with materialism, then we might as well discard the timeless teachings of many teachers, theologians, and others, who have attempted to bring some civility and purpose into this often Godless, corrupted world. Personally I am not willing to do this.I also found the author's attack on &quot;New Age&quot; thinkers, like Helen Blavatsky and others, only too typical of the trite criticisms of materialistic thinkers. I even checked out one of his sources, who wrote a trilogy debunking Blavatsky and others (I can't remember the author's name), and parts of the 2 books I perused were in my opinion sadly failed attempts to attack the messangers while not attempting to take on the far more difficult and important task of evaluating their messages. Not at all surprising, for how can we &quot;prove&quot; that there is a God, or that there are Masters of Wisdom, karma, reincarnation, etc., which would point to some spiritual meaning for life? There are those who try to prove these things, even doctors, scientists, etc., but from what I could tell from this book, to Mr. Campion and his sources it's doubtful that any proof would ever suffice. To me a purely materialistic reading of history, where there is no ultimate Purpose and meaning - which I would claim can be pursued by trying to grow spiritually, often through multiple physical incarnations - is itself in one important sense lacking in purpose."},{"Title":"The Great Year: Astrology, Millenarianism, and History in the Western Tradition (Arkana)","review":"Campion convincingly ties together the stands of historism, astrology, and millenarianism into a tapestry spanning time from Babylon to modern Marxism, seeking to explain how ancient beliefs about the cosmos have influcenced modern views of the future.

First, the kind of \\"Egyptology\\" described in this book is, put kindly, unacademic. Second, you should know a few things about \\"Professor\\" Dee Jay Nelson, the author.Dee Jay Nelson claims in this book to have an extensive collection of Egyptian artifacts, written hundreds of scientific papers, and completed major translation efforts in behalf of important museums. He claims to be a professor of Egyptology with multiple degrees, teaching at Rocky Mountain College in Billings, Montana. None of these things is correct. He is a high school dropout, who only afterward received a GED. He did go to Eastern Montana College...for one month. Then he dropped out, receiving an \\"incomplete\\" and no degree. He did not go to University of California at Berkeley. He did not graduate from any other university for that matter, with any degree of any kind, let alone in Egyptology. Does he speak Egyptian? Probably. But he's no professor, PhD, or other academic of standing. I wouldn't take the rest of his claims at face value. No, he hasn't \\"directed or been assistant director on four professional digs in the Nile Valley...\\" or discover the royal tomb of Princess Nefer-Ka-Ra. No, he didn't write \\"more than 130 scientific papers.\\" A quick online search of any college library database will fail to find any theses, dissertations, articles, or other academically acceptable writing with his name on them.Then why read this book at all? Entertainment! The same reason you listen to Coast-to-Coast AM! It's interesting, intriguing stuff, even when you know that it bears no resemblance to reality. It's fun-fiction from a man who's been saying it so long, he is beginning to believe his own groovy delusions. It's like talking to that eccentric person you know in the tin-foil hat: It's fun to listen, as long as he or she is not violent.So, enjoy the fantasies of Dee Jay Nelson (and friend). If you actually start to believe what he's saying, just calmly close the book and go lie down until the feeling passes.

He proposes a 'new' set of grading standards that the general collecting community didn't pick up. His 'Accugrade' system had subgrades for various aspects of Silver dollar appearance. The main grading services such as PCGS and NGC chose different grading standards which were generally tougher than Mr Hager's. So an 'Accugrade MS 65 Prooflike' dollar usually sells for much less than a 'PCGS MS65'. Often an 'Accugrade Prooflike' won't be qualified as a PCGS Prooflike in most of the comparisons that I have seen. In any event the book is still useful as a reference on Prooflike and Proof dollars even if you ignore the grading aspects of this book. Just don't pay $100 like I did when this book came out, $20 for a new one is more reasonable considering its content."},{"Title":"Knowing When to Stop: A Memoir","review":"The beginning of this book is fantastic. Mr Rorem has decided that there are but two esthetics in this world, and that everything can be applied to either one or the other. When he writes, as he did there, in the present, speaking of himself in the present, Mr Rorem is at his best, but when he begins to delve into his youth the reader is forced to wade through a trough of self-pity and self-hatred. There is very little to like about the younger Ned Rorem, and had there not been the occasional spurt of wisdom and humor I doubt I would have finished this mammoth tome.The most enjoyable sections were Mr Rorem's recollections of his associations with other stars in the twentieth-century musical firmament, most especially Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland, as well as Martha Graham.

Rorem recounts, in his graceful, inimitable style, his childhood, musical training, early sex life (of course), his first years in Europe and, most absorbingly, his friendships with some of the most famous artists, both musical and otherwise, of the century. Bernstein, Cage, Katchen, Thomson, Copland, Boulez, Capote, Paul and Jane Bowles--Rorem describes them with sympathy and insight.

At that time, I felt that I must do my tiny part in carrying the flag of hope for those suffering from schizophrenia. To the best of my knowledge, there is only one other orthomolecular practitioner in my country who seriously deals with schizophrenia.What I have found is that with most clients, I don't know which I need to treat more: schizophrenia or drug side-effects! Before a client even comes to my clinic, I have them fill out questionnaires for symptoms of schizophrenia and for side effect symptoms of the drugs they are on. Almost invariably, the drugs have more or less suppressed the illness symptoms as a trade-off for the physical suffering and mental degradation caused by the drugs. We accept this situation, willing to suffer physically, and even live with the drug depression, apathy and tiredness, because we identify with our minds - that's who we are, and if we are crazy we don't exist at all. That is our deepest fear. Still, to the best of my knowledge, no one ever recovers by using drugs - a condemnation to a deteriorating life.The only hope for schizophrenics is orthomolecular psychiatry, or orthomolecular nutrition. Still, the path is difficult. Detective work is needed to uncover the underlying biochemical imbalances specific to each patient/client. The non-physician orthomolecular practitioner, or patient and family, must try to influence the psychiatrist to slowly lower the medications while the orthomolecular program takes effect. This book, \\"Natural Healing for Schizophrenia...\\" provides the knowledge and the clues to look for in finding the individualized path for to healing. RECOVERY - return to health, family and society, is possible. Good luck on the journey!!!

The only real thing I picked up from this book that I didn't get from Pfieffer's was that Vitamin B5 exacerbates histadelia. I'm curious why that is. The problem with this book for a person starting out on the natural healing pathway is there is way too much information in this book and it is possible you could miss your answer by going off on a tangent. It took me two years to finally stick to the simple regieme of calcium, methionine, B6 and zinc that is the key to beating histadelia.

Therefore I did not have high expectations for reading this book. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a great book, and the scientific references are not bad either (most natural remedy-based books have either no references or unreputable references). I especially liked her section on the role of histamine in mental disorders. Histamine plays a much larger role in mental illness than the conventional doctors currently think. For example, only 20-25% of Americans have allergies, yet 85% of depressed patients have allergies---a four-fold difference, and very statistically significant. Histamine may also contribute to anxiety and ADD.

Armed with the information I studied here I have started my son on a regime of fatty acids, minerals and vitamins. It's too soon to say what will happen but in just a few weeks his eye contact, memory and social skills have begun to improve. I believe every sufferer of schizophrenia should be taking nutritional supplements. Unfortunately, in the UK the protocol is to get them on drugs in order to make them well enough to be safe and that's it. I wonder what my son's life would have been like if I'd had this information seventeen years ago.

In their stead they proposed dietary changes, the identification and alleviation of vitamin deficiencies, getting rid of infections, and more. The results, they claimed, were immeasurably superior to anti-psychotics.These scientists and clinicians reported that \\"schizophrenia\\" and \\"bipolar disorder\\" are not two illnesses, but rather many syndromes with very disparate sets of symptoms that have been shoe-horned into two \\"labels,\\" which, conveniently enough, were large enough to support an industry selling medications that suppress, but do no cure, these symptoms.The specific causes the reported for such syndromes were:- a previously unidentified tendency to accumulate copper. The political process that decides which illness doctors are allowed to treat has recognized an illness, fatal if untreated, wherein copper accumulates in the brain AND liver, but not the illness they describe, in which it accumulates in the brain only.- a disturbance in the synthesis of hemoglobin, which causes levels of Zinc and B6 to become pathological.- a disturbance of methylation and or histamine levels, which may be related to an unresolved intoxication- a variant of celiac's disease that had previously largely been overlooked, wherein the symptoms only manifest themselves in the brain.- in some cases, a yeast infection, which releases toxic waste into the blood stream.The big stars of psychiatry convened a task force to look into their claims; as things happened they found the claims to be without merit. Hoffer and others wrote a rebuttal explaining why their report was flawed, and perhaps not intended to do their research justice, which was never answered. After meticulous investigation, I have come to be convinced that Hoffer, Pfeiffer, and others were correct in their assertions.10 or 15 years ago, my faith in organized medicine and the system was such that I would have wanted Edelman confined to a psychiatric ward or prison, for poisoning the minds of the young and not so young; today I would have other candidates...I cannot recommend this book too highly to anyone with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and / or autism, or an interest in truly interesting medical research, and, to a lesser extent, to anyone with a psychiatric problems. If I could, I would gladly give this book 15, and not 5, stars. Make no mistake about it, this is the book that your psychiatrist probably has never read, and which many psychiatrists, comfortably ensconced in a routine of patients, pharma reps, freebies, and perhaps \\"consulting fees,\\" and a very limited and unchallenging repertoire of medications, would likely much rather that you do not read."},{"Title":"Natural Healing for Schizophrenia & Other Common Mental Disorders","review":"This is an incredibly dense book.

I found it particularly helpful to understand the history of schizophrenia, seeing the illness as a disruption of cognitive and perceptual/sense functions.

In the medical field this area of treatment is called orthomolecular medicine. While this field emerged out of research of treating schizophrenia with niacin in 1960's, today orthomolecular medicine offers very effective and safe treatments for large range of mental health conditions. The book covers a broad range of treatments from Vitamin, mineral &amp; herbal treatments to issues such as cerebral allergies (food allergies that effect the function of the brain) and sugar imbalances. Out of all the publications on orthomolecular medicine I have read to date, this one stands out as the very best. This publication combines exhausted in-depth research conveyed in an elegant and well-written fashion. The rich presentation of the book arms the layman reader with knowledge that is far beyond the quality professional books on the subject. If I had to change anything about this book, it would only be the title; I would call it &quot;natural brain healing &quot;, since I find it very valuable to all mental illness.It is a real shame that mainstream psychiatry have ignored these monumental advances in their own area of science.

The reader is sucked into the vortex of what it is like to live under such circumstances, where an aging Jewish professor who has built a life of purpose and meaning based on scholarship, hard work, and the belief in the rationalism of the state begins to understand that it will all unravel around him. You begin to experience how difficult and incomprehensible it must be for him, and empathize and worry for his fate as the building storm clouds of violent fascism fill the skies of 1930s Germany. As the days and weeks pass into months and years under the growing tyranny of National Socialism, Klemperer, married to an Aryan woman, increasingly finds solace and relief from the growing insanity swirling around him by concentrating on his academic writing, which he continues against all odds.As he faces an arbitrary enforced early retirement from his professorial duties, he also begins to take more time to enjoy simple pleasures with his wife, Eva, as they revel in long nature walks, the perils and pleasures of driving a second-hand car, and in watching the cinema. His refusal to submit to the progressively more invective growth of lies, invectives, and accusations of the Nazi regime build into a quiet resolve to resist in the way he knows best, by maintaining an intelligent, insightful, and careful witness to the everyday horrors perpetrated with malice and cunning on the Jews as the scapegoat for all of Germany's post-WWI social and economic woes.One stands by as we watch Victor and Eva systematically stripped of everything of meaning to them; their house, car, telephone, typewriter, even their beloved cat. While he understands all too well the dangers for him and his family, he consistently resists the increasingly strident pleas from family members for him to emigrate primarily because he identifies himself first and foremost as a German, and he refuses to abandon the Fatherland to the beastial likes of Hitler and the Nazis. One's sense of horror is magnified by his careful attention to the day to day details of living in the regime, the difficulties in finding socks, or clothing, or a cobbler, or vegetables, coffee, tobacco (both he and Eva are smokers), dealing with increasingly restrictive curfews, the ordeal and shame associated with the enforced wearing of the yellow star of David, the progressive acts of enforced segregation from the general populace, the occasional experiences at degradation at the hands of a youthful crowd of Hitler Youth.Yet there is great humanity evidenced here, both within the Jewish community and without it. The pathos of ordinary people caught in the web of a totalitarian state is made quite clear; unlike other academics who recently have argued in belief of a generalized and universalized hate on the part of ordinary Germans leading to their willing complicity in the persecution of Jews, Klemperer offers almost daily testimony of the unending acts of kindness, generosity, and personal risks that everyday citizens take to help and assist Jews to survivie against the dictates of the totalitarian regime. Again and again he is given free food, extra provisions, someone looking deliberately the other way when they did so at personal risk. Klemperer seems to acknowledge that life in Nazi Germany was a hell for all of the citizens, Jew and non-Jew alike.Interestingly enough, at one point he mentions his personal willingness to forgive and forget towards most other Germans, but reserves enduring special scorn, animosity and bile for academics who became fellow-travelers of the regime to save their personal position and privilege. This is a book that should become required reading for college students in world history."},{"Title":"I shall bear witness : the diaries of Victor Klemperer, 1933-41","review":"As with Volume One (see my review), the most disarming and appealing feature of this tome is its slow and ineluctable building of suspense and empathy as World War I veteran Klemperer steadily weaves the day to day details of his life in Nazi Germany in the 12 years of that regime into a portrait of a rogue state moving irresistably down the path to tyranny and terror.

Even the most simple and basic freedoms are denied them, so his refusal to submit to the progressively more invective growth of lies, invectives, and accusations of the Nazi regime build into a quiet resolve to resist in the way he knows best, by maintaining an intelligent, insightful, and careful witness to the everyday horrors perpetrated with malice and cunning on the Jews as the scapegoat for all of Germany's post-WWI social and economic woes.One reads in horror as Victor and Eva continue to be persecuted and systematically stripped of everything of meaning to them; their house, car, telephone, typewriter, even their beloved cat.

He pointedly gives credit to all the Aryans who assit Eva and him as they flee from the Nazis into the more anonymous countryside in the tumult and confusion caused by the firebombing of Dresden.

Victor Klemperer was a Jewish-Christian convert who married an Aryan wife and had served as a Front-soldier. The latter two facts helped him survive the war in Dresden, though it was a close call even then. The day to day detail he records has an intense drama, though it must have been tedious and very stressful to live through. In 1933, he loses his job as a professor, then he is forbidden to use the library and public transport and eventually he and his wife lose their house. You feel like you are living through the times day to day. To take one story, if he cannot find evidence of his military service his job, then his life, are at stake. It is the string of such little insect stings that tell the story, as he says. The author later wrote a book on The Language of the Third Reich, noting its use of boxing metaphors and such like, but it is this account that tells us the most about his era in Germany and the range of responses of ordinary people to the ideologies and events of the day.

Anyone who wants to understand the South or the southern mind must read it. Don't shut the cover because you think it might be dated."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"W. J. Cash's The Mind of the South (1941) examines southern society and thought between colonial times and 1940. According to Cash, the role of the frontier is what influenced southern society and made the section different from other parts of the country. The South remained in the frontier stage for a large part of its ante-bellum history. The essence of the frontier is competition. This competitive spirit of the ruling class (which sought to tame the land and build plantations) and the nature of life on the frontier contributed to an intense individualism. The plantation system developed by the ruling class essentially perpetuated frontier conditions and individualism. The tradition of the old backcountry also contributed to an intense distrust of any exercise of authority.Cash also develops the themes of the conflict with the Yankee and southern defensiveness on the issue of slavery. The will to victory over the Yankee led to the development of the southern passion for politics and rhetoric. The Civil War made southerners more self-conscious and unified than ever before. Cash asserts that during Reconstruction the South overcame the frontier that the Yankee tried to impose on the defeated Confederate states. To summarize, the role of the frontier, southern defensiveness, and the conflict with the Yankee are the dominant themes in The Mind of the South."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Fascinating and comprehensive analysis of the southern states, our culture and thinking up to World War II. Anyone wanting to understand what is unique about the South, and even to understand why the southern states have switched in recent years to voting Republican instead of Democratic since the conservative attitudes of the South have changed little since WWII, should read this book."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Cash gives a fairly objective history and calm, respectful, clear-minded critique of the South while advocating that the South become more liberal, realist, secular, intellectual, and socialist, as these things were understood in 1940. Cash was for the dissident academics who stood up for secularism and evolution. He was not a fire breathing radical, but he did advocate ameliorating poverty by accepting unions and raising wages. He disapproved of the southern individualism of \\"every man for himself\\" and \\"winners take all\\" in which all responsibility for wealth and well-being was up to the individual and not to any collective good will. Even when jobs were scarce and labor was at a surplus, southerners often demanded that the unemployed \\"root or starve\\".He says that the reasons why the north would not let the south secede was that they wanted a united nation under a tariff set by the north and more importantly, they wanted to make the south more like the rest of the nation, which meant getting rid of slavery for starters.Cash gives more examples of characteristics of the south. One being that there is an air of unreality here in which the inhabitants become caught up in emotional, irrational, and superstitious thinking. He thought the influence of living with blacks had something to do with white's behavior in the south, saying that the blacks are most romantic and hedonistic of the races. He thought that the Southern planters would not have seceded if they had thought more clearly about how it was inevitably against their interests to do so, but they could not because of unrealistic thinking, which meant that any Southerner could whip ten Yankees easily.The south is also known to be romantic and sentimental. Cash did not like the Southern Agrarians and movies like Gone With The Wind because they perpetuated the idea of sentimental and romantic South of legend, not reality. He also that the Agrarians were wrong in assuming that the South wanted to remain an agricultural society forever, but actually embraced industry after the Civil War.The south is known as an elitist society by choice amongst all classes. The lower classes often looked up to their leaders reverently as they were often the heroes of the Civil War or were Cotton Mill entrepreneurs that were going to save the South's economy. Hence, there was not much of a class conscience in the South and the workers continued to be exploited as cheap labor and were denounced as traitors to the South if they went on strike. It was often believed that any poor man could become successful if he just worked hard enough. Before the Civil War, poor whites lived on the poor land, as the rich planters had bought up all the good land. Poor whites did not do much other than hunt hogs, grow corn, and drink bust head. After the Civil War, the poor whites were put to work in the Cotton mills and they worked long hours from an early age for low wages and lived in towns owned by the company. Still, their housing was better than in the past and it was free. The elitism of the south was not frowning and arrogant; the leaders had a kindly, paternalistic but patronizing way of communicating with poor whites that diffused tensions. In a sense, the rich and poor whites were equals, as the blacks were considered inferior. Poor whites were also often cousins of rich whites.There is a good statement from Cash at the end that sums up southern characteristics nicely: \\"Proud, brave, honorable by its lights, courteous, personally generous, loyal, swift to act, often too swift, but signally effective, sometimes terrible, in its action--such was the South at its best. And such at its best it remains today, despite the great falling away in some of its virtues. Violence, intolerance, suspicion towards new ideas, an incapacity for analysis, an inclination to act from feeling rather than thought, an exaggerated individualism and a too narrow concept of social responsibility, attachment to fictions and false values, above all, too great attachment to racial values and a tendency to justify cruelty and injustice in the name of those values, sentimentality and lack of realism--these have been the characteristic vices in the past. And despite changes for the better, they remain its characteristic vices today. \\"So that is the criticism dished out from one son of the South, albeit a rather unusually liberal one. Is he still in the family?"},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Written in the stilted pedantically formal style of the 1940s, Cash's description of the South is both full of surprises and reaffirms some of the worse stereotypes of the southern way of life. His manuscript divides the South into three frontiers: pre-Civil War; reconstruction and its aftermath; and the era of industrialization. The reader cannot avoid noting the many parallels between Cash and Frederick Jackson's frontier hypothesis of the American West. But he will also note that Cash's version has the added twist of applying an economic theory to the southern way of life. In short, the author engages in his own kind of southern romanticism. By seeing sees the frontier as an economic opportunity for southern expansion, I believe that the idea of expanding slavery to the new territories gets sidestepped in Cash's narrative.In the first section, dealing with the pre-Civil War South, the author rejects the quaint notion that southern planters were linked to British royalty via the English Cavaliers, and asserts instead that they were mostly poor \\"risk-takers\\" who happened to get lucky and were then able to work their way up through the ranks. One would have to dig deeply into the history of the early settlers to confirm or deny this thesis. He also rejects the syrupy \\"Gone with the Wind\\" mythology of southern gentility and readily admits that the south was four-squares backwards, with little interest in academics, philosophy, and scholarship, few men of letters, and being congenitally wedded to slavery, which in Cash's view was a complete economic failure.As for the Civil War itself, Cash agrees with many others that while the North did indeed win the shooting war, the will, mind and the anti-democratic values and political tactics of the South not only survived intact, but also were reinforced and fortified. With the leadership of the South after Reconstruction being made up mostly of officers in the Confederate Army, the old racist order in the South returned with a vengeance, and with the exception of a name change, so too did slavery. \\"Sharecropping\\" and other economic ruses, including vigilantism and the jailing blacks on any pretext, including being unable to prove that they worked for a planter, made the transition from slavery to a new modified form of extended paternalism, one smooth sociological operation.Today, 72 years after the book was published, the fact that the South may have lost the shooting war but won the only war worth winning, the cultural civil war, is even more true than during the time the book was published: It is not an exaggeration to suggest that it is the Old South's values that represent the core philosophy of today's Republican Party. Its emphasis on \\"states rights\\" over Federal rights; its focus on freedom from the federal government by individuals; yet its contradictory demand for conformity on social issues such as abortion and seeing inside the bedrooms of everyone, or gay rights, and its opposition to any policies that African Americans support, suggest that the conservative Republican's platform has all its roots firmly planted in post-Reconstruction \\"Old South\\" politics and sentiments.In the third part of the book we see the 19th Century come to a close with textile mills, banking and light industry replacing southern plantations. However, the southern racial order of paternalism that kept blacks at the bottom of the \\"pecking order,\\" continued. It did so by making the poor white worker strike a bargain with the racist devil. That devil made him think that he was better off remaining emotionally superior to blacks with slave wages than being equal to them with much have higher wages. By augmenting the slave wages of poor white workers with an emotional currency called racism, the southern Mills were able to compete on par with their northern counterparts, and in addition, were also able to keep labor unions out of the South.The bargain with the racist devil was an insanely dumb and counterintuitive bargain that still exists today: When offered the chance to improve their economic status by joining with blacks politically, or by voting against their own economic interests simply to see blacks remain in their familiar inferior position, poor whites will opt for the latter every time. That is to say, they will elect to chop of their own economic legs at the knees rather than see blacks draw equal to them. Arguably, (at least since the Nixon Southern Strategy of 1968) without this pact with the racist devil, there would be no Republican Party.In summary, much of Cash's interpretation of the southern mind has to do with holding contradictory or paradoxical views in the mind at the same time: To wit, the South both embraced progressive movements, yet it was reluctant to give up its pet conservative ideas even though they hurts southerners as a whole. Also, a tendency toward both hedonism and Puritanism is a strain that runs from beginning to end throughout southern thinking. Religiously, even the Methodists in the South were steeped in a stern kind of Calvinism, yet there was also an undercurrent of free-will theology. The southern conservative canon focuses on freedom of the individual, yet at the same time it demands conformity on issues that deal with what goes on in the sanctity of the bedrooms of every individual.Throughout the era of the author's study, a caste system existed in the South. It changed, from planter, to confederate officer, to mill boss, to inner city policemen, to today's Southern Bank Managers and CEOs. But structurally it remains essentially the same as in 1940 even today. This is the same system that blocked the rise of an egalitarian populist movement in the late 19th century, one that essentially ended with the Bacon rebellion, which would have brought together poor whites and blacks to fight the corporate industrialists for a better economic stake in America. Instead, even today poorer whites continue to throw their lot in with the wealthy corporatists, even when they see that their respective interests continually clash, and even when they see that they continually get the raw end of the stick..For the \\"Old South\\" as for the \\"new South,\\" there is no value higher than \\"keeping black people down,\\" that is to say \\"in there place.\\" The race card still trumps all, that is the long and the short of southern history, whether 1940 or 2013.

Cash was a Southerner who wrote this book and then hanged himself. If you want to experience page after chapter after page of a man with complete self-loathing, then I recommend The Mind of the South, a book in which we learn much about Mr. Cash's mind in Cloud-Cuckooland, though next to nothing about the real South.

At school you got Yankee cant; at home you got Lost Cause and Jim Crow. That doesn't fit the Chamber of Commerce image of cities too busy to hate, but that was the reality for all but the most miniscule minority of white Southerners. Through public school and college in The South, I never had a word from Southern thinkers with the minor exception of Faulkner - not much of a thinker, but a good describer.Cash was my introduction to Southern intellectual history, and by the time I found him I was far from the South in both space and time. I can feel Cash in my very bones; a dose of Tom Watson populism, a dose of Mencken's cynicism, and a whole bunch of the self-loathing that a defeated and impoverished people wore like tattered old clothes every day. Some neo-Southerners call Cash a South-hater, but they miss the point; Cash wanted desperately to love The South, but could find little to love except myth. You get much the same with Woodward, though in finer clothes. &quot;Strange Career&quot; is nothing but myth, yet it propelled Woodward to the heights of the Academy. The key to both these books is that they are Yankee approved mythology. The publishing houses are not on Peachtree Street, they are on 5th Avenue. For anyone wishing to begin exploration of Southern thought, Cash, the Nashville Agrarians, and Strange Career are the places to start. If you go no further, you won't know anything about The South, but to go further, you must start here."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"I am the author of Rising Tide, another book about the South, and the greatest compliment paid to me so far was by someone who compared my book to this brilliant book. Cash's work is certainly one of the most insightful inquiries ever written about any region, any where, by anyone. Some of Samuel Johnson's work about his travels into the Scottish Highlands comes to mind as comparable, but I can't think of any other. In fact, the southerners Cash wrote about are often descended from that same stock.Then of course there's the personal tragedy of the author's suicide. If you want to understand America, you have to read this book.A good counterpoint to this is William Alexander Percy's Lantenrs on the Levee, published the same year and also still in print. Cash writes about rednecks; Percy writes about aristocrats, chiefly his own family who considered being called &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; an insult. They, after all, were descended from the Norman conquerors nof the Anglo-Saxons."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"This book was suggested to me by an American History professor 10 years ago. Just recently did I get around to reading it, however, and I must say that it is an impressive analysis of the white Southern mind-set leading up to the Civil War and through the Depression. I believe that many of the same thought processes hold true to this day particularly with all the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag and its inclusion in state flags (MS, SC, GA etc) in addition to the national shift of power to Southern conservatives in the Congress last decade. The book describes the political, religious, economic and social distinctions of the South in psychological terms and often in Jungian fashion showing opposites in existence together (i.e.- hedonism and refinement, morality and slavery/Jim Crow, etc). I have lived in the South most of my life and was glad to have 'rediscovered' this interesting book. Cash's writing style is difficult to follow at first- somewhat meandering and flowery (and intentionally humorous in some cases), but his insights are very modern and relevant in today's American society. ... Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Since Reconstruction, works of Southern history and, in this case, sociology have usually fallen into two distinct genres. The first tends to reinforce the popular Old South mythology with exaggerated, romantic imagery as inspired by an emotional attachment to the &quot;Lost Cause.&quot; The second is a reaction to the first. The revisionists, always irritated by the chauvinism of Southern popular mythology, want to convince you that Southern mythology is exactly that--a myth. The most violent of the revisionists will have you believe that romantic images of the Old South are fundamentally fictional--an image created by the Southern propagandists eager to create only the most flattering cultural portrait. For the record, THE MIND OF THE SOUTH falls more into the second category than the first. In fact, all of the works of Southern history and sociology that we now consider &quot;classic&quot; are more critical and revisionist than romantic. The non-fiction works of Cash, Odum, and C. Vann Woodward, and the fiction of Ellen Glasgow are all appreciated throughout the country for their critical views of what we call the Old South. It has become nearly equivalent in Southern studies to call a work both revisionist and worthy of praise. The ideas are, unfortunately, redundant. One's appreciation for things Southern all but negates one's credibility as a serious scholar. But the problem with extreme revisionism, and with the Cash work in particular, is that it has you believe that Southern mythology is SO fictional that it is nearly arbitrary. It wants you to believe that popular Southern imagery is a product of ignornace rather than careful consideration of the evidence. There is a difference between calling mythology an exaggeration, as the best works of William C. Davis, John Shelton Reed and Edward L. Ayers do, and calling it patently false, as the works of C. Vann Woodward and W. J. Cash do. This is the challenging question for any revisionist: If the popular view you are trying to de- and reconstruct is false, why (and how) was it originally created? And more critically, if all of history is just a social construction, what makes your take on things innately more accurate than mine? It seems to me that popular mythology must have some grain of truth, for it would not have developed as it did from nothing. It must be based on something that really exists. This idea, of course, is violently rejected by most post-modern historians who believe that ALL of history is nothing more than a social construction. For those sympathetic to that view, this book will appeal to you. To those looking for some insights into the factual basis for a Southern creation myth, you'd do better to read Ayers, Davis, or Reed. These fine historians are able to treat the topic with a sensitive balance of critical insight and popular appreciation.Published in 1941, one can't help but think that THE MIND OF THE SOUTH is an iconoclastic reaction to the immense popularity of GONE WITH THE WIND, released in 1939."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"W. J. Cash is hard to pin down. Liberals, from C. Vann Woodward to Nell Painter, seem to have little use for him. Conservatives, like Donald Davidson and the other Southern agrarians, also had little use for Cash. Yet Cash's book is still in print and being read sixty five years after his suicide. There are reasons for this. First there is the unique Cash style. In his excellent introduction, Bertram Wyatt-Brown advises the reader to imagine Cash as a country lawyer presenting a case in court or perhaps sitting in the town square swapping stories with friends. There is much merit to this advice. Cash's style is often folksy, sometimes sarcastic and, at other times, completely his own as he summons unique and usually spot on phrases to describe aspects of Southern culture. Cash is a product of his time though he does not spend that much time on the Old South and rather focuses his energy on \\"The Frontier the Yankee Made.\\" But do not think Cash is an old South apologist. He has little use for the hagiographic tradition of the Dunning school or the Nashville circle of Agrarians and his book clearly reflects it.But Cash is no traditional liberal either. He was a man of his time and place as is shown in his comments on race on gender. Cash clearly feels that continuity was the chief hallmark of the Southern past and shows it again and again, from the planters leading the \\"man at the center\\" in the Old South to the lack of success of the labor movement in the 20's and 30's.Cash's interests as a newspaperman are also reflected in his book. Cash handled book reviews and foreign affairs editorials during his tenure at The Charlotte News. His comments on authors and books remain some of the more interesting and lively parts of his magnum opus. The threat of tyranny, which Cash wrote about in great length in his columns, was on Cash's mind as he wrote the book as can clearly be seen in the last pages.If somewhat dated, Cash's book remains one of the most interesting and controversial looks at the South. While often critical of his home region, Cash remains very attached to it and its virtues. Above all, Cash believed in the South as a unique and interesting region. In this age of mass communications and moving around the country, Southerners looking to understand their region before its completely submerged into a common culture should look at Cash. For if the South is to survive, it will not be a sense of place, it will be a sense of mind. In an era when we can order the same food, listen to the same music, watch the same television in Asheville, Oak Park, Denver and Trenton, Cash may be more important than ever to Southern survival."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"What makes the South unique as a region has virtually disappeared since this book was researched and written. What Cash describes is what made the South unique to begin with -- its blend of agrarian culture, 18th century British cavalier society, and Scottish individualism. As Cash writes, \\"the Southern world, you will remember, was basically an extremely uncomplex, unvaried and unchanging one.\\" How the South approached the complexities of the modern era, and dealt with the ideas of industrialization and multiculturalism, is not his focus. Certainly the book should be read in the context of its times (America had yet to enter World War II) and with the realization that much has changed since then. His book is not an apology, nor is he blind to the clash of racial and social issues that the Civil War and subsequent Reconstruction left unresolved, either. The fact that Cash's work has been vilified and re-evaluated over many years, even by the reviews here, is an indication that the concepts and issues he described more than sixty years ago are still debated today -- a true picture of the mind of the South in the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"The nature of a people is seldom easy to describe because the attempt is often sabotaged by either the Outsider's incorrect perceptions or the Insider's preconceptions, depending on which is constructing the definition. What we find with W.J. Cash's The Mind of the South is no different, although it is a pleasant journey. Sparkling with some of the most fluid prose ever found in historical writing, Cash's work deserves recognition for this reason alone; yet there is value in the exposition itself, even if it forgets a full two-thirds of the South's population in its description (blacks and women). What the modern reader is left with, then, is not so much a description of the \\"the southern mind\\" as it is \\"the white southern male mind.\\" And while Cash's work does not quite apologize for the many neuroses of that mind, it does attempt to explain the effects it has had on our perception of the American South, with a small dash of glory added for good measure.First, it is important for us to take into account the wonderful introduction to the work by Bertram Wyatt-Brown. Wyatt-Brown shows that Cash's battle with depression was a salient part in understanding his interpretation of the South, as was his upbringing. Wyatt-Brown seems to agree with my assessment on the Insider/Outsider effect:\\"The origins of Cash's interpretation of his culture and region lay not only in the objective fact of Southern intransigence about issues of race and change, but in the very makeup of his mind. Like so many creative depressives, he stood apart from the society around him. Such a position of detachment can provide a special angle of vision that those immersed in society cannot obtain (Cash xxvii).\\"Wyatt-Brown, with this statement, makes Cash an outside-Insider, by virtue of his being a manic depressive. He is a southerner, and therefore capable of the same preconceptions of his own people as any southerner; however, according to Wyatt-Brown, by reason of his mental condition, he is elevated away from this status and into a new status altogether, a presumably better one. I would agree with this, if the work itself is to be taken as proof. Cash is capable of wonderful insights into his own culture and society. However - and this is crucial! - we must not gloss over the fact that by omitting women and blacks from his work, Cash loses some credibility. It is here, it seems, that Cash could not escape the Insider mentality.This work is characterized by one over-arching theme: southern culture, though as elusive in most respects as any other, is penetrated throughout with one defining and collective temperament. In essence, this work is interpretative rather than linear, as it attempts to analyze rather than delineate. This elevates Cash from the traditional historian (in the mold of Clement Eaton) to sociologist or social commentator (in the mold of David Halberstam). That is not to say that Cash does not know his history or pilfers it from others; it seems impossible after reading The Mind of the South for one to imagine Cash using such smooth language while pulling facts from anywhere outside his own mind. The disjointed quality usually apparent in any attempt to fuse sources without an overall voice is thankfully absent. Cash is who we hear while we read, and it is his elucidative brush-strokes that paint the image of the Southerner.Much is left out of this short review of Cash's work, as brevity is a consideration. A more complex examination of the work would require many more words than I have time for at the moment. But I do feel obligated to at least sum up the trajectory of Cash's masterpiece. The first few chapters lay the groundwork for Cash's southern temperament - individualistic, violent, quasi-aristocratic, provincial, just to name a few - while the remainder of the work displays the evolution of that temperament while it is worked upon by forces both outside it and from within, and its own natural need to adapt. The Yankee plays his part, as does Uncle Tom and the fugitive slave, the southern belle and the Garrison abolitionist, the carpet-bagger and the scalawag, the confederate soldier and the lynch mob, the fire-eater and the bible-thumping revivalist. It is impossible for any society to exist in a vacuum, or as a prehistoric insect preserved in amber. That being said, it is still remarkable that the American south came as close as it did."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"As a native Southerner, I was bowled over by the profound truths contained in this book. It strips away the legend of the South and shows the reality behind it. One of Cash's main tenets is that the South never changes, it just adapts to new times. This makes the book somewhat repetitive, as each era of history is essentially just a variation of the past. Also, this book was written before the Civil Rights Movement. I would have loved to know how Cash would have changed his opinion of the South after desegregation. Even though it is somewhat dated, this is still a book that every American should read. The South matters, and this book provides a key to understanding it."},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"Have you ever wondered why Southerners are the way they are?Why are they so hospitable sometimes but so refractory at other times?Why did we (Yankees) have to fight that Civil War with them? &quot;The Mind of the South&quot; holds answers to these questions as it paints a loose, but poignant picture of southern attitudes before the Civil War. It was written by a Southerner. However, I'm certain that anyone with an interest in the Civil War, the South, or the psychology of Southerners, would find it interesting. I found that it helped me understand why Southerners don't see things the way I do. Why would a Southerner see a Yankee &quot;as cowardly, avaricious, boorish, half Pantaloon and half Shylock&quot; and himself &quot;as polished, brave, generous, magnificent, wholly the stately aristocrat, fit to cow a dozen Yankees with the power of his eye and a cane? (pg. 67-68)&quot; Read the book to find out why. The effect of reconstruction on the attitudes of Southerners is also explored, as well as the growth of the South up to W.W. II. This was also very insightful. The book did tend to be a little too long. You may find some of it offensive. It is certainly controversial. Nevertheless, I highly reccomend this book. END"},{"Title":"The Mind of the South","review":"As a \\"Yankee\\" who moved to the south 5 years ago, this book has helped me understand the people I now live among. Despite the fact that this was written 70 years ago, the traits are still evident in the people today. The book is well written,although at times it seems to be redundant."},{"Title":"German Women for Empire, 1884 1945 (Politics, History, and Culture)","review":"I appreciate two basic contributions of this book: first it focuses attention on Germany's entrance into the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century race for overseas possessions. Many historians of empire overlook Germany's interest in imperial possessions outside of Europe. Second, the book wrestles with the intersection of gender and empire, a field that is well developed for the subcontinent (and other colonized places) but less so for the colonizers (especially for Germany). Good histories about German women, especially middle class women, are hard to come by, and Wildenthal's book compares quite favorably with other efforts (I'm thinking of Reagin's A German Women's Movement). The book is quite accessible for undergraduates and is definitely worth assigning either in a general European history course or in an upper level course on German history."},{"Title":"German Women for Empire, 1884 1945 (Politics, History, and Culture)","review":"German Women for Empire is a path-breaking book in various ways. It was among the first scholarly works to rekindle interest in German colonial history. The book shows that despite the limited size and economic importance of the German colonial empire, it was indeed quite significant for socioeconomic and sociocultural developments in nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Germany. Wildenthal came to this realization years before many other historians (re-)discovered German colonial history as a field of study. More importantly maybe, this book looks at German colonial history from a gender perspective and shows the intersections between feminism, nationalism, imperialism, and, eventually, also fascism; a vantage point that makes it truly unique. \`Path-breaking' may, in the end, not even be the right word to describe Wildenthal's book, because hardly anybody has stepped through the door that she has opened. So maybe \`singular' or \`unique' might even be a better adjective."},{"Title":"German Women for Empire, 1884 1945 (Politics, History, and Culture)","review":"This is a beautifully-written, extremely informative, and original book. It explores the nexus of gender and colonialism in a fresh way."},{"Title":"German Women for Empire, 1884 1945 (Politics, History, and Culture)","review":"I was required to read this book for a graduate seminar on German history. As a fan of more traditional &quot;meat and potatoes&quot; history, I have never truly cared for the &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;cultural&quot; historians who have seemingly taken over the profession. Nevertheless, I opened this book with an open mind to perhaps learn something about German women during this period and to enhance my understanding as to exactly what gender historians like to argue.In this book, Wildenthal fails to lay out an argument or veils it so completely that only an experienced gender historian could decipher it. Wildenthal jumps from one bit of evidence to the next, failing to tie her points together in an effective manner.It baffles me as to how Leslie A. Adelson, author of Making Bodies, Making History: Feminism and German Identity, could say that this book &quot;will define scholarly standards and inspire other studies for a long time to come. Wildenthal probes the nexus of German women's history and colonial politics more deeply, more extensively, and more systematically than any other piece of scholarship I know&quot; when this book reads like a random collection of evidence lumped together in a book whose ideas do not flow to a logical conclusion. Wildenthal also cites extensively the experiences of a handful of women and this, I assume (and am pretty confident of its accuracy), bears no significance on the greater realm of the German woman."},{"Title":"Deep Black (Deep Black Series)","review":"My husband has read most of his favorite books of the authors he likes so D Coonts' is new to him and he enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Deep Black (Deep Black Series)","review":"You'll probably think I need to get out more, but this was my first Coonts book. I wanted to start at the beginning of a series with hopes for the future.There are three sets of players in this story...the Wash D.C. NSA headquarters team, a field team in Russia and the star of the story..surveilance and weapons technologies. It gets tedious as Coonts' technological descriptions get more detailed to make the reader believe the more outlandish. If you're a Clancy fan, you will obviously love this sort of thing.The characters themselves are an odd mix of flawed people that didn't quite gel for me. Even at the end of the book, I wasn't sure of most of their motives.There are events on the Washington end that are but soapy suds, and have no bearing on the outcome of the story. This type of thing distracts from the real action happening. I found this filler, along with the necessity to keep language on a vulgar level less than appealing.There is also an underlying animosity between NSA and CIA at a political level. While this may be possible, it is disconcerting to think that our elite intelligence agencies can't cooperate at the topmost levels, and must instead engage in childish competitiveness rather than fully cooperating to serve American security interests.The most unbelievable aspect of this tale is the ease with which the American field team trots all over Siberia and Moscow, disrupting the Russian way of life with the full cooperation of every Russian they meet. Apparently Coonts thinks that the average Russian wouldn't have a problem with Americans running around in helicopters and other assorted commandeered vehicles, brandishing weapons, driving up to gates of highly secure military bases and so on, and along the way stopping at the local hotels for a few ZZZs and a bite to eat.

The book continues with the character of Charlie Dean who i believe was intro'd in the techno-thriller collection COMBAT, go read it. I liked the cinematic characters of Charlie, Lia, and Tommy Karr who was one cool spy, and think that nearly every male reader of this type of genre imagines himself to be.The back story involving William Reubens head of Deep Black caught up in an imagninative murder at a relatives house doesn't really go anywhere, but the main story involving our heroes was intriguing filled with tough guy (and girl) dialogue, cool gadgets, and some old school Cold War intrigue, and a hint of romance.

From his first book (\\"The Intruders\\") through \\"America\\", we've watched Grafton grow from a young naval fighter pilot to an Admiral, providing suspense and thrills certainly on a par with Clancy's Jack Ryan (except in much fewer words!), with possibly a little more spin on politics (e. g. \\"Cuba\\" and \\"Hong Kong\\") and a little less focus on the glamour of technology.In \\"Deep Black\\", in which Coonts collaborates with co-author Jim DeFelice (himself with a half dozen or so books to his credit), we find a tale about National Security/CIA intrigue fostered by a possible coup in Russia. Our leading characters, Charlie Dean, a ex-Marine sniper, and Lia DeFrancesca, a former Delta Force trooper, spend most of the book deep in Russia ferreting out various evidence of mischief by the bad guys. Activities there alternate with command and control vignettes back at the \\"Art Room\\", some sort of conglomerate spy oversight agency. [Perhaps we know now how the co-authors divided their assignments.] At any rate, all are out to control world politics before the Russian President becomes an assassination victim, with most of the suspense leading up to the moment of truth re that event.While the story was mildly entertaining at times, we thought the plot and writing skills on display were a departure from what we expect of Coonts. In particular the gender and sexual tension generated (or not) between the leads Charlie and Lia were barely beyond adolescent. Much of the technology used by the operatives, such as ear-embedded communications with an agency half-way 'round the globe, remote controlled drone fighters, and many other sensing and locating devices, were rather far-fetched, detracting from the credibility of the plot.

Nevertheless, he remains the most critical, brilliant, intelligent, wise, courageous, instructive, ethical, moral and faith-based voice in our nation, and his writings increasingly teach us essential lessons for living in Peace and in Christ.As we today witness the ineluctable surge of endless and counter-productive military violence which cannot possibly construct a stable and peaceful society in Iraq, we need now to remember this informative, ethical, moral, and faith based collection of essays by Father Merton. He as so often writes with such profound moral and Christian principle that he could be writing for us today. Would that he could!This important collection of Father Merton's prayers, meditations and exhortations, originally published posthumously as Thomas Merton On Peace, opens with a lengthy, scholarly and brilliant essay by the great Gordon C. Zahn, defining the terms and raising the issues which the writings of Merton address throughout this substantial book. Zahn's essay in itself is sufficient feast for reflection on our times and on our individual states of grace, yet it merely serves like Virgil in Dante's trilogy to guide and introduce us to the wonders and truths which lie beyond.The collection of Father Merton writings are divided in three parts: Principles of Peace (eighteen essays), The Nonviolent Alternative (fifteen essays, including Blessed are the Meek: The Christian Roots of Nonviolence), and a series of Incidental Writings, including the Chant to be used in Processions around a site with Furnaces, of which the final line calls to us today: \\"Do not think yourself better because you burn up friends and enemies with long range missiles without ever seeing what you have done\\"This excellent collection ends with a Prayer for Peace which ought to be required reading at every Catholic liturgy this season, as originally read in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday of Holy Week in 1962, some 45 years ago April 12. This two page prayer justifies the small price of this great book, and should be graven in our hearts, for our continued conversion to Christ, Prince of Peace, to awaken us to the evil military peril we so softly accept as normal and right.

The book contains constant references to catholic ideology -a fact which many non Catholics will likely find grating.

Zahn's essay in itself is sufficient feast for reflection on our times and on our individual states of grace, yet it merely serves like Virgil in Dante's trilogy to guide and introduce us to the wonders and truths which lie beyond.The collection of Father Merton writings are divided in three parts: Principles of Peace (eighteen essays), The Nonviolent Alternative (fifteen essays, including Blessed are the Meek: The Christian Roots of Nonviolence), and a series of Incidental Writings, including the Chant to be used in Processions around a site with Furnaces, of which the final line calls to us today: \\"Do not think yourself better because you burn up friends and enemies with long range missiles without ever seeing what you have done\\"This excellent collection ends with a Prayer for Peace which ought to be required reading at every Catholic liturgy this season, as originally read in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday of Holy Week in 1962, some 45 years ago April 12. This two page prayer justifies the small price of this great book, and should be graven in our hearts, for our continued conversion to Christ, Prince of Peace, to awaken us to the evil military peril we so softly accept as normal and right. Christ is the Nonviolent Alternative who alone can construct a peaceful society.Read this book and rediscover our True Faith."},{"Title":"The Lady on My Left (Center Point Platinum Fiction (Large Print))","review":"The lady on my left is an excellent novel with a well thoughtplot.

I am looking for hope and for overcoming such feelings, not wallowing in them. And as insensitive as this may seem, I also feel like the author is awfully whiny about her inability to have a sixth child. For those of us mourning the loss of our fertility and any hope of having a family, it feels like a giant slap in the face. This book made me feel worse about my condition, not better.I skimmed through section one because I couldn't bear to listen to her whine anymore, and I am loathe to read further. I will push on but so far feel this is a colossal waste of my money. Agreed with the other one-star reviewer: maybe it is my medical background, but this book did nothing for me.In short - if you are in your teens or twenties and have no children; if you are coping with the loss of your womanhood before it even begins; this is NOT the POF book for you."},{"Title":"Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"Karin Banerd explains at the beginning of this book that premature menopause can occur naturally, as a result of a full or partial hysterectomy, or as a result of radiation or chemotherapy treatment. When Banerd realized that she was experiencing premature ovarian failure naturally (her body began the process before she was 35), the lack of information and support for women in her situation left her feeling isolated and lost. Her desire to fill this gap in women's health literature prompted her to write this book.Menopause Before 40 is full of useful information. Banerd provides practical advice on how to identify and cope with the symptoms of early menopause. She includes a clear, thoughtful discussion on the pros and cons of various hormone replacement therapies (HRTs), and identifies the benefits and risks of some alternative approaches to alleviating menopausal symptoms. A list of web resources (which includes both Canadian and US sites), an extensive bibliography, and a good index are also provided.But what makes this book unique is Banerd's courageous, deeply personal account of her own experience with early menopause. She describes the physical, emotional, and mental highs and lows that she experienced, and how they affected every aspect of her life, including her marriage, her work, and her sense of self. She tells the story of this tumultuous period in her life with unflinching honesty. It's all here - the frustration of trying to find doctors who would listen to her (at least one flatly refused to believe that a woman of her age could be menopausal), the devastating bouts of depression, the havoc wreaked on her sex life, and her struggles to fulfill her roles as employee, wife, and mother. Banerd tells her story calmly and matter-of-factly, but her descriptions of these experiences are heartrending.Menopause Before 40 is an excellent resource for women who are, or suspect they are, experiencing early menopause. Karin Banerd makes the sometimes complex material interesting and easy to understand. This book will also be of interest to anyone, male or female, who wants to gain a deeper understanding of the impact that early menopause has on the women who experience it and those around them."},{"Title":"Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"Coping with POF, I was hoping for some words of wisdom from someone who has been through it first-hand. That is what I had expected this book to provide. Instead I felt I was reading an angry woman's diary. I barely got through 1/4 of the book when I decided this wouldn't be much help. Reading about how many and what kind of tampons and pads this woman used to how she hated the world wasn't what I call helpful. I ended up returning the book as even for only $3, it was a waste."},{"Title":"Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"If you suffer from premature ovarian failure, and are going through early menopause as a result, you'll find this book validates every single thought, emotion, physical feeling and sense of personal chaos you may be going through. I sure did! I want to thank the author for being so candid. I have read material on POF on the internet, and think this book should be required reading."},{"Title":"Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"Karin Banerd's book is a most useful guide for all women who find themselves in the bewildering predicament of experiencing early menopause. Karin provides the reader with a most touching account of her long and painful journey to discovery, search for solutions and finally coping with this potentially health-threatening condition.Karin's description of her poignant experiences as well as the wealth of well-researched material on all aspects of early menopause, including HRT, will no doubt be of great support to other women and their partners who find themselves in the same difficult situation. Her courage in telling her personal story will, I think, be appreciated by patients and doctors alike.Moreover, Karin delivers this information from the point of view of the patient, not the medical practitioner."},{"Title":"Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"As a woman who has been dx with POF I was looking forward to reading this highly recommended (by amazon reviewers) book. Overall I was disappointed with the book... perhaps it's my medical background or perhaps I just don't enjoy the overly explicit details regarding the author's personal traumas. I'm sure for some readers the author's personal musings about her severe depression and personal drama may be comforting in that \\"I'm not alone\\" sort of way but if you're looking for a positive perspective on how to cope with POF this is not the book to consider."},{"Title":"Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"It was a shock when I was diagnosed with an extreme case of Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) at age 28. No one expects to be going through a process that is, in effect, menopause at so young an age. One of the ways that I have regained at very least the illusion of control over my life and body is by reading as much as possible about POI. It has also helped to read the experiences of other women who have endured a similar shock and gone through similar, ongoing medical issues. In an ideal world, I'd be able to form a support group with other women going through similar experiences, but POI, especially POI as extreme as mine has been, is pretty rare.In general, the best and most thorough book that I've found about POI has been \\"The Premature Menopause Book\\" by Kathryn Petras. It addresses the broad spectrum of medical and psychological issues that women with POI go through. As an introduction to the experience of POI, I would recommend it before \\"Menopause Before 40\\", particularly if you are also coping with infertility. The author of \\"Menopause Before 40\\" had already had four or five (I don't remember how many.. I read it a few months ago) children before going through POI. I'm not proud of this, but I resented her for it. Infertility is an central part of the psychological experience of POI for many of us, and Karin Barin's extensive account of her own experiences with POI do not make it as central (even though she did have one extremely negative experience where she went in for surgery and the surgeon changed course partway through, deciding on a course of surgery that would make Barin completely infertile without even consulting her first. Bad medical establishment! Bad practice!).It is possible that \\"Menopause Before 40\\" contains more current medical information than \\"The Premature Menopause Book\\", because \\"Menopause Before 40\\" is dated 2006 while \\"The Premature Menopause Book\\" is from 1999. (On that same line of reasoning, I wouldn't recommend \\"Before Your Time: The Early Menopause Survival Guide\\" either. Even though it came out most recently (2010), its descriptions of medical issues and treatments are too brief to be of use.) However, I'm not a doctor, so I'm not the best judge of that.Premature Ovarian Insufficiency can come with a lot of medical complications. Here is where \\"Menopause Before 40\\" shines, as a tale of perseverance through medical appointments and hormonal changes. One of the problems with POI is that doctors don't necessarily know what the best course of treatment for any given patient will be, and often a local physician don't know much about treating POI because it is so rare. It can be necessary to go to a few different doctors, sometimes traveling out of your geographic area, in order to find treatments that balance you out. And it takes time, often months, to evaluate whether a course of treatment will be effective. If you are looking to hear a lot of voices of women who have gone through POI, I'd recommend \\"Faces of POI: Learning and Living with Premature Ovarian Failure\\" by the International POI Support Group. But if you are looking to hear in depth about one woman's long slog through the medical establishment* to get her POI satisfactorily treated, I would recommend this book.*She was dealing with the Canadian medical establishment, not the United States'. If you are looking for a guide to navigating the United States' medical establishment, know that the Canadian system is different."},{"Title":"Menopause Before 40: Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure","review":"Karin Banerd's \\"Menopause before 40 Coping with Premature Ovarian Failure\\" is an excellent primer for ALL women undergoing menopause - not just those before 40.

FINALLY after numerous blood tests, it came back that I was indeed in menopause. I found Karin Banerd's book here on amazon and I was so happy to have found this resource. She tells her own story of going into menopause at age 35. I took this book to my doctor and she agreed that it's a wonderful book.

A JRT is not for someone wanting a lapdog,(they love to play and need interaction with the family) though he is this at times, but more than that the JRT is a dog with energy and is a special and loving dog.

A friend told me about the book and also mentoned that a new revised copy will be out next year."},{"Title":"A Choice Not an Echo: The inside story of how American Presidents are chosen","review":"It is one of the more delicious ironies of American politics that the reforms that were foisted upon the Democrats in 1972 by liberal activiststrying to nominate a candidate of the Left, reforms which then spread to the Republican Party in the wake of the Watergate scandals, havehad the opposite effect that their advocates intended. Loosening the powerbrokers grip on the nomination process has produced anuninterrupted string of conservative Republican nominees and nearly thirty years of at least relatively conservative presidents, even thoughDemocrats have won three of those elections. This is not, of course, how it was supposed to work. The operating mythology held that itwas the evil men in the smoke-filled rooms who were forcing their reactionary minions down all of our throats, and, if only you could givethe people their choice, they'd go for progressives. Well, those reformers would have done well to read Phyllis Schlafly's A Choice Not anEcho, before setting in motion a process which they didn't understand, but which she had clearly, if over dramatically, explained back duringthe 1964 campaign.What Ms Schlafly set out to demonstrate--and she succeeded to a considerable degree--was that the Eastern Establishment of the RepublicanParty, with its money, access to the media and advertising expertise, had for years wielded an inordinate influence over who would be theeventual presidential nominee every four years. At first blush this might seem to confirm the reformers intuition, but, as Ms Schlafly said,what these men believed in was not conservative politics, as we understand it today, but their own rather large pocketbooks. This led themto favor stability, domestic and global, above all other causes, and meant that they were de facto defenders of the New Deal and relentlessadvocates of d&eacute;tente with the Soviets. Ideas were less important to them than not rocking the boat; the party line a distant second to thebottom line. In their own strange way, they had become allies of the Democratic Party, which by the early 1970s had taken the nation a longway toward socialism at home, acceptance of communism as a legitimate system abroad, and an increasingly demoralized and relativisticculture. Thus, the party paraded out a cavalcade of \\"me-tooers\\"--nominees like Wendell Wilkie, Tom Dewey, Eisenhower, and Nixon--whohad basically come to terms with the New Deal and were internationalist but not confrontationalist when it came to the Soviet Union.Meanwhile, Eastern party powers did everything they could to deny the nomination to someone like Robert Taft, \\"Mr. Republican\\", who wasboth isolationist and eager to roll back the Social Welfare State.In this thin volume, Ms Schlafly argued that for Republicans to compete and win on the presidential level they would need to shuck off theinfluence of the Easterners, the moneyed interests, and select truly conservative candidates who would draw sharp contrasts with theDemocrats, not try to fudge their differences. When she first wrote the book it was to justify a Goldwater candidacy, and she rewrote itsomewhat later in 1964 to prepare Republicans for the vicious assault that she correctly predicted that Madison Avenue would launch againsthim, with establishment Republicans in the East joining with Democrats to defeat a man who threatened both big government and the ratherstable balance of terror that was the Cold War.In his terrific book, Before the Storm, Rick Perlstein has told the fascinating story of how the grassroots conservative movement managed, in1964, to finally win the nomination for one of their own. The victory was so unlikely that in places his book reads like a thriller. Of course,with LBJ riding a tidal wave of popular support in the wake of the Kennedy assassination, one could argue that the win wasn't worth much.In fact, Goldwater went down to such ignominious defeat that it left many on the Left saying that conservatism had ceased to exist inAmerica. Indeed, the Eastern Establishment had their way again in 1968 with the candidacy of Richard Nixon, who proceeded to expanddomestic government, bail out of Vietnam, buddy up to China, and pursue a policy of d&eacute;tente with the Soviet Union. But then came theMcGovern reforms, and the post-Watergate reforms, and American politics has been drifting Right ever since.In 1976 Ronald Reagan nearly knocked off a sitting president in the first relatively open GOP primaries, and the Democrats nominated aborn-again Southerner, Jimmy Carter, who did beat Ford. Reagan came back and won in 1980, establishing what appeared to be aRepublican hammerlock on the presidency, but George Bush Sr. squandered that lock by raising taxes and alienating his conservative base.This left him vulnerable to two other conservative Southerners, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot, as, presumably for the first time in the history ofAmerican politics, the Eastern establishment had no candidate at all to support, though they finally grudgingly went with Clinton as the leastconservative option. Just two years later, in 1994, Ms Schlafly's thesis was brilliantly vindicated as Republicans ran on the starklyideological platform of the Contract with America and won a resounding victory, taking both houses of Congress for the first time indecades. Then in 2000, George W. Bush managed to defeat John McCain, the improbable darling of the establishment, in the primaries,then proceeded to dethrone a sitting Vice President during an unprecedented economic boom. (It is notable that Al Gore too was aconservative Southerner, despite his bizarre lurch leftward during the fall campaign.) Bush achieved these twin feats while running well tothe right of Ronald Reagan, who, though he undoubtedly would have liked to, never actually ran on a platform that called for privatizingSocial Security and turning over government services to \\"faith-based institutions\\".Oddly enough, it is today Democrats who need their own Phyllis Schlafly (and isn't that a delicious prospect?) to come forward and summonthem back to their party principles. Unless Democrats are content to be a party that periodically gets to put their own \\"me-tooer\\" in theWhite House, a Democratic president who will govern like a Republican, then they need to offer \\"a choice not an echo.\\" It is Democratswho need to shake themselves loose from the thrall of the big corporate interests who have taken over their party and transformed them intowhat Clinton himself realized they had become : \\"Eisenhower Republicans...fighting the Reagan Republicans\\". They need to ask themselveswhether they exist solely to hold governmental power every once in a while, or whether they still have an organizing vision of the uses towhich that power should be put.Congressional Republicans too should heed Ms Schlafly's sage advice and should borrow a page from their own playbook; in 2002 theyshould run on a new Contract, one which differentiates them from Democrats in the most direct terms. Too many of our politicians havebeen mesmerized by the siren call of the media for bipartisanship, but as Ms Schlafly wrote, citing an unnamed Republican leader :Bipartisanship is just a $5 word for...a two-bit word, \\"me-tooism.\\"Our politics is at its best when the two parties stake out their very different, nearly opposite, positions on the issues and then seek toconvince us, by force of argument, that one side or the other has the better platform for America... Thecentrality of ideas, and the imperative that parties be unwavering advocates of theirs, is the great insight that animates Phyllis Schlafly's stilltimely polemic and that rescues it from some of its more paranoid and conspiracy-minded passages.GRADE : C+"},{"Title":"A Choice Not an Echo: The inside story of how American Presidents are chosen","review":"Phyllis Schlafly's book is a must read for those who believe feminists are nuts.

The story is about young Dynah Carey who is engaged to be married and while walking home one night is raped by a stranger. These things happen all of the time-that doesn't make it any less horrific. Dynah in complete sadness and confusion goes through the next few days trying to block out what happened. Soon she realizes she is pregnant and her world changes once again. Dynah is attending a Christian college and soon word of the tragedy spreads to those in charge at the college. Since (of course) this is a Christian college they tell her she must quit because no one is allowed to be pregnant on the campus especially from something so awful. (I just have to add that this part of the book made me really angry because this is how so many Christians are and no wonder people don't like those who believe!)The story continues and more people show their true colors when they find out she isn't planning on having an abortion. I won 't give away the story but it is really amazing to read such a story that talks about abortion after a rape, this isn't easy stuff to read!Good book, but not a light read at all! Francine Rivers is a wonderful author and I will always recommend her!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I ordered this book for my christian bookstore and ended up reading it during down time at work. The subject is definitely provocative, and Dynah's journey will probably illicit an emotional response from the reader. It did with me, I found myself guilty of victim blaming, cheering on her allies and later wondering why there was so little focus put on the rape itself and healing that huge wound, but I totally lost focus on that because the book got a little odd and started reading like a campaign ad instead of a piece of well rounded fiction, resulting in it just being an okay read that I probably wouldn't suggest to a rape victim."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I loved it. Couldnt put it down. Had a good but contraversial message. Francine rivers creates characters well. Intensely written."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"\\"The Atonement Child\\" by Francine Rivers is the story of Dynah Carey. She becomes pregnant as the result of a rape, and the novel shares her story of deciding whether to have an abortion or not, as well as the resulting consequences of the rape and pregnancy.I loved that there is a novel that tackles such a hot-button issue. I felt it could have been a bit more balanced though. Putting the baby up for adoption was not really covered in the book--rather, the focus was on whether or not to have a abortion. Also, there wasn't a whole lot of closure regarding her rape. It's such a traumatic event, but we the readers weren't really given a lot of insight into her healing process from the rape.Overall, a good read. I applaud Ms. Rivers for tackling the issue of abortion and presenting Dynah's story so well with how she wrestled with the issue herself (and not just Dynah, but several other characters as well have their own secrets and pain)."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"GREAT book! It's definitely a book that I will share with others and will probably reread myself! Francine Rivers is a very good author."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Dynah Carey had the perfect life until she was raped. Then she discovers she is pregnant and she thinks her world has ended and her family is torn apart. When she considers an abortion, like others in her family have done, she has to decide if she will follow them, or break the cycle.While this is a book on the controversial topic of rape and abortion, Rivers has done a great job covering the topic and presenting in a riveting way. I could not put the book down until I finished reading it. I give this book 4.5 stars."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Dynah is a sheltered Christian young lady who is raped and then learns she's pregnant. The book details her journey through her survival during the pregnancy and her decision to keep or abort the baby.I really enjoy reading Francine Rivers books. They are captivating and well written. But I had a really hard time getting into this book. Maybe it was the subject matter, maybe because it felt a little cheesy for me, maybe because it also felt a little \\"preachy\\". I'm not for abortion, but the book felt more like a platform for a topic than a story. That being said, it's still well written and I would recommend this book as long as you don't mind the slightly preachy tone."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book really shows that God can take something horrible and turn it around for something good. God's plan are amazing if we are just open to accepting them."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The Atonement Child is one of the first books I read by Francine Rivers, and though it is fiction, it deals with two tough topics: rape and abortion. Rivers takes a tough, yet compassionate view on the issue of abortion and weaves a great story around it. In my opinion, this is the best book she wrote. Although I am a guy, I loved the book and was pulled into the story. I always considered myself very pro-life, but this book helped my pro-life views to be even stronger. Kudos to Francine Rivers for doing such job writing about these two issues."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"All of her books that I have read are wonderfulI would recommend her books to anyone in high school and up. Just because they can be very graphic."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The Atonement Child is a story that will resonate with many readers. The subject matter is always topical and no-one who reads this story will be untouched by it.Dynah Carey is a beautiful young women brought up in a spritual home by loving parents.She goes to a Christian college away from home where she meets a man with similar values as herself.

I couldnt put it down!!! There is hope in every situation with Gods help!!!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book is not only the journey of one innocent girl and her decision but many others as well. Francine Rivers, the author, include the mixed emotions of everyone involved. From the pregnant person's torment, parents feelings, friends opinions, school consequences, relationships effects, future health concerns, doctors opinions. Francine Rivers really covered many reasons for abortions. She included why people came to believed what they believe. She included why people chose what they choose. She included the influence each have on each other, either right or wrong. She included how we justify our actions. All this and a smooth flow of truth and fact; Cause and effect of people's lives with deep seeded emotion and pain.I had to keep reading to find out if this experience will bond the families or destroy the families involved. Can God work good through evil? You will have to read this to find out.I really hope this book helps others see where someone was mentally when they made a decision. Giving others love and understanding to move past their decision without judgement.I was asked to abort my child 35 years ago. Then I was asked if I wanted to give him up for adoption when my relationship ended with his father. Luckily, my parents said they would stand by me no matter my decision. I did not abort nor give him up and today he is married and a beautiful loving person.Kris"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Great book! Couldn't put it down! Inspiring message too! Francine Rivers is a very encouraging writer... makes me want to read more of her books!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I am a huge Francine Rivers fan - and after reading her Mark of the Lion series, I've read everything else she's written. I found this to be a lovely story of a young woman experiencing disaster, handling it with grace, and demonstrating how strong a young lady in her predicament can be."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is one of my favorite books by Francine Rivers. This fictional story takes a touchy subject and approaches it with elegance. I found myself laughing, crying, and experiencing a myriad of emotions while reading this story.This book definitely tugs at your heart strings. Without giving away too much information, it shows how one girl's actions and decisions were able to atone for someone else."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I couldn't put it down. I read it while we were on our way to Denver for a vacation. I don't even remember the ten hour drive because I was so into this book.

Great job, Francine!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The Atonement Child is a gripping story of a young lady named Dynah. She is tested and tried in her faith beyond anything she could ever have imagined possible. A tragedy strikes her life and leaves her making a decision that will change her life forever. This is a heart wrenching story of love, faith, and hope."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is the first book by Francine Rivers that I've read, and let me tell you, it so blessed my socks off that when a friend asked me for ideas on what to give my mother for her birthday, I told her The Atonement Child, without a doubt. My mother read it and loved it, and I have since lent that copy out to friends whom I knew would be blessed by it. Since then, I have read the Mark of the Lion series (does anyone know if there is another book coming?) and for Mother's Day, I am getting my mom The Scarlet Thread :-) I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed ALL of Mrs. Rivers' books, but I am thankful that The Atonement Child was my first intro to her writings... it blessed me so much!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"It was so good I read it 3 times. I recomend this book to anyone who has ever been sexually abused. It can help you work through your problems."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book was so down-to-earth and based on what is occurring daily&gt; It was heart-wrenching to see the emotional struggle a young Christian girl was going through as she questioned whether she could abort the child conceived from a rape. It was inspirational as she shared insights of the struggles of her mother and grandmother who had both aborted children years before and yet were afraid to share that information that had plagued them for so many years. What would happen to Jesus today???"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is my first Francine Rivers book, and I was so impressed. I felt like Rivers was real and honest about the situation and didn't try to just write another &quot;cookie cutter&quot; Christian fiction. This is a story about real people, real things that happen to people, and a REAL GOD that will redemn the choices people make."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers has done it again. The Atonement Child is a descriptive and real life fiction that stops and makes you really think on what you believe. I read this book knowing that I was pro-life, and was strengthened in that belief after I got done reading the book. It made me reflect on what I would do in Dynah's case. I encourage everyone and everyone to read this book. Thank you Ms. Rivers for another excellent novel!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I just finished reading The Atonement Child. At first I wasn't going to read it as it was not an issue for me. I am prolife and have never had an abortion. I read the comments here though and decided to go ahead a read it. I found myself involved in the story right away and not only that but when I was finished I found my faith had been strengthed. Only Francine Rivers could produce a piece of work such as this. I would highly recommend this book to everyone. It is a fantastic piece work. Once again, my hats off to Francine."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Before starting this book, I was a bit skeptical about the subject matter. I wasn't convinced the plot (from what I knew of it) would be able to stretch over an entire novel without being boring at times. But several friends of mine had recently read the book and assured me that I would love it, so I decided to give it a try. Was I ever in for a surprise! I picked up the book around 9:30pm, expecting to read a chapter or so before allowing myself to drift off to sleep early. By 2:30am, my eyes were so puffy from crying that they were almost swollen shut, and I felt emotionally drained as I fell asleep with the light on and the book open beside me. Awaking late the next morning, I rolled over and continued reading, and taking breaks only for meals and a shower, I finished the book that afternoon. I just couldn't pull myself away from the lives of the characters as I struggled through the pain with them! Before determining my opinion of a book, I always wait a number of days after I finish, so that I can see how it affects me later on. I consider this one a truly great book! Even several weeks after finishing it, I am still being moved by thoughts of the story. I have a new perspective of abortion, though I was already pro-life, and my faith in God has been strengthened incredibly in my desire to have the peace found through Him by the characters. Not a day goes by when the characters of this book do not come to mind as I wrestle with a decision or a struggle. What a blessing for me that I had the opportunity to read The Atonement Child! Thank you, Francine Rivers!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The Atonement Child presents a very realistic picture of a college woman pregnant from rape. True to the experience of many women in this situation, she DOES NOT WANT an abortion, but feels pressured into one.A similar, excellent book is Friday's Child."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I just finished this book, and even though excellent reviews have already been written, I feel I have to add my thoughts, if only to encourage others to read this book. Rivers writes about real characters with real problems, but reminds us that God is in control. It breaks my heart to hear people say their pro-life, yet will make exceptions in the cases of rape and incest. Rivers shows how getting rid of a child doesn't eliminate a problem; it only compounds them. If you think abortion should only be a political topic or only a personal choice, read this book. Thank you, Ms. Rivers, for writing this without soft-soaping anything."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I was torn up about admiring the courage of the heroine while at the same time detesting her fiance and his misogynistic behavior. What a joke that he was the \\"spiritual leader\\" of their relationship, I guess because he was a man? And I was simmering again every time I read about how worried Dynah was about losing her virginity and being \\"unpure\\" for her husband. I used to love Francine Rivers but much of this book makes me want to gag."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I read Francine River's Scarlett Thread and was overjoyed to find that she had another 'controversial' book. I feel like the book just dragged on and was not personal. It didn't feel as if it came from her heart. I was really disappointed though I read the entire book. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a realistic book about rape/abortion/unwanted pregnancies. It was too fake."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers knows how to weave a poignant story dealing with profound issues, that are resolved by resounding faith. This story deals with a young woman's journey after rape; and in fact, how everyone else around her deals with it as well."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Atonement Child from Francine Rivers is a pivotal book dealing with the issue of abortion. At times, it has been criticized for not being realistic enough, but to those who've said that, they've missed the point. Though it was written in 1997 and some of the references might seem a bit dated, the message stays the same. If you were stripped of all your comforts; home, friends, future . . . would you still serve God? I read this book when it first came out, when Christian Fiction with issues was a new genre. I decided to read it again when it tumbled from my book closet. I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I found this to be a very emotional and spiritual book.A friend had read it and suggested that I should too.Once I started reading it i couldnt put it down.I think it's an excellent book for any person, Christian or not. I would hightly recommend any of Francine Rivers' books."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"An extremely good book! I would recommend it young adults everywhere! The book is extremely well written and covers the biblical perspective of abortion really well. The author does a really good job of bringing the characters to life."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I just want to recommend this book to anyone who likes to read! I happen to see this book in our local book store and told my mother in law that I might like it for Christmas. She bought me the book...and I couldn't put it down! I read it in all of my spare moments. I couldn't wait to get out of bed so that I could keep reading. Well, I finished the book in three days...but had I had more time...would've loved to sit down and read it in one sitting. This is the first book I have read from Francine Rivers, and I am hooked. This book was so well written...I am online to order a few more! =) This is a must read! So touching! It leaves you in awe of the Almighty!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was such a wonderful book! It changes your views on abortion and shows how God helps us through all of our hard times, no matter what the circumstances. I would reccomend this book to anyone that wants to explore what they believe!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Excellent. Rivers handles an extremely senstive situation in a manner that makes you think about your Christianity. The tone of the book is such that you become so involved in Dynah's life, it brings tears to your eyes. Rivers developes the characters in a way that is truly amazing."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I am a huge fan of Francine Rivers', and this book really disappointed me. It was totally predictable and unrealistic. It's a sensitive, emotional topic and deserved a more real-world telling. I do think Rivers did a good job of presenting the issue, but I often had to force myself to keep reading. Rivers did continue her tradition of excellent character development, but again, I wanted a surprise, or maybe just a hint of suspense, to keep me reading. A surprisingly unsatisfying book for Rivers."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"My apologies for such a long review, but I want to make it clear why I have given it a low rating despite my personal convictions on the subject matter:The Atonement Child came strongly recommended to me by a friend who knows my pro-life views and assumed I would like the book because of them. I'm very sorry to say that she was wrong in this.Though I appreciated the lessons learned in this story, I felt like I was reading the script for a Lifetime movie. And a poor one at that. It often felt corny or outright unbelievable. The main character, a young woman pregnant as the result of a rape, runs into one woman after another who has had an abortion. She also encounters more insensitivity and controlling personalities than seems plausible. I felt that in a book set in the real world, my suspension of disbelief should not be quite so challenged.Another thing that bothered me was the omniscient view that the story was told from. Though I understand what Ms. Rivers was trying to accomplish, the way the point of view jumped from one character to the next was sometimes confusing and frustrating. Viewpoints would switch with no buffer at all (within the same paragraph at times), and we had to see into the minds of characters so minor that there seemed no valid reason for it. I feel that the story would have moved more smoothly if a few characters viewpoints had been focused on instead of slowing down progress with every little person's background.And finally, I think the book was very... predictable. I had the main plot guessed within 5 pages, the happy ending figured out before the first chapter was through, and the little secrets were so easy to decipher. More than once I thought towards the main character, with some frustration, \\"Really, Dynah? You don't GET what's going on yet??\\"I don't mean to be so down on the book. It did have it's positives. It was a story of redemption in many ways. Of things being set right. The last few pages made me smile, despite their silliness. I could feel that Francine was not trying to be judgmental towards women who have been through abortions. That she was trying to reach out to them and show them that they are not alone, while at the same time maybe giving hope to women who don't know what to do right now. And I appreciated all of these things. I suppose I just look for a little bit more to my literature than this book offered.As somebody else mentioned: If you are looking for viewpoints on abortion, this is a good place to look. If you're looking for excitement or a gripping read, this may not be it. Bottom line~ I'm glad I got through it, but I won't read it again."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The title was the first thing that grabbed me, and once I started reading, I couldn't stop. Although the story moved too fast for me to really get to know Dynah, I felt her pain, humiliation, and suffering and grieved for her prediciment. The well-meaning but insensitive remarks of those around her isolated her even more. Then with the pregnacy came Dynah's test of faith, her confusion and even more pain. All very real emotions for any real person in a similar situation.However, this terrific story is not without it's flaws. I felt the conflict between Dynah's parents was effective, but not very realistic. It seemed to bother Douglas more that his wife had slept with someone else (previous to their relationship) than it did that she'd had an abortion. I found it ironic that nearly every woman in the book had an abortion, and all of them suffered for it. The portrayal of the abortion clinic, with the ... administrator waiting to lure pregnant girls into her clinic and force them to have abortions, was unrealistic to me. Dynah was already a hard character to connect with. Even for a sheltered girl who grew up in the church, for a woman in her twenties, she seemed too childlike. Also was her absolute perfection, which made her seem unreal. Still, sympathy for her pain and struggle made me care about her and what happened to her.That was lost when Dynah became a prophet, delivering God's message to the doctor and hearing God's voice. Most people look for a sign from God--it's rare that anyone hears His voice telling them exactly what to do. How easy life would be for everyone if that happened, and how easy it was for Dynah. All her struggle, pain, insecurity, and confusion vanished and she suddenly knew what she had to do. At that point I knew where the story would end and felt no desire to even finish it. Dynah never seemed to suffer the aftereffects of the rape, she was so consumed by abortion issues, and I found that strange. Just like her mother and grandmother suffered for years to come about their abortions, a rape victim is usually severely traumatized by the brutal violence inflicted on them. It was almost like Dynah was never raped, she just got pregnant somehow.Those two topics--abortion and religion--are very sensitive topics and I applaud the author for approaching them. But I think she felt too strongly about this issue, and made her novel come off as somewhat preachy. Instead of dealing with Dynah's rape and resulting pregnacy and the difficulty she would have dealing with that, the book became a long anti-abortion campaign. I also didn't like the ending, where she and Joe plan to marry (which of course was coming all along) and live happily ever after. The baby's birth should have brought a whole new set of issues, or it would have for someone who was traumatized by a rape. But unrealistically, Dynah's rape becomes irrelevant.Other than the easy solutions and Dynah's unrealistic character, I enjoyed the book. It was well written and engaging, but it may lose your interest around the middle. ...."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I just read this book, a book I wanted to read from the time I knew it existed. It was the compelling story I knew it would be. I found the reactions of Dynah and the people around her -- the college dean, her fiance, her parents, etc. -- to be very realistic. I found myself thinking that many women in such a situation would find the same kind a reaction to their circumstances, even in the Christian community. Other people certain of what SHE must do, their acceptance of her hinging on whether or not she did what they wanted.Dynah's story beautifully illustrates that what happens after a rape can be nearly as traumatic on the victim as the rape itself. It also shows that something truly beautiful can come out of evil circumstances when God is involved.I highly recommend this book. I would only caution that you should set aside plenty of time to read it, because you won't want to put it down!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The first book I read by Francine Rivers was Redeeming Love and like everyone ~ couldn't put it down! I would have to say Atonement Child is much less intense of a read, however still equally as page turning!! I love that the author adds so many different unspoken thoughts of what is going on in the minds of the characters as far as talking with Jesus is concerned. I find all their thoughts are what mine would be, right down to questioning Gods existence, love and protection. I have not yet finished (will by 3rd day!), but I can see Gods hand in the whole picture! I am excited for the outcome of the story as well as my own relationship with Jesus!Thank you Francine for another powerful, convicting read!!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book was so engrossing and if it was in my power I would pass it along to all teens. The rape of a Christian college student was horrendous, a girl who tried every day to live a life that would honor God. The ordeal she went through with her friends, boyfriend and even the college dean was enough to make anyone feel hopeless with nowhere to turn. This was a girl who had her head screwed on right and looked forward to a bright future, but when her parents did not respond with a positive attitude, she felt abandoned.This scenario could easily happen and the courage Dynah showed was very uplifting and inspiring. Those who are pro-choice are not likely to recommend \\"The Atonement Child\\" for obvious reasons but I gladly do. As you can gather, I am against abortion simply because common sense tells me that if I do anything to prevent the birth of a baby then I have killed a child."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I am not by any means religious and honestly don't like to read about religion, but this book gave me a different outlook on the aspect. I liked how it dealt with real issues like abortion. It showed that you can be extremely religious and still have doubts and human emotions. I like how the girl was persistent in following her heart. I didn't want to put it down. Great read for teenagers and up."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book is not about perfect Christians, living perfect lives that never have any problems are heartaches. Nope, Ms Rivers dives right in to the thick of REAL LIFE allowing her characters to be hurt, feel betrayed and struggle with what a loving God has allowed to come upon them. Yet, she does it with such conviction and grace that instead of becoming a depressing downer, it lifts the heart and the spirit of the reader. This book is not afraid to explore where life goes \\"when bad things happen to good people\\"A horrible crime against a young woman, a surprise pregnancy, a broken fianc&eacute; and uncertain family have all been done before, but Ms. Rivers breathes such life into her characters you feel you know them.This is the story of how a young woman finds grace to follow God in the midst of harsh and hurtful reality. As such it will challenge you to trust God no matter what your circumstances.Challenging, uplifting, informative, GOOD. Read it--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book was written with amazing insight and I thought it was brilliant how she managed to show how many lives and how differently abortion affects EVERYONE involved....not just the person having the abortion. I've read negative comments on here about how people thought it was unrealistic and overkill for her to include so many different people in Dynah's life who had experienced abortion which is completely rediculous. It's called \\"generational curses\\" and yes many times grandmothers, mothers and daughters experience the same trauma in their lives because they don't talk about their past or recognize there is a pattern and a stronghold in a certain area. The after effects of an abortion are long lasting emotionally and physically and she explained those quite well. I can only think the people making these comments have not been personally touched by the loss of a life through abortion. One person commented against the case she made regarding the family who opted for abortion because financially it wasn't the right time to conceive- they thought no one would ever do that...well welcome to the real world! That is a VERY common reason. This is a controversial subject but it shouldn't be...to love and respect life is a simple yet powerful concept. I applaud her for writing this book exactly the way she did!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"All in all, I thought this was a good book. It kept me very engaged and I read it very quickly. I agree with what some others said, in that I was shocked that after hearing about Dynah's Christ centered and wholesome upbringing, her parents marriage and very character so very quickly disintegrated. It was clear that it was not just Dynah's pregnancy that was the cause, these issues have been around for years, and the amount of anger and resentment that so quickly surfaced was just...unbelievable for a family of Christ followers. Not that Christians are perfect of course...but this was a bit, okay a lot, much. I also had mixed feeling on Francine Rivers' clearly trying to push the idea that any birth control at all is wrong. I was really shocked and put off by that. Dynah's thought process when she refuses the morning after pill, and the rest of the book make clear that Rivers' doesn't believe that any form of birth control is ever acceptable. I find that ascertation shocking and dangerous. I can not believe that any one would fault a rape victim for taking the morning after pill. And Rivers' states that birth control pills are abortificants. I find that a bit much. The abortion clinic director is certainly portrayed as a monster with no heart. And finally, when Granny is discussing abortion with her friends, and one shares that her granddaughter had one, because the pregnancy was 6 months sooner then planned, I kind of wanted to throw the book across the room. While that MAY happen, I think its incredibly hard to believe that a happily married couple who looked forward to having children someday would actually abort b/c it was sooner then planned. I do not believe that people really believe the rhetoric about it being 'just tissue' to that extent."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Any story about rape and abortion is bound to be controversial in these times, but Rivers has done a remarkable job of making nearly every character sympathetic and human. In fact, the two most unsympathetic characters are \\"good\\" Christians in this book, showing that Rivers has little bias. The writing is impeccable and the characters strong and three-dimensional. I felt that Dynah lost a little of her depth after she finally makes her decision, but I think that's due to the focus on other characters. Ultimately, this is a story about hope and how the Lord can take horrible things and make them into good and bring healing to so many. Rivers has a great ear for writing our inner dialogue with God. When we yell at him, accuse him, and beg him for mercy, she's got it all down."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"At the risk of sounding like a God freak [which I am] I must respond to some who think this book unrealistic. Though this may not be your reality it is the reality of many faceless, unnamed women [and men]. I shared this book with my sister who in presenting it to other members of her bible study group was amazed to find out how many other women shared similar experiences. In almost every instance they tried to put this experience behind them and through reading the book were able to finally share their experiences with others and address feelings that have been plaguing them for years. I view Ms. Rivers' book as a cry to girls who find themselves in similar situations. It helps them to realize the cruel reality of the circumstances that they find themselves in. That abortion is not the quick fix that it can sometimes be promoted as. It showed that one's life is forever changed by such a decision. It also shows that it takes the love that only God can give to help heal the heart of someone who has to endure such a painful experience. The book does not just promote anti-abortionism; it illuminates the fact that none of us are perfect and that we are all trying to make it and sometimes deal with decisions that we made when we were too young to understand the magnitude of what we were doing [whether that is abortion or something else]. Dinah's attack and rape was totally horrible but the hurt that her mother and grandmother harbored over the years was definitely a noose around their necks. It may seem that Dinah's rape was glossed over so that Ms. Rivers could stand on her anti-abortion soapbox but is this how she feels or is she showing how victims are really treated? Deal with the \\"problem\\" or get rid of the \\"problem\\" and move on with your life. It's not like getting the abortion was going to make Dinah forget what happened to her. Doesn't society too have its own guidelines as to when it is acceptable or unacceptable to abort a child: it's okay when you are raped but woe to the one who willingly engaged in the act. The books shows that the decision is not an easy one no matter the circumstances.What some of us may overlook in reading this book and noting all of the \\"coincidences\\" is that Dinah was most disappointed with her mother and grandmother because they tried to hide their pasts from her as she faced a decision they had already made in their own lives. In this world that we live in today we sometimes need someone who will be brave enough to expose their wounds and tell the true story to help someone else who is going through. Some look at other incidents in the book [such as the restaurant having a job opening right when Dinah needed work] as mere coincidences. I saw them as God showing His love for one of His children. Often times we complain about how the world has become and then when God sends us something or someone to show us just how much He loves us we are quick to mark it off as a coincidence instead of acknowledging that in this big, wide world there is someone who is willing to give us the conditional love that so many of us yearn for and never think we can receive.Thank you Ms. Rivers. You will never know how much the Atonement Child and Redeeming Love helped me to see that God can not only save but love a wretch like me."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The book the Atonement Child by: Francine Rivers is about choice, sacrifice and love. The book is about a young girl who gets raped and becomes pregnant. After she finds out she's pregnant her whole world falls apart. The book then is about her struggle to decide what to do with this child that's growing inside her. Her religion makes abortion to her seem completely wrong, but she doesn't think she will be able to give the baby up. All the people in her life a screaming for her to get an abortion when her whole life they've all been against it. The rest of the book is about Dynah's struggle to decide what to do. I really enjoyed this book, it was well written and made me think about things.With me myself being a Christian I could really relate to what Dynah was struggling with. I mean its really easy to say something until it actually hits home. The subject of abortion is a complicated subject , but I think Francine Rivers did an excellent job portraying what people put up to that decision go through. She also shows the long term affects an abortion can have on people, through the mom and grandma's abortions. She also so the affects it has on others, like Ethan, Joe and Dynah's father.After Dynah brakes off her engagement to Ethan, she moves home to her parents. She moves home because the dean kicks her out of school for being pregnant. She had not yet told her parents that she is pregnant or that she got raped. When she does return home and tell her parents it brings up stuff from there past, and causes problem between her parents. She learn that her mother had an abortion before she met her father. After this Dynah runs away, because she feels like things are her fault, and starts to work at a little diner. Until Joe comes and finds her and convinces her she must go back. On the way back Dynah stops at Dr. Wyatt, the doctor who was supposed to do her abortion. His wife and him take her in for a week until she must return home. In her week there she witnesses to the doctor and he decides to stop doing abortions. When she moves back home her parents begin to work on things and everything begins to look up. She decided to give the baby up for adoption, Joe helps her pick a family. Then she has the baby. Joe is there to help her with it all. After she has the baby she decides no to give it her daughter up for adoptions. After that Joe and Dynah decide to get married. So the point of the book kinda is listen to the lord and good things will come your way.This book did a excellent job of portraying what women go through when they have an unwanted pregnancy. She showed all different aspects of what people go through, form the women to her family to the doctors who do the abortions. The books main theme says that abortion is wrong. It also tells people that the need to listen to the lord or there heart. Although this book portrayed all aspects it was a little one sided towards anti-abortion, which I personally was ok with because I don't believe in abortion either."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was a tear jerker... I could not put it down. I loved the characters-- they were like real people that we all know. I loved the way Dynah listened to the Lord speak to her rather than letting others decide her fate. In addition, I learned a lot about abortion that I did not know. It was educational as well as entertaining."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The book The Atonement Child was a very good book. The book deals with many issues that some teenagers deal with. The book deals with rape, pregnacy, relationships, and abortion. The book was written very well and has a good story line. I would recommend this book to all ages, but mostly to teenagers. Over all the book is a very good."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Having seen too many women come to the Emergency Department after a rape, this book takes the reader into the minds of ALL the victims- the victim herself, the boyfriend, the parents and many others. The reactions are so real and raw. I was particularly impressed by the author's handling of the &quot;Christian&quot; mind set- it was, unfortunately, so right on. I recommend this book to men who have all these confusing thoughts and need guidance when someone they know and love has been a victim."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I think I have read every one of Francine River's books, and this one has to be her best thus far! I have always been pro-life, but this book has cemented that view for me. Francine Rivers has an amazing talent. She presented Dynah's situation so realistically, it was almost as if I were there! Mrs. Rivers does not simplify the situation, the characters are complex, real people, like you and I.Dynah's problems(and the other characters) are not whitewashed, she presents these things in a very real light. This is powerful reading! I highly recommend this book! It is excellent reading!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Atonement ChildBy Francine RiversReview by Roseanna WhiteWhen I was about ten or eleven, I attended a youth lock-in at my church, during which we had an activity that forced us to choose sides on hot topics. There were corners of the room for strong agreement, mild agreement, mild disagreement, and strong disagreement. When a question was asked, each person had to go to a corner and then debate their stance. One of the proposed statements was \\"Women have the right to choose whether or not to abort an unborn child.\\" This being a church function, one side of the room was unsurprisingly empty. But I, with my untested ideals, was surprised to see that not everyone strongly disagreed, some did it only mildly. The argument? \\"But if someone was raped. . .\\"It's a question that plagues our country, even into our churches. Everyone says that the answers are not simple, and Rivers tackles the issue with her usual insight and tenacity. It's so easy to love her main character, the sweet and faithful Dynah, that the reader's heart has to break when tragedy strikes her, even though we all know from the outset that it will, otherwise there would be no book. As Dynah struggles first with the fact of the attack itself, and then with the outcome of it, the true complication of the situation becomes so very apparent. Rivers points out through her uncomfortably real characters that the intellectual decisions we make when uninvolved don't always transfer so easily to something when it hits us in the face. She doesn't just open the question of whether or not abortion is wrong, ever or always or sometimes. She deals with the heartbreak of rape, the fragility of relationships, the blinders people put on in the face of trial, and the depression that haunts us in our lowest hours.The lack of support Dynah encounters in everyone from her fianc&eacute; to her school to her parents is gut-wrenching. She is fighting not only to make the right decision concerning the child she did nothing to find herself carrying, but to maintain the love of those who were supposed to give it unconditionally. She finds that world that is supposed to be unquestionably Christian unquestionably political; her college is so concerned with keeping up the appearance of virtue that they neglect its actuality. That forces the reader to take a step back and examine the institutions that many probably take for granted. And as usual, when we finally have to question our assumptions, we find faults that rip at our hearts.Nothing is easy for Dynah, and it isn't any easier on the reader. We're forced to understand the generational outcry both for and against this monumental decision, to learn the facts that horrify and yet still leave that gray area. We cheer for the one friend Dynah has who never wavers, never leaves, and we cry for the woman who is little more than a girl and can't find the right words to pray. She hears the voice of God in her heart, but the voices of those supposed to follow Him are so loud, and so contradictory that she questions her own spirit.I truly wanted to scream as time and again people chose convenience over righteousness in this book, mainly because I saw their points, saw the world in them, and knew that this was far more than a fictitious story. I had to open my eyes and realize that the issue wasn't as distant as I probably thought, wasn't as clear as my eleven-year-old-mind had once thought. . . and yet murky only because of our human failings, fears, and pain. Rivers looks at both sides of many different debates in this book, presenting them honestly and clearly. Her conclusions don't make the question hurt any less, but they guide the reader toward the most crucial epiphany of all: this Choice isn't just about an unborn child, it's about the women that have to live with it. It isn't a matter of saying yes or no to abortion, but yes or no to God. Whose voice do we listen to when the tempest is crashing? Do we pray for atonement for our sins, or do we step up and stop sinning?"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I couldn't hardly put this book down - wondering what Dynah was going to do, even though the ending was predictable, but like her other books there were unseen twists and turns along the way. I would like to see everyone read this book, no matter thier point of view on abortion. River sends a strong message that all life is valuable, no matter the circumstances or the cost."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is a powerful book about a &quot;normal&quot; Christian girl from a &quot;normal&quot; Christian family who gets raped one night, and then discovers she is pregnant. As she struggles to decide whether or not to have an abortion, she discovers that a lot of things about her friends and family's lives and convictions that were hidden below the surface. I thought it was neat how the author didn't portray all the Christians as the nice guys with all the answers and the doctors at the abortion clinic as evil monsters. Even though this book is pro-life, I would highly recommend it to people on either side of the issue-- it's the kind of book that will make everyone think. I, for one, couldn't help wondering what would happen if I was put in the same situation as Dynah. After all, she was really just a normal person. P.S.- I'll join the other reviewer in Joe's fan club. He's the man."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I have recently become a fan of Francine Rivers' incredible writing. I was captivated and blown away by \\"Redeeming Love\\" and encouraged in \\"The Last Sin Eater.\\" Yet, \\"Atonement Child\\" left me wondering far into the night about why I wasted sleep on reading this book. The only likeable character in this book for me was Joe. More background and character development should have been explored.A majority of the time, I didn't care for the heroine at all.The chapter where her grandmother's friends get together to have their serious \\"discussion\\" was preachy, packed with statistics, and uncomfortable. It felt like the editor must have added that little section to prove some debate.The conclusion was highly predictable and completely unrealistic. This book had no control!However, the most fascinating part of this novel(spoiler) was the spotlight she placed on the \\"Christian college,\\" \\"Christian motives,\\" and how twisted many become when their entire life is centered around the business aspect of church. God was completely shut out of her situation at New Life College. I am so glad that Ms. Rivers exploited how far away from Christ many believers become (without even knowing it!)."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers covers very sensitively and accurately the trauma involved in rape and an unwanted pregnancy. Having been raped as a young girl I can validate her portrayal of Dynah's feelings. I also bore a child of the rapist and thank God to this day for my son. My rapist never knew of this wonderful son, which I have come to feel was punishment in itself. That son died at 26 of A.I.D.S. (Which is a whole other story.) This book brings out the faithfulness of God in spite of our sometimes shallow Christian inadequacies. Reading this book helped me have a new understanding of a dear friend who has never recovered from an abortion she had years ago. This book touches many angles in an area where much healing education is needed."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I have seen too many women come to the Emergency Department after a rape,but this book takes the reader into the minds of ALL the victims- the victim herself, the boyfriend, the parents and many others.

I recommend this book to men who have all the very normal confusing thoughts and need guidance when someone they know and love has been a victim."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"No one writes fiction like Francine Rivers. She really gets to the heart of the matter and challenges to reader to go deeper in the faith.Abortion is such a tough issue and many have opinions that are black and white. Either it is wrong or it is a choice. Yet, when challenged, those on the side of pro-life will agree to the validity of an abortion when rape is involved. This book addresses this exact issue. Yet because Francine Rivers is such a good writer, she addresses this hotbed issue with gentleness, forgiveness, and grace.What I enjoyed about this book is that it challenged what I believed. It is hard to stand on the side of pro-life without having compassion for women in tough circumstances. And what are we do with women who do have an abortion but have to live with the guilt and shame the rest of their lives? Are we to condemn them? Or are to to lavish compassion and grace on them? I am not sure what I would do, but this book has challenged me to look at this issue from a whole new perspective."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Never before have I felt so moved by the brutal honesty of the characters and situations created by Francine Rivers. Truly this author is a woman after God's own heart. A must read for all women of all ages!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Excellent book. Francine Rivers is a Christian author who writes from a biblical perspective. This particular book is about abortion and all of reasons why it is not acceptable in God's eyes. Very quick reading. She draws you into the story quickly."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The subject of this book is a difficult one and Mrs. Rivers's talent of breathing real life and a realistic Christian struggles into this story is beautiful. As I was reading this book I could not help but put myself in the place of Dynah, the main character. What would I have done in her shoes? I'm sure I would have had the same doubts and question God; however, would I have made the right decision. What is the right decision is a central part of this book but not the main point. The point of this story is to trust in God even when the most unthinkable thing has happen. This is hard for every person of faith and I found this story inspiring."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I have enjoyed many of Francine Rivers books, but was a little skeptical about this one. I was wrong. What an amazing book--I could not put it down! I was a little bogged down with the details in the beginning, but she really did a great job working everything into the story."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This story does more than just \\"preach\\" and \\"judge\\" others for their action. I feel that some people fail to see what the author is really saying. Whether this story seems to be unrealistic or what not, the book is about God's love and His redemption to all. Yes, it might seem unrealistic because things \\"just happen\\" to work out for Dynah Carey when she was on the run. And of course, the people around her as well; Joe being \\"the one\\" and her parents are on a good term (I suppose). It didn't \\"just happen\\" because she wrote it. It happens ALL THE TIME because God do provide for those who love and trust in Him.This book was written from the Christian perspective on abortion. It is a touchy subject, especially for those who have had abortion or those you know have had abortion, but it doesn't stop there. Whether you have had abortion, regret or not, God still loves and forgives (as the author constantly repeats in the book). Maybe she was being \\"preachy\\" or just straight up \\"judgemental\\" on telling people what to do with their body, but there is no easy way out when you Belong to the Lord. God doesn't want His people in the path towards Death. Even if Dynah Carey have had aborted the child, God was and still is and will be Glorified.One thing I struggle with the book is being optimistic in tough situations. Yes, find joy in all trials, but being raped and having to carry an anyonmous's child is hard to be \\"joyful.\\" Maybe being too optimistic is just unlikely. I guess it does take great Faith to see it.Whether this book touches your heart or not, God is Glorified in and through everything."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I read this book in Portuguese and couldn't put it down. I was thrilled to find out that it's actually an American book! It shows that ALL babies -- even those conceived out of rape -- have a right to life and that God forgives those who have HAD ABORTIONS and who have PERFORMED ABORTIONS. One thing that I've learned -- through this book, through working in the Crisis Pregnancy Center and through talking with people about the abortion issue is that we will never win the battle against abortion through legislation alone. We must first win over the hearts and minds of the people who see it as just another form of birth control or who don't consider an embryo or fetus as a human being. This book does a lot to begin that battle. Read it first, then have your pro-abortion friends read it and discuss it with them. Not only will it open their eyes to the Gospel, but it'll show them that not all \\"Right-to-Lifers\\" are militant clinic bombers."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book has actual stuff that could really happen, and lots of stuff to think about. You can think about different ways that things could have happened in it, and you care a lot about the characters and what happen to them. I could read the whole book straight through if no one interrupted me."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was the best book I've read ever. (And I've read many, many, many.) Even though it's fiction, it presents facts. This book will touch and open your heart and mind. This book will give encouragement and strength. Even though the topic of the book is abortion, it will give encouragement in other ways as well. So, even if you are not dealing with abortion, it will still give encouragement. This book gave me encouragement, inspiration, and a new outlook on life, love, and God. It was so good, it went by so fast. I thought it would take me at least a month to read the book, but it went by in a week. This book is so uplifting, I would recommend it be read by all. A '10' doesn't do this book justice, but it's the highest rating there is. This book is AWESOME."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Making Dynah a saintly adored girl, does make us question why God would allow a Christian girl to be raped, but at the same time, isn't the rape of ANYONE disgusting and horrible, regardless of whether they are a beautiful saint, or an ugly homeless person?We never feel how her \\"best\\" friend or boyfriend feel, only Dynah. We never see the rapist prosecuted, or even see the police TRY to find him. We never see Joe even angered at the fact that this woman he has supposedly been in love with since day one, has been brutalized.Bad things happen even to saints. Ms. Rivers needs to get a little more reality based. This was a huge letdown after reading Redeeming Love."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I have discovered Francine Rivers by reading Mark of the Lion series which was a masterpiece for me. By picking up \\"The Atonement Child\\", I was expecting the book to be great. But the book was far away from the real life. The heroine who was raped and became pregnant from that rape was somehow distant from the whole situation like that did not involve her but someone else. I did not feel the heroine suffering at all. I did not feel any emotions in that book. I was expecting more to the story. The writer before writing about the subject should have consulted people who found themselves in similar situations if she was not able to picture herself in similar situation just for the book. The book was predictable."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I hated this book at first. The main character did not seem real to me at all, with her perfect life and perfect Christian boyfriend and all that. The first few pages kind of gave me a sick feeling, like I had eaten too much cotton candy. But I kept reading anyway and I'm very glad I did.As time went on Dynah became very real to me, as did her questioning God and her anger. I liked that the author was not afraid of getting angry at God or questioning Him. So many Christians are. I think that most of the \\"realness\\" of the situation was expressed through Dynah's pain and crying out to God for answers. There was no sugar-coating of human emotions in this book, and I liked that.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that adoption was not even *mentioned* as an option until the last part of the book. All through the novel we are given a black and white scenario: Dynah gets an abortion or haves the baby and ruins her life by trying to raise a child on her own. I just wanted to scream, \\"Hello?!? What about adoption!!!\\" It seemed too unlikely that no one in the story was considering that option.Something else I didn't like was that everyone seemed to have dealt with abortion at some point. It was unbelievable. I thought the mother's story was interesting and surprising, but after that you start hearing about the grandma's abortion, Joe and his girlfriend, the doctor, the lady at the clinic, the grandma's friends. Come on. Not everyone has had an abortion. I thought the book would have been great if it had just stuck to the fact that Hannah had had an abortion that was now ruining her marriage and making her doubt herself, leading her daughter down the same path. But it just wasn't necessary to the plot that everyone else had had one too at some point.Overall, I liked this book a lot. I read it straight through in two days. I highly recommend it. Some stuff is annoying, but the book as a whole is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"In Francine Rivers' The Atonement Child, Dynah Carey's perfect world is turned upside down. The night she is raped marks the beginning of a journey filled with pain when she learns she is pregnant.

Her family is shattered and each has a solution-the \\"right\\" solution-for Dynah. Only she can decide what's right for her. Past family decisions and secrets make home uncomfortable, but finally Dynah chooses her path, praying for strength and courage to stand firm in her decision. Be prepared to read about abortion in this religious fiction novel. Each separate view is presented well, although coincidence is relied on often enough in the novel.

The protagonist uses prayer and scripture to grapple with difficult decisions. There are miracles in this book which will leave you with a warm glow"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is my first Francine Rivers book and I must say i was very disappointment for many reasons. After the first couple of chapters in it was very predictable. As you read each chapter there were never any surprises, you knew exactly what was coming. For a young girl being raised in a good Christian home, her parents seemed to have a horrible relationship and the book made it sound like it been like that for the 27 years of marriage. Absolutely ridiculous not only mom had an abortion, but so did grandma and after all these years they were still hung up on it. I would think that if they accepted Christ's forgiveness, they would have lived their life in joy instead of wallowing in what happened decades ago. I am not for abortion, however, in a case such as rape, I would understand that choice. The author is clearly against abortion in any way, shape or form and that is her choice. However, she makes it sound factual that any woman who does have an abortion will suffer for the rest of her life. I know women who have had an abortion due to circumstances beyond their control and in so such way did they suffer for their entire life, nor should they. She also writes that there is a link between cancer and abortion. This is totally unfounded. The most reliable studies comes out of Denmark showing there is no connection at all. Other studies of women who have had abortions and later on breast cancer state that there MAY be a link, which is a far cry from what the author states. Ms. Rivers is pushing her own agenda in this book and if I were a woman who had an abortion (for my own PERSONAL reasons); then asked God for forgiveness and knew I was forgiven, I would find this book offensive. Besides this story being very unrealistic, it was judgemental and as Christians, ours is not to judge."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book was such a disappointment. I loved reading \\"Redeeming Love\\" by Mrs. Rivers; it was a very well written and a moving story. I thought I would love \\"Atonement Child\\" just as much, but it left me shaking my head. Dynah the heroine of the story was praying every second and it really seemed fake and boring. The whole story was not the way young college student's act or talk, even at Christian Colleges. I finished the story because I was sure it would become inspirational. Instead it left me shaking my head. The writing was very amateurish and not near the level Mrs. Rivers is capable of. Read \\"Redeeming Love\\" and miss \\"Atonement Child\\"."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"It was the best book I ever read I couldn't put it down. I tried to read other books before but failed I read this book and couldnt put it down. It was great!!!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I loved this book! Working at a crisis pregnancy center as well as knowing girls who have gone through this situation themselves, I thought the book was acurate. As a Christian I thought the struggles between, her and God were very accurate too. Being a Christian doesn't mean happy all the time, but through struggles we question God, we doubt, we hurt, yet we trust in God to answer those prayers and trust Him enough to go to him when we are hurting the most. I thought the book was greatly written and the characters portrayed great. Ethan is a real guy...I see all the time. Her roommate thinks she knows the best for her but doesn't. Her parents want the \\"best\\" for their daughter yet they forget to deal with their own feelings and past. It was very real and I loved the book!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I thought this was a good book. It was interesting and easy to read. It made you want to read on. However, Rivers doesn't always give an accurate representation of how abortion affects people or what abortion clinics are like or the people that work in them. She also makes a couple stereotypes in the book about pregnant teens. There is also stereotypes toward christian girls. That none of them sleep around or that they all come from great christian homes. I don't think this is always the case. I think Rivers is a very credible author. She is well known and has won many awards for her books. And particularly in this book she seems more credible because she has had an aboriton herself. I would recommend this book to woman of any age. Especially if your in the same situation. It really gives you a good christian perspective on things."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I believe this book is a good read for Christians and non-Christians alike. It gives you a glimpse inside the world of abortion, but it doesn't have a judgemental tone. And for Christians, it is an amazing testemant to a relationship with Christ instead of just having Sunday Morning religion. I started it yesterday and have only a few pages left. I can't put it down."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was very well written. I enjoyed both the factual part and the emotional-relationship part. The factual part about the link of abortion to cancer. The emotional-relationship part about Dynah losing her fiance due to her being raped. It's terrible that a tragedy had to happen to Dynah just to find out people's true colors. I could especially relate to this book because I too was raped and lost my boyfriend as a result of it. My ex-boyfriend and Ethan belong to the jerk club. Even though it was obvious that Joe cared for Dynah, I did not like the very end of the book (I don't want to ruin it for anybody who hasn't read it yet), but it should have been the other way around. After you read the book, you'll know what I'm talking about."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is my 4th Rivers novel, and I must say that I found it much less enjoyable than the other works I've read so far ( my favorite is Voice in the Wind). I found the characters unrealistic and unconvincing, especially Ethan, her harsh fiancee, and Janet, her insensitive, flaky roomate. Compared to Angel in Redeeming love, and Hadassah, Julia and Marcus in the Mark of the Lion trilogy, I found Dynah to be false and unrealistic. Being a 20-something myself, her realities and views of the world were naive and sheltered, making it difficult to relate to her. Certainly her struggles and pain would be potentially devastating, but the story developement was fast - too fast - leaving too little room for character involvement. To put it simply, when I put the book down in between reading, Dynah and her fellow characters completely left my mind until I picked it back up again. With Rivers' other novels I carry her people in my head even when I'm not reading.

Put this at the top of your list of books to read."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers is by far one of my favorite Christian novelists. I have read herMark of the Lion : A Voice in the Wind, An Echo in the Darkness, As Sure As the Dawn (Vol 1-3)series at least three times. It's phenomenal! And this summer I read, for the first time,Redeeming Love, an instant new favorite which I will likely read again and again. I didn't hesitate to buy The Atonement Child. She's a great author and I was confident I would like anything she wrote. I was wrong.This book centers on a young college student named Dynah. She's engaged to the campus hottie, who is studying to be a pastor. Life is wonderful until one night changes everything. On her way home from work, she is raped. She soon discovers she is pregnant as a result. The book twists and turns with the reactions of her friends and family members. What advice do they give? What decision will she make? Who will support her in that decision? Is an unborn life still valuable if it comes from such horrific beginnings? Can an abortion have lasting effects?I love the controversial topic of this book. The plot is fantastic, but the delivery leaves much to be desired. The dialog was trite. I often felt I was reading a very long crisis pregnancy pamphlet rather than a novel. Much of the book was predictable and several of the characters were poorly developed. Some seemed mere shadows rather than true characters with key parts in this story.Final Thoughts: Dissappointing. If you want more information on pro-life arguments, this is a good book to read. If you want to lose yourself in a novel, pick up one of her other books."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Have you ever read a book that when you weren't reading it consumed your thoughts - well maybe not \\"consumed\\" but you wished you could be reading it. That's the atonement child, and every other book I've read by Francine Rivers.Although the situation is one that I have been blessed to not have experienced, that did not take away from the lessons in this book. The joy and hope you feel while reading it. It shows just how Almighty God is, cause this book helped me through something I was going through in my own life, during that exact time.Rivers tackles a difficult subject in this book - abortion by itself is tough, but when a child is concieved as a result of rape - she stood up to the challange in this book! Every character in this book was developed well, you loved some, cried for others, and wished you could jump into the pages to knock some sense into others! I was taught patience in waiting on the Lord, cause all things will work for His good.It's an excellent read - it's about abortion, life, love, patience, peace, marriages, relationships, friendships... it'll apply to you!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Being a rape survivor, I had hoped to find some guidance, or at least a kindred spirit in the healing process. However, the rape is simply glossed over--it seems like merely a convenient tool the author used to get a perfect, sweet, innocent, virgin girl pregnant. She does not have recurring nightmares, does not panic at triggers (or even has any, from the looks of things), blame herself, or show any other sign of being affected by the rape other than an unwanted pregnancy and not wanting to admit it publicly. I'm hoping it was just sheer ignorance on the author's part; it would be highly disturbing if she truly thought rape was that easy to move on from, and quite honestly, I was a little insulted she didn't take the time to at least do some research on the after-effects of rape and the recovery process. Focusing on how evil abortion is made the story far too one-dimensional for my taste. The whole book reminded me of those sad little stories intense pro-lifers spout with intense detail in the hopes of grossing women out too much to have an abortion. It was like a pamphlet in novel form.I did love Joe, but only in a fantasy kind of way--it's nice to think of someone being secretly in love with you for the longest time, so much so that he would travel across the country looking for you and raise your rape child. But it is not realistic at all.Overall, a pretty big disappointment. The characters and situations were too black and white, and it confused me that God had very obvious English dialogue. It might just be for the ease of writing, but I've only heard of that happening to people with the gift of prophecy, which I have a hard time believing all the Christians in the book had. I would encourage the author to do a bit more research on both rape and abortion, not just watch Fox News and Google numbers from pro-life websites."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is not a new book, but it's one worth reviewing. I first read The Atonement Child in college, and its powerful message has remained with me ever since.The main character, Dynah, thought that her future was secure and perfect. In a moment, everything changed as a result of rape. This book details her journey through abandonment (family and fiance), the testing of her faith, and a new perspective on life. She is pressured to end the pregnancy, and the book does an excellent job of conveying the emotions that must take place when faced with a difficult decision.What impacted me the most was the portrayal of the Christians in Dynah's life and how they reacted to the tragedy. While I'd like to think that I would be supportive of her and do whatever I can to help her, I know that I'm not perfect and I would likely make presumptive judgments as well. It made me think about the ways that I approach situations and taught me to not make assumptions about people.The Atonement Child is powerful, and it is yet another masterful work by Francine Rivers. It is worth your time!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I had never read anything by Ms. Rivers before this book, even though she has come highly recommended from several friends. Having been burned before in the past by recommendations (and hundreds of dollars wasted), I was very thankful that Amazon Prime had this on their Kindle loaner list.That being said, I don't normally read Christian fiction, and the Christian fiction I have read has been painfully shallow and boring (Kingsbury) or phenomenal (Dekker). Since most of Ms. Rivers' works appear to be mainly of the chick-lit variety, I wasn't sure what to expect. It did start like I expected: pretty, innocent Dynah (obviously - what else would a future rape victim be named?) has a bright future ahead of her, what with an engagement to the campus dreamboat and stellar grades at a bubble-like Christian college. She loves God, she loves her family, she loves her man - everything's peachy. Then she gets raped.At first, Ms. Rivers did a great job highlighting exactly how devastating it was, without going into detail. But she really let the ball drop on the aftermath. I assumed it was because Dynah was so preoccupied with being pregnant and her less than stellar friends/fiance at school, but later, once Dynah leaves and moves on - she apparently also moved on from being brutally raped by a faceless stranger in the dark. There's really no mention of it again, except for a grimace here and there. While everyone copes with tragedy and brutality differently, even the most blessed of women would feel some sort of trauma. I wish Ms. Rivers would have delved into that more. It would have made for a deeper, if more painful, storyline.And from the first few pages, it was completely predictable, but Ms. Rivers did manage to suck me in. I think it was because I went to a Christian college very similar to NLC myself. Everyone liked to talk about forgiveness, and grace, and mercy - but once something like that actually happened, it was quickly swept under the rug and the girl (always, the girl) was quickly shunted out of school. Scholarships got lost, which was sometimes the only way these girls were going to school, and getting kicked out pretty much condemned them to a life of welfare and always fighting to claw your way out - if you don't give up completely, that is. I read Dynah's experience with her roommate, fiance, and school dean with horror, because I knew real people who were actually like that. It's what made the story real for me.I did enjoy Dynah's journey, and the fact that she herself didn't know what to do at first. Most people are so decided, one way or another, on the issue of abortion, but when you are assaulted from all sides about making the right choice, which doesn't seem right to you at all, it makes things immensely more difficult. Unfortunately, not all women have the luxury of just packing up and leaving whenever they want. While some stories work out for the best, others do end up in a darker place than Dynah's did. It made the story a little unrealistic, along with Joe's beta male stalking.I also could have done without the elderly lady group session, where all of them were surprisingly informed of abortion statistics. I myself am against abortion, but even this part of the story came off as preachy and heavy handed.All in all, there were parts I did enjoy, and parts that I had to grit my teeth through. Maybe I'm too cynical, who knows. I would recommend it if you aren't too averse to a predictable plot conveying a very anti-abortion message."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book was recommended to be by a friend. It's truly touching. A VERY strong Christian woman is raped and gets pregnant. THe book is about her making the decision on what to do with the baby- to keep it or abort.

Yes, it's intense material and an intense read.While she struggles with the decision of what to do and her faith, her family struggles and nearly falls apart in the process. This is a hard topic for anyone to discuss and while the novel itself is an excellent read (Rivers is by far one of my favorite authors), I was surprised to find out how close the issue was for the author. When asked which book has been the hardest to write and why, Rivers responded: \\"The Atonement Child was the most personal and difficult to write because I had to face my own abortion experience. Added to the considerable research I did, and women who shared their experiences with me, I went through an intensive post-traumatic stress Bible study for post-abortive women at our local pregnancy counseling center. Reliving all aspects of my abortion decision and experience was excruciating - but healing. After twenty-six years of being imprisoned by guilt and shame, I was free through the power and love of God. Though the book was the most heart-wrenching to write, it also proved to be the most life changing. I've received countless letters from other post-abortive women and have learned my experience is not unique. Our nation is filled with wounded men and women. The character of Hannah is based on my story, Doug is based on Rick's, and Evie is based on my mother's.\\"It's an incredible story that is beautifully written. It's honest and doesn't sugar coat how hard a situation like that would be. Whatever your thoughts are about abortion, I think its a story worth reading."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Briefly, this has been one of the most touching and inspiring books I have ever read. I think Rivers truly touched on the point of true faith. Dynah's (protagonist) journey taught me the significance of maintaining faith in God no matter the struggles and hardships. Additionally, we never really discover how deep our relationship with God is until we face the difficult times. His love is forgiving and unconditional and \\"The Atonement Child\\" is a testament of this. Thank you Francine Rivers for this blessing of a book. Five stars hands down."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Loved this book. Francine does a great job of backing up her book with scripture!

Francine Rivers is my favorite Christian author. Can't wait to read another book of hers!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers has always been one of my favorite writers, Christian or non-Christian.The Atonement Child follows Dynah Carey, a young woman who was raped by a stranger and became pregnant. She rejects the morning after pill offered to her by her doctor. She doesn't believe it's possible that she could become pregnant. She does, and her fiancee, unable to cope with what happened and the possible scandal surrounding it if people don't believe she was raped, leaves her. That makes room for another young man, who has always been interested in Dynah, to possibly win her affections. A multitude of twists pepper the story, like her mother and grandmother's guilt over their own abortion stories. When Dynah refuses to abort her unborn child - not easily, of course - that is when her mother and grandmother's guilt and stories come out.This is a beautiful story about the power of redemption. Our own redemption story can be found in it; Christ sacrificed everything to make sure we were saved, just like Dynah sacrificed everything in her life for her belief in life and Christ.Rivers communicates a powerful truth: God never leaves us nor abandons us, despite trouble and horrors that come upon us. Good comes out of the bad that happens to us, according to Romans: \\"God works all things out for the good of those who love Him.\\"God worked in Dynah's lives and the lives of her doting family, and he works in and through the lives of those who love Him as well as well."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Wednesday, June 13, 2012The Atonement ChildFrancine RiversImagine being forced into a sexual encounter one had no choice over.Imagine experiencing the consequences of another's choice as result of such a sexual encounter.Imagine having the choice of life and death in one's own hand.Francine Rivers twists these themes and dilemmas together in the Atonement Child. Choose life. When it seems overwhelming, just do the next right thing. Two wrongs never make a right. Most of all, this story is one of redemption.Now, imagine being a believer and assuming those around one where also Christ-like. Check your heart. When the testing comes, friends and family fail. People once noted for their Christ-like character are not what they seem and the unexpected steps in. All things work together for good, to give us a hope, a future, and build our character for the kingdom. Ms. Rivers assures readers: God's will will be accomplished. Thank you, Ms. Rivers, for the message of hope and courage found within these pages.My heart beats in agreement with Ms. Rivers on this issue. Courage like Dynah's is only received through Christ alone. Difficult decisions guide the plot; only God's hand can be trusted.

Again, thank you."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I have heard a lot about this book for years and wanted to read it but kept putting it off because I knew it was a weighty subject matter. Francine Rivers is an excellent writer and this book was next to impossible to put down!!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I knew what I was getting into when I picked up The Atonement Child. I'd read it years ago, but I forgot how challenging and convicting its message could be.In this story, Francine Rivers tackles the issue of pregnancy as a result of rape and whether it's okay, from a Christian worldview, to abort a baby conceived in that way. Emergency contraception, abortion, rape ... these are highly provocative issues, and few people ride a middle-of-the-road line on them. What I appreciate about this book is, even though it's fiction, it takes these issues from a hypothetical and puts them in the context of believable circumstances. And it made me wonder how my beliefs would hold up to such a trial. What would I do if faced with a situation like this, for me or someone in my family? Would I stand for life? Or would I look for a way out of a tough situation?Rivers doesn't handle these issues lightly nor does she paint the decisions characters make as easy ones. What results is inspiration and encouragement.Rivers' books are precious gems among Christian fiction. Her stories are hard to put down, and they aren't \\"oh that's nice\\" kind of stories. They tackle hard issues and force readers to think about their faith and how they live it out.I'm excited for the re-release of this book, hoping a whole new generation of readers discover Francine Rivers."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers just cannot write a bad book, this one is as fabulous as all the others. Heartwrenching, eye opening, full of encouragement. The Atonement Child deals with a sensitive issue and Francine handles it beautifully.A baby conceived of rape, an abortion, more than one generation effected, this book shows the baby is not the only victim. It sheds light on a controversy that plagues people today.This is not an easy read and it gives plenty of food for thought."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much! I highly recommend it to anyone. It's about the sensitive subject of abortion - a young woman is pressured on pretty much all sides to abort her child who was conceived under far less than ideal circumstances."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Although not my favorite Francine Rivers book I still had to give it a top rating. It's difficult to read at times because of the subject matter but nonetheless tells a compelling story about a woman's choices along with the obstacles she faces throughout her journey.

Francine Rivers does an excellent job of addressing a difficult subject in a realistic manner, facing the issues that one would encounter in life. I love the way she incorporates faith in Christ!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone. It really opens your eyes to how God views abortion. It is hard to put down. It is a very nonjudgemental book. No matter your position or thoughts on the subject you read this book to the end and wish there was more."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was my first Francine Rivers book, The Atonement Child, and I have two more to read: Redeeming Love and The Scarlet Thread. My friends told me to read Redeeming Love first. I started with The Atonement Child. I loved the book but was a little confused when it kept changing from current times to the journey in the wagon and readings from the journal. It was still very enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I am a big fan of several other Francine Rivers books, but this one was a total disappointment.Ms. River's own bias comes through very quickly in the book, preventing her from treating the subject of abortion as a complex personal decision and the subject of rape is glossed over as if it really is not an important factor in the plot. Because of the author's bias she never really deals with both sides of the issue in a realistic way. Within the first few chapters it becomes predictable and clearly judgemental. This book could actually be hurtful to a woman who had experienced such a situation.The characters are one-dimensional and quickly portrayed as perfect or evil depending on their stance on abortion.This is a soap-box book and nothing more. It is certainly lacking the quality of her other books."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"In this book, Dynah is a young woman who's brutally raped one night on her way home from work. The rape, however, is not the main focus of the book; her decision about whether to get an abortion once she finds out she's pregnant is. In fact, the rape itself, which I'm glad that many before me have pointed out, is pretty much brushed aside as soon as Dynah finds out she's pregnant. In fact, Rivers seems in such a hurry to get to the abortion issue, she doesn't even get some of her facts right; for instance, she gives Dynah a male doctor for the rape exam and describes the exam itself as really painful. If she had really researched this issue, she would have found that hospitals always provide female doctors and nurses for female rape victims and the exams are as painless as possible so the patients will not have flashbacks. To her credit, she does focus on many of the issues Dynah faces with friends, family, and a love interest after the rape, but she sometimes gets too holy inspite of the import of the book's message. And what's with all the male people Dynah turns to? The rape doctor is a man, she goes to HIM again to see if she's pregnant, the person she confides in the most is a guy, and then she asks a male doctor to deliver the baby, for cripe's sake. Plus, I don't think there's anything wrong with after-morning pills, and Rivers does; she even had Dynah say, when she finally realized abortion was killing a baby, that, \\"I knew the truth before; I think I've known it ever since I was concieved.\\" Oh for crying out loud; like she had pro-life values even then? After the horrendous ordeal Dynah went through, could you truly blame her if she'd chosen not to have it by taking a pill the same night she was raped? Try to imagine how it would feel to carry something a stranger placed inside you against your will. Whether you even believe those pills are bad or not, folks, you should at least respect what rape victims go through.As for the over-holiness I mentioned: other than Dynah's ridiculous claim that she's been pro-life since she was a zygote, there's the repulsive Calvinism Rivers slipped in, however briefly; when demanding of God why all this happened to her, Rivers writes God as giving Dynah an imbecile response: \\"I HAVE TORN SO I MAY HEAL.\\" My response to that? B.S. Don't you ever tell me God tears our souls apart with evil and nasty doings just to make a big show of winning us over again; how dare Rivers say this! Then there's Dynah's unrealistic and faux-saintly words about the rapist: \\"I consider him a child of wrath who didn't know better. He's hurt me, oh, more than he'll ever know, but it was mostly physical.\\" PHYSICAL? The shame, doubt, terror, anxiety, loss of sleep, and turmoil she went through because of that jerk was NOT physical; Rivers, you bite your darn tongue. He was a monster and needed to be punished as such.This forgiving attitude of Dynah's occured after she made the sudden return to God and regained her faith. Fine, but dismissing the rapist is unrealistic and wrong; and the sudden utter contentment with which she rubbed her stomach, glowing with satisfaction at being pregnant and quoting sentiments about God, is totally flat and ridiculous. It should have been edited, and clarified that this peace of hers happened a realistic time after her last near breakdown. And explain her feelings a bit; she was advanced in her pregnancy, so it would be nice to have read something from her, or Rivers' lips, explaining how she'd come to love the baby since she could feel it all the time now, that this and God's guidance had been a steady thing that brought her to her contentment in the pregnancy; NOT that she was terminally unhappy, then had a conversation with God above crashing surf and ten minutes later went from fearing to loving the baby's movements. It is not that simple; I certainly believe she could have had peace by that time in her pregnancy, and very much that God was the author of it, but the rapid timing was just clumsy. Rivers, could you please recall that you're trying to write reality and not some simplistic political statement?Lastly, Dynah says her cause for doubt was caused by being tossed about by her emotions for several months. To which her friend replies, \\"No wonder.\\" And she says, \\"Don't make excuses for me; the world's done that enough.\\" Right, like the whole freakin' world has been telling her to abort, like it was an EXCUSE to admit that she'd been naturally, VERY naturally, utterly torn by feelings. What a bad, unChristian girl; for cripe's sake. After that self-flaggelating statement, her friend just stares at this ridiculously sudden occurence of peace in her and admires her. Then, there's the giving-birth scene, with God's in all-caps Voice shrieking Scripture into both Dynah and the doctor's heads as she pushes. Every other sentence during the birth is, at one point, God's Voice dictating. Enough is enough, Rivers. Give me more reality next time, please; you were doing great, being brilliantly open and considerate of Dynah's feelings and everyone else's, until she decided to keep the baby. It's not all calmness after that.Rivers is a wonderful writer, but I didn't like a lot of her approach here. Rivers says at one point in the end of the book that she talked with women who suffered from abortion, but it's pretty clear she has little experience in the mind of rape survivors, even those who trust God. Women should be allowed to recover properly from rape, but a baby would make this considerably hard and a miraculous recovery and speedy happy ending like the one Dynah experienced is very unlikely."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Dynah is a young woman who is attending a Christian college when she is brutally raped. When she discovers that she is pregnant, she finds little support from her fiance, her family, or her college and she is pressured by many of them to have an abortion. There is no doubt where Francine Rivers stands on the subject of abortion. She is squarely against it and she uses everything in her writing arsenal to put across that point. Even while agreeing with her viewpoint, I feel that she has not done the topic justice in this book. The plot is very predictable from the very beginning and the characters are one-dimensional. It seems as if every woman in the book has had an abortion at one time or another and that is not realistic. There are several questions left unanswered at the end of the book. Who will take care of Dynah's grandmother? How much support will Dynah receive from her father? How will Joe finish his education? If you want to read better Francine Rivers books, I recommend her Women of the Bible series."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was my first Francine Rivers book, and believe me, I thought I would NEVER get to anything happy and bearable...I found myself angry at all the &quot;good&quot; people who turned against the victim.....maybe I was looking for relaxation and got too much contemplation!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"There is only one good thing about this book, and that's why I'm giving it two stars. I'll talk about the good first.The book talks about cancer facts linked to abortion, and the book seems to be anti-abortion. It was good to hear about the cancer facts. I've heard people say \\"Women who have abortions always have some type of GYN issues\\". Even if they don't necessarily have cancer, they always seem to have something, whether it be fibroids, endometriosis, etc. I personally know people who have had abortions, and every one of them had either cancer, fibroids, endometriosis, or all three. They all ended up having to have a hysterectomy. My friend who is both a pastor's wife and a nurse knows both from counseling women and from her work as a nurse - she said the same thing: \\"Women who have had abortions always have some type of issue\\". Abortions obviously cause medical problems.We haven't gotten into the emotional/psychological effects that abortions can have on women. They can have emotional problems as well as the medical problems. My pastor's wife/nurse friend said \\"The medical/physical effects that abortions have on the women I've seen is nothing compared to the emotional effects\\".And anyway, who are we to kill God's babies, and to destroy His Handiwork?That's the good in the book.Now the bad.I didn't really see this book as a \\"Christian\\" book. The characters, to me, were very selfish, arrogant, and prideful.Dynah's parents for example. They were so prideful and arrogant, they did not want their daughter to have a baby out of wedlock, even if she was a rape victim. And they were so afraid that the baby might be black - they did not want a black grandchild. Who cares what society thinks? Why not care about your daughter and your unborn grandchild? How selfish, arrogant, and prideful.Ethan. The future preacher. I hope I never end up going to his church. How arrogant and prideful he was. He didn't want his bride pregnant at the wedding. Who cares about the wedding? You need to care about your fiance and her unborn child. (I know that Ethan is a jerk for a reason - to make the book good. So it is okay for Ethan to be a jerk. But it is not okay for Dynah and her parents to be a jerk, because I think they are suppose to look like good people.)Dynah herself. She is the most selfish person ever. She did right by not having an abortion, but I feel she did it for selfish reasons. Which, it is good that she did not kill her baby, even if it was for selfish reasons. But I just felt she was a selfish person all around. For example, she did not even give Ethan a chance to recover from the shock. Yes, Ethan was a jerk. But, you've got to be honest, most men would have been the same way, at least initially, until they've had a chance to get over the shock. Dynah expected him to be all understanding without a shock factor. If she had of let it sink in, he might have eventually become more compassionate. And I felt she was really selfish and wrong when she asked a man to marry her so that she wouldn't be a single parent. Oh, she was worried about being a single parent - she even mentioned it. How arrogant and prideful. I see Dynah as a bratty girl who always gets her way. And she doesn't care whose toes she steps on to do it. Selfish, prideful, arrogant. I think it's more Christian to be a single parent than it is to ask a man to marry you. Christ is the head of the church, and the husband is the head of the wife. But Dynah is head of it all. I despise Dynah with a passion. Her getting raped made her true colors come through. It showed what type of person she really is. She is too arrogant and prideful to be a single parent, so she asks a man to marry her. I do not see her or her parents as Christians. True Christians are selfless, and they lack in arrogance and pride.I was really disappointed in this book. I felt it did not deliver a good message, other than the cancer facts. I felt it delivered a message that a person should be arrogant and selfish and prideful (and should not be a single parent). To me, that is not being Christian. I feel it is also sending a message to girls that it is okay to ask a man to marry you. Just because Dynah had a pushover who said yes doesn't mean you will. I will not serve pride and arrogance. I will serve the Lord. Even if it means having a baby out of wedlock if I am a rape victim."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Wonderful read. Very touching and I feel it is a good book for teen girls. Nicely written for such a tough subject."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I finished this book only because it was a selection of my book club. Frankly I did not care what happened to any of these people (as if I couldn't figure it out for myself by a quarter of the way through it). The dialogue was stilted and preachy, the characters were threadbare. I thought the book was very poorly written--something I would read from a high school student. One dimensional characters. Just awful."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I love Francine Rivers' books. However, this one, besides being my least favorite, made me stop reading her for a time. Unlike her other books which focus on the glory and power of God, this one is largely about the evil of abortion. And while not all of the Christian people are pure good (the Christian school forcing her to either announce her rape or leave) the ones who are strictly against abortion are pure good. By contrast the pro-choice people are just morally disgusting humans. I found this to be a little heavy-handed, not to mention unrealistic. God takes a backseat to Ms. Rivers' stance on abortion in this book and the result comes off as self-righteous and judgemental. I was keenly disappointed."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I love Francine Rivers' books. I just recently finished the 'Mark of the Lion' series. I thought it was an awesome series. But 'The Atonement Child' was a let down. It was hard to keep my mind focused on what was happening. I thought it a little bizarre that a person who 'claims' to be a Christian, would even bring up the subject of having an abortion. I didn't think it realistic that everyone around Dynah, had an abortion, or had a part in one. It was okay, but definetly not one of her best books."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book really disappointed me. I agree with the reader who said it seemed like every woman in the book had had an abortion. I also really didn't like Dynah all that much. She was a shallow character, and the whole time I read I kept thinking about how stupid she was for waiting so long to make her decision (like not getting the morning after pill) then waiting 6 months to see a doctor for prenatal care. Just because she didn't get the abortion doesn't mean she took care of her baby in her womb. It just seemed like I kept waiting for her to stand up for herself and she never did. She just remained frail and kept running away from everyone. Is that how Rivers wants women to be? Maybe I've just known people who have kept babies who thought they did it because it was the right thing and they cared for it. They didn't need to be self righteous about it like Dynah was."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was my first Francine Rivers book and, by this book alone, I think she is my favorite author. The emotions of the characters (especially Hannah and Doug) come across as raw and utterly realistic. The author really made the reader feel what the characters were going through. There were so many deep statements hidden within the pages that I'd have to say it's not an easy read, but well worth it. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book is wonderful. A very moving story. I recommend everyone tweenies and up to read it!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Thank you, Francine Rivers for having the courage to write such an eloquent story of one of the most controversial issues of our day. Personally, I think this book was divinely inspired and it made me take a deeper look at my own stance against abortion. I highly recommend this book as a must read."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Another fantastic book by Francine Rivers. This book makes you redefine your belief system on the controversial topic of abortion and why you believe as you do. This is one of the those books I will never forget and the impact it has on my spirituality."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers is a phenomenal writer. She has a way of intriguing her reader somehow by relating the character to the reader. I haven't figured out how she does it, but it's good. I went to a private christian univeristy, which is the setting of this book, and loved this book. I felt as though Rivers hit a lot of taboo subjects right on the head. I'm amazed at how she is able to express things that you don't think others notice in life but are a reality. This story is sweet and has a healthy dose of reality. It is not as heart gripping as \\"Redeeming Love\\", but it has its own taste that is still satisfying. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is a must read. It is a difficult subject but denying it does not help the problem any. We need to stand firm and pray!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I could hardly put this down, it was a great book. I thouroughly enjoyed it. I can't imagine how difficult this situation might be. I admire the author for having the courage to write about this, and to write it so well."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"It took me all of a day and a half to read this book. This book is so powerful and inspiring, you will immediately want to recommend it to any and everyone. Not only does this book send a powerful pro-life message, it also makes you realize how easy it can be to have an intimate relationship with God. The way Dynah continually spoke to our Father and listened to Him when she was seeking His guidance inspired me. I now find myself doing the same thing more and more often. In addition, you can see the many ways that God can and will work in our lives if we just allow Him."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers has done it again! I picked up this book almost 4 years ago and finished it in one sitting! I reread it 2 weeks ago and got even more out of the story. The story primarily focuses on a young Christian women in college, who got raped when she was walking home from work. Her fiancee does not know how to relate to her anymore and she is feeling pressure from several sides to have an abortion... something she feels strongly against. The book goes through her walk and has a surprise ending. You will LOVE it!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was the first book of Ms. Rivers that I red and it got me hooked! I absolutely couldn't put it down!!! I laughed &amp;I cried. It stired so much emotion I really could empathise with the characters of the book. I highly recomment."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is my 4th Rivers novel, and I must say that I found it much less enjoyable than the other works I've read so far ( my favorite is Voice in the Wind). I found the characters unrealistic and unconvincing, especially Ethan, her harsh fiancee, and Janet, her insensitive, flaky roomate. Compared to Angel in Redeeming love, and Hadassah, Julia and Marcus in the Mark of the Lion trilogy, I found Dynah to be false and unrealistic. Being a 20-something myself, her realities and views of the world were naive and sheltered, making it difficult to relate to her. Certainly her struggles and pain would be potentially devastating, but the story developement was fast - too fast - leaving too little room for character involvement. To put it simply, when I put the book down in between reading, Dynah and her fellow characters completely left my mind until I picked it back up again. With Rivers' other novels I carry her people in my head even when I'm not reading. I love Francine Rivers' novels and plan to read all that I can get my hands on, but was truly disappointed in this one."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Dynah Carey, a college student and devoted Christian, finds her world falling apart after she is raped and made pregnant by an unknown assailant. Her fianc&eacute; now sees her as damaged goods and breaks off their engagement, while the college president, seeking to uphold the school's \\"abstinence-only\\" policy, asks her to publicly recount her trauma to prove her innocence, or drop out of school. Her parents' relationship is torn asunder as her father insists that she have an abortion, while her mother warns her of the consequences. Dynah uses her unshakeable faith as a way to channel her anguish and eventually find peace as she struggles to make her decision. Although Rivers provides a strong argument for the pro-life stance, her tale of faith and endurance fails on a literary level by its author's crippling lack of subtlety. As Dynah makes her lonesome journey, temptation comes in the form of an overwhelming barrage of abortion-recipients, (her own mother and grandmother included), all of whom deliver conflicting advice. The reader can even predict who will step forward next and confess by the way the prose builds up. The story also suffers from a complete lack of middle ground. Everything is black and white, cut and dry: pro-lifers are good, clean, pious folks whilst pro-choicers are greedy, abuse their children, and all but foam at the mouth. All political views aside, although the publisher claims this story is \\"balanced,\\" this reviewer can think of no word further from the truth."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"... this novel presents various aspects of the decision to have an abortion, or to not have an abortion, and the after-effects of that decision with delicacy and compassion. This is perhaps the first in-depth, abortion decison piece I have ever read that focuses a great, great, deal on the person carrying the child - the WOMAN! In one passage of the book, one life-long supporter of pro-life causes says she is withdrawing her support of the cause because too many focus on the baby and completely ignore the woman carrying the baby. *This is a key passage in this book, as it illustrates that this is not as much a book about the life of an unborn child, as it is about the hard choices and frightening life of a single-mother carrying a child.The only thing that made me squirm a bit (as a life-long believer that abortion should not be made completely illegal), is the suggestion in parts of the book that the pro-choice movement is a money-driven one, and abortion clinics exist mostly for capitalistic purposes.But regardless... If you are looking for a well-written novel that explores one single woman's choices regarding her unborn child, AND if you are able to keep an open mind, I highly suggest this book. It was entirely different than I thought it would be."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Great book; should be a must read for all young girls and the parents of children who are pregnant and not married. Gives a great message of how the road of christianity is not easy."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"this book is an almost perfect example of the kind of trauma that trying times put us through. It remnds me that even in the midst of every storm, God never leaves us He still cares. Also shows that with Him, the fire doesnt burn, but refinesA truly beautiful book abou God's grace"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I know that many people will disagree with my review but it is the truth of how I feel about this book.I only read it because it is the book of the month for a Bookclub I am involved in and did read it all - but, only so I could honestly say I've read it and not made a judgement on just a part of the story.It is incredibly preachy and I do not, for one moment believe that God uses our families to bring judgement on us for past sins or mistakes we have made. Our relationship with the Lord is a personal, one-on-one relationship.No, I have not ever had an abortion but do know some women who have and know their pain and regret."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"One of the BEST books ever written about the abortion issue. Francine Rivers masterfully and sensitively examines the topic from just about every possible angle. Having been involved in the pro-life movement for decades, I have seen many sides of the abortion debate. I have read many books. This is the most outstanding. Buy it for teens, adults--anyone you care about. Whether staunch pro-lifers, \\"pro-choice,\\" or undecided on the issue, ATONEMENT CHILD will give them plenty of food for thought. We read this novel in a book club I facilitated, and all the ladies loved it! Discussion questions at the back make it a powerful tool to assign in an ethics class or other church and educational venues. Gotta get it folks! Then try out her other powerful novels, as well."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This novel about a young lady in college who had everything in her life,togeather, her handome and adoring fiance, her college life, her job and her faith which had a sudden down turn. She was raped. Out of this rape she became pregnant. She is faced with the choice of abortion because of horrible circumstances. Will she continue to trust God and grow in her faith through this emotinal turmoil? I found Atonement Child, awsome. In a world of today with low morals and freedom of sins, this book plays a great role. Seeing as rape and abortion is a huge issue today, This book fits right in! Being in highschool or and having abortion as a simple solution given as an option for any mistake you would call it, shows how low we have become to justify our low moral living. In these circumstances of rape, we try to justify even more! But what right do we have to control life? Who is to say who dies or lives? This is a silent holocast that is treated lightly in our days.These questions are addresed in this book. This is where God Comes in! He is the master and controller of all life? This book shows how important one piece of tissue as some would say, but a real child is to God. This book shows how important a little one is to God no matter the circumstances that one is concieved in!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I've read this book 3 times, and every time I put the book down, I was crying. (and I'm not the emotional type!) It's a story about real issues, (rape, abortion, single parenthood) and I think Ms.Rivers did an awesome job portraying the characters in a realistic way. I'm glad that Ms.Rivers had the courage to write a story about this, because I'm sure other people didn't. Being in my late teens, I can identify with the characters, and love them! It's a beautiful love story of how Jesus Christ really does love us, even though we doubt him when we go through trials. Read it! You'll get a blessing!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Having seen too many women come to the Emergency Department after a rape, this book takes the reader into the minds of ALL the victims- the victim herself, the boyfriend, the parents and many others. The reactions are so real and raw. I was particularly impressed by the author's handling of the &quot;Christian&quot; mind set- it was, unfortunately, so right on."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"THE ATONEMENT CHILD review, by NicThe Atonement Child, by Francine Rivers, tells the story of Dynah, a young college student, who has lived a somewhat sheltered life until she is raped and finds herself pregnant.I enjoyed this book. It deals with serious issues on rape, abortion, and forgiveness--among other things. It is an easy read that can be completed in one or two sittings.I have read other Francine Rivers books that I liked better, but that doesn't mean this one wasn't enjoyable. I would have liked a little more suspense though, because the outcome is somewhat predictable."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I couldn't put it down. I am anxious to read other books by Francine Rivers."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book seemed unrealistic to me. Dynah is violently raped by a stranger at night in the park and she never saw his face during the attack. She's not on any type of birth control and REFUSES to take any medication prescribed by the doctor to prevent pregnancy. Her so called \\"christian\\" parents demand her to have an abortion...especially the father. Her parents are continually arguing and screaming at each other and contemplate getting a divorce. Everyone Dynah knows has had some type of experience with abortion in their past. Dynah has a difficult time deciding the right decision..abortion or not.She was violently beaten and raped by a man she never saw. What woman would refuse to take the medication to prevent the pregnancy in the first place? Dynah's decision and the ending of the story seemed really unrealistic.Which is worse rape or abortion? This book condemned abortion and didn't speak much about the violent rape that occurred."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"My friend had loaned me this book and I was excited to see the topic. I've always struggled with the pro-life stance when you look at it from the perspective of rape. The plot for this book is wonderful, but I felt that it missed something throughout the entire book. I kept thinking that the supporting characters were not believable. Every single person she came across seems to have a history with abortion and you get a new story from each of these characters. It was just too unbelievable for me. So, the story itself is was not strong, but it was interesting to see the side affects that women have after having an abortion. I had never thought about that before reading the book. Not sure if I'd recommend this one if you are looking for a good book to read. If you are interested in the pro-life and pro-choice debate, I would recommend Atonement Child."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"As a fan of Francine Rivers' Biblical fiction, I hate to write anything less than complimentary but I have to say honestly this is not her best work. It seems like every other character in the book has had an abortion. I can think of other ways to drive home the point that abortion is a devastating experience other than having multiple characters disclosing their own personal stories about the exact same thing over and over again throughout the plot. The book was overall engaging, but a bit tiresome."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Atonement Child is my favorite book. I think the author portrayed the hidden feelings of so many young girls caught in similiar situations as the girl focused on in this book. This book is for the young and old. It shows the struggles a young woman goes through when she is raped and then pregnant. The story is real, and it will totally open your eyes."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I was very touched reading this book... for the second time. I love that it shows that no one has to be a victim, that God can carry us through anything... that He is faithful, even when we are faithless - because He can not deny Himself. I became connected to the characters, I felt their emotions with them... I felt emotions against some. In other words, this writing really drew me in, it was written wonderfully.God's love is strong and powerful, and He is able to birth us all through the fire it we're willing."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"If you haven't read this book, you are in for an outstanding read. I couldn't put this book down. Francine Rivers approach to the abortion issue is right on the money. I have passed this book to many of my friends and all have loved it and been changed by it."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Wow. I don't even know where to begin. This book was absolutely breathtaking. Francine Rivers took one of the most difficult topics and made it into a beatiful love story. Not just a love story between a man and a women and a mother and a child, but a love story about God's undying love and if we trust in him he will guide us every bit of the way.I am absolutely in love with this book. Even though this books has difficult issues you are able to feel the Dynah's inner peace amongst all the termoil. Everything this young girl goes through is unbelievable, but with God's love and guidance she is able to lead others to deal with their past and begin to heal."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I have to say that I fell in love with this book. At first I thought that the characters were a bit shallow, but then I realized that this was not just a story about Dynah. It was more a story of sin being passed through the generations. River's took a multifaceted look at abortion, presenting the different reasons women turn to it. In all situations abortion seems to be the best and easiest way out, but the characters show that there are many lasting consequences that may not be apparent beforehand. I loved this story, and highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I can only imagine what a difficult book this was to write! This is such a heart-wrenching issue, and is a favorite argument of pro-choicers. Though I knew how it would have to end, I couldn't stop reading to find out just how this would be accomplished. I found myself crying over Dynah's pain. I could just feel so much sympathy for her. The issue was dealt with very well. It wasn't graphic, but it didn't back off from the message either. Praise to Francine Rivers for have the courage to write about such a difficult issue.If you enjoyed this, you will probably also enjoy Redeeming Love by the same author. Ms Rivers is wonderful at handling difficult issues, and while her books are \\"grittier\\" than most Christian fiction, I think it was necessary, in keeping with the tone of her books. I am not even a very big fan of Christian fiction, but I will read anything written by Francine Rivers."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I love to read and have read The Atonement Child twice. It's one of the most profoundly touching yet wrenching stories,I've ever read. The character development is beautiful, and Dynah is such a real and beautiful character. I love the way it highlights God's incrdible love and care. It also brings you inside the hearts of the more undesireable characters, making them real people instead of &quot;bad-guy&quot; monsters. No review I could write can do justice in describing this book, but I highly reccomend it as a simply incredible, healing story. Also gripping and entertaining. One of my favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I recieved this book as a Christmas present because I'd seen it in a bookstore and it intrigued me, so I requested it.My family certainly regretted it! I ignored all of them Christmas day, becaue I was completely wrapped up in this story of Dynah and her brutal rape. The characters were fantastically believable, and the situation they find themselves in is incredibly real. Readers will find themselves indignantly scolding all the characters that betray Dynah. The pace never slows, and Francine Rivers grabs you and will not let you go.Dynah's inner conflict as she struggles with the decision of whether or not to abort her unexpected child is utterly palpable, and her face-to-face encounter with the Creator is spell-binding.You will not come out of this book unchanged. And if you happen to support abortion, I, as a born-again Christian, challenge you to read this book and still come out supporting it.This story is about the redemption only available through Christ, and it's a fascinating read. I recommend it to anyone who has ever sinned. (And that's everyone.)"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is the third book I've read by Francine Rivers and she is fast becoming a favorite author of mine. All three books dealt with various topics but all were well written and thought provoking. The Atonement Child deals with a controversial subject in today's world - abortion. I found myself caught up in Dynahs story and her predictament. In the beginning of the story, she had everything a girl could want....an engagement to a promising young man; a normal, loving family (or so it seems). But tragedy strikes and Dynah's world is turned upside down. The people who were strong influences in her life now disappoint her. Throughout her ordeal Dynah stays strong in her faith, focusing on God, His Love and His Word. I found myself wondering if I could stay as strong as Dynah, or would I have given in to what others in my life suggested be done. This book challenges you and makes you think about choices and about the unborn truly being REAL. What a moving story this was. This is a book I will highly recommend to others!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I was encouraged by a co-worker to pick up a copy of Francine Rivers' book &quot; The Last Sin Eater &quot;. After I read that book, I searched on the net and came across this book. It had a catchy title so I thought, why not. I started this book and absolutely could not put it down until I finished it. I am not what you would call an avid reader, but this book is so well written, you just feel the pain of Dynah when she goes through all of the ordeals of being raped and finding out she is pregnant. She has so many people trying to tell her what to do. You would be surprised at who they are and what they are telling her. She only has to realize what God's plan is for her life, and who her real friends are. This book keeps you on the edge consistently throughout, from the first page to the last. It will make you think the next time you say &quot;I don't know what God wants me to do in a certain situation&quot;. I highly recommend this book for christians and non-christians alike."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"i love francine rivers. each of her books touch me in a special, sneaky way. after reading other reviews, i am compelled to say that i think the sensitivity of the issue kept people from giving a fair evaluation of her writing: if nothing else, ms. rivers is one of the most skillful writers i have ever read. her characters are anything but simple--the complexities are just more subtle than in less-talented writing. you have to think about them a bit more, and wonder about them. i didn't think ethan came out as a horrible human being at all--rivers has too much understanding of the human soul to portray him that way, and i sensed pain beneath his hardened (and annoying) attitude.i will have to agree and say the issue of rape was not treated realistically enough, which is why i docked a star. it just seemed to vanish after it happened, which i know is not the way it happens in real life. it's something a victim will struggle with for years afterward.in response to other reviews:1. for those of you who think ms. rivers doesn't know what she's talking about, consider in your evaluation the fact that she has herself had an abortion, before she became a christian (also remember this happened in adulthood, so she has more understanding of non-christians, pro-choice, etc than you give her credit for).2. for those who think it unusual that it seemed like all the women around dynah had an abortion, consider the idea that this was purposeful and for a point: there was a legacy of abortion in dynah's family, and her choice was how she would deal with it--break it or succumb to it. that was the point."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Ms. Rivers' book helped me in a way that I couldn't have imagined when I started reading it. She took a very controversial issue and shed some light on the subject of rape and abortion. The one thing I enjoyed is that she didn't make all of the Christians look too holy or above everyone else. She wrote this wonderful book with the intent to include non-Christian readers. I highly recommend both pro-life and pro-choice people to read this story about the decisions young women have to face every day across America."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"When my friend recommended the book to me I wasn't interested at first because of the subject matter (rape and abortion), yet when I began reading it I couldn't put it down. The characters were portrayed very well and this impacted me deeply. I felt like I got to know Dinah through all of her pain and I found myself thinking about her for ages after I finished reading the book. I'm so glad that a very controversial subject was handled so openly and I found myself having to really search myself on the issue of abortion. Half way through the book I sat and cried. I learned through this book that no matter what life throws at us, God's Word stands. As a Christian I know that abortion is not God's will, yet I was unsure as to why. Dinah's baby was not some monsters kid, she was a child of God and precious in his sight. I was very moved by the book and would recommend it. Be prepared to be challenged!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"In a word . . . amazing. This book was incredible to read, not only because of the vivid and touching characters, but also because I think this book reaches out to both Christians and non-Christians. In today's world, abortion has become such a natural part of living and Francine Rivers does an amazing job of letting us know, through her words and characters, about both sides of the issue while being a part of the story. Dynah is such an incredible character - she had a perfect life set out for her, but after her traumatizing ordeal, she finds out who she really is as a person. Her faith was tested in so many ways and this book went a long way in showing you that no matter how much tragedy happens in your life, God is so much stronger than anything you have to face and He will always be guiding you. And along with Dynah, I fell in love with Joe as well. Who wouldn't? He's sweet, charming and incredibly loyal. This is a book that I know I will read over and over again, and I know others will feel the same way."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and still remember it quite well. The beginning was hard to wade through (Dynah's life sounds so perfect, wonderful, and sheltered, that even if you hadn't read the back, you know that disaster will soon strike her life!), but after that it got better. I especially appreciated the way the hypocrisy of her college was pinpointed; being commited to purity is good, but I've seen far too many Christian organizations follow the letter of this law to such an extreme that they forget the point. I also loved watching the way Dynah struggled with her situation, and the different phases she went through. Her commitment to making her own decision rather than giving in against her will to what others wanted for her showed remarkable courage, especially considering the sheltered, nearly conflict-free life she had led before her rape. She is definitely an admirable heroine."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"One of the most outstanding Francine Rivers books yet. Only with God's divine guidance could an author so perfectly capture such a heavy, complex issue with a wonderful entertaining story intertwined with solid Bible truths. Absolutely a must-read."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book is amazing. I was in tears only pages on. Francine Rivers is an amazing author and I would recommend any of her books to everyone."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers is a GREAT author of many books and God is clearly using her talent to reach women, of all ages, who have traveled varying bumpy roads on this journey called life. \\"The Atonement Child\\" addresses the issue of abortion in a gentle, understanding way without judging the women for the choices they had made in their pasts. I would recommend this book to all women because even if we've not experienced an abortion ourselves, we all know women who have and we can learn how to lovingly minister to those women without needlessly wounding them, in the name of God.

As a Christian, I appreciate how she uses the problems we face in day to day life without taking away from the hurt and pain certain circumstances cause, yet she also shows how our great and mighty Lord can use all things for our good. Sometimes it just takes time before we are able to see or understand how any good can come from where we are and what we're dealing with."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is a life changing book and everyone should read it.

Francine handles the issue of abortion through her gift of story, and she does it without being heavy-handed or preachy.The characters are well-developed and the story flows well.

She was able to show some of the things that people don't often bring to light such as the perspective of an abortion doctor.

Her faith begins to falter and she begins to doubt God's grace and love. Can she find the understanding she seeks? Will forgiveness fill her broken heart?The author pens an unforgettable journey of realistic proportions. Heartbreak, indecision, grace and love fill the pages of this memorable novel. Original, believable and interesting characters with fitting storyline and plot will keep you reading. Her stories never disappoint, guaranteeing the reader an entertaining and hard to put down book. Loved the ending. I will recommend this very well written novel to others."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I didn't exactly know what I was getting into when I picked up The Atonement Child, by Francine Rivers. I had read the book description, and it was one of a few titles I put on hold at the library. I didn't remember what it was about when I started it, but very shortly into the book I flipped it over to read the back cover again.You start off being introduced to a very likable Dynah Carey. She's compassionate, working with the elderly, a student at a Bible college, engaged to the man of her dreams, and just sweet and wonderful to everyone.On her way back to the dorm from work, she is raped. And her perfect life is shattered. As is fairly obvious from the cover, it turns out she is pregnant.And without getting into spoilers, the story is about how all the people in her life respond to the rape and to the pregnancy, and how she responds as well.It took me about the first quarter of the book before I started to really get into it, but at that point I was hooked. The pacing was good, and so many of the flat, two-dimensional characters were fleshed out as you went. The only place I struggled was towards the end, when Dynah's grandmother is having a get-together with a bunch of her widowed friends and they start discussing abortion. That section dragged and felt a little forced. And preachy.I loved that the book did not shy away from the tough issues. All the hypocrisy.A great book."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I love Francine Rivers, although one of her books I didn't like.But I loved this one. She handled the subject with such grace, honesty and fairness.It was not boring either, but I could actually put it down sometimes without \\"anxiety\\" :) and do my chores.I was inspired as I always am when I read her work."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Dynah Carey is a Christian Golden Girl. She's the doted upon only child, engaged to a man who intends to become a pastor, and just has life together. Yet one moment shatters it all. In that one moment, her life is changed by a rape that leads to an unwanted pregnancy. Her dreams are in shatters. Secrets long held in her family are brought to light. Through it all, her family and those she loves encourage her to get an abortion, yet she remains confused and clinging to the One who loves her beyond anything and can bring healing even to the most broken.This is my favorite book that Francine Rivers has written. I've read it several times. Dynah's faith starts off strong, then wavers, but slowly becomes strong again as she has no choice but to cling to God. She has one friend who doesn't throw stones at her and allows her to make her own decision, and that friend, Joe, truly loves Dynah with a Christlike love. This is a book that offers hope to women who have had abortions, and offers love to women who find themselves in a situation much like Dynah was in.I reread this book for the Tyndale Summer Reading Program. My thoughts and opinions are my own.Recommend to - Karen Kingsbury fans, women who have suffered from abortion, fiction loversRating - 5 stars"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Dynah is happily engaged and in college when she is raped and finds out she's pregnant. Now she has to decide what to do with the baby. Plenty of people offer advice, some for abortion and some for having the baby.I thought the book was good. There were quite a few characters to keep straight and the point of view in the story sometimes changed quite a bit during a chapter."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers did such a great job portraying the big issue of abortion in this book. The main character, Dinah, a godly young lady, who is serving the Lord has the unexpected happen to her. You know the \\"why do bad things happen to good people\\" ordeal? Her \\"perfect\\" life is shattered by rape and the consequences multiplied by an unwanted pregnancy which now brings the question, \\"What to do with this child?\\". Her life as she knows it is over, unless she does what everyone else seems to think she should do, gets an abortion. That would solve it all. No bad reputation, no ruined life, no reminders of the bad thing that happened to her, as far as those around her it seems to be the perfect solution.... but what about the emotional scars abortions can leave? No one wants to talk about the facts, or give her any real information on the long term effects of a decision like this. Her family is being torn apart, her faith stretched to the limits, and time is running out. What will she do?This book is so worth the read, for many reasons, but it especially gives insight about the damage abortion can do to a woman physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I wonder how many women are out there that no one knows what they have gone through or suffered in the course of their lives after having an abortion, whether out of choice or possibly being forced or coerced into one. What does God have to say about it? Is society's view on the issue an accurate one in light of His Word? This book certainly gives much to think about."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I was so excited to see a Francine Rivers book on the Tyndale Summer Reading Program list as she is my favorite author. I thought for sure I had read all of her books but I guess I missed this one and the other one on the list somehow. The book I just finished is The Atonement Child. It is about a young Christian girl, who is raped and ends up pregnant. It is about her struggle with whether to abort or not and the reactions of all those around her. And through all of it many are set free and brought back to a right relationship with the Lord.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It is a must read and one that will keep you up late at night, turning page after page. I want to tell you so much more about the book but I don't want to give the story away. This would also be a great book for someone who has had an abortion and is struggling with the fact that they did.This book will make you rethink your positions and solidify your resolve to be pro-life. I give it 5 stars!!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Ms. Rivers has done an exemplary job of compassionately addressing the multitude of issues that make up the complex issue of human suffering that is abortion--and comes to rest firmly on the Lord's promise of redemption. Abortion is a tragic response to desperation that cannot be eradicated by legislation nor condemnation. Instead, we must reach out in love as Christ commanded and demonstrate, in action, that there is another way.

Even when life is \\"not fair\\" God is in control and has a plan."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is my first Francine Rivers book. I do not and have not ever supported abortion. I now understand more than I ever have in the past. Other books talk about it. This takes you through the storm and lets you experience it. I hope that this book continues to bless those who need healing and open the eyes of people like me. The other great thing about this book is that the relationship with God had so much focus. It is a reminder to always look to Him for all the answers in our times of need even if we think it is small. Little things build up to be big things. Lay them at the feet of Jesus."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"What an overwhelming since of LOVE! All from the birth of a child formed by God. Thank you, Francine Rivers.

I never truly understood what that could feel like until I read this book and realized what it was like for people who have gone through this. Amazingly powerful and a page-turner from beginning to end!!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book tackles such a tough issue. It is insightful, but as a Christian, not far-fetched, as some have claimed. I love the epilogue as much as the story itself. Francine Rivers is a fantastic author, who, in nearly every book I have read of hers, makes you feel the emotions and connect with her characters. (the only books of hers I didn't care much for were the Mother's Daughter books....the rest are very entertaining and ver well written, esp Mark of the Lion series...you'll get lost in that trilogy)."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book is a great inspirational read. It tells of the story of a young girl caught between what the world thinks and what she knows is biblically correct. Throughout the book I found myself cheering Dynah on and standing behind her. What a great read for a woman of any age!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I have read this book at least five times, so I bought a kindle book for my iPad to have it more readily available.

It is life-changing!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book handles a delicate subject with honesty and grace. An excellent book about love and forgiveness. I couldn't stop reading!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I read this book some years ago, and not to be terribly dramatic, but it actually changed my life. It really encouraged me to look at some beliefs I had held for years, from a slightly different angle. I am grateful that Francine Rivers was willing to write what she did, because I imagine she took a few hits for the stand she chose. When I re-read it this week, I was reminded once again that this is still a thought provoking book.Dynah Carey is a college student at a small private Christian school in the midwest. An only child, her parents live in San Francisco where she grew up. They encouraged her to 'spread her wings' and she met her fiancee there. One fateful night, her car in the shop, she takes the bus back to campus and is going to walk the last blocks. She is attacked and finds out later that she is pregnant. Everyone is horrified, some for all the wrong reasons - and no one seems to understand what she needs to hear.This begins a journey through which Dynah learns that only God can be her source and He can ultimately turn something unspeakably terrible into something for good.I recommend this book - no matter what you believe about abortion, it may make you think."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Thank you Francine Rivers for dealing with a political subject in such an awesome way! I really enjoyed the spunk of the women in this novel."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I am not one to reread a book. Nor to watch a movie I've already seen. It's kind of like - I know the ending, therefore, the story loses it's appeal. Not so with \\"The Atonement Child' by Francine Rivers. I originally read it as an older teen. Now as an adult I saw things in the characters I didnt' before. As is usual with Rivers writing, the characters are realistic and well developed. The reader has a myriad of emotions reading this book. An amazingly accurate look at the motives behind the actions. Though never in the same situation as Dynah, I still can learn a lot from her. Her relationship with God was gripping and honest. He doesn't always make sense, but will I trust Him regardless? He doesn't always \\"feel\\" like He's there, but will I believe He still is? He asks tough things, but will I rely on Him to do them? Or will I struggle in my own efforts? Will I choose to forgive and love in the midst of my pain? Those are just some of the things the book addresses. Worth your read. Even if you've read it before!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The Atonement Child by Francine Rivers is a wonderful book. It is about a young college girl who is raped on her way home from work. She finds out that she is pregnant, having been a virgin prior to the rape. This book deals with the effects of an abortion on everyone involved, the doctor, the person having it, and those people's future spouses. This books is definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The Atonement Child is an example of what Christian authors should be doing with their talents. It is an engaging read and deals thoroughly with the subject of abortion, treating it biblically and compassionately. The only way that the killing of unborn children will cease in our nation is for individuals to become convinced of the horrors of abortion. The best way to convince individuals is through popular media and entertainment such as literature and film. Harriet Beecher Stowe proved this in relation to slavery with Uncle Tom's Cabin. Francine Rivers contributes in the same way with The Atonement Child, in which she does a wonderful job of balancing bold truth with hope and healing."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"WOW!

Francine Rivers is an amazing writer. All her books are fabulous."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The book was good, but there are a few characters who have nothing to do with the plot, who could have easily been left out of the book. One chapter deals with grandmother Evie and her circle of friends, who \\"discuss\\" the subject of abortion. This chapter was preachy and it seemed added only to include statistics and information on abortion. I enjoyed the book, and thought it was a feel good novel. I would recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Atonement Child is perhaps the most compelling and riveting work of literature dealing with abortion in the world. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is a powerful and moving novel about the most emotional political and moral topic of our time, abortion. A must read."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"What an amazing masterpiece. This book is what made me want to go into a career with girls struggling with teenage pregnancy. Such a hard topic but Rivers writes so well and depicts so perfectly the battle in Dynah's mind and heart. So honest. My favorite book!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I simply love every book I've read by Francine Rivers. A message that stands out to me and is a prevalant theme in her stories is that we need to listen for God's answers. This is so hard to do since life is so rushed and we're all so impatient. I first read The Mark of the Lion series because it was given to me by a good Christian friend. I would start reading it, then put it down again. There's a lot of backgound information at the beginning that is very deep, especially if you haven't read much of the Bible. I'm guilty of not reading mine enough. These books, however, made me pick up my Bible and start reading again. If you haven't read this series, please do. Hadassah's story will change your outlook on life.I'm actually still reading The Atonement Child. I stayed up until 2 A.M. reading it last night and plan to finish it today. Ms. Rivers does a superb job of broaching this delicate subject. She also makes you feel like you are Dynah. As I struggle daily with waiting for God's answers, these books give me the assurance that God is there and He has a plan for us all. Perhaps the message in this book is that Dynah had to go through this trying experience to change the people around her and bring them back to God. Thank you, Francine Rivers, for your excellent work in Christian fiction!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers proves to me again why she is my favorite author! A story of being true to yourself and doing what you know is right against all other opinions. Story of true love!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"The Atonement Child is the story of Dynah, a typical college student. One day after work, Dynah's life is turned upside down when she is raped. Things only get worse when she finds out she is pregnant. She then begins to lose everything that she held dear. As her family is torn apart, she ponders over what she should do. Should she hold fast to her faith and what she believes, or should she have an abortion? Ultimately, it is up to Dynah to decide.Francine Rivers is an accomplished writer. She has written numerous titles and won many awards. After attending the University of Nevada, Rivers had a successful writing career in secular writing, but in 1986 after becoming a born-again Christian, Rivers wrote Redeeming Love, her most popular book. She has also received acclaim for her three-book series the Mark of the Lion. Her books range from historical fiction to children's books. Her most recent project is The Sons of Encouragement Series.Rivers always does an excellent job of developing her characters in her stories. The Atonement Child is no exception. She weaves the story in such away that the reader experiences almost every possible emotion as Dynah experiences hardships. It is very easy for the reader to be swept up into the story and even be reduced to tears many times. There is also a hint of suspense as readers anticipate what is going to happen next.This fictional account of a young girl's struggle through a crisis pregnancy stirs the emotions of every reader. It sheds light on a controversy that continues to plague American people and people all over the world today. It delves into the emotional and the spiritual aspects of abortion and takes the reader on an unforgettable journey. This book is not just another easy read. It will take readers to a place within themselves they have never known."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book will change your life. It is probably the best book (besides the Bible) I have ever read. Read it and pass it along."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I did not care for the way the rape was brushed off as unimportant and the fact that no one really seemed to care (Dynah included) if they caught the guy. I am not saying he should have been caught in the book and justice swiftly served (like putting him in prison with a bunch of men who gang rape him--that would be justice, the punishment fitting the crime). Ethan's character is why I do NOT believe in once saved, always saved. There are non-Christian men who would have treated her better than that, but perhaps it IS because he is a Christian that he believes the absense of Dynah's hymen diminishes her in his eyes. I believe in forgiveness, but the fact that that abortion doctor, who has aided in literally HUNDREDS of murders, brings Dynah's baby into the world and is all of a sudden forgiven EVERYTHING AND ALL AT ONCE, is a little hard to swallow. Also, I think Dynah hardly seeming upset finding out her mother had committed a murder/abortion is unrealistic. And that business about God hurting so that He can heal is ludicrous--what is He, some kind of sadist? I know the CHRISTIAN God, not that God. Ms. Rivers obviously has a narrow-minded view of the Master Creator. How could anyone delude themselves into believing such a thing (referring to Dynah here), that God would purposely make/allow something horrible happen to them when they did NOTHING wrong? The rape is actually very glossed over and does not seem like it happened at all, but better that than an explicitly disturbing and very graphic rape scene."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I really enjoyed The Atonement Child. It made me question how strong my faith really was and how I would react if I ever got raped. This book gave me a new and clearer perspective on life, it also made me more aware of my surroundings. I now realize that even the streets near a church, school, or christian college aren't necessarily safe. I definitely think that my faith in God has become stronger since I read The Atonement Child.I think Francine Rivers is a great writer, and expressed her opinion on abortion very clearly. I really liked the way Rivers represented each of the characters, and the way their thoughts and feelings revealed a descriptive picture of their personality. I also really liked the way the book flowed, so that we knew what all the characters were thinking.I think Denah's faith became stronger after she got raped. Even though she doubted God at times she never let anyone make her decisions. I loved the book but I wish that Denah and Joe had realized their love for one and other earlier in the story. I also wish that Ethan hadn't been so self- centered. I think that everyone should read this book, no matter whether you're male or female, old or young I believe that there is a message for everybody."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book is such a wonderful, powerful contribution to understanding the sanctity of God given life. It certainly shed some light on that topic for me, and I highly recommend this book to women who have faced abortion or feel that abortion is okay just because it's legal."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book is a must read! A heart-wrenching situation is looked at in a new light. A true light."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This isn't an anti-abortion book. It's a story of compassion for others. I was profoundly affected by the honesty with which the author looked at the way other Christians reacted to the heroine's situation. The truth is, sometimes we shoot our wounded. May God forgive us. I have read every single one of Ms. Rivers' novels, and she never fails to move me in some way. I always have a sense that God is speaking to me, even if the message He has for me isn't the subject matter the author has written about. Should the Lord tarry, I hope to read many, many more books by the talented Ms. Rivers."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers has written a masterpiece on today's issue of abortion. She digs in and deals with the tough cases and the issues that no one is willing to discuss. Coming from her own heart, she displays the pain and guilt that many women and men face after an abortion, showing that the baby is not the only victim. Creatively written, the book takes you on a journey of not only a family, but also many friends, that must come to terms with their past. In the end, it is the choice to give birth to a baby conceived of rape that brings the truth to light for everyone. This book will capture your heart without preaching or telling you what to believe. The facts are presented in a way that allows you to see all sides of the issue. You will finish the book feeling as if you really knew the characters. It is an excellent piece of work and a must for all to read."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Another &quot;Can't put down book&quot; by a great author. A great story that will make you smile and cry. It is a great story for our current society."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers is my number one favorite author. However, this book was distinctly different. She hit on issues in society which allows for compromise. This book is sensitive yet definitely guides into Godly principles - even when all have compromised.What especially got my attention and drove me to my knees for all women was the closing note to all women. Not only is this a story for the ages, but the ending has a warriors prayer that should be printed up and hung on refrigerators throughout the world."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was such a great book! Francine Rivers brings the characters to life! The issue of abortion is truthfully described and the choices Dynah has to make are real. Dynah Carey is the kind of solid Christian that everyone wants to be, but an unwanted pregnancy tests her faith to the limits. Pressure from her fiance, friends, and a family that knows the tragedy of abortion prevent Dynah from making her own decisions about the child she carries. Dynah alone must learn God's will and make the choice."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book handles a personal story of tragedy resulting in an unplanned pregnancy and how a young girl handled it. It presents many facts about abortion which are essential to an accurate understanding of the issue. It's very compelling reading"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"If you intend to read this book, you may not want to read my review, as it gives away most of the story line. That being said, I must respectfully state that this was one of the most unrealistic books I have ever read. The story line was tailored to further the cause of the author's obvious anti-abortion stance in such a way that it actually weakens the argument. Now, I am not in favor of abortion, but it just seems a little far fetched that a young virgin woman is raped, refuses a morning after pill to guard against potential pregnancy before it occurs,(I know, another point for debate),she gets thrown out of school, her 'loving' Christian fiance dumps her, his best friend moves right in to convince her to have the baby because, coincidentally, he just happened to have gotten a girl pregnant in his past and she had an abortion, which he regrets. So naturally he can't wait to become a father to this baby. (Of course, if he had become a father to his girlfriend's baby, he probably wouldn't have been able to get the college education that is now going to enable him to support and father this 'atonement child.') But the coincidences don't stop there, they seem to come crawling out of the woodwork. Let's see, the girl's mother had an abortion years ago, her grandmother also had one (because her own life was in grave danger)...several members of her church come forward to form an anonymous group of upstanding women whose lives are a shambles because they all have had abortions. When the girl runs away from home, she just happens to stop to eat at a diner where business is very slow, but they are desperate to hire a waitress, and throw in free meals--what luck! Then, of course, the ex-fiance's friend hunts her down, because after all, he has to alleviate his guilt over his loss by making sure she has this baby. I was looking forward to a thoughtful, realistic presentation of the heartbreaking problem a woman is faced with when, as a result of rape, she has to decide whether to terminate a pregnancy. Again, I want to state that I am not saying the author is wrong to be against abortion, but the story is just too pat--most women in this situation don't have a guy chomping at the bit just dying to marry her and be an instant father to a child conceived as a result of a violent assault, and the decision to have the child would undoubtedly have catastrophic effects on the woman's life, and her ability to support herself and her baby, regardless of how much she would love the child. The cost of health care and delivery alone would be devastating, not to mention working, child care, housing, etc., and raising a child in poverty is also heartbreaking, as would be giving the child up for adoption. This book makes it appear that there is an easy solution to such a problem when there simply isn't. The best persuasion acknowledges the opposing point of view and proceeds to refute it. The author fails to do this, and consequently fails to write a believable story."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book was okay. It seemed that all of the characters except for Joe, were christians who didn't really know God's character and what the Bible says. This disappointed me. It didn't appear that they loved God with all their mind it appeared more that they were stuck in their condition.I guess I expected more."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was the first Francine Rivers title I have read, and came highly recommended, so my expectations were high. One of the outstanding qualities immediately evident in this novel is Rivers' superb ability to describe real feelings. Few people have the ability to understand the feelings and struggles of others. Even less are able to communicate these feelings and struggles to others. Rivers succeeds admirably on both counts. The main character Dynah, like people in real life, is unpredictable, and Rivers' description of her struggle with the difficult issues and consequences of rape, pregnancy and abortion mirrors the highs and lows experienced by people in the real world. Although Rivers is clearly committed to an absolute pro-life position on abortion, she shows that applying this consistently in real life situations involves a difficult and painful struggle. Her characters are far from shallow, and their development throughout the course of the plot enables Rivers to work with deeper themes of repentance and forgiveness.A literary criticism could be made that the fairy-tale type ending where Dynah and Joe pledge to be married is too optimistic and is a concession to the standard movie romance. It seems to be a significant departure from the realism that Rivers has so brilliantly described throughout the rest of the novel, since the real struggles that Dynah experienced are far from over with the birth of her child and impending marriage. However, on the whole this novel's strength lies its literary qualities.Notwithstanding the above kudos, The Atonement Child is not entirely exempt from criticism. It is unfortunate that Rivers' commitment to the sixth commandment (by firmly maintaining a pro-life position over against murderous abortion) is not accompanied with an equal commitment to the third commandment (the constant casual use of God's Name as an expletive borders on the blasphemous) and the fourth commandment (there are a number of instances where the main characters buy a meal on a Sunday, implicitly endorsing Sunday shopping). Moreover, I found Rivers' portrayal of the antagonistic church community somewhat too negative. Although it is undeniable that the church community does not always function as it should, I sensed that the important role and involvement of a sympathetic and supportive church community could have been developed more strongly.Of more serious concern is Rivers' belief in ongoing revelation. On at least two occasions, God is presented as speaking directly to and through Dynah. Readers like myself who believe that God's revelation is sufficient and complete in the Bible, will have to sadly conclude that Rivers is unscriptural on this point.The above weaknesses, however, do not detract from the novel's strengths. I simply present them for the consideration of discerning readers, but still do not hesitate in speaking very highly of this book. Despite its theological weaknesses, this novel is rightly regarded as one of the best in contemporary Christian fiction."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is a facile treatment of difficult and complex issues (rape, abortion, adoption, single parenthood). The characters are pasteboard, and the idea of generational retribution as an explanation for otherwise random evil is shallow and predicated on a superficial reading of the Old Testament. (And the symbolic character names...please.) Also, because abortion is the &quot;issue,&quot; rape and its aftermath are glossed over, with the rapist exonerated of his wrongdoing. I was looking forward to a book that tackled these issues with honesty and depth. But The Atonement Child actively offended me. I'd certainly never recommend it to anyone grappling with any of these emotionally charged, difficult issues."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"While this book is fiction, and a good book at that, the author needed to make the rest of Dinah's life and experiences a little more realistic. First of all, especially in a city where her college was located, and as recent as 1996-1997, there should have been a sexual assault nurse examiner, not a male doctor, doing her ER exam. Yes, I work in healthcare and my background is Emergency and OB, so I have taken the author to task on not making her settings realistic. Even the most rural counties in my state provide this service for all sexual assault vicitims. Secondly, Dinah gave birth in a delivery room? Give me a break! The birth was set in California?? C'mon now, birthing rooms have been used since the late eighties for all but C-Sections and since Dinah chose to go without an epidural, I have no idea why she had the baby in an operating room, then got moved to recovery, and had a roommate????? Was this story set in 1975 and I missed that? Christian writers tend to be the last group to figure out there are female OB/GYN's and you give birth the way you want to these days!! Other than the poorly researched settings and occurances, this is a great book dealing with a very intense issue. Francine Rivers, please keep writing your awesome books, but pull yourself into at least the 1990's!!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Rivers is a wonderful auther whose books really grab your attention. Sad to be done reading this book"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is a good book, came in good shape........the story started out a little slower for me than some of her other books but after awhile, I was hooked!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"It was an interesting book on the struggles a person might go thru trying to decide what to do in the situation like she found herself in. A very good book and yes I would recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Once again realized how much freedom and peace there is if one operates according to God's will and not in our own selfish and fearful ways."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This book was recommended by a friend and I was very pleased with the book. Was an easy read and loved the content."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"this book touched such a sensitive issue; we as a society have taken two very opposite positions on.it shows a women fighting what society tells her she should do; VS what she believes is right.I think it is worth the read."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I Loved this Book! Could not put the book down, wanted to keep reading it. Would recommend this book! First time reading a book from this author!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Really addresses the many ways that choice really isn't choice, and the long-term widespread damage it causes. A wonderful read providing insight to God's healing grace and support."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I'm an adoptive mom and a Right To Life member! This book allowed me to see it from a Birth Mothers point of view and also shed light on the issue of RTL supporting the birth mother not just the baby! I'm a better women for reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Rivers has a way to incorporate biblical context with present day stories. This is a very catching work that will leave you fulfilled"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This was the first book by Francine Rivers, and the first book of this &quot;type&quot; that I had ever read, and I loved it! I'm a slow reader, but finished this one quickly; I just had to find out what happened next! I volunteer at a crisis pregnancy center, and I felt by the end of this book that everyone who volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers should read this book; the insights into what is going on in someone's life in the midst of this crisis are extraordinary. I also enjoyed watching Dynah's spiritual journey as her character developed throughout the book. I recommend this book to everyone I can. Probably one of the best books I've ever read!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"If a man's heart can be shattered to pieces this book can do just that! Most men really have no understanding of the act of rape until it hits home; wife, daughter, sister, mother. This book helps men to understand. Add a difficult dicision to boot! Hard to put down!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers takes the topic of rape and abortion to our doorsteps. It makes you stop and think about your true beliefs. There is a challenge in this book for the Christian community, if crisis hits close to home do we practice what we preach?"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I really enjoyed this book! I couldn't put it down. I read it while we were on our way to Denver for a vacation. I don't even remember the ten hour drive because I was so into this book. When I was done reading it, I gave it to my mom. She read half way through the book before she realized it wasn't a true story. She couldn't put it down either. Great job, Francine!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"To be clear, I read this book years ago, but just picked it up again in its new format and cover. As I went to re-read it, I mistakenly thought perhaps it would be less powerful since I knew the ending before I started. Boy, was I wrong!In \\"The Atonement Child,\\" Francine Rivers writes a heart-wrenching tale of a young woman who is raped and soon finds her perfect little life changed forever. In her talented, moving way, Ms. Rivers turns this into a multi-generational story, showing the responses and experiences of \\"those gone before.\\"In the story, she handles the issue of unplanned pregnancy and the sometimes hypocritical way the world responds to it, especially those in \\"Christian\\" circles. I would definitely recommend this book (and have) to anyone I know. Especially those who claim to be \\"pro-life, but...\\", as this book will challenge your thinking and make you answer, \\"What does it really and truly mean to value life as God commands?\\"Francine Rivers has a God-given talent to write life-changing stories, and I think its quite telling that this book is just as applicable to today's issues as it was when she originally published it 15 years ago."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Francine Rivers just cannot write a bad book, this one is as fabulous as all the others. Heartwrenching, eye opening, full of encouragement. The Atonement Child deals with a sensitive issue and Francine handles it beautifully.A baby conceived of rape, an abortion, more than one generation effected, this book shows the baby is not the only victim. It sheds light on a controversy that plagues people today.This is not an easy read and it gives plenty of food for thought.The Atonement Child gets 5 stars from me!"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I think that all women should read this book no matter what they have gone through. The way Francine Rivers approached the issue took me by surprise. She reminds these women that there is hope and that God has not forgotten about them. This story also shows the importance of tuning out the world, and waiting on God when it comes to making the decisions in your life. What happened in this story can happen to anyone and the comfort and redemption that you can find in God is also there. This is the second book I've read by Francine Rivers, and I own others and plan on purchasing many more. She is an excellent writer and draws every audience in, whether you are a college student (boy/girl), married, or what have you. This book would make a great addition to any Christian literature book shelf. I definitely recommend this :)"},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"Always love Francine Rivers. She presents this story with sensitivity and shows the importance of love and support for those who have important life decisions to make whether we agree with their decisions or not."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"I am probably 99 percent pro-life, with the one percent being cases of rape. This book handled both sides of the story well, with the predictable outcome. A good editor would have cut some of the tedious detail, for instance.... she turned on the faucet, rinsed her hands, dried them on a towel, hung up the towel. He put the key in the car door, turned the key, opened the door, got in, settled himself behind the wheel.... Yawn."},{"Title":"The Atonement Child","review":"This is the story about a young lady Dynah attending a Christian College engaged to the next mega preacher being groomed. Dynah is raped one evening on her way home from work. Ethan, the boy wonder, has a problem. His beloved is no longer a Virgin. To make matters worse she finds out she is pregnant. Due to what people will think, that they sinned, he dumps her as well as the college as they have a rule that if you are pregnant you have to leave even if it's not your fault. This is a college that preaches pro-life agenda but in Dynah's case is willing to look the other way should she abort the child. She leaves to find comfort at home only to find that she has gone from the frying pan to boiling water. Good book."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"Howard Hughes led an intensely interesting life, and that's what makes this biography such a disappointment. Any book about Howard should be a quick read, but these authors focus on \\"The Untold Story\\". Unfortunately the untold story is exceedingly tedious, and boring. Maybe this is the reason it was \\"untold\\". The book almost solely focuses on Howard's troubled relationships with women from his early twenties to his death. After his first wife, it's the same story over and over again. Howard dated an enormous number of girls and we get to hear about each and every one of them.Between the stories about these vapid relationships, there is some interesting material here, but the authors inexplicably leave out the Senate hearings in 1947 and his test flight of the \\"Spruce Goose\\". The last twenty years of his life are some of the most bizarre and interesting, but this is rushed through at the end of the book. There's plenty of books about Hughes out there and I guess I just picked the wrong one."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"I'd heard so many rumors about Howard Hughes through the years, seen movies and documentaries, but never knew much about the real man - after reading this book, I felt I did. It turns out this charmed life was lived by a very sad soul, in search of something money couldn't give him. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Howard Hughes the Untold Story","review":"This book covers everything about Howard Hughes, from his early formative years in Texas, to the loss of his mother, his many and varied pursuits of the world's most beautiful women, to his expansive business acumen: pulling his father's legacy into previously unseen profit and then building his own legacy within the aviation industry and the film business. It shows his descent into illness and drug addiction at the hands of his Mormon caregivers. I now have an understanding of who he really was, from many perspectives.
