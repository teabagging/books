This book is one-of-a-kind in that it is an in-depth, thoughtful and frank essay on everyone's favorite topic, and it doesn't veer into the pornographic or the clinical.In the hands of a less-skilled writer, this book could have become silly or creepy. Rhodes, though, doesn't shy away from observations that put his most intimate experiences under a microscope. This is not a gossipy book; it's a sincere exploration of sensuality.His first sexual encounter, masturbation, issues of sexual identity: it is all here. Rhodes doesn't exploit these subjects, and he doesn't offer them for the reader's approval. Instead, he describes his sexual history in the context of his life, which has had its ups and downs. It's a pretty brave book.The most shocking part, to me, was not what he did sexually, but the fact that his daughter commented on it, which means she has read it! Well, I guess she is under no illusions that her parents were Rob &amp; Laura Petrie!I'd like to see a book of this calibre told from a woman's perspective."},{"Title":"Making Love: An Erotic Odyssey","review":"In connection with preparing to run a conference on sexuality, I have read a number of books in the area, ranging from scholarly to popular relational junk. This is one of the most honest, open and best-crafted books in the area, by a brilliant writer who cares and thinks about what he feels, who he is and why, and explores what it is to be a man who wants both the deepest intimacy in his personal relationships and is also completely turned on by just plain old mind-bending sex, but knows that's nothing to be ashamed of. I understand Rhodes got a lot of criticism for writing this book; instead, he should be praised to the heavens for his bravery. I think it's a terrible thing that it has gone out of print."},{"Title":"Making Love: An Erotic Odyssey","review":"A friend (that's you, Jack) sent this book to me. Otherwise I would have never voluntarily purchased it. I had already read his Pultzer prize winning &quot;Atomic Bomb&quot; book and was thus willing to give this one a go. I am glad I did. I read it in two days. I would recommend it to anyone interested in widening their sexual perspective. This is not an instruction book, it is a partial overview of human sexuality at its most emotional level. Rhoades respects no boundaires -- everything is fair game. Personally, I thought the last 1/3rd of the book was the best."},{"Title":"Making Love: An Erotic Odyssey","review":"Very frank and open discussion of the author's sexual history.Especially helpful for male readers.First 2/3's is the best.Highly recommend this book if you are not offended byfrank discussions about sexual preferences and behavior."},{"Title":"Making Love: An Erotic Odyssey","review":"Disappointed after the positive reviews here. It's a very short book, only 173 pages and reads like a diary. But it's a diary that's somewhat disjointed, and jumps from one experience to another without much filler in between. To put it bluntly, it's more like a journal of his sexual conquests, and one that's not terribly interesting. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Making Love: An Erotic Odyssey","review":"The number one lesson I learned from this sexual memoir is the extensive role that an industrial-made lubricant could or perhaps even should - who knows ? - play in man's approach to a woman."},{"Title":"Farscape: The Illustrated Companion","review":"Ok, as a Farscape fan I enjoy the content of this book but there's not a single picture in color except on the front and back covers."},{"Title":"Farscape: The Illustrated Companion","review":"As one of the other reviewers pointed out, the episode synopses are brief. As a matter of fact, they only cover the setup for each episode, and omit the resolution. It's like reading teasers. I was hoping for something that would actually summarize the entire episode. In that regard, this book was a disappointment, and I won't be buying the rest of the series.To be fair, the books are lavishly illustrated with drawings and black and white photos. The background material on production, and actor and producer interviews are interesting. If you're looking for *complete* plot summaries for each episode, keep looking, as this book doesn't have them."},{"Title":"Farscape: The Illustrated Companion","review":"This book actually has pretty terse episode descriptions and spends a lot more time on actor and staff impressions, descriptions of the props, sets and costumes, and generally interesting things that you don't get from watching the episodes themselves.

This book covers the episodes, gives us information about behind the scenes and has chapters on the special effects.

There are also chapters on the different characters and the actors/puppeteers who play them.

Much more thoughtful than most of the more fashionable post-colonial or globalization writers. Ong demonstrates how the Chinese transnational community confounds notions of peripheral non-westerners, or transnational community as weapon of the weak. She also demonstrates how the contemporary world is creating the context for the rise of China. The ultimate antidote to babble about how we have moved into a world beyond identities and geopolitics."},{"Title":"Flexible Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality","review":"Aihwa Ong uses the example of the international (and now transnational) diaspora of \\"guoqiao\\" or overseas Chinese to look at the construction of flexable citizenships. These communities, she argues, increasingly construct their cultural identities through a pramatic assesment of the best strategies of advancement, irregardless of national place. In this way, Hong Kong capital has been key to the transformation of mainland China, Malaysian Chinese send their \\"parachute\\" kids to America for education, and the Singapore leadership brings in Harvard professors to help them construct an alternative modernity centered on conceptions of Confucianism.She addresses the ways in which race can still form a glass celing, even when transnationals have all the right cultural capital, and the way \\"traditional\\" gender roles are reestablished to meet the need of the (male) transnational class to have a (female) foundation in one place. She also discusses the ways in which the advanced agency of the transnational class is dependant on a much more restricted class of people.Although some of Ong's conclusions demand reconsideration in light of the Financial Crisis of '97, the return of Hong Kong and the events of 9/11, and although her tone occasionally waxes chauvainistic, much of her analysis still rings true."},{"Title":"Flexible Citizenship: The Cultural Logics of Transnationality","review":"A must read for anthropologists and other social scientists interested in the process of globalization."},{"Title":"Michael Kohlhaas: Berlin 1810 (German Edition)","review":"The eminent modern story of a man who suffers injustice, and takes the law in his own hands to do himself justice, for the man who did him wrong, has friends in high places.He seeks revenge by establishing a private army, gets the support of the population and becomes a threat for the whole establishment.

It contains 43 stories, 22 of them from 1950-1952, and the rest from the 40's, 30's and 20's, and one by Jack London from 1912. As one might expect, with the surge in number of anthologies in this period, they draw more and more on the stories which were published more recently.Two of these stories have been nominated for Retro Hugos: \\"What You Need\\" by Lewis Padgett was nominated in 1996 for the Retro Hugo for Short Stories written in 1945, while \\"A Subway Named Mobius\\" by A. J. Deutsch was nominated in 2001 for the Retro Hugo for Short Stories written in 1950. In addition \\"The Colour Out Of Space\\" by H. P. Lovecraft is included, which tied for 12th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll in 1971 for stories written before 1940, and tied for 26th on the Locus All-Time Poll for Novelettes in 1999.Other noteworthy stories include Jack London's \\"The Scarlet Plague\\", and end of civilization story, Andr&eacute; Maurois' \\"The War Against The Moon\\", Ann Griffith's \\"Zeritsky's Law, and many others. While this collection is not as strong as the previous ones, it is still a very good collection of stories. This is definitely worth picking up if you have the chance and enjoy early science fiction."},{"Title":"Omnibus Of Science Fiction","review":"Although he has since been overshadowed by John Campbell, Groff Conklin was an influential editor who produced several collections of science fiction short stories long before SF was fashionable. This book contains a treasure-trove of stories by authors whose names are still familiar as well as a few who may be new to the younger reader.I certainly hope a new publisher decides to reissue some of Conklin's collections. It has been too long since we were able to enjoy stories by Kris Neville and Ross Rocklynne."},{"Title":"Web Management With Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 5.0","review":"This book is a shameful rip-off. It's a breathless sales job on VSS with no in-depth information about how to use it. It is extremely superficial, and unconsciounably badly-researched. There are blatant inaccuracies that should never have gotten by if the book had been reviewed by a moderately technical person. (One example from page 63: &quot;Use Regular Expressions doesn't alow the String field to contain wild cards, and forces Visual SourceSafe to treat them as literal characters.&quot; ??!! Any first-year programming student knows that regular expressions are the opposite of literal characters, they are a rich &quot;wildcard&quot; language that operate exactly opposite to the way the authors describe.)If you're the least bit technical, stay away from this awful book, it won't make you smarter, only angry."},{"Title":"Web Management With Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 5.0","review":"If you have a job in configuration management and start looking for books on SourceSafe you will find this is the only one. The book has some useful information but it becomes obvious that the publisher does not employ technical editors. There are several aside story sections in this book that could have been handled to help the user learn more but instead came across as the writers frustration with project management or cynical humor. Had any editor looked at these asides they surely would have edited them or removed them entirely. The publisher QUE used to be a producer of semi good technical books but WROX has passed them by in a big way. Hopefully Wrox will look at this product as viable to produce a book on but until then this is all there is."},{"Title":"Web Management With Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 5.0","review":"I truly wish that someone would write a book on how to successfully implement version and file control with Visual SourceSafe. There are NO books about it anywhere. Please, if you have any knowledge of VSS, write a book, a primer or even a flyer. This book is not helpful at all."},{"Title":"Web Management With Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 5.0","review":"I was looking for a book to help to programatically integrate SourceSafe with Microsoft apps. ie. VB. This book is essentially a book that tells you you need to use source safe on a large web development project. Not what I needed."},{"Title":"Web Management With Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 5.0","review":"As the author Steve notes above, the book is indeed more thanjust for web developers. Anyone who has tried to use VSS and found itdaunting will find lots of help and hidden gems in the book.There's even a (usually) insightful ongoing scenario painted throughout the book where features are described in terms of their impact on a fictional company and 2 antagonistic protagonists. The infighting between them, and the solutions offered by using VSS to quiet that, are often helpful. They're sometimes stretched, though. And to be honest you'll have to suffer through frequent and painfully trite cliches throughout the book. On the subject of &quot;pin&quot;ning a file, it offers: &quot;You pin the version at a mutually agreeable point, and go on to make your DaVinci-esque changes to the file. In order to stab a pin into a defenseless file you must ...&quot;That sort of cliche is bad enough, and it occurs too often. Even worse, the section on &quot;sharing&quot; files ends: &quot;Remember, sharing is a healthy experience, and hopefully, if you set a good example, you can set aright today's skewed values.&quot;Oy, how distracting! That added no value at all. How the editors let these sort of things get by is beyond me. Since the book was authored by 2 gentleman, maybe one was more prone to this in some sections than others.And I will say that out of the notes I took from the book, the ratio of useful tips outpaced the &quot;drivel alarms&quot; by 8 to 1, so if you're not daunted by separating the wheat from the chaff, I'd still recommend it. Particularly as there are no other 3rd party books on VSS (as of now).I do feel, though, that the &quot;web&quot; focus seems sometimes muddled. If you're a web application developer, as opposed to a web *site* (html) developer, you may find some aspects of the book wanting. While the running scenario does respect programmers' unique needs with its inclusion of &quot;jeff, the programmer&quot; and his butting heads with others (both quite realistic), the coverage of features sometimes leaves the distinction poorly defined.For instance, it discusses the choice of using a temporary working directory to hold only a few files being worked on briefly versus the &quot;programmer's&quot; setup with a directory structure that would keep most of the project files checked out &quot;quasi-permanently&quot;.That sort of distinction between approaches is helpful, but the discussion concludes with the notion that the former is more suitable for the non-programmer in the example because &quot;the web development cycle is much shorter than that of a program&quot;.So what of the web programmer? They're left to carefully considering approaches raised to decide if he/she should approach them as offered for the &quot;programmer&quot; or &quot;web developer&quot;. In some cases, one is more suitable than the other.Perhaps the May 97 publication date (with its likely authoring in the months before) has dated the book with respect to its treatment of these unique needs of the web application developer, and the likelihood that this is a major camp in the user community.Or maybe the intention was there but the authors really didn't understand those unique needs well enough (they're each described as freelance designers, so theirs may be a second hand perspective of web application developers).I hope that an update to the book may address these needs. I have a list of suggestions to offer, if the authors are interested."},{"Title":"Web Management With Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 5.0","review":"(With all due respect for the other reviewers)I do not agree with the majority of the assessments offered here, unless your only view point is that of the webmaster or web designer. There are plenty of books on the shelves of book stores and libraries, about Web page and site management, design, and building. Objectively, this book dose not appear to be for that purpose. The title does not suggest that the heart of the book is about Web management, but that Web Management is a casual example of using Vss.The purpose of Vss is not to build web pages or sites. The primary functional purpose of Vss is to track the changes made to a file. The secondary purpose is that of a file manager, of a sort.How one might use Vss to accomplish any task beyond file management and version tracking, is entirely up to each user of Vss. Any insight, from an outside party, should be viewed as a benefit to the reader. The subjective assessments of the authors' delivery has nothing to do with the material presented.I have been looking to acquire this book or similar Vss application type renderings. However, this seems to be the only book available, in this regard. From the table of contents, one might imagine that this book might contain adequate information on the subject of Vss and maybe the pitfalls and difficulties with it.I have installed Vss 5 &amp; 6 and provide the administrative and technical support for 80+ engineers and 20+ programmers, who are working on high end, state of the art technology, real applications. I have found some pitfalls and problems with Vss that I need to remedy. Microsoft will not offer support to anyone without the added costly charge for their service.It is my humble opinion, that the supplied documentation should include adequate information for the user to read. Then, and only then, if the user needs help, Support Services should be placed into the equation. At that point in time, the user should have no problem with the additional support service charges. However, the Vss information is scattered and sparsely located throughout any documentation that MS supplies with Vss. It would seem that this book might supply the additional needed information, at a fraction of the MS support cost.If the critical accounts of the subject matter are accurate, then I am disappointed in the authors of this book. If I were a webmaster then I would be discouraged form purchasing this book. However, this book does appear to have the information that I am looking for. I have been unable to locate a copy of this book, in the library, book stores, and e-commerce sellers of this book.If you have a copy of this book and are interested in selling it to me, then please drop a card or line to me at PB Box 12150, Portland, Oregon 97212-0150."},{"Title":"Web Management With Microsoft Visual Sourcesafe 5.0","review":"I should have added to the last review that part of the challenge is that the very &quot;web&quot; features of VSS 5 are also rather paultry and focused more on &quot;html coders&quot; and &quot;web site management&quot; as it regards &quot;site maps&quot; and &quot;link verification&quot;. The product itself (and its doc, which led me to this book) are both wanting with respect to web application developer features as well as suggestions on how to use the product from that perspective. Given that, one can perhaps further forgive the authors, but its a notion that today's web developers should consider in evaluating the book.It will likely still be valuable to most, especially those new to VSS, but it seems it could be much more so with just a few refinements and elaborations."},{"Title":"Don Juan Tenorio (In Spanish)","review":"This is the most famous depiction of the ancient legend of Don Juan, the unrepentant and bold sinner from Spain. A masterwork of Romanticism, &quot;Don Juan&quot; tells the story of Juan Tenorio, a worldly man whose only interest in life is to seduce as many women as he can. He makes a bet with his friend Luis Mej&iacute;a, to see who is more fortunate with women. Don Juan wins, but his father writes him off from his testament. After that, Don Juan rapes Luis' fianc&eacute;e. All this gives him, of course, a bad reputation, so the father of his beloved Ines forbids him to marry her. Events unfold then at a rapid pace, amidst duels, murders, illegitimate seductions and tragedy, including the apparition of ghosts. But more than just a cloak-and-dagger play, this work is a fascinating elaboration on the central myths of sin and repentance; of trespassing and divine forgiving; of the redeeming possibilities of true love, as distinguished from the sins of the flesh which lead to hell. In the Spanish world, it is the play that is staged every year, by the beginning of November when Day of the Dead is celebrated. It is a sum-up of the Romantic myth and, as all classical works, it admits different interpretations, from the literal to the philosophical. And it's a lot of fun too."},{"Title":"Don Juan Tenorio (In Spanish)","review":"Don Juan Tenorio is the ultimate player. He is to players what William Shakespear is to poets.

That is, I'd heard of the Pillbsbury Bakeoff, of course, and knew of chili contests. I had no idea there was a year-round series of national competitions, a la the PGA Tour or perhaps more appropriately, the Pro Bowling Tour.The whole concept of a year on the competitive cooking circuit was a new one for me and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about it. Sutherland's reporter-style writing, lots of facts and descriptions, not too much analysis, really works. She examines the competitions, profiles some contestants, looks into the preparation for an event, discusses the history of cooking contests, and addresses the phenomenon of &quot;contesters&quot;.I have to agree with another reviewer that photos would have been a welcome addition to this book, the few on the jacket are great, but left me wanting more.Apparently, cooking contests are uniquely American. According to Sutherland, &quot;Through contests we embody the founding fathers' ideal... to make of ourselves what we can... Even if you are stuck in a dead-end job in a dead-end marriage on a dead-end street, in America you can rise above your station and reign supreme at the bowling alley or the dog show or the poker table.&quot;Cookoff isn't really about cooking, it's about the competition."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"Food writer Amy Sutherland has written a fascinating behind-the-scenes expose of cook offs and recipe contests. From the outside, such contests seem rather boring, with middle-aged housewives preparing grandma's handed-down recipes. However, much more is percolating under the surface!Sutherland traveled around the country for over a year, attending cook offs and interviewing numerous contestants to write her book. She covers many of the biggest contests, such as the Pillsbury Bake-Off, as well as smaller ones, including State Fairs and chili cook offs. These cook offs, some of which have been around for decades, have become big business with huge purses and prizes, leading to increased drama. Sutherland details the cooking disasters, failed recipes, and occasional squabbles. Sutherland also paints a vibrant portrait of the cook-off regulars, who calls themselves &quot;contesters.&quot; These contesters enter numerous cook offs, make many of the finals, and are absorbing to read about.At the end of most chapters, she includes winning recipes from the contests she discusses - so don't flip ahead or the suspense will be ruined! The final chapter gives practical advice to readers about recipe contests and cook offs. After reading this book, I'm eager to enter a contest on my own. A most enjoyable book - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"The best way to read this book is quickly, lightly, and without too big of a literary appetite. Ruth Reichl it's not - but it's an entertaining read nonetheless.I found *Cook-Off* to be an amusing set of stories about a quirky, feel-good slice of Americana. The chapters read like a set of feature articles culled from the front page of the \\"Lifestyles\\" section of any small-town newspaper. The content is the main draw here: Sutherland makes a nice effort to draw together the disparate characters and dispersed narratives of this little-known cookery circuit. It's fun --wholesome, lighthearted fun.And if the writing is at times amateurish, the syntax is frequently tortured, and the grammar and vocabulary shockingly off-the-mark... well, that's the downside to small-town newspaper-ish writing, I suppose.One example:\\"Only two people have won the International Chili Championship cookoff, the bigger of the two national chili cookoffs held in Terlingua, Texas, each year, twice in its long history.\\"Another example:\\"Americans cross spatulas at approximately more than 1,300 such competitions annually.... Chili alone accounts for more than 750 cookoffs nationwide. In Texas alone a chilihead willing to travel....\\"In Chapter 2 \\"alone\\" Sutherland gives us \\"approximately more than\\" 3 occasions per page to wince at her clunky sentences and poor grammar.This would have been an excellent read if the book had attracted a better editor. As it is, it is an entertaining read - as long as you don't read too closely. The story is nice, such as it is. The writing is a distraction, but not so much of one that it stands in the way of getting to the meat of the cooks' narrative."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"How can you not like a book that features a character like the mysterious Tunnel of Fudge woman? Amy Sutherland's wit and powers of observation make this a good read. Her exploration of a subculture obsessed with creating new recipes for various processed foods provides a fascinating look at who we are, how competitive we are, and how preoccupied we are with our quirky passions. Be it competitive cooking, golf, bingo, or skeet shooting, Americans love to win. Sutherland does a great job of showing us ourselves through this microcosm of American culture. A somewhat careless editing job is maddening, but ultimately, the author has researched and written an enjoyable, funny, and compassionate book."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"I could not put this one down. It's hilarious, suspenseful, and surprisingly inspiring. Sutherland has written a book that's about more than competitive cooking...it's about competitive America, about the beauty of improvisation, and our sense that nothing--not even a drippy Tunnel of Fudge--is impossible. Sutherland introduces a fantastic parade of characters, as amusing as they are driven, as creative as they are kooky, and as truthfully and warmly rendered as I've read in any book anywhere. If you enjoyed Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, or more recently, Wordfreak, you will love Cookoff. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"What a marvelous mix of entertainment and information on an issue I knew nothing about! Sutherland's journalistic approach takes amazing and colorful twists and turns as it lays out the inner-workings of the cookoff circuit where the players range from highly entertaining to overly competitive and crabby. I found myself dying to meet the queen of the cookoff, Diane Sparrow and wanting to cry over Cindy Shmuelling's bittersweet story. If you are interested in what makes people tick, this book is for you. As with all books worth their salt, I relished each new chapter and felt sad when it was over!"},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"Who knew! Leave it to Americans to making cooking a sport, one where the freshness of a garnish can make the difference between winnng the big bucks or not. Sutherland is an apt guide of this world of competitive cooks with all their quirks. This book is not just for foodies, but for anyone the least bit interested in American pop culture. The cooks are vivid and compelling. The food ingenious to appalling. Part travelogue, food history and culinary who-dunnit, Cookoff is a winner."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"I enjoy watching cooking contests on the Food Network, so I was eager to read this book. Unfortunately, the book does not capture the excitement of seeing the cooks in living color or touch your heart when they talk about their lives in their own words. You can't see the frustration on their faces when the cookies crumble or their radiant joy when they win. Reading that somebody smiled or the tears flowed just isn't the same. Most of all, you can't see the FOOD.

So far (I'm about halfway through) I've found proper names spelled two different ways in the same paragraph, common words that are misspelled, and turns of phrase that are just wrong (for example, someone is described as &quot;flaunting&quot; a convention).If you're not someone who notices these things, it's a good read.

This hilarious book recounts a year on the road with the hardcorps of the cookoff world, recipe-inventors who battle it out to win KitchenAid mixers and lottery-sized cash prizes. Big surprise: The, uh, quality of so many winning dishes. Big laughs: The teetering, white-knuckled, very-high drama of competition. Big warning: If you cook, you may find it impossible to resist entering the fray."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"I love to cook, love to talk about cooking, love to read about cooking. I thought &quot;Kitchen Confidential&quot; was a hoot....but &quot;Cookoff&quot; is even better. &quot;Cookoff&quot; is equal parts cultural history, thriller, and comic inspiration. It took me into a world I know nothing about, but about which I had quite negative opinions. But the author introduced me to a broad assortment of imaginative folks, each with a good story, and some even with a recipe I might like to try myself. Sutherland explores interesting ideas about Americans and food, the underlying craving for recognition, sport, and money--she does this with a lot of heart."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"I can't believe I read the whole thing. Are there two different versions of Cookoff? I don't see how anyone could call the author \\"sly\\". \\"Condescending\\" seems more accurate. Humorous? That's a laugh. I found boring stories about ordinary people using inferior processed food products brought to market by overly sensitive sponsors to create recipes that \\"reinforce the most slovenly American food habits-assembling instead of cooking\\". Cookoff is a turkey. Save your time and money, wish I would have."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"As an avid recipe clipper, I've come across some pretty odd concoctions and sometimes just have to wonder, who thinks this stuff up? Thanks to this warm, funny, and engaging book, I now know that I can thank the hardcore recipe \\"contesters\\" who focus their considerable energy on finding yet-unheard-of ways to prepare chicken, discovering new uses for processed foods, and building a better burger. Chronicling a year's worth of the most high-profile cookoffs, Sutherland presents affectionate and often hilarious portraits of some of the most creative and competitive amateur cooks in America. She places the recipe-contest phenomenon in a cultural and historical context, but generally keeps the social commentary to a minimum in favor of great reporting from the front lines of the cookoff circuit. Delicious fun!"},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"What fun.

I have learned a lot about a hobby I have enjoyed for years."},{"Title":"Cookoff : Recipe Fever in America","review":"Cookoff: Recipe Fever in America is a delightful book, especially for readers who enjoy cookbooks and cooking magazines. Amy Sutherland, a journalist from Maine, got invited to the Pillbury Bake Off rather serendipitously and decided to go, pretty much as a lark, figuring that it would prove an amusing piece of Americana. Sutherland was surprised to discover an entire cookoff subculture, with an entertaining cast of characters and no shortage on drama. Her experience at the Bake Off inspired her to spend over a year traveling around the country, spending time at cookoffs and time with contesters: cookoff professionals, some of whom have won substantial sums of money for their devoted cooking efforts. Each chapter focuses on either a particular cookoff, or a particular aspect of cookoffs, such as what happens when cheating occurs. Sutherland is a wonderful writer, able to keep you in suspense (and actually make you care!) over who would actually each cookoff. I really enjoyed reading this book; it is pretty much a refreshing change from anything I have read in a long time. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys reading about food.

I am not much of a cook. I rarely ever cook, and my husband and kids are better for it. Nonetheless, I loved this book. I read the stories of culinary expertise with great envy, yet with great fascination. The dedication and the creativity of the so-called \\"contesters\\" who live and breathe the competitive cooking lifestyle astounded me. This is a great study of average people who find their skill in not-so-average arenas. I actually found myself tensing up as the contests covered would come to an end, hoping my favorites would do well (and the snobbish ones would not). Piece of advice: if you like the suspense of it, don't flip ahead to the end of the chapter, as the winning recipe is there in plain sight. I expected to bump into some slow spots, but there were none to be found for me. This book kept my interest through to the end. There are personalities to love, and there are personalities to hate, just like any good book. Who knew a book about competitive cooking could be so thrilling? And who knows? I may just attempt to whip up one of the winning dishes. Maybe there's a chef somewhere in me, after all. Read this book, and you will never watch \\"The Food Network\\" the same way. I may even create my own recipe to enter into the competitions. Pickled Eggs and Spam, anyone? No?

It did nothing to add to the book-but detract it did."},{"Title":"Herodotus,","review":"This is a review of Michael A. Flower's and John Marincola's commentary on Book IX of Herodotus's Histories for the Cambridge green and yellow series. Book IX is the final book of Herodotus's Histories and contains, among other things, Herodotus's accounts of the Battles of Plataea and Mycale, the immediate aftermath of the Persians' defeat in and withdrawal from mainland Greece, and the Siege of Sestos. F&M; are particularly interested in showing how Book IX achieves closure for the Histories as a whole and how it prefigures the political-cultural landscape of the mid-late fifth century BC, when Herodotus was writing, so a reader interested in Herodotus's aspirations/agenda as a historian and author and how Herodotus's narrative anticipates later (particularly Athenian) historical developments will find this commentary particularly enlightening.This edition consists of a 50 page introduction, 50 pages of Greek text, about 215 pages of commentary, four brief appendices occupying 11 pages, a very comprehensive bibliography of almost 20 pages (current through 2002), and two indexes (one for Greek terms, and one for general topics). The authors provide enough grammatical and lexical help that a student in his or her third or fourth year of studying Greek should be able to read Book IX with little difficulty using the commentary, and the majority of the notes in fact are primarily designed to help with translation. However, the discussions of literary and historical issues are fairly complex and clearly pitched to an advanced audience, so this edition is probably not suitable for a student reading Greek prose for the first time (Amy Barbour's textbook \\"Selections from Herodotus\\" is a better option in this respect). Unlike many modern commentaries on the works of ancient historians, the treatment of historiographic problems is balanced quite well with discussions of the literary qualities of Herodotus's text. Delineating Herodotus's appropriation of Homeric language and ideology, for example, is accorded just as much importance as evaluating the historical accuracy of Herodotus's narrative. Readers who are interested in Herodotus from either a literary critical angle or from a historical angle will therefore both find useful material in this commentary.There are number of other features of this edition that are worthy of note. The introduction - in addition to containing the usual accounts of Herodotus's life and times, an overview of his style and techniques as an author/historian, a very brief reckoning of the manuscripts, and an analysis of the major themes, characters, and events of Book IX - also includes a concise guide to Herodotus's Ionic dialect, giving readers who are only familiar with Attic prose a handy aid for identifying and understanding Ionic forms. The four appendices provide Greek texts of and commentary on primary sources that complement the narrative of Book IX (i.e. Simonides' poem on Plataea, the putative dedication of the seer Teisamenus, and the so-called 'Oath of Plataea') as well as a list of the troops composing the Greek and Persian battle lines at Plataea.It is not possible in a short review to enumerate all the different questions and issues F&M; cover in their notes, but I will say that their commentary is one of the most wide-ranging, erudite, and thought-provoking that I have encountered in this or any other series of commentaries on ancient texts. It is one of the few commentaries on the market that attempts to address ALL aspects of a text in detail while still prioritizing providing grammatical help to the student-reader, and on the whole it succeeds remarkably well in doing so. Moreover, the commentary is composed in a very straight-forward and engaging style and is often quite entertaining. For example, as part of a note on Herodotus's account of the seer Hegesistratus, who had to escape a Spartan prison by mutilating his foot so that he could wrest it free from the chain that bound it, F&M; remark (pg.177) with perfect aplomb: \\"Two physicians have confirmed for us that Hegesistratus could have survived and not bled to death before reaching Tegea\\".In short, then, this commentary combines magisterial learning with judicious organization and presentation, and should definitely be read by anyone with a few years of Greek and a serious interest in Herodotus and Greek History."},{"Title":"Alone With Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism (Grove Press Eastern philosophy and literature series)","review":"I found this book of approximately 130 pages absolutely fascinating. While it is very non-traditional, it provides a bridge that helps the modern person to relate some of the most important concepts of Buddhism through the bridge provided by Western existentialist thought.This book is very well written and Stephen Batchelor is very credible as an author having spent considerable time in Asia and having been a monk for 10 years in both the Tibetan and Zen traditions. While the book is largely his own perspective, it is a valuable one given his life experience and ability to convey complex topics in easy to understand terms. It certainly got my attention!If you are looking to read your first book on Buddhism or Existentialism, this is probably not for you. However, if you are familiar to one or both of these topics and/or are looking to understand the human condition more deeply, then you will not be disappointed at the ideas presented here.For me, this was a two sitting book that completely engaged me. I have read many books on Buddhism and Existentialism and thought this had a lot to offer a modern person in terms of making Buddhism relevant to modern contexts. I also found it a useful and sensitive exploration of the nature of loneliness and the limitations of the human condition. Among other things, it poignantly expressed how loneliness and the reality of our ultimate death could help us deepen our experience of reality through relationship and fuller engagement with life."},{"Title":"Alone With Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism (Grove Press Eastern philosophy and literature series)","review":"I've read this book three times and each time I get more out of the reading. The author is able to break down, explain, and connect the various Buddhist approaches with insight and clarity. Sometimes the language and references can be challenging (there's a glossary in the back) but his take on the commonalities of Buddhism and Christianity are some of the best and they are motivating me to read Paul Tillich, John MacQuarrie, and Martin Heidegger just to find out more. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Alone With Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism (Grove Press Eastern philosophy and literature series)","review":"I sense the author is just pushing his own view on buddhism (or... existentialism) through this book: this is not a study of the crossroads between buddhism and existentialism, but the author's own view on buddhism expressed in the terms of existential thinking.St. Batchelor in this book holds a view about buddhism very much close to that of contemporary Vietnamese zen buddhism. They see the world as manyfold manifestations all sprung from one unique universal 'tank' ('alaya vijnana'); consequently they hold the view that all things and beings in this universe are linked together in complete solidarity. This is one view: but this is not really essential either to buddhism or to existentialism. It also seems to me somewhat oversimplified as a moral and as a cosmic hypothesis. Personal responsability and gratuitous compassion are closer to ancient, theravada buddhism.Anyway, I much preferred--and would recommend--the same author's \\"Buddhism without belief\\" as a contemporary, 'modernist' approach to the ageless and visionary wisdom of buddhism!"},{"Title":"Alone With Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism (Grove Press Eastern philosophy and literature series)","review":"This is a fantastic book...but it may never become the widely-read classic it deserves to be. The reason is that it is written \\"inspired by\\" the language of Martin Heidegger's existentialist masterpiece Being & Time. If you've never read Being & Time you might struggle to make sense of the significance of such terms as \\"Being Alone\\" and \\"Inauthentic Being-with-Others.\\" These terms, and many like them, were used and fleshed out in Being & Time. Without this background the reader could perhaps miss the full picture that Batchelor is trying to convey. I don't mean this as a value judgment - you have either read Heidegger or you haven't. I've read Heidegger, but not Wittgenstein, for example. No shame in that. I took a class on Heidegger's Being & Time while in college. I found it to be both the most difficult book I've ever read and one of the most rewarding. Because of this previous exposure to Heidegger, I was able to get right into Batchelor's flow in this wonderful book. Perhaps I am wrong about this. I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from reading this book. It really is a little masterpiece.In any case, Batchelor does a wonderful job of contrasting Authentic and Inauthentic Being Alone and Being with Others. If you have had exposure to Existentialist thinking, particularly Heidegger and are interested in an analysis of Buddhism using that terminology and approach, then this is THE book for you."},{"Title":"Alone With Others: An Existential Approach to Buddhism (Grove Press Eastern philosophy and literature series)","review":"The author, who is very knowledgeable about the subject, helps explain why Buddha talked about despair and anguish and offers some insight into how the human condition can improve using Siddhartha's methods.

If you are looking for a single-volume source, this is probably one of the best. The authors devote 14 chapters to virtually all aspects of M&amp;A. In process, with clarity and eloquence, they explain the \\"Watson Wyatt Deal Flow Model\\" which, after appropriate modifications, can be applied to almost any organization involved in M&amp;A negotiations, either as a buyer or as a seller. The final chapter, all by itself, is well worth the cost of the book. In it, the authors suggest various \\"keys\\" to M&amp;A success. They then provide:Resource A: Sample Task Force CharterResource B: Integration Planning TemplateResource C: Executive Summary of Watson Wyatt Worldwide's 1998-1999 Mergers and Acquisitions SurveyWhat we have here is a single-volume in which two experts on the subject of M&amp;A seem to share everything they know about the subject. Even if your company is not currently a buyer or seller, its senior-level executives should read this book. Why? Because you just never know. Perhaps sooner than now anticipated, your company will be courted by another...or it will be attracted to another company as a prospective acquisition.

Timothy J. Galpin and Mark Herndon clearly have vast experience and draw on case studies to illustrate their suggestions. They provide sample surveys and integration flow charts to guide hands-on planning, and offer practical advice that you can apply in real-world situations. Not all of these ideas are new, nor do the authors claim them to be. Instead, they apply the most relevant ideas from management and psychology to M&amp;A. The authors hammer home an extremely consistent message: You must communicate. They present their ideas clearly, even though the book is often wordy and uses a lot of passive voice (alas, business prose).

Based on the research that organization has collected, Canfield offers a three-part \\"blueprint\\" for good fathering.First, Canfield says, every father should resolve his relationship with his own father so that he can effectively build relationships with his children. Second, a father must be involved, consistent, aware, and nurturing. Third, Canfield offers perspective on each stage of fathering, from having an infant to becoming a grandparent.For what Canfield has to say, this is a long book (288 pages). Part of the problem is that Canfield loves to belabor his points. He does a ton of recapping, whether from chapter to chapter or paragraph to paragraph. It doesn't help that the content within a number of the early chapters doesn't feel well-organized.When it comes to problem-solving, Canfield is always frustratingly general, as he tends to drop out of his anecdotes at key moments. So we never get to hear how this fathering expert disciplined his children in any specific situations, and he often presents challenging problems without offering solutions of any kind.Canfield is more specific with the long-term approach a father should take. Yet his list of mandates feels inhumanly rigid - no one could possibly do all of it and still keep any ambitions of his own. It gives the book a feel of, \\"Kids are great, but you've got to abandon all your hopes and dreams to raise them right.\\" He also advocates effusively praising your children on a level that feels disingenuous.Canfield is right on the basics: listen to your children, love them unconditionally, be involved in their lives, build them up, and so forth. No one's disputing that. But this book isn't the best way to get these points across."},{"Title":"The New Great Trek - The Story of South Africa's White Exodus","review":"The First Great Trek took place due to a lack of economic opportunities and independence for the Cape Dutch, or Afrikaaners.

Don't let the fact that it is an anthropology book scare you off- it is not overly dry or academic in the least. While it is very informative and contains a lot of info about politics and ethnicity in the Isthmus, it's written in a casual, personal style that is extremely readable. It contains a lot of funny anecdotes that really brought the Isthmus alive for me. I found myself becoming immersed in the author's vivid descriptions of the countryside, the towns, the colorful characters he met and the political rallies that he attended. More than anything it reads like a travel book, but with a bit more substance. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and would recommend it to anyone who plans to travel to Oaxaca, or is remotely interested in indigenous Mexico."},{"Title":"Mexican Memoir: A Personal Account of Anthropology and Radical Politics in Oaxaca","review":"This comment is not about the content of the book, which I am sure I would enjoy. It is about the extremely-poor formatting, which makes the book impossible to read. Some lines have words scrunched together and, since some of the book is in Spanish and Zapotec, it is hard to figure out. Some lines have only one word. Some letters are even backward! Since so much of the book is in other languages, the reader is reliant on the footnotes but, as they are at the back of the chapter, one has to spend a lot of time finding them. This is much more annoying in a Kindle than in a conventional book. I had expected that I might be able to highlight the text and find the footnote, but the Kindle book isn't configured that way.I won't be buying any serious academic texts from Kindle until this problem is resolved."},{"Title":"The Greatest Disasters of the 2oth Century","review":"I own a copy of this book as part of a large personal library of disaster books.

Possibly I enjoyed it as much as I did because at the time I was actually in Africa (Zambia to be exact). This of course made the situations brought up all the more relevant to me. Each character that Ms Harper wove into the story was someone I felt on a particular level I could empathise with. It also made the situations they were in clearly understandable.The book is set in a game park well away from any areas of civilisation. The first half of the book is basically concerned with giving the readers the characters backgrounds ( a eccentric professor and his students from Pretoria University of a field trip, the game rangers, lodge manager and his wife and a variety of guests) and then bringing them in all together, normally I would have felt that the book was dragging on while I waited for the action to happen, however this was not the case. Each person she brought into the book was such interest to me that I honestly didn't care that I had spent had half the book becoming aquainted with them.When I think back it is amazing how many characters she included, and strangely each one seems as interesting and understandable as the next. On face value this is no more than a situation drama but it was much more... significant. Ms Harper shows both the good and bad sides of the human character and social, mental and phisical handicaps that people have and can survive throughI would highly recommend anyone to read this book, and any others of hers."},{"Title":"Jackal's Dance","review":"could not put it down once I started reading loved it. Made me want to go to Africa to see the place for my self"},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"Illumination (1896) has been an underground classic among serious writers and readers since its publication. Although it sold well in its day, it was largely lost to mainstream attention for most of the 20th century. Only in the 1980s did it first start appearing in school settings with the first critical edition by Nebraska Press (and Penguin Press editions around the same time). It has been called an \\"American classic\\" by more than one critic and writer.First, an explanation of the odd title. Frederic intended the title to be simply \\"Illumination\\", which it was indeed published as in England, but due to some mis-communication at his (soon to be bankrupt) American publishers - a working draft had the internal working name of \\"damnation\\" - it was mistakingly published as \\"The Damnation of Theron Ware\\". Later publishers in the 1930s then combined the two into the full title \\"The Damnation of Theron Ware, Or, Illumination\\".This is an important novel and can be critically approached from a number of perspectives. Probably most important and timeless (c.f. Richard Dawkins \\"The God Delusion\\" (2006)) is Theron Ware's \\"Illumination\\" about truth in religion. Is the value of religion based on the belief in a real God, or just a belief in a god that may not even exist - the existence of which doesn't matter - the value in religion comes from _pretending_ to believe. It is unclear in the end if Sister Soulsby, Forbes and others truly believe, or just pretend to believe, and if it even matters.The narrative technique of writing from Theron's perspective, hearing in the first person about his own \\"Illumination\\" and personal growth (a positive healthy thing it seems to him) - which is then re-played at the end of the novel from other peoples perspective, is very powerful and well crafted. It really makes the reader examine times in their own lives when they thought they were on the right and true path. It has a certain Rashomon theme of subjectivity and what is the truth of events from multiple perspectives."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"I'm a lousy writer, so a positive review is difficult for me to write-- it is always easier to write a negative review, but I'll do my best because I feel like this work is ridiculously neglected. Besides being a fascinating document of social and intellectual trends in mid to late 19th century America, it is a wonderful study of an individual who does not comprehend the limits of his own intellect. Ultimately, it is about self delusion. The theme is relevant today."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"Pastor Theron Ware of a hard-shell Methodist congregation in up-state New York in the late nineteenth century faces hostility among his people and seeks advice and comfort from sophisticated neighbors, including a seductive red-head with money and talent. The slippery path he enters on is not so much one of sin as of self-delusion, a penchant he never really escapes. His poor, put-upon wife and a pair of slightly shabby &quot;debt-raisers&quot; (=fund-raisers) provide him a refuge amid his general ruin. The Methodist Church described in this novel apparently existed in spots in the late nineteenth century but would be unrecognzied today. For one example, the novel explains that not only was Theron Ware a Republican but so were his fellow clergy and even all the seminary professors in the denomination. Ultimately it is a story of terminal naivete."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"When I ordered this book for a school project, I wasn't really expecting that much. We had to choose a work of fiction written during and about our time period, which happened to be the time period this book is set in, and we had difficulty finding many options, so we went for this one.I was surprised to find that this book is quite entertaining. **There may be softcore spoilers in the rest of this paragraph**. It tells the story of Theron Ware, an initially down-to-earth pastor living a simple life who ends up moving to a town where some more diverse viewpoints are held. He begins to learn about the lives of the looked-down-upon Irish and become more versed in the ways of science. Frederic does a great job of creating a very vivid setting for his story, and all the characters come to life as Ware tries to reconcile his traditional, protestant, way of life with the twin forces of secularism and Catholicism pressing down on his worldview.Read it for the history, but also for the enjoyment. 4 stars only because it's not on my list of top 20."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"Rather drawn out. I definitely wasn't a page turner but I can see the importance in its time period with the secularization of the American intellectual sphere."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"By all means read the book, but this \\"Quill Pen Classics\\" edition is a glorified print-out. As soon as I opened the cover the two front pages tore away from their binding, and within a day of reading it the cover fell off, with more pages threatening to go. Moreover, the type is bad and faded in parts. Better to find a used Penguin or Modern Library edition. I wish I had."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"Although this is a Faustian tale, the redemption is not uncertain-it is completely absent. The much put out Theron faces his new future in the West as a hopeless innocent, only his wife expresses modest doubt about his re-education. Having succcessfully ruined the surprise ending, I can only suggest everyone find a copy of this wonderful novel, set aside a day, and read it straight through. An amazing work from an under appreciated author."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"This book was good although extremely hard to read and get through. I only finished it because it was for book club. I would not recommend this classic."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"IMHO, this novel can and should be included with the other American novels that we cram down the throats of high-schoolers: Moby Dick, Scarlet Letter, Huckleberry Finn, etc. This is the almost painfully realistic story of a preacher who discovers that there is another world outside his previously sheltered existence. For many of us, this sort of discovery is a happy and broadening experience. But in Ware's case, his new discoveries cause him to reject all the good things about his old life, and to build fantasy castles in the air of his imagination. In his increasingly desperate attempt to escape into a fantasy life, he leaves behind many of his values and ethical standards - not least his responsibilities to those he loves.This book will hit a nerve for many readers - it did for me. It is easy for the reader to identify with Ware and realize only too late, as Ware did, that he is embarking on an illusory and self-destructive quest. Frederick constructed both the plot and the character of Ware perfectly, and this novel is worth everyone's time to read. You will keep thinking about it long after you have closed the book for the last time."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"&quot;The Damnation of Theron Ware&quot; starts out as a quietly damning portrait of small-town piety, but slowly gains momentum until, at the end, it hits you like a sledgehammer. The title character, a naive, self-satisfied young Methodist minister, is a cautionary figure for us all; introduced tentatively to a world of sophistication, he loses faith in all the old verities of his life, with nothing but a few poses and attitudes to replace them. Even at the end, trying to make a new start, his self-delusion is breathtaking. Harold Frederic had the misfortune to die at 42, just as he was starting to hit his stride as a novelist. Had he lived to write even another 10 years, he might be a household name today."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"Over 20 years working as a bookseller, this is the novel I would most often recommend to customers who were seeking a truly entertaining out-of-the-ordinary novel. I've read it three times now, and am looking forward to a fourth in the next year or so. The main characters are fresh and utterly believable and they are surrounded by a fine cast of eccentrics. Frederic is a exceptionally visual writer. This book would make a fabulous movie."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"This book flows and entertains 'til the end. Frederic combines naturalism, realism, and romanticism all in one book and truly touches the heart. The tragedy of this common man opens our eyes to how easy it is to lose our innocence and fall from our pride. I definately recommend this book to anyone who ever ponders about life and the meaning of it."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"I won't bother repeating the plot line or lift any of the criticism found in the introduction, instead I will offer my thoughts on this amazing book.1. It is an excellent picture of what religion may have really been like in the 1880s in upstate New York. I especially enjoyed the revelation that the barnstormer preachers didn't really believe in the religion, but rather did preached fire and brimstone because that was what they were good at and needed a gig. I am sure that is how it has been for centuries in any religion, I never considered that before.2. What is most amazing to me is that Theron Ware was convinced he was making good decisions as he transformed himself, that he was improving himself by associating with intelligent interesting people, rather than the boring, uneducated people of his own religion. Yet, though he thought he was improving, in the eyes of those he wanted most to like him, he was devolving into a terrible person. This makes me wonder, I suppose, when we make decisions in life to pursue some course of action, or to be some sort of way, it doesn't necessarily make us a better person, although at the time we may think it might.3. I didn't think the book was that clear on why the Catholics thought little of him. Granted they didn't like him talking bad about his own folks, still, that does not make a person unlikeable. To me this was confusing and perhaps poorly presented, but perhaps that is how life is.4. It seems that Theron would have remained most likable and respectable if he would have kept to his own people and not dabbled with these \\"out of the box\\" type thoughts. But how can a man who sees the emptiness and backwardness of his co-religionists remain? That is what I don't understand.5. Theron thought he was very clever, when actually he was somewhat uneducated, and looked down upon by those who were. Reminds me of myself. Whenever you start thinking you know something, remember Theron Ware.6. Celia reminds me of some hard core left wing artist types I went to college with. It is hard for me to believe that people like that existed in the US in the 1880s. I have had to revise my understanding of history somewhat.Overall, this is a thought-provoking book about life in general and how best to conduct it, but it doesn't offer any answers, but some difficult questions that I tried to present above.Theron made some mistakes, but before we condemn him, I think it would be best to put yourself in his shoes and ask yourself, what would you have done differently? Probably nothing, and you would have ended up in the same place he did.I have a version with an introduction by Everett Carter. If you have that introduction, don't bother reading it before and certainly not after. It is worthless unless you are a serious literature student."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"This was a very popular novel of 1896, and is considered by many to be a literary classic. Theron Ware enters the scene as a small town Methodist Minister. He and his wife seem to be humble folk and settle into a small house near his church. Soon he meets a Catholic priest, an atheist physician, and a beautiful Irish lass. They make quite an impression on him. They are sophisticated, well educated, and quite worldly. Alas, they are such a strong influence on him that he starts playing the worldly role, and begins to look down on his job and his religion. He also finds himself strongly attracted to the lovely Celia Madden. I should mention that in those days the Irish were assigned to the caste of untouchables.Theron acts as if he is now a man of the world, although he knows nothing of the literature, music, and philosophy discussed by others. He becomes a boring, mean minded buffoon. The book continues with his steady degradation, a preacher who has become a victim of that secular humanism that our current day fundamentalists complain so much about.The novel provides an interesting view of religion and culture of the late 1800s. It was somewhat difficult for me to understand how such a seemingly pious man could turn into such a churlish fellow. Perhaps his upbringing was quite religiously strict, and he developed a strong reaction formation to it all."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"Okay, granted. In some ways, this is pretty thin soup. A short novel, after all, and not by any stretch of the imagination a major novel, certainly not in the sense that Middlemarch or Ulysses are major. But I'd put this on a list of personal favorites. And there are certain second rate novels which for all their second-rateness should not be lost. Frederic lived not too long, accomplished not very much, saw not everything there was to be seen - but in this little fable of a Methodist preacher who never quite got the point, Frederic himself pretty much gets it right. Not a mean achievement for a lifetime, and so one not to be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"I would love to recommend this novel. Frederic writes about realistic characters and issues pertinent to America during the 1890's with a touch of irony and subtlety. Frederic is somewhat comparable to William Dean Howells and Stephen Crane in that he was writing at the same time about similar issues. He incorporated techniques of both realism and naturalism, which blended into a unique style distinctly his own. Unfortunately, Frederic is currently a forgotten author. This is the only book of his that is now in print. Please read this novel and pass the word so that Frederic and his work does not remain forgotten."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"Although I was a lit major, this book was never on any of my reading lists in college. I chanced upon it when it appeared on my son's required reading for a course..and wow, am I glad I did! It should be a classic, have no idea why it isn't, if only for the detail and insight about church politics and the workings of congregations in the 1800s.This gem of a novel focuses on Theron Ware, a Methodist minister who has had a less than stellar career, which leads to his current posting in a small, backcountry town. He vows to make a new start and, for a time, things seem to go well. But alas, Theron is less certain than he appears, making him easy prey to those with questionable values and setting him on a parth towards destruction. For the first time in his life, Theron questions his calling, his values and even his marriage.I couldn't wait to see how this one would end..and I won't give the ending away here. I'll just say that if you pick up this one, you won't be disaapointed."},{"Title":"The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination","review":"I found this book on my father's bookshelf and brought it home to read. I'm not sure why I picked it--nothing about the title or description excited me too much, so it sat on my own bookshelf forgotten for several months. Finally, hurriedly getting ready for a vacation I needed a book to read and found Theron Ware. I loved it so much that I went right out and bought my own copy. I recommended it to my 21 year old son and he loved it too. One caution though, do NOT read the introduction first--it gives the entire plot away. Save it for after when you can savor the analysis."},{"Title":"Lombard Street -A Description of the Money Market","review":"Walter Bagehot was the first editor of the now world-famous Economist magazine, which has in many ways remained faithful to the liberal philosophy (in a European sense)of its founder. Lombard Street might be difficult to read at first, but as with Charles Dickens once you get used to the style the tale is riveting. And his advice on how a central bank, as the lender of last resort, should behave in the face of a banking crisis remains valid to this day."},{"Title":"Lombard Street -A Description of the Money Market","review":"Can a book about finance written in 1873 be helpful in a world with complex financial markets and plenty of information about how they work? The answer is yes. It is not that \\"Lombard Street\\" is a classic that one finds quoted many a time; the reader's interest should transcend historical inquiry or curiosity; \\"Lombard Street\\" should be read and revered by anyone interested in the underlying, abiding features of financial markets.But what are those characteristics? Bagehot, then editor of The Economist, writes that credit centers on trust: \\"Credit means that a certain confidence is given, a certain trust reposed.\\" And, banks always have on-demand liabilities that far exceed their readily available assets. In short, credit works on trust, and the system, in the absence of trust, can fall apart rapidly.What follows from these premises is a careful examination of how the money market came about, what its uses are, how its operations are connected to trade and country's overall welfare, and, most importantly, how central banks can deal with financial crises. Written elegantly, \\"Lombard Street\\" is, at the same time, an introductory overview of the market and a trenchant analysis of its most salient features.But what makes \\"Lombard Street\\" timeless is that it deals with finance in its human form. Bagehot talks about power, prestige and perception as much as he does about interest, discount, and credit. Trust is based on institutions and people: the human features of finance-trust, anxiety, mania, optimism-are timeless and apply to the financial markets of the nineteenth, twentieth, or twenty-first century. That is why \\"Lombard Street\\" is an ever useful introduction and guide."},{"Title":"Lombard Street -A Description of the Money Market","review":"Wiley Investment Classics generally fall into two categories, tough and dreary reads full of information, and lively entertaining accounts which also educate. Unfortunately, Mr. Bagehot and Mr. Bernstein's text is the former. The book does an outstanding job of promoting the importance of a strong central banking system and the importance of strict credit control when combating financial crises. However, it does so amidst extremely repetitive and somewhat painful language. The authors provide outstanding quantitative and anecdotal evidence supporting their case, but they do so in such a way that makes the book a true labor to read.This book would be very beneficial to anyone doing research on, or working for some kind of central banking organization. Otherwise, I would suggest looking to any of the other Wiley Investment Classics for a more interesting and educational read about finance."},{"Title":"Lombard Street -A Description of the Money Market","review":"This is an excellent book.

I wish I had read it many years ago. But I have to wince at the terrible job Echo Library did in printing it.It's full of obvious missing spaces so that words run together, likethesewords.This happens on almost every page. The author, Walter Bagehot, includes some actual balance sheets from the Bank of England as examples. Yet Echo Library fails to align the figures into columns. Instead it appears as a bunch of jibberish.It appears that Echo Library somehow acquired a text file of the book, perhaps as a Word document or something, and then simply output that onto paper and binder, and then shipped the books, without even glancing at the results, let alone proof reading it.Also, apparently to save paper, the publisher made the type size a bit small, and made the page column a bit wide. That saves paper alright, and makes it a thinner book, but it makes it harder to read. But it's still worth reading because Bagehot is so good.MY RECOMMENDATION: It's an excellent writing by Bagehot, first class. But buy it by another publisher."},{"Title":"Lombard Street -A Description of the Money Market","review":"The great Victorian book about what we now call central banking really needs to introduction.

Some pieces are of mainly historical interest, but not most. Neither is it a 'religious title', in fact it is nearly irreligious in places. It merely takes issue with arty types like Mr. Kipling, G.B. Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Whistler. It is also vintage Chesterton, at his usual paradoxical, oblique, witty, funny, slapstick, sardonic, jolly, and generous best.It is a positive and happy book, but it was accused of Negativism in its day (Kafka said Chesterton was so full of joy that you might almost suppose 'he had found God'--perverse but honest.) Another exasperated opponent, said that if he was so clever and all-knowing he should write down his own personal positive beliefs. So he did. They are still read today, and many who enjoy 'Orthodoxy' (1908) will enjoy this, its progenitor too, which is impossible to summarize, so I have given a thumbnail of each chapter.CONTENTSChapter 1. Introductory remarks on the importance of orthodoxyThe examined life - meaninglessness of modern subjective attitudes of not owning your own point of view. Decline of respect for reason and rational argument - political correctness, or 'Good taste, the last and vilest of human superstitions'. To know a man's worldview is to know him. Pernicious effects of subjectivism in literature and the arts.2. On the negative spiritEssential need for positive belief - no society can prosper on negative laws alone. Progress in human rights of liberty, education, free speech, and tolerance are only guaranteed with 'a definite creed and a cast-iron code of morals'.3. On Mr. Rudyard Kipling and making the world smallKipling considerable poet but no true patriot, but proto-fascist. [GKC probably first to spot this.] Worships strength and discipline, empire-building, for their own sake. 'He admires England, but he does not love her'.4. Mr. Bernard Shaw***GOOD***[GKC being good friend of GBS.] GBS brilliant and witty, but hopeless subjectivist. GBS attacks all pretensions as 'every moral generalization oppressed the individual; the golden rule was there is no golden rule'. But then why should we allow Him to make the One Rule that rules them all? Perpetrates errors of sociologist/anthropologist, still with us today.5. Mr. H.G. Wells and the giants***GOOD***Wells' faith in Evolutionism (as opposed to evolution) shown to be false - 'the scientific fallacy...of not beginning with the human soul...but with some such thing as protoplasm'. The demonstrable fact of original sin in the universal existence of selfishness. Wells' Utopia assumes selfishness can be cured by ignoring it, not curing it. 'Heresy of immoral hero-worship' (ie, celebrity).6. Christmas and the aesthetesEssential nature of ritual. Attacks 'The religion of Comte, generally known as Positivism, or the worship of humanity'. Comte's attempt to institute a secular religion - ritual the only sensible part of his theory as it expresses the deepest meaning and emotion. 'Take away what is supernatural, and what remains is the unnatural.'7. Omar and the sacred vine***EXCELLENT***Correct attitude to wine and the good things of life. Not a mere mean between excess and teetotalism but a proper enjoyment of what is good. 'Drink because you are happy, but never because you are miserable...poetical drinking...is joyous and instinctive'. 'Happiness is a mystery like religion, and should never be rationalized...If we are to be truly gay, we must believe that there is some eternal gaiety in the nature of things.'8. The mildness of the yellow pressTabloids. No so much sensational as stunted, mendacious, and silly. [So no change there then.]9. The moods of Mr. George MooreSatirical. Pride, least attractive of all faults.10. On sandals and simplicityGentle mockery of the vegetarian impulse.11. Science and the savages***GOOD***Materialism (philosophical). Sociology/anthropology inadequate methodology. Starts by excluding what they pretend to disprove existence of. Study of primitives less revealing than study of one's own soul. [cf. Pascal Boyer]12. Paganism and Mr. Lowes Dickinson***EXCELLENT***Dickinson represents ancient Greeks as 'an ideal of full and satisfied humanity', ie, he is a humanist/New Ager. Replaced by Christianity because rational but sad pagan virtues such as justice and temperance insufficient. Great Christian virtue is humility. Mystical and happy values of faith, hope, and charity are essential, even if seem irrational.13. Celts and Celtophiles***GOOD***Race: a non-concept [genetically ahead of his time!]. Nationhood: a definable spiritual concept. Irish a nation, not a race.14. On certain modern writers and the institution of the familyDefence of the family against Nietzsche & co.15. On smart novelists and the smart setAnalysis of 'penny dreadfuls' and 'halfpenny novelettes'.16. On Mr. McCabe and a divine frivolityUse of humor defended in serious debate (against po-faced atheist).17. On the wit of Whistler***EXCELLENT***Errors of relativism in art as in ethics: illustration of the mutable camel. The artist Whistler: 'He was one of those people who always live up to their emotional incomes, who are always taut and tingling with vanity'. Three type of satirist who are also great men (illustrated by Rabelais, Swift, and Pope. Whistler talked too much about his art to be a great artist.18. The fallacy of the young nationA nation may be chronologically young and spiritually old, or vice versa. Eg, Ancient Greece and America.19. Slum novelists and the slums***EXCELLENT***Patronizing novelists writing of the lower classes, eg Somerset Maugham. Undemocracy in Britain.20. Concluding remarks on the importance of orthodoxy'Man can be defined as the animal that makes dogmas.''If we want doctrines we go to great artists.''The more we are certain what good is, the more we shall see good in everything.''We have a general view of existence, whether we like it or not; it alters, or, to speak more accurately, it creates and involves everything we say and do, whether we like it or not.' True."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"This book is a sort of prequal to Chesterton's most famous apologetic work, \\"Orthodoxy.\\" \\"Heretics\\" is a collection of papers that Chesterton wrote to expose what he considered to be the unhealthy philosophies of his day. A critic later wrote of this work, \\"I will begin to worry about my philosophy...when Mr. Chesterton has given us his.\\" Chesterton then wrote the book \\"Orthodoxy\\" in response to that comment.With that said, it is well to note that \\"Heretics\\" and \\"Orthodoxy\\" should be read almost as a single work. From the viewpoint of Chesterton, \\"Heretics\\" is the critique of bad philosophy and \\"Orthodoxy\\" is the defense of good philosophy.The trouble with \\"Heretics\\" is that it is such a local book. What I mean is that this book is a series of analytical criticisms of specific men during that specific time period (late 19th century to early 20th century) and it is easy to miss the points Chesterton makes if you are not familiar with the philosophies and views of the men he is critiquing. That isn't to say this book isn't one Chesterton's finest works. Yet, I would certainly reccomend \\"Heretics: The Annotated Edition\\" to anyone who is not very familiar with these particular early 20th century English writers which he is referring to in this book. The annotated edition makes it much easier to see what Chesterton is saying. For although people change over time, philosophies generally remain the same; and that is why Chesterton's criticisms of these philosophies are still relevant. And as stated earlier, this book, in a way, sets up the groundwork for \\"Orthodoxy,\\" which is still considered a masterpiece; and almost certainly worth reading for anyone who does not understand or sympathize with the sentiment and romance of the Christian faith."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"George Bernard Shaw, the subject of one of the essays in this book, once wrote that morals were for the middle class. The lower class couldn't afford them and the upper class could afford to do without them. Modern day &quot;thinkers&quot; assail the Judeo-Christian ethic as irrelevant to any class and pride themselves on their thoroughly contemporary avant-garde world view. How ironic it is that this thoroughly modern iconoclasm has been around for at least 100 years.Chesterton weighs in on the &quot;heretics&quot; of his day who prided themselves in their heretical superiority to conservative orthodoxy. These heretics seem to have had a worldview not much out of step with modern avant-garde thought. Chesterton's critique of these ideas is lucid, lyrical, and logical. The passage of 100 years has obscured the context of much of what he says, but his conclusions are as timely today as they were yesterday."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"A fantastic book by a great writer, highly recommend it for anyone interested in Apologetics, or just fun argument should definitely read it. While this review will hardly do justice to him, Chesterton is amazingly complex, and while sometimes incorrect, offensive, or fallacious, he is always intelligent, witty, and generally has an opinion very much worth listening to. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"G.K. Chesterton wrote HERETICS c. 1905. Yet this book is still timely in that popular gurus change opinions and social theories very quickly never realizing how dated the newest fad becomes. Chesterton had the rare ability in exposing many new fads as actually some varient of some ideas that were in vogue during Ancient History.Chesterton never engages in ad hominem arguments. He is careful to metion the merits of those with whom he disagrees. Chesteron focuses on the logical fallacies of his critics and never engages in bitterness or smear tactics.Readers should carefully read Chesterton's cirticisms of G.B. Shaw. Chesterton asserts the validity of Shaw's Socialism. Chesterton does not argue with Shaw's socialist views per se. He does critisize Shaw's tendenacy toward a mechanical view of society and politics. One should note that in spite of their repeated debates and crticisms of each others' work, Chesterton and Shaw remained life long friends.Chesterton has some interesting comments on political power. Chesteron was probably not a democrat, and his views beginning on page 168 are note worthy. Chesterton remarks condemns those who pick a Caesar. He remarks that people falsely look favorably on such an individual because he, the Strong Man or the Caesar, is not an ordinary man. In other words, men may domocratically opt for someone whom ordinary think is better. This is a form despotism or slavery where the ruler has the sanctions of the victim. Other rulers hold position by heredity right whereby men accept this notion only because of the social order rather than false praise or respect for someone who may be evil and take advantage of men's sychophantic blind obedience to self appointed knaves.Chesterton has good insight regarding the abuse of language and different rules for social classes. If some poor soul is arrested for stealing, he/she is accused of theft. If some who is wealthy is arrested for the same crime, the comment is that the wealthy person has an illness called kleptomania. To paraphrase Chesterton, the wealthy want to make laws ( or in their case excuses)while decent people want to obey the law and expect everyone to do the same.G.K. Chesterton writes well and uses reason as his guide. He did not get angry when his critics attacked him for his personal appearance. He was a large man. Chesterton could laugh at himself. However, he got angry when men attacted honesty and truth. Chesterton was a champion of himself or his work. He was a champion of reason, truth, and honesty. Whether one disagrees with him, Chesterton is well worth reading for his prose, knowledge, and logic."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"As he himself affirmed, Chesterton was criticized on numerous occasions for maintaining a seemingly irreverent or flippant tone and attitude while writing about subjects that inherently demand the utmost sincerity. To superficially read Heretics might be to understand the apparent validity of such criticism. On the surface it seems as if Chesterton could not have cared much less about the philosophies of the prominent individuals that he attacks as heretical throughout this work, let alone the vague conception of orthodoxy that he utilizes as a basis of comparison. However, these claims against Chesterton only appear valid until the reader ascertains that the author's wit, jocularity, and jovial nature are not to be confused with insincerity. The light touch that Chesterton applies to heavy though is not an indication of indifference, but rather a testament to the acuity of his mind and subtle genius. It might not, it seems, have been possible for Chesterton, or anyone, to have been more serious and sincere. Chesterton cared very much, and that is what sheds light on Heretics' almost impossibly simple truth.In Heretics, Chesterton outlines the popular philosophies of his day which stood in opposition to not only logic but also that which the author maintained as truth. Amazingly, more than a century later, the same truth is still available and apparent to those who seek it while the same philosophies, although perhaps slightly altered, still stand in direct contradiction to what Chesterton understood to be unmistakable truth. What might be the greatest truth so easily recovered from the pages of Heretics, yet which remains so hidden from the view of the masses, is the incomplete substance, as opposed to the mere falsity, of many philosophies. Chesterton's work, however, was, as he admitted, left unfinished with regard to Heretics and later fulfilled with the publication ofOrthodoxy. If Heretics presented a problem, Orthodoxy presented the solution. Both are timeless classics, and both should be read if an understanding of Christianity in relation to apparent philosophical and ideological truths is sought."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"Just begain reading \\"Heretics.\\" I wish I had found this book, and Chesterton, 30 years ago when I was 20 instead of now when I am 50.Ideas and actions can take decades sometimes a century or more to \\"bloom.\\"During 1905, Chesterton identifies errors that have bloomed and guide/justify our day's thinking & action -- runious errors.Can't wait to finish.Should be required reading."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"Gilbert Keith Chesterton was one of the most influential English writers of the 20th century. His prolific and diverse output included journalism, philosophy, poetry, biography, Christian apologetics, fantasy and detective fiction.Chesterton is constantly at odds with today's world. This is why he is probably more worth reading than any of his contemporaries, like Oscar Wilde, and even GB Shaw and HG Wells, because today, today we live under their liberal values. His writings on the subject of democracy should be required reading for anyone with the right to vote: our society is almost completely ignorant on that subject, to its tremendous detriment. Nearly every essay in \`Heretics' is a revelation; and \`Orthodoxy' is practically a study in how subtle and surprising good sense can be.In Heretics, Chesterton has this to say of Wilde:The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.He writes of Shaw:After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.You are about to read one of the most intelligent, well written books ever produced.Orthodoxy: The Romance of Faith"},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"Heretics consists of penetratingly intellectual, yet humorous, good-natured, and good-sported, polemics against various philosophies and art movements of Chesterton's day. Most of the people he attacks are people I did not recognize by name, but their philosophies as he describes them were easily recognizable. He hits them from some rather unique angles, making this a very refreshing read for the philosophically-minded.He gives his opponents due credit and spends the first portion of most of his essays talking about what's *right* about what these people are saying. For the most part he takes a \\"something's missing\\", rather than \\"this is wrong\\", approach, trying, you might even say, to build them up rather than tear them down. In this way Chesterton is the \\"yea-sayer\\" that Zarathustra wanted to be in that one chapter of Nietzsche's work.He doesn't push Christianity too strongly in this book, but mentions it enough that you know for sure where he stands. If I ever finally decide to (re-)embrace Christianity, it will be in no small part due to Gilbert K. Chesterton.For a large chunk of my life I regarded Christianity as a pit of psychological death, where people go to turn themselves off and become drones. Turns out this was just my own experience growing up. Without shutting off my critical faculties, I've been nurturing a more open-minded attitude about it, and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised.If your hangup about Christianity is that Christians are lame people, this is the book for you. Chesterton strikes me as having been more \\"fully alive\\" than most people I know."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"Unlike Chesterton, I am not Christian, much less Catholic. I identify with Montaigne or Thoreau and appreciate Twain. Yet, I have never read so much logical, wise and witty argument in a small book, with the exception of the great Dane Piet Hein's grooks (short poems very popular in English translation around 1970). Like Twain putting down the Judeo-Christianity of the Bible, or Wilde on the vogue for things Japanese, Chesterton the conservative will thrill all readers who enjoy carefully crafted tracts, carrying wild trains of thought all the way to the end of the line.Each Essay takes on novelists, poets, philosophers, clergy and so-forth, mostly well-known in his day, introducing some of their work and what they stand for. If Loren Eiseley once re-introduced the symbolic essay to English in the 60's as Annie Dillard once opined in Best American Essays, Chesterton's essays each center on an idea he associates with each person. Three names I recall off-hand are Kipling, Shaw and Wells. The idea associated with Kipling is that he embodies the globe-trotter (what we called a jet-setter in the 60's) as opposed to the farmer who stays put. The world traveler thinking to enlarge his vision, becomes jaded and mentally blinkered as the world \\"shrinks\\" due to the greater speed of travel, while the humble man who never goes out the gate imagines a boundless world and enjoys a blessed life of enchantment. As I paraphrase the argument, it sounds trite, but it, and many others in the book are phrased so well, one can read the essays many times without sharing the fate of the traveler.Please note, my five stars are for the book itself. I think the paperback's cover makes it look like a cheap Christian tract rather than the masterpiece of a subtle man of faith which provides food for thought as fresh today as on the day Chesterton wrote it. I include quotes from Heretics in half a dozen of my books in English and think he may seem less dated than I will in a hundred more years!"},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"Chesterton writes in a style uniquely his own. \\"Heretics\\" is not a book of the theology of heretics. It is rather a critique of the culture of secularism and modernity, a culture that has moved \\"beyond\\" the quaint discussions of religion and universal truths.Chesterton smartly blasts this view that intelligent and enlightened people no longer condescend to consider dogma that would divide the society and determine a truth over against a lie. He points out the hypocrisy, arrogance, vacuous arguments, and inanity of secularism and what today we might call \\"progressivism.\\"The main thrust of this book is to highlight the universal truths of creation and humanity especially that have never been refuted only ignored. He accuses our culture of claiming liberty but prescribing stern rules of conversation; for example, we have freedom of expression but are not allowed to express religious truths in \\"proper\\" society. We can talk about minutae but not about eternal truths of maximum significance.This book is about offending those who claim to be above offense. For orthodox Christians like Chesterton, humor is a spiritual virture and satire is its expression. He is a master at writing satire and eloquently offending his targets while probably making them smile. He writing seems to go astray often but always returns to achieve its objective.Who are the heretics of Chesteron's book? We all are when we deceive ourselves and ignore the truths of God revealed in Jesus Christ. Chesterton gives us permission to laugh at ourselves and our culture while returning humbly to our Creator for whom we have been created for his pleasure."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"\\"In former days, the heretic was proud of not being a heretic. It was the kingdoms of the world and the police and the judges who were heretics. He was orthodox.... All the tortures torn out of forgotten hells could not make him admit that he was heretical. But a few modern phrases have made him boast of it.... The word 'heresy' not only means no longer being wrong; it practically means being clear-headed and courageous.\\" Chesterton begins here and goes on to discuss, in twenty separate, though connected, essays, the fallacies of various literary \\"heretics\\" of his own time (the first edition of this book came out in 1905). Some, such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, definitely fit the strict church definition of a heretic. Others held views that were wrong in his opinion but that did not necessarily contradict the teachings of orthodox Christianity.Chesterton usually compliments the strengths of the people or groups he discusses before criticizing their weaknesses, except in those cases which he believes hold almost no merit whatsoever. His writing is insightful, easily understandable, and--best of all-funny. On the writings of George Moore, an Irishman whom Chesterton thought was overly self-absorbed: \\"We should really be much more interested in Mr. Moore if he were not quite so interested in himself. We feel as if we were being shown through a gallery of really fine pictures, into each of which, by some useless and discordant convention, the artist had represented the same figure in the same attitude. 'The Grand Canal with a distant view of Mr. Moore', 'Effect of Mr. Moore through a Scotch Mist', 'Mr. Moore by Firelight', 'Ruins of Mr. Moore by Moonlight', and so on, seems to be the endless series. He would no doubt reply that in such a book as this he intended to reveal himself.\\"Some of his criticisms are arguable; for example, Chesterton, because of his strong admiration for Ireland, dismissed any theory about the importance of Ireland's Celtic origins altogether (apparently some Englishmen were excusing their poor treatment of Ireland by arguing that England was superior because it was Teutonic and not Celtic). He has something of a point, since the theory is often exaggerated, but because Ireland and other \\"Celtic\\" countries do share many common cultural characteristics, the Celtic theory cannot be completely dismissed. And C. S. Lewis believed part of Chesterton's critique of Rudyard Kipling to be somewhat unfair. Generally, however, Chesterton is very accurate. And he is unfailingly interesting. Who else could finish debunking \\"tolerance\\" by saying \\"Turnips are singularly broad-minded\\"?Chesterton was a convert to Catholicism, but most Protestants will find very little to disagree with religiously in this book, which should be required reading for every modern politician. Chesterton, the traditionalist Liberal (then defined as a supporter of liberty) is neither neatly liberal, conservative, or libertarian by modern definition; liberals will find themselves squirming as he tears apart their weakened concept of democracy, and conservative militarists should squirm as he unveils the failures of British imperialism, which is not unlike their own ideology. Libertarians can do some wiggling of their own when Chesterton comments, \\"The modern man says, 'Let us leave all these arbitrary standards and embrace liberty'. This is, logically rendered, 'Let us not decide what is good, but let it be considered good not to decide it'.\\" Ouch. Though Chesterton penned \\"Heretics\\" over a hundred years ago, most of the ideologies it dismantles are still very prevalent, and it is as timely now as the day it was written."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"This collection of essays is 'Chesterton the Critic' at the top of his game, cutting through intellectual and artistic pretension to get right to the heart of the matter. Some of the people he wields his pen against are still well known names (like H.G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw); others will only be known to serious students of the late Victorian age. But, the book is surprisingly relevant nonetheless. Partly, this is because our own day is still deeply haunted by the errors of the 19th Century so it's not difficult to name for yourself modern proponents of the ideas that Chesterton rides out to do battle with. But it is also due to the fact that Chesterton's method is never just attack. His winsome, witty, warfare of words is ordered toward revealing the hidden or neglected truths that his interlocutors deny or reject or just miss.And those turn out to be important truths about some of the biggest perennial questions:Why should it matter what someone's philisophy is?What's wrong with subjectivism?What is the most secure ground for human rights like free speech, tolerance, and liberty?What is the difference between good patriotism and bad patriotism?Are human beings more than animals?Can we build a great and just society without first addressing human selfishness?Are human beings incorrigibly ritualistic?If so, what is the difference between good ritual and bad?What is the correct attitude toward drinking and other indulgences?Why is sensationalist media so consistently boring?What is the proper relation between the ideas of nation and race?Is Christianity a benefit or a hindrance to society? and how so?Is there any value in \\"low\\" entertainment like romance stories and action/adventure films?Does humor have any place in serious debates about the most important things?Is there any such thing as \\"good\\" art or is it all in the eye of the beholder? to name a few.It's also important to note that Chesterton does not just denounce from on high; much more often he is explaining how he came to change his mind or notice something that he had missed before.Not surprisingly, this book got under the skin of a number of Chesterton's contemporaries. One of them threw out the challenge that if he was so clever and all-knowing he should write down his own personal positive beliefs instead of just criticizing others. So he did. That's how Chesterton's little classic 'Orthodoxy' (1908) came to be."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"Heretics is somewhat neglected in Chesterton's oeuvre, possibly because it is an early work (1905), and many of the writers discussed are out of fashion now. Yet, I believe Heretics contains not only his best writing, but it already establishes the main themes of his life's work.Technically, it is a book of literary criticism, but from an unusual point of view, that of his subjects' philosophy.\\"I am not concerned with Shaw as one of the most brilliant and one of the most honest men alive; I am concerned with him as a heretic--that is to say, a man whose philosophy is solid, quite coherent, and quite wrong.\\" (p. 22)Brilliant though he was, Shaw expected reality to conform to an inhuman ideal:\\"He has all the time been silently comparing humanity with something that was not human, with a monster from Mars, with the Wise Man of the Stoics, with the Economic Man of the Fabians, with Julius Caesar, with Siegfried, with Superman. Now, to have this inner and merciless standard may be a very good thing, or a very bad one, it may be excellent or unfortunate. but it is not seeing things as they are.\\" (pp. 62-63)This is excellent writing, whether we entirely agree or not. It may be a little unfair to Shaw, but it is fair to life.Chesterton is often called an optimist. But he knew the other side, as anyone reading Alzina Stone Dale's life, The Outline of Sanity, can find out. Joy in living, good beer, conversation, balance, sanity, these were achievements, not just nature.I have managed to find a couple of books by George A. Moore, including his autobiographical novel portraying the Paris of the Impressions of the 1870s and 1880s, Confessions of a Young Man. One tends to regard it as a memoir, and Chesterton did so. Chesterton attacks his egoism, the interest in the world as related to his own temperament:\\"We should really be much more interested in Mr. Moore if he were not quite so interested in himself. We feel as if we were being shown through a gallery of really fine pictures, into each of which, by some useless and discordant convention, the artist had represented the same figure in the same attitude. 'The Grand Canal with a distant view of Mr. Moore,\\" \\"Effect of Mr. Moore through a Scotch Mist,' 'Mr. Moore by Firelight,' 'Ruins of Mr. Moore by Moonlight,' and so on seems to be the endless series.\\" (pp. 131-132)That has to be one of the funniest sentences ever written, and I could barely type it for laughing. A bit later on the page, Chesterton gives his vision of originality:\\"Thinking about himself will lead to trying to be the universe; trying to be the universe will lead to ceasing to be anything. If, on the other hand, a man is sensible enough to think only about the universe; he will think about it in his own way. He will keep virgin the secret of God; he will see the grass as no other man can see it, and look at a sun that no man has ever known.\\"There is no space to mention all the wonderful writing in Heretics. I will mention his often expressed view of the narrowness of the larger world, where one can choose one's companions, as opposed to the nation, the neighborhood or the family, where one has to take people the way they are, with all their foibles.\\"The best way that a man could test his readiness to encounter the common variety of mankind would be to climb down a chimney into any house at random, and get on as well as possible with the people inside. And that is essentially what each one of us did on the day he was born.\\" (p. 190)As always, Chesterton's ideas are eminently discussable! No commentary of mine could do justice to the variety, wisdom, and good humour in this book. The best thing would be to find a copy and read it.I have the John Lane edition, 1905."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"Charming Edition!A sister book to Orthodoxy, which is a must read.

Lewis did a much better job of writing short, pithy essays (e.g. God in the Dock) that have enduring value. However, some of Chesterton's essays are memorable and make points of enduring value."},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"The company asking $6.99 for this public domain book, widely available on the Web, is called BiblioBazaar.Bizarre would better fit..99 is, perhaps, reasonable for a repackaged public domain book, though really Kindle users should just find unencrypted Mobipocket files and load them using the USB to their Kindle.In the meantime, caveat emptor!"},{"Title":"Heretics,","review":"There are not many items I like about Chesterton, but there are a few. For one, he is intellectually honest. He doesn't attack or slander past infidels; instead, he names those he disagrees with, and instead of attacking the arguer (ad hominem), he instead is honest enough to attack the argument itself (modern apologists could take a page or 3 from his book). His sense of humor is good, & his prose is lovely. What then, is there not to like?Well, in chapter one, he states: \\"All the tortures torn out of forgotten hells could not make him admit that he was heretical.\\" Which is in and of itself a ridiculous statement, as the history of the Inquisition proves. He inveighs then against freedom of thought & speech in a most invidious manner. He says also, that a landlady should be concerned with the tenant's philosophy more than the tenant's income. This is (IMHO) a possible argument for rental discrimination: not Xtian? Leper, outcast, unclean! He does weigh in on the concept of \`immediate victory', & I couldn't agree more. He does pay compliments to Shaw & Kipling. But most of this chapter devolves into bad philosophy.Chapter 2 is GK's more insidious attempt to target progress as Man's downfall. He states: (quote) Nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal; I might almost say that nobody can be progressive without being infallible at any rate, without believing in some infallibility.(unquote) What? Progress is progress - one must define parameters a little more clearly. In GK's terms, the progress spoken of is Man's change of heart, in respects to putting humanity above divinity, at least IMHO.In Chapter 3, he rather pays Kipling huge compliments, but says RK is unpatriotic (of course, this is when England viewed India as an annexed country, & so is excusable). Mostly it is a complaint of the lessening of the natural world by exploration. GK is so verbose at times; it is hard to grasp his meaning.Most of the chapters, as they go, usually compliment the men criticized and targeted. I can see having a problem w/Shaw: he had some ridiculous political theories (approving Stalin, downplaying the Holocaust, that sort of thing: I have some problems w/that also, & I am an atheist). But in Chap. 5, he rails against applying the label of hypocrisy against his beloved Church, as if the men composing it are of some mystic order that is above that sort of thing. & his odd take on humility? Quote - Humility is so successful that it is mistaken for pride Endquote. But false modesty is also a sin, & can very well be that selfsame sin. He inveighs against interfaith, as if it were a curse. & this one is truly foolish: Quote: That is why religion came so early into the world and spread so far, while science came so late into the world and has not spread at all,(End quote) is revisionism, pure & simple. GK casts a blind eye (as most apologists do) to the fact that Xtianity has fought & squelched progress at every turn. He defends Xmas (& honestly, it is a forgivable holiday at best, no argument). But he claims, throughout the book, that faith is an absolutely essential ingredient to living, which it most certainly is not.So I give Mr. Chesterton 2 stars: one for his wit and elegant prose, & one for his intellectual honesty (& the Internet abounds w/bad examples of this: Xtians reviewing & criticizing books they haven't read). But he fails on multiple points. He proposes the insidious concept of labeling, as if only Xtians are truly worthy (Antinomianism). He tries to demolish other viewpoints, & fails due to ineffective analogies & excess verbiage. If you desire rhetoric for rhetoric's sake, rhetoric that supports what you want to hear, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"Its an awesome book about love and family.You'll fall in love with them and won't want to wait to read the follow up books."},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"I enjoyed this book.

Don't miss it! -----Tess Mallory, Leisure/Lovespell romance author"},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"After refusing yet another marriage proposal, Denver socialite Grace Wyne finds herself cast out of her mother's house and shuttled to her father's Nob Hill mansion in San Francisco. She's ecstatic at the turn of events, believing her father will understand her need for a marriage based on love. He does, but that doesn't mean he supports her suffragist endeavors.After loosing most of his family to a house fire, Irish immigrant Nate Dempsey left his homeland to make his fortune in America. Although he's been saving as much as he can, so far his dream hasn't come true. But he finds contentment working as a chauffeur in the Wyne household.And then he finds Grace.Both have an instant attraction to the other. Both break society's rules to spend time with each other. And both won't admit that this love is exactly what they need to achieve their dreams until the moment the earthquake hits and each believes all is lost.From the Ashes is well written book about overcoming the obstacles we place in our way that keep us from happiness. Ms. Agnew does an amazing job of weaving in period details to help enmesh the reader into early 19th century San Francisco. While I throughly enjoyed the book, I would have liked a little more on why the social stratification kept two such fiercesome rebels apart. That small comment aside, Grace and Nate's romance is a rumbling tremor that leads up to the big moment, when nothing will ever be the same again."},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"Agnew doesn't have a firm grasp on historic fiction but she knows how to write a love scene. Perhaps I am still reeling from The Captive Queen but I felt the incident in the library was beautifully executed even if it did bear a certain resemblance to Atonement.Most readers will admit to crushing on a fictional character. Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gilbert Blythe, Edward Cullen. Loathe as they are to admit it, I have yet to find a reader who doesn't have a place in their heart for a man who exists only on paper. Nathanial Dempsey isn't one of those characters but something about him wouldn't let me go. I couldn't put my finger on it until I read the following, \\"A picture of Grace large with child flashed in Nate's thoughts. She'd be a little rounder in the face, her cheeks rosy. Sure, and it would be a hell of a lot of fun getting her into that condition.\\" It hit me like lighting; Nate's thought process echoes my husband's. Both have humble backgrounds, a fierce determination to prove themselves and an unwavering devotion to their family. Good men but romantic is not a fitting description for either one. A biased opinion to be sure but I have to hand it to Agnew for creating such a believable leading man.Grace is another story entirely. She starts strong but quickly loses her momentum. Her drive dissipates as soon as Nate enters her life. Grace and Mary attend suffragette events throughout the book yet the reader is never privy to the goings on of these meetings. This is what I mean when I say that Agnew doesn't have a great foothold in the genre. The suffragettes weren't weak willed ladies who sat around sipping tea. The author had the opportunity to mold Grace in the image of these strong, independent, determined women and she let it slip through her fingers. And what is with the nightmares of burning mansions and buildings pitching from their foundations? Was she supposed to be a clairvoyant?I am going to digress a moment so please bear with me. I spent the better part of the last twenty years living on the San Andreas fault. I've experienced a fair number of quakes, nothing compared to the 1906 one of course but Northridge wasn't exactly a walk in the park. It scared the shit out of me. Smaller quakes made the walls shake and two sent my dog running to my daughter's side but most of the time, you can't feel the damned things. I'm not joking, they really do happen all the time. Take a moment and check out the following.[...]Now back to Love from the Ashes. Agnew includes a handful of quakes prior to the big one. Thus far I have been unable to confirm or discredit their occurrence. I would be upset if I found that Agnew over exaggerated or completely fabricated these events for the purpose of her story. California has enough problems without people thinking the world is about to open up beneath their feet. If they did happen to the degree Agnew described I am upset with her for giving them so much weight in the story. By the morning of April 18th I was bored with the idea. Too much exposure to it underplayed impact of the moment. I was yawning when I should have been shaking in my boots.I wouldn't judge it so harshly if I didn't think Agnew was capable of more. A decent read but lacking in places."},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"Two very head strong and independant people who clash from the first time they meet. Desire and attraction was there from the first moment however due to their very different life styles neither was going to be the first to admit that they belonged together. Mother Nature at her worst proved to them that being together no matter who you are is more important that your social status."},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"This is one of those \\"guilty pleasure\\" books. The ones that whilst they are not exactly the best written, and whilst the characters could have been better developed, you cannot help find yourself immersed in and enjoying. I was reading it more for the earthquake than the romance, however, and the fact that the earthquake did not occur until about 3/4s of the way through the story was a bit disappointing, but I did find that last bit rather gripping, although more could have been made of the tragedy and the death - I felt like I was being told about it, rather than shown. Having recently experienced a lot of earthquakes myself, including several major ones, I would have to say that even our worst could not compare to that San Francisco one.As for Grace... While her attraction to Nate was the main point of the plot, she did come across as rather a foolish young lady, who was perhaps both a bit of a tease and also given far, far too much freedom. She's lucky her father did not ship her off to a convent or something! As it was, I did like Nate. I guess I've got a little bit of a crush on the whole \\"black irish\\" thing. And the sex scene was pretty sexy. So yes, a quick and enjoyable read, but not one that would stand up to heavy analysis."},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"I cant complain a lot since this was a free book, and I did enjoy the story overall, but it was just really hard for me to get into this book. I normally read a book in one sitting and this one I had to put down a lot. I love to get lost in the book and this one never sucked me in. Perhaps it was that the main male character was a worker for the lead female's family and it was hard to connect to him. I loved the leading lady she was quirky and fun and one of the main reasons I pushed through and finished the book. Reading the book did cause me to do some research on the Earthquake of 1906 and I found some interesting first hand accounts that I enjoyed reading as much as the book.Again the book was free and I am not sorry I read it.

Grace is thrilled because she always felt closer to her father who according to Grace is a very progressive man. As a matter of fact her father and his new wife support Grace's unconventional attitude and the young woman enjoys her newly won freedom until her father employs Nathaniel Dempsey, an Irish immigrant, as a driver. The young man stirs unknown emotions in Grace, who doesn't know how to handle these but to react with stubbornness and bold actions which in return unsettle the self-confident but a bit conservative Nathaniel.Grace was depicted as a cosmopolitan and progressive young woman who enjoyed her father's support in her quest for equality between the genders and social ranks, which she tried to achieve in mostly childish and immature ways. However, the author managed to put these mainly annoying actions in a nice context which finally didn't result in a deterioration of Grace's image.Nate overshadowed Grace in every aspect. He has much more life experience and patience, which allowed him to react to Grace's exaggerations with calm and superiority.The storyline was interesting, entertaining and well written. The fact that the main characters belonged to different social ranks and how they finally found to each other was done in a realistic way. I liked how the story evolved around the earthquake and maybe might have wanted the quake to occur earlier so that more space could have been devoted to the story around and how the main and sub characters coped with this incident.Nice and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Love From The Ashes","review":"If you have free time and enjoy historical romance novels I recommend downloading this book.

Set in San Francisco in 1906, historical accuracy sets the remarkable tone and background of this fascinating glimpse into the past.Nathaniel Dempsey, Nate, is accustomed to division. Coming from Ireland, he has known religious division. Now a member of the San Francisco working class, he knows class division. Yet despite the barriers of wealth and background between them, those divisions aren't enough to keep his attraction and love for Grace under control.Grace comes from a world of wealth and privilege. Raised in the highest social circles, life in Denver had been an endless sea of social events including parties, balls, weddings and funerals, all very carefully supervised according to very proper rules. But when Grace refuses her sixth proposal, her mother and stepfather banish her to San Francisco to live with her father. Delighted with her newfound freedom, Grace and her stepmother Mary become involved with the suffragette movement.Grace's father hires Nate to chauffeur his wife and daughter in his new Studebaker. Of course the independent Grace insists upon driving lessons, throwing herself headlong into the adventure. But she wasn't prepared to fall in love with her father's chauffeur. Nor to confront her father's disappointment and displeasure in her desire to pursue the suffragette movement.LOVE FROM THE ASHES is a delightful reminder of priorities.

Nate is battling his own demons, in particular his attraction to the cinnamon-haired beauty who is out of his social stratum. It is only after the devastating effect of the 1906 Earthquake that makes them realize how precious love is and that it must not be wasted.This book is what I would call a \\"slow burn.\\" The sexual tension between Grace and Nate grows at a slow, unhurried pace. When they finally consummate their desire for one another, it's like gas being thrown on a fire. I've read a lot of romance novels, and this one is definitely HOT - page gripping, never want it to end HOT.The other thing I appreciated about this story is how adeptly the author ended it. Some books build to a climax and then cut you off at the knees (it's over before you realize it) while others drag out the ending mercilessly. This had just the right balance.

What's amazing is that his analysis holds up after 100 years. Wilson believed that &quot;separation of powers&quot; did not exist, and that the building impenetrable walls between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches produced abdication of responsbility. Wilson held up as a model the Westminster cabinet form of government as a model of clarity, openness, and responsibility. You can read Wilson's 1884 pages as if he wrote them today. The style is pure Victorian -- run-on sentences galore -- but the analysis is rapier-sharp. My opinion -- get this book, and have your mind changed. You will never see American government the same way again.PATRICK McGRATH The Campaign for Responsible Government Stony Point, NY"},{"Title":"Congressional government: A study in American politics","review":"This book is a classic. As a young academic with a keen interest in national politics, but without any experience, Wilson critiques the American governmental structure on a number of points, examines all of the branches (except judicial), the inner workings and character of each branch, and their inter-workings. Wilson is mostly critical of the system's deficiencies and has few words of praise for Constitutional government. Instead, his ideal model is the British system, with which he is constantly comparing the American. He also touches on the model of French government to provide a broader basis of comparison. The world's other great model Republic, Switzerland, is given passing mention. A broader discussion of the diversity of foreign models, including more discussion of the brilliant Swiss federal system, but also including the German system, would have added much to this book.Wilson's principal complaints with the shortcomings of American government can be summed up with one word: disjoint. He states that there is no structure in the Congress that can be described as \\"leadership\\" in British sense, meaning that even the nominal \\"leaders\\" of the parties cannot claim to speak for the rank-and-file members, who may act on their own initiative, through committees, in the process of drafting legislation (instead of having legislation crafted by a central administration and having members vote or reject it). The result is that there is no cohesive policy, as the various committees draft legislation within their own domains that in the end can be contradictory or mutually abrasive.Wilson also states that there is disjoint between the executive and Congress, largely due to the executive being independent from the legislature. This is almost unique to the American system; in most systems, the functions of administering law are subordinate to those of making law. The independent executive leads to a disconnection between the making of law and the making of policy, which makes forming a cohesive policy quite difficult.Wilson offers more such examples of disjoint in the American government, including the disconnect between those who decide how to tax and those who decide how to spend, but the logic is similar. If one extends the line of Wilson's thinking, the implication is simple: the concept of checks and balances in our Constitution has been a failure. This conclusion harkens back to the spirit of Centinel, who in 1789 condemned checks and balances as snake oil, contending that human intellect is not equal to the task of checking the various interests through an elaborate counterbalancing system. A more effective alternative would be a simple and transparent system (the American system is not transparent but quite obfuscated) in which any attentive observer could determine the chain of events that produces results, and act directly to indicate his approval or dissent of that result. In contrast, Wilson states that in the American system, \\"the voter has no way of knowing how his ballot can any effect on the government or policy, even an infinitesimal one.\\" Wilson's thesis is similar to Centinel's sentiment in his famous letters.Noticeably absent from Wilson's dissertation is any mention of the judiciary (typically presented at the most basic educational level as one of three coequal branches), which in the United States, takes a role in crafting policy through the concepts of judicial review and the setting of precedents that are similar to legislation in effect. One may conclude that this absence is because the judicial branch has only become so prominent in the 20th century, but such a conclusion would be misinformed; the Supreme Court has been crucial to policy in America, since John Marshall. The absence of the judicial branch in this analysis is a minor deficiency, but an intelligent reader should be able to extend Wilson's logic of disjoint to the judicial branch. Nonetheless, it would have been interesting to see his thoughts on the matter.In all, this book is quite informative, insightful, and worth reading. On a lighter level, it is interesting to see how some of Wilson's observations on government hold just as true 125 years later, and to see how some that he states as essential have come to change."},{"Title":"Congressional government: A study in American politics","review":"To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist. If you favor a historicist government unlimited in size and scope, and reject the universal truths espoused in the Declaration of Independence, then this is your book and Wilson is your man."},{"Title":"A gun in his hand (Gold Medal Books)","review":"Interesting, well researched biography of Francis Crowley, a small-time car thief and stickup artist who became the object of a statewide manhunt after he cold-bloodedly shot and killed a Nassau County, New York, police officer in 1931. Crowley and his partner-in-crime, Rudolph \\"Fats\\" Duringer, who was himself a suspect in the shooting death of a dance-hall hostess whom he murdered after she resisted his advances, were traced to an apartment on Manhattan's upper West Side on May 7, 1931. The ensuing gun battle between the fugitives and literally hundreds of policemen drew record crowds of onlookers and lasted for hours before the two were finally overpowered and taken into custody. This book was published in 1951, about twenty years after these events had occurred, and the author drew upon personal interviews with many of the detectives and other law-enforcement officials who worked feverishly to bring the killers to justice. Thus we are treated to a wealth of information regarding what really happened behind the headlines. The forward was written by Dr. Richard H. Hoffmann, a distinguished psychiatrist who examined Crowley during pre-trial proceedings and described him as having had \\"the face of a choirboy, the mind of an imbecile, and the heart of a diamond-back rattlesnake.\\" Both hoodlums were separately tried for murder, convicted, and electrocuted at the death house at Sing Sing Prison. Crowley, who gloried in the nickname \\"Two Gun\\" bestowed upon him by the press because of the two pistols with which he was always armed, was only 19 years old at the time of his death. While the Crowley case has been touched upon in several true-crime books, this is, as far as I know, his only full-length biography. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"THE SENSE OF BEAUTY","review":"The philosophy of Santayana is remembered mostly by his theory of aesthetics, which is discussed in detail in this book. His aesthetic theory is basically subjective, or &quot;psychological&quot;, and if viewed from a contemporary standpoint, somewhat at odds with current developments in neuroscience, but closer than most schools of Western philosophy. All philosophical theories of aesthetics are interesting to investigate from the standpoint of comparing them to what is said about the human aesthetic faculty in modern research in neuroscience.As in ethics, Santayana approaches aesthetics in three different ways, namely as the exercise of the aesthetic faculty, the history of art, and the psychological. The first two do not concern the author in the book, his attention devoted entirely to the third. His intention is to remove himself from the influence of the poets and of Plato, and find the out how ideals are formed in the mind, how objects may be compared with them, what properties are shared in beautiful things, and the process by which humans become sensitive to beauty and in turn value it. He is after a definition of beauty that explains its origin in human experience, and one that explains the human capacity to be sensible of beauty and the relation between a beautiful object and its ability to excite the human senses.The author takes a different definition of aesthetics, being one that he calls &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;appreciative perception&quot;, and which results from combining a notion of criticism with that of the notion of aesthetics as a theory of perception. Santayana wanted to develop a theory of aesthetics that relies on perceptions as a judgmental, critical notion. Perceptions that are not appreciations are thus to be excluded. An aesthetic theory then deals with the &quot;perception of values&quot;.The author's view of religion is well-known, and his atheism rare for his time. The religious imagination he says, has resulted in creations that rival those of the poets and novelists, so much so, he says, that humans believe the content of these creations to have objective reality. The ideas of these divinities are further enhanced by the realization of their natural power, with the belief in the reality of an ideal personality bringing about its further idealization, eventually spanning many human generations. History and tradition are cast by the imagination of these deities, in which peity resides and is nourished. The author of course does not excuse the God of Christianity from this, but he acknowledges the possibility that the human conceptions of Christ and Mary may in fact have real counterparts (the evidence of this not to be explored in this work).The author states that unless human nature undergoes radical change, the main intellectual and aesthetic value of ideas will come from the creative acts of imagination. If human perceptions are not connected with human pleasures, there would be no need to look at things, no interest in them at all, and no importance would be imputed to them. It is indeed amazing how many ideas, thought to be rational, logical, or abstract, actually fit in with the author's aesthetic worldview. Concepts and results in science and mathematics in particular, after their discovery, are sometimes thought of as having their origin in logic and reason. But it was the keen human imagination that brought them about: a grand interplay of intuition and playfullness. Ugly ideas are not permissible: only the most beautiful survive...and oddly, and most interestingly, it is these that usually seem to work the best, and transcend the context in which they were discovered."},{"Title":"THE SENSE OF BEAUTY","review":"In this book, Santayana rejects the Platonic conception of beauty is an intrinsic characteristic of a thing, and argues for beauty that exists only in the mind (and senses, hence the title) of the viewer. The pleasure that beauty gives its audience is universal, but what is beautiful is not universal across audiences. That may be old hat to us, but wasn't quite so old hat in his time. Santayana enumerates various types of beauty, and relates each to the pleasure it gives its audience. Santayana even claims that some of our other preferences -- for example, for youth over age -- are fundamentally aesthetic in nature.The argument is Santayanaesque, and thus not exactly rigorous. A lot of the physiology (&quot;Psychology is always physiological,&quot; he writes) is hokey to our &quot;modern&quot; medical minds. Some of the digressions seem to be just him taking the opportunity to say something clever, rather than advancing the main argument in any way.Still, Santayana is a virtuoso of putting together large, complex &quot;big think&quot; arguments, and he writes subtly and beautifully. This book is worth it, even if only to see Santayana doing what he does best: arguing broadly and forcefully, this time for a new conception of aesthetics."},{"Title":"Laughing Whitefish","review":"Robert Travers is best known for \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" which was made into a movie, and truth be told, I thought that was the only book he'd written.

This is not a hot paced \\"the bad guys are chasing us\\" sort of trial novel, but a hard look through the eyes of a varied and well drawn cast of characters in early Michigan at the injustices dealt the Native Americans at the hands of white men, and corporations. There are several passages I would like to share with you - because they are so precognitive of events right now in the United States.\\"...I predict that one day in this country there will be corporations so vast and so powerful - yes and so helpless to restrain their own giantism - that they will rival and possibly even challenge the Government itself.\\"\\"...if the defendant here gave the Chippewa Indians a hundred Jackson Mines it wouldn't replay them even a small fraction for all that we whites have stolen from them during the past centuries. We have left behind us an unbroken wake of broken promises, broken hearts, and broken people.\\"The book is based on an actual case in which a descendant of the Chippewa Indian guide who showed the white men to the rich iron ore deposits which became the Jackson Mine sues the company for the percentage of the mine which was originally promised to her father in a written contract. My old copy does not have it - but I see the new copies available at Amazon include a forward by an expert on indigenous law and policy, which I am sure would be interesting to read.The story of the case is interesting by itself - but Mr. Travers has populated it with memorable and lovable characters from the old alcoholic lawyer, to the young lawyer full of hope and idealism and more than half in love with his exceptionally beautiful, as well as educated and intelligent client, Laughing Whitefish."},{"Title":"The Writer's Legal Companion: The Complete Handbook For The Working Writer, Third Edition","review":"Without this book, I would never have been able to negotiate my first book contract.

Better communication was certainly required here.&quot;She called back two days later, both astonished and delighted. When she asked about the first paragraph in question, the editor said, \\"that's okay; you can have it.\\" She got what she wanted on the next paragraph in question too. On one other paragraph that concerned her, the editor said something like, \\"Well, that sounds like this but in the book trade it really means that; so it isn't a big issue.\\"&quot;The result: she got 19 out of the 21 things she asked for.

He knows his diseases and his history; unfortunately, he has a bit of trouble writing. The grammar is at times appalling. Here is one of many examples:\\"During the Thirty Years War Germany lost half of its population mostly to typhus and the consequent demographic collapse of Central Europe in the seventeenth-century delayed any substantial recovery from the decline already caused by the Black Death and postponed the recovery of Germany until the rise of Prussia.\\" No, I did not leave out any punctuation; it is a 50 word sentence with zero commas or semicolons. I'm normally not very anal about things like this, but it happens so often as to detract from the message.His reliance on primarily secondary sources is troublesome. I would prefer to hear why a certain author is wrong based on the primary source evidence. He has a tendency to list statistics, which are no doubt important but need to be introduced in a manner that is readable and understandable.I would not recommend this book to someone looking for an introduction to disease history; however, if you are well-versed in general history and already know a bit about diseases, you will find it worth a read."},{"Title":"Armies of Pestilence: The Effects of Pandemics on History","review":"I will admit that I have not yet finished this book, so my analysis is a bit incomplete. So far I have found that the book is very informative, but very hard to read (and this is coming from an english/history major!). Bray obviously knows his stuff, but instead of stating his own theses and hyptheses, he just overquotes other authors. He does say at the beginning of the book that he used mostly secondary sources, but he cites so many other authors that you start to lose what it is HE is saying. I would have liked for him to take all his sources and come up with an independent analysis based on them (a basic research paper writing rule). Also, he operates under the assumption that there are certain historical events that the reader should know (Roman battles, etc.) - I would have liked him to have spent some time &quot;setting the scene&quot;. Bray also alludes to things without explaining them - in the first chapter he states that Hale (one of the many quoted authors) based one of his theories on &quot;a cuneiform tablet&quot;. But Bray doesn't say any more about it. Does this tablet still exist? What does it say on it? Does the tablet require interpretation or is it straightforward? These are the things I like to know. I will say that the book is a good starting point - but if you want to really learn more about this subject, you are either going to have to do a LOT of independent research (which is what I am doing) or take a look at another book written on the topic."},{"Title":"Come Ye Apart: Daily Bible Readings in the Life of Christ","review":"This book is a wonderful daily devotional and I wouldn't start the day without ready it.

I once again ask the author where are my rights?The author's claim of a Macedonian Question, is more than a mere squabble over a name. It is a well-designed scheme for annexing the northern Greek provinces of Macedonia and Thrace. It started during the inter-war period, by the decisions of the Comintern and the Balkan communist parties seeking to establish a united (Macedonian and Thracian) State. Subsequently it was Tito, in 1944, who tried to establish such a State within Yugoslavia. He changed the name of Southern Serbia (which had been known as Vardashka since 1913) to \\"Macedonia\\" and then proceeded to establish, out of the Slavs of the region (Bulgarians and Serbs), a new Slavic nation inappropriately called \\"Macedonian\\".To transform this theoretical concept into a political reality Tito:Concocted in 1944 a \\"Macedonian government\\" as a first step to the setting up of a Socialist Republic of Macedonia\\".Dubbed the local Slavonic dialect \\"Macedonian language\\". A special committee worked for years to turn this dialect into the \\"official Macedonian language\\".In 1968 the \\"Macedonian Church\\" came into being irregularly, by a government coup. As a result, it was not recognized as a formal Church by any Orthodox Patriarchs or by the Vatican.In 1969, the \\"History of the Macedonian nation\\" was published. Any reference in the world's archives to Macedonia and to historical figures and historical events connected in any way with Macedonia over the millennia, was manipulated and forcibly given a \\"Macedonian (Slavic) identity\\".Thus, politicians and historians collaborated:to usurp the name, the emblems, and the history of Macedonia;to set in motion expansionist aspirations, by renaming Greek Macedonia as \\"Aegean Macedonia\\", i.e. part of a united Macedonia and issued maps limiting Greece's northern frontiers to Mount Olympus;to allege the existence of a \\"Macedonian minority\\" in Greece.Their theoretical basis for these claims was based on the assertion that:The ancient Macedonians, Alexander the Great, the Ptolemies, etc. were not Greeks (an allegation which is repeated in the recent FYROM's school textbooks for 1992-3).After the arrival of Slavic tribes in the Balkans in the 6th century AD those Slavs, that managed to reach the Byzantine Provinces of Ancient Macedonia, intermarried with the local non-Greek Macedonians and thus they formed a new ethnic group, the \\"Slavo Macedonians\\" who subsequently were simply referred to as \\"Macedonians\\".Unfortunately for the author, World history does not record a similar case of usurpation of a people's name and history by another group of people.Lack of the slightest credibility on the part of the pseudo-Macedonian \\"nation\\" of Skopje is furthermore revealed by the single fact that Skopje's Bulgarians and Serbs discovered only after 1944 that back in the sixth century they had been transformed from Slavs into Macedonians. (The Albanian Kossovarians are going to ask for their independence in the coming months. Will this uprise encourage the oppressed Albanians living in FYROM?)To claim that the Ancient Macedonians were not Greeks, however, and to use the term \\"Slav\\" with reference to the creation of the \\"Macedonian nation\\" is a trick that the author has used.The \\"Macedonian Nation\\" does not, nor did it ever exist. The Macedonians were Greeks, they spoke the same language and worshipped the same gods (who were inhabiting the Macedonian mountain of Olympus) and performed the same sacrifices, in the same sanctuaries as all the other Greeks. Only, if the author had a better understanding of city-states would she realise this.The Macedonians, together with the rest of Greeks, possess according to Herodotus, the kind and constituent element that composed a nation:\\"And next the kinship of all Greeks in blood and speech, and the shrines of gods and the sacrifices that we have in common and the likeness of our way of life \\" Herodotus, History VIII, 144,2 (Loeb, A.D. Godley).Unfortunately, the author has re-written propaganda and has forgotten to mention that the Slavic dialect spoken in Central and Western Macedonia (Northern Greece) is an ancient Greek language. It contains 1164 Homeric words. Due to the long coexistence of Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians, this dialect has been enriched with Bulgarian words and endings and has nothing to do with the so-called \\"Macedonian language\\" invented in 1944-45, which is a mixture of the Bulgarian and the Serbo-Croatian languages."},{"Title":"Fields of Wheat, Hills of Blood: Passages to Nationhood in Greek Macedonia, 1870-1990","review":"An utterly historically inacurate peice of rubbish.

Hundreds of thousands of Macedonians have been expelled and forced to leave their homes and their homeland just because they wanted to preserve their language and culture and didn't want to be Greeks. The region has been colonized with Greek emigrants from Turkey and other parts of the world, just to make it look more Greek. The names of the Macedonians who stayed there have been changed to Greek. Their churches taken away from them. They are not allowed to speak or write their own mother tongue. The list goes on and on. The same situation exists even today.

As a case-study in historical sociology/anthropology, this book is competently executed, percipient, well-researched, and skillfully argued. Karakasidou deftly combines multiple social-scientific methodologies and sources of data to describe and analyze the interplay between economic changes (in the structure of possession/property relations in Greek Macedonia), social/demographic changes (voluntary and involuntary population transfers, emigration, and war), and political changes (the establishment and development of an increasingly modern and 'scientific' modern Greek state authority over erstwhile Ottoman Macedonian territories and populations) with the development and evolution of modern ethno-national and civic-national Greek identities. On the other hand, Karakasidou is theoretically weak and her arguments at best tenuous when it comes to describing and analyzing the transition from pre-modern identities to modern regional, ethno-national and civic-national identities. She is clearly biased against the modern Greek state and modern Greek historical and social-scientific scholarship. This extends even to clear mis-representations of the works of Greek scholars, and to patently one-sided and unscholarly treatments of modern Greek nationalism and nationism, and related modern Greek state policies. Finally, there are far too many self-references in this book, to pieces penned by the author, the level of scholarship of which is much inferior to that evident in this particular book. Moreover, one can clearly detect a tendency to pre-emptively strike against criticism on the part of Karakasidou, in that she presents herself all too often and all too eagerly as an alleged 'prodigal daughter' of the modern Greek nation, allegedly airing too much of the latter's 'dirty laundry'. On both counts, she is both mistaken and hyperbolic. All in all, a useful, well-written, but uneven book, which, unfortunately, seeks all too often to make and sustain arguments that are unsupported by the author's actual research, or the scholarly literature she cites. The arguments and evidence of this book, those that are in fact based on and supported by Karakasidou's dissertation research, are neither controversial nor earth-shattering. They are simply good and useful social-scientific scholarship."},{"Title":"Fields of Wheat, Hills of Blood: Passages to Nationhood in Greek Macedonia, 1870-1990","review":"This book is a work on (historical?) anthropology and in that field my qualifications are non existent: at best I am an amatuer (in the french sense).

It is a good start. I can't refrain from commenting on the other reviews. Firstly I dont think that the author chose to participate in &quot;politically charged debates&quot;, rather, she was drawn into them.

Peaceful assimilation is accepted by most countries throughout the world as a means of promoting national unity. I agree that in many cases, assimilation processes were not exactly suave, but in all cases the basic human rights were fully respected, and as a Greek person whose family roots are in the ethnically Greek town of Korytsa (now Korce, Albania) and the formerly ethnically Greek town of Monastiri (now Bitola, FYROM), all I have to say is that the Greek state's mechanisms of repression back in the 50s and 60s pale in comparison to what my people suffered and are still suffering by the Albanian and Old Yugoslav/FYROM authorities.

Assiros is just a fragment of the Macedonian puzzle. There is very little doubt, that the area north of Thessaloniki had been predominantly Slavic ever since the time of the Slavic invasions (up until the the Neuilly Treaty), while the indigenous Greeks were pushed below the Verria-Serres line. That there were few Greek-speakers in the predominantly Slavophone Assiros region prior to the arrival of the Thessalians during the late 1700's, does not imply that the Greekness of Macedonia is a recent phenomenon, as she insinuates. Karakasidou is deliberately misleading the reader here! She doesn't mention anywhere in her book that in the neighboring Chalkidiki region (just 40km to the south) no Slav had ever set foot there! Most of southern Macedonia was Greek-speaking as any ethnologic map can illustrate, while Assiros fell in the northern Slavic zone. Yes, *some parts* of northern Greek Macedonia were recently Hellenized in order to homogenize the region, but the overwhelming character of Macedonia remained Greek-speaking(not just pro-Greek)throughout the centuries. Maybe she needs to re-read Brailsford more carefefully?"},{"Title":"Fields of Wheat, Hills of Blood: Passages to Nationhood in Greek Macedonia, 1870-1990","review":"An Excellent book. It took a lot of courage for a Modern Greek author Anastasia Karakasidou to correctly represent the ethnic situation in the Greek part of Macedonia, which Greece took after the partition of 1913. It exposes to light the existence of the Macedonian nation, in contrast to the unconvincing claim of the Greek government that there are no ethnic minorities in Greece. It is obvious that there is no Balkan country that is ethnically pure and Greece is not excluded. It is time that the people of the Balkans realize to appreciate each other and respect the rights of the nations and minorities bordering them. Only then will the Balkans prosper like it should and could. Anastasia Karakasidou is a breakthrough writer representing Greece and her effort should be saluted. Let us hope that the gap between the modern Greeks and Macedonians will disappear with these two people finally coexisting in peace without prejudice and disrespect."},{"Title":"The Brannocks","review":"What a great Western. I have read other books by Matt Braun but I think this is the best one I have read. Earl Brannock is in Denver, he is a professional grambler. Virgil Brannock shows us next and becomes a very good business man. Clint Brannock is the last one to arrive. He was always the wild one. He is hired by the city as a Marshall. Clint is looking for Jack Quintin who killed the Brannock boys parents. He also finally show up in Denver and is hired to kill the three boys. A very good Western book. Lots of action, a good ending. I hope Braun writes about these three again. The way the book ended it is wide open for it. If you like books about the old west you will really like this one."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Classical Sicilian: Including Richter-Rauzer and Sozin Attacks","review":"This is indeed a solid book. It covers the theory very well in a nice way, since he offers explanations after many moves instead of just listing the variations followed by a \\"with advantage to black\\".Regarding all major variations, he presents general themes and plans for both sides. There are many diagrams, and in some cases the positions in the diagrams are closely related which helps you understand the connection between some plans.In my opinion, these are very instructive.After each variation is covered, he starts a discussion entitled \\"Which line to choose in the (for example) Sozin)\\", where he explains firstly his own view and experience and then generally the differences, which line suits the positional player, the aggressive player, the solid player etc. From someone who has tested different lines in various variations and then read his discussion afterwards, I can say that he is right on many points.Between me and some of my friends, we own all the Easy Guides in the different Sicilian Openings and a few others as well. In my opinion, this one is the best."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Classical Sicilian: Including Richter-Rauzer and Sozin Attacks","review":"Easy Guide to the Classical Sicilian does a good job of balancing the need for general information on an opening, as well as getting into the specifics of each variation. The main strength of this book is that it does not try to take huge shortcuts that would keep you from memorizing a lot of material for the sake of being easier. The main variations are all deeply covered, up to move twenty or so in the h6 Rauzer, which prevents doubled f pawns. Some of his suggestions are not technically the &quot;main line,&quot; but they are all lines played by top grandmasters including Shirov, Leko, and Svidler. The variations themselves are easily understandable, even up to an advanced stage. This is because the author does a good job explaining the main ideas before each chapter, so you understand the basic early middlegame plan even if you don't know the exact move at the moment. Another plus is that while it is a repertoire book, there are about 6 different ways you could put the lines together to form a repertoire. For instance, in the Sozin you have both the 5. .. Qb6 line, forcing the knight away, but making the game less concrete, or the dangerous (for both players) early queenside activity lines in the sozin and Velimirovic, as well as the main lines. In the rauzer, you have the plan of h6 to kick out the bishop, or choice of several Bd7 lines, with doubled F pawns. This also isn't a book that tells you that everything you play will be able to counter white, in fact in some places the author tells you that at this point black doesn't have a foolproof answer, but it's going to be that way with every line. If you're not yet facing the open Sicilian much, concentrate on the Anti Siclilians, but if you are facing the open more and more, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Easy Guide to the Classical Sicilian: Including Richter-Rauzer and Sozin Attacks","review":"As a club player, I am often confronted to Sicilian players. I bought this book to find out what I was supposed to play againt the Sicilian. &quot;Easy guide to the Classical Sicilian&quot; not only shows the main variations on many positions types but more importantly it explains the plans behind these positions (the whats and the whys).

Kaplan has earned a reputation as a fine writer and here he shows why."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"Great book. To those who say its communist, I ask several questions:-Its from good ol' UC Berkeley. What did you expect?-Have you ever been to the bay area? What did you expect?This book is just a part of the great San Francisco Bay Area culture. People should learn to appreciate that this is simply how we think here in the Bay.Otherwise a fascinating look at the Yakuza."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"If you've been itching for nearly 350 pages of rabid liberal conspiracy theories and innuendo, look no further, this book was written for you. On the other hand, if you're genuinely interested in learning about the Yakuza, look elsewhere.Kaplan and Dubro almost manage to stir in enough facts to make the whole thing seem relatively plausible, except that every page is loaded with half-truths and outright incorrect information. All of which leads each paragraph to conclude that a vast right-wing conspiracy spans the Pacific, and oppresses the innocent citizenry of Japan and the US - The worlds 2 richest nations.Starting off with a little historical background that is fairly correct, the authors rapidly move onto post WWII. Here's where the ride starts.Pulling off from the station you'll get right-wingers in the US pulling a fast one by backing Japan, and Chang-Kai-Chek, rather than Mao in China after WWII, despite overwhelming public opposition. Steam builds as these right-wingers begin savagely attacking innocent communist spies and back the same action in Japan and Taiwan. Terminal Velocity is reached and the boiler blows when the CIA and right-wing thugs begin enlisting the Yakuza to break strikes, unions, etc, in the name of capitalism. From here you'll be rocketing across the globe as right wing yakuza infiltrate the planet with sex, sex, and more sex. And a little sex with drugs just for good measure.By page 75 this whole book has de-railed, engulfed in flames of conspiracy and hurling off the map at supersonic speed.Suggesting that the Yakuza has kept Japans population from attaining the fabulous quality of life that exists in Maoist China, and that the US is at fault - is too absurd to define. And yet this book manages to stretch over 350 pages out of trying to do it, mainly by filling the pages with unconfirmed innuendo, unsubstantiated word of mouth, and virulent communist propaganda.Which as I said, is hardly a book about the Yakuza."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"I bought this book ready to dive into some indepth info on the Yakuza, but found it hard to ignore the Marxist propaganda interlaced throughout.I can only come to the conclusion that there is something else the authors want to get across other than Yakuza history. In fact, I would even venture to say that this book is 80% Japanese/Yakuza history, and 20% Marxist propaganda.If you can weed out the Marxist, left-wing extremist diatribe, the book is a good read with lots of history."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"Although I have not read this book yet, I am looking forward to it and the shipping came on time."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"This is a solid reference work, and expands and updates on the earlier work that was itself a classic. It examines structured corruption in which organized crime, organized politics, and secretive corporate conglomerates, all help one another become wealthy at the expense of the public.There are a number of fine points across the book that merit emphasis here, and one of the earliest is that of how the CIA and the Army G-2 deliberately nurtured Japanese criminal organizations during the occupation, because they were &quot;anti-communist.&quot;There is an excellent section of the book that focuses on how the US government fostering of political corruption in Japan in turn led to US corporate corruption, to include the funding of separate US corporate foreign policies anti-thetical to those Congress was trying to foster in the days before Congress abdicated its responsibilities.Lee Kuan Yew would like this book. He says the only antidote to organized crime is strong extended families--natural families whose kinship equates to ethics. The book documents the spread of crime in Japan to every aspect of life, and one can only be saddened to see how the concepts of samurai honor and loyalty have been turned upside down.Three ideas keep running through my mind as I read the book, two of them from the author and the third my own. First, the authors focused on the importance of following the money. He knew and wrote about this in the mid-1980's, but today the US Government is still marginally able to follow money, especially informal money that the FBI only discovered in the late 1990's with help from Dick Clarke (see my review of &quot;Against All Enemies&quot;). Following the money is *the* intelligence challenge of the 21st Century, and it is not something CIA can do--we have to find means of integrating all seven tribes, and especially business and banks as well as law enforcement at every level. Second, the author documents the weakness of Japanese law enforcement in a manner that highlights the weakness of US law enforcement at the state and local levels. Think of this book as traveling back in time to Japan, and then forward in time to the US, where we are now suffering many of the same problems. Finally, being a fan of Special Operations properly done, I realized that 21st Century warfare is going to be about man-hunts. It is going to be about tribal and criminal orders of battle, and about decapitating terrorist and criminal gangs without mercy.The book spends some time on how US forces overseas are in fact a major stimulant and catalyst for crime, especially drugs and trade in women and children. By sending our forces and their money into austere conditions, we have actually created 750 &quot;crime magnets&quot; all over the world. And if you think our secret bases overseas are secret from anyone other than the US public, think again--one has only to ask the prostitutes. There is another important aspect of GI (Government Issue) life overseas: too many of our naive GI's get sucked into crime, first from small loans, then being asked to smuggle small things, then big things, to pay off the loan, and then being tracked down, after returning home, to be brought into international crime within the USA. I realized from this that DoD needs a crime counterintelligence and amnesty program, and we need to out-brief every GI on how to handle criminal blackmail when they encounter it, both overseas, at home, and post-service.The book ends with a fascinating and thoughtfully-selected series of vignettes on the spread of Yakuza crime to 21 countries. The study of their passports is especially interesting, and makes us wonder why the US Treasury is still spending most of its time, two years after 9-11, trying to harass those trading with Cuba, instead of going after terrorist and criminal money.Toward the end of the book there is a useful professional discussion of how inept governments are at identifying correct names and name variants when trying to spot and monitor criminals. This is a real problem. Within the US Intelligence Community, there is no standard for international names, each agency doing its own thing, with the result that even if we were to connect all the databases, the decades of unstandardized data entry across the archipelago makes many of our records too hard to use--almost as if we have to start from scratch.One final point that really jumped out at me: the authors do a great job of identifying the real experts on Yakuza, across many countries, and what struck me was that they exist but no one has figured out how to create a virtual community of interest with the Internet such that all of them are security in touch with one another, sharing name databases, libraries, photograph archives, etcetera. The obsession with secrecy and national control remains the greatest obstacle to actually doing well against crime, and we appear to need regional information sharing systems that are NOT secret (just secure), and multinational regional &quot;stations&quot; against crime.Closing comment: the book documents the incompetence of the US approach to manning its Embassies, especially in the law enforcement arena, where individuals are not language qualified, have no idea of the culture or history, and rotate every two years just as they are finally getting wise. We need a &quot;long haul&quot; manning strategy, and in my view should start thinking in terms of 10-year assignments with every second person coming in at the 5-year mark for solid continuity of intelligence and counterintelligence against these clear and present threats to national security and prosperity.Outstanding book. A classic relevant to any country, any business, any government, at any level."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"I have been interested in the topic of transnational organized crime for about four years now. Most research on the topic that you will find today concentrates on the more sensational groups like the Russian (Eurasian) groups, the Colombian drug trafficking organizations, and of course the \\"traditional\\" OC groups from Sicily and mainland Italy. Very little work has focused exclusively on Asian groups, most especially the Yakuza. Kaplan and Dubro's work helps to fill that gap immensely. Their work is undoubtedly the best material on the Yakuza available. For a more comprehensive look at Asian OC in general, Bertil Lintner's \\"Blood Brothers\\" is excellent as well."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"Not as gory or glamorous as I expected, this book does paint a very vivid and true to life picture of the yakuza. Recommended if you have an interest in the underworld."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"\\"Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld\\" is a book that is almost criminally enthralling.In the United States the world of organized crime tends to be viewed as entirely exclusive to Anglo-European or Eastern European groups. Whether it be the Cosa Nostra or the Armenian mob little is generally known about the criminal organizations of the East. Particularly Japan's Yakuza.How many of you knew that the pervasiveness of methanphetamines throughout the world is thanks to the Yakuza? Also, how many of you knew that the Yakuza is so widely integrated into Japanese society that they have often held press conferences announcing the end of gang conflicts or that they even have their own offices? How many of you knew that the Yakuza was allowed to survive and thrive after WWII thanks to the American occupation of Japan? Did you also know that the CIA employed some Yakuza as spies against the left wing in Japan after the war? ...and that these same people that they employed and let gain power...were the same people they put in prison for Class A war crimes?These are just a few of the interesting and altogether jaw-dropping facts you'll learn by reading this book, a very thoroughly researched study on the fairly little known but globally expansive criminal organizations of Japan. If there aren't at least a dozen parts in this book that don't shock and amaze you I would be very surprised. I could go on and on about all of the interesting facts on the Yakuza covered in this book (from its vaguely noble beginnings to its rather uncertain future) but I think if you are interested in knowing about them you should read this book firsthand. You will NOT be disappointed.A fantastic book."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"Since this book was originally published in 1986 it has been the standard reference work on organized crime in Japan. This new, greatly expanded edition only adds to its status. Organized crime in any country tends to share certain similarities. Their activities concentrate on gambling, prostitution, drugs, extortion, and smuggling. Also, they are usually very right-wing and nationalistic. The Yakuza are no exception, but there are some differences, \\"...it is as if the Ku Klux Klan and the Mafia formed an enduring, politically potent alliance.\\" The symbiotic relationship between Japan's political system, Big Business, and the Yakuza is a disturbing indication of the depth and prevalence of corruption and bribery in the world's second-largest economy. The authors (both American journalists) trace the roots of the Yakuza to its medieval beginnings, but most of the book concentrates on the period since the American Occupation, when the present form of Yakuza organization solidified (and also exposes the involvement of the CIA with the Yakuza's post-war growth). It documents the rise of the Yakuza into a multi-billion dollar enterprise with worldwide investments in real estate, art, big business and more. The original book ended before the bursting of the \\"Bubble Economy\\", and this new version picks up the story and shows how the Yakuza have adapted since then to the new economic climate. The authors also cover extensively the internationalization of the Yakuza, particularly their various attempts to move into America. A must-read for anyone interested in contemporary Japan and Japanese politics."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"There aren't many non-fiction books in English about the Yakuza, and this one is the probably the best history of the secret society. The Yakuza is often compared to the Mafia, which can be misleading. Japanese gangsters are involved in different kinds of rackets and are more ingrained in mainstream Japanese life than the Mafia ever was in America. The authors do a good job explaining the history and customs of this group and showing why they are unique among criminal organizations. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"The Yakuza are a mysterious group. One goes to Japan and sees very little of its presence in any obvious manner. Yakuza: Japan's Criminal Underworld, exposes much of what the organization does and engages in, its hierarchy structure, its depth of influence and its history. This book was more in depth and informative than I had expected and shed light on many dark areas.The book starts with the history of the Yakuza and how they started from their original business lines of gambling and various retail sales businesses. It describes the Yakuza's perspective of their noble origin and humble goals. How the Yakuza fit into the war effort is discussed along with their post-war metamorphasis into a reactionary group pushing for resurrection of Japan's imperialist past. Major Yakuza leaders are described in detail: their origins and personal histories as well as some of the details of their financial transactions.The book goes on to describe the hierarchies and cultural dynamics of yakuza groups. The yakuza tributary system is described in detail as well as the wage earing capabilities of members at various positions within the group. THere are definately som inconsistencies in the authors details about the money involved and the quantities of people. In some cases members of the yakuza from bottom to near top earn in the range of 40k US-600k US but then estimates on net profits and number involved imply everyone is making 600k-1 million US, on one of their many business lines. It appears many of the estimates are quite exaggerated. To talk about Yakuza gambline being on some notional amount with their cuts being in the single digit percentage means often they are using numbers for dazzle effect rather than giving perspective on what business lines actually earn.The book goes into the modern day with most analysis really ending in the late 90s. The bubble economy is explored and the extent to which yakuza were able to have a strong financial backing during the period is very remarkable. The \\"globalization\\" of the yakuza is described and how they have entered into South East asia as well as western US and hawaii. All in all one gets a lot out of this. There is a lot of sensationalism in this book though which is why i didnt give it 5 stars, but that aside, one gets a lot out of this book."},{"Title":"Yakuza","review":"I love this book.

Ceram's book looks at both the Hittite Empire and its' discovery in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Both tales are equally compelling. Among the first Indo-Europeans to appear in history, they established themselves as a warrior aristocracy in Anatolia ca. the 19th century, B.C. Ruling a polygot collection of ancient kingdoms, they 'went native' as regards religion and culture to a great extent. Their decentralized system resembled a confederacy, and their early government featured a limited monarchy, ruling jointly with a proto-Senate (the Pankus). Ceram is at his best in tracing the unravelling the silence that shrouded them from the time of the Fall of Troy until the 19th century. He shows how the accidental discovery of their capital, Hattusa, by explorers led to debates as to who built it. Next, the cuneiform libraries of their kings yielded another suprise: They spoke an Indo-European language. The work of Friederich Hornzy, an Austrian who deciphered the language as his likf's work, is a compelling vingette. The identification of this ancient empire with the Hittites mentioned in the Bible sparked intense controversy, but proved to be true. Proponents took one reference, from II Kings 7:6, in which the kings of the Hittites come before the kings of the Egyptians in precedence, to infer their existence as a great power. Ceram leaves us with other tantilizing questions, such as: was the Attasyrias who raided the western shores of Asia Minor the Atreus whose sons, Agmamenon and Melemeus, sacked Troy? A highly readable, yet rather scholarly account of one of archaelolgy's greatest triumphs, written almost in the style of a mystery novel. -Lloyd A. Conway"},{"Title":"The secret of the Hittites,: The discovery of an ancient empire,","review":"In terms of revealing information on the Hittites themselves, I was not impressed by the author's presentation of historical fact. However, this book does reveal an astounding image of what it took to begin to uncover the mystery shrouding this long sought after Biblical people.If you enjoy the history being made as much as the history being uncovered, I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The secret of the Hittites,: The discovery of an ancient empire,","review":"C.W. Ceram's book is dated in places, but still an excellent account of the archeology which unearthed the ancient Hittites - one of the great empires of the near east - and allowed them to speak to us today. This is a story mainly about archeology and those who brought the Hittites alive once more. This book should be understood as such - a blend of history of both Hittites and the scholars who struggled to find them again. Those who wish to read solely about the Hittites can still glean much good information from this book, but as an addition to other works."},{"Title":"THE POCKET AQUINAS","review":"\\"The Pocket Aquinas\\" is a good introduction to the world of Thomistic thought and writing. The book is divided into eight, topically organized sections highlighting the main themes of St. Thomas' work. Within each section there are collections of his work dealing with questions pertinent to the section's subject. Each section concludes with a list of suggested readings.Overall I feel that the reading of this book I was introduced to a condensed version of Aquinas' thought. What is missing is the \\"feel\\" of Aquinas' work which one can only get from a reading of a large, unabridged section of a tome. Although I generally have little interest in abridgments, I feel that I have learned a bit of St. Thomas' wisdom. For this \\"The Pocket Aquinas\\" is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"THE POCKET AQUINAS","review":"I can't really comment on The Pocket Aquinas' usefulness as an introduction to Thomistic philosophy and theology. I was already well-steeped in Thomistic thought before I discovered it. However, of all the books I own, this is the one I have inevitably gone to first (not exclusively, but first) when attempting to puzzle out some fine point of St. Thomas' thought.It's not that what's here is not also available elsewhere, because for the most part it is. It's that the book's editor has a keen grasp of what is essential for understanding the Thomistic and, through St. Thomas, Aristotelian principles upon which Aquinas' thought is grounded. There are no superfluous texts here. Every one of them has something important to offer. It's regrettable that even more could not have been included, of course, but there is a limit to the size of most men's pockets.This book will not \\"teach you Aquinas,\\" but then again, neither will either of the Summas. Grasping St. Thomas' meaning requires long, dedicated effort that encompasses all of his writings. What this volume will do is provide you with a quick way to get at the nut of important points that otherwise might require you to spend considerable time flipping through the pages of his larger tomes. I give The Pocket Aquinas a very well-deserved five stars."},{"Title":"John Ruskin: The Later Years","review":"An affectionately and well-written account of Ruskin's life (I'm referring here to parts 1 and 2 of this biography, taken as a whole). As another reviewer has pointed it, the book does move along nicely, leaving the reader feeling as though he has been given a solid picture of a period in Ruskin's life (the book is organized chronologically), though not that he has exhausted all possible accounts of it, accounts which could easily become boring to all but the most devoted of Ruskin's admirers. The only thing for which I would fault the book is its sometimes cumbersome, dry over-emphasis on facts -- lots of facts. We are too often told about where, what and when instead of why. Perhaps it was the author's intention to give an &quot;objective&quot; account of Ruskin's life, one in the shadow of which we'd paint our own picture of Ruskin the man. But that would seem to be contradicted by the obvious affection with which Hilton writes. Nevertheless, it was an informative read and the two volumes evidence Hilton's enormous work of scholarship. Ruskin was one of the most prolific writers we know of, but here Mr. Hilton shows that he familiarized himself thoroughly with Ruskin's works and letters. If for nothing else, we should be grateful for that. With a little humor and more analysis, this would be a near perfect biography. As it is, it's the most authoritative contemporary account of its subject and a fulfilling read."},{"Title":"John Ruskin: The Later Years","review":"To begin with the headlines: Ruskin was a racist, sexist, anti-democratic pedophile. Despite all of this (grounds for civil, if not criminal, liability today), Hilton has managed to craft a magnificent biography. He does not condemn these parts of Ruskin's character -- raising the question of whether it is place of biography to condemn -- he simply states the facts. Hilton certainly does, however, praise Ruskin where praise is due, perhaps posing this problem of biography in reverse. In this book, a fifteen year later sequel to &quot;The Early Years,&quot; available here in paperback, but in hardbound only through the out-of-print service, Hilton accomplishes everything for which one could wish in a literary biography. Hilton makes you feel Ruskin's inspirations and how they colored, often drove, his numerous works. He ties Ruskin into his time and how he stood in relation to his contemporaries. I'm not sure that Ruskin was worth the dedication of so much of Mr. Hilton's life and labor. Surely that is for him to decide. Nevertheless, this is, and will remain, the definitive work on Ruskin."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"RecommendationI would recommend this book to anyone who is from the age of 11yrs old to 14yrs old because it can be confusing at some points and it can be hard to read like\\" ...'Exploration' was just a snazzy word for geography.\\" There are some rude languages that children under 11 will not understand for example \\"Shut up.\\" If you are interested in a 6th grade book than this is the perfect book for you."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"We like the last part of the book when the kids got in trouble!

The heart-warming story of selective mute Rachel White, Sarcastic puppy-loving Bastian Fauvell, shy drunken-fathered Sean O'Day, and future cheif justice of supreme court Jessica Cooke, will guarantee to change your life. The story is about a very non-typical April 28, the sixth month anniversery of the death of Tommy Feathers a kid who had a huge crush on Rachel, where Mr. &quot;Fab&quot; Fabiano's class is left without a teacher.

They had previously heard Someone is Hiding on Alcatraz Island. Flying Solo doesn't have the mystery of Alcatraz Island, but it deals with other important issues for 6th graders today. One student thought it was &quot;neat&quot; to hear the story through the various characters' point of view. I had them write a letter to me when we finished. They were to tell me their opinion and they were to answer the question: Have you ever mistreated a student in this class? They were very honest. I loved it. My class didn't feel they could ever&quot;fly solo.&quot; (They're right next door to the school office.) Enjoy this book. We did!"},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"Flying solo is a great book. I found out about it in the book Fig Pudding, and I thought the excerpt was good. My best friend and I fought over the book in Library, even though I found it first, but I came over his house later that day and I borrowed it, and I spent all night reading it.What happens in the story is a girl named Rachel White decides to remain silent, and she hasn't talked for six months. One day, The teacher, Mr (Fab)iano, planned a vacation, and the substitute is sick, leaving Mr. Fabiano's class teacher-less. The class decides to run the class themselves, and I'm sure anyone would like to party when there is no teacher, but with Karen Ballard around, the natural-born leader, the class is doing their own work. Things go pretty well in the class until Bastian Fauvell, air-force brat's rock ritual, with deep emotions from Rachel White about Tommy Feathers, the boy who died exactly six months ago.I loved this book because it is very exciting with a sad touch to it. This is a great book. But I have read one other Ralph Fletcher book, Fig Pudding, and in both of these someone dies. I don't like it that much, But it can actually spice up the whole story. Flying Solo is sort of based on the death of Tommy Feathers unless the book wouldn't be as good. I much prefer this over Fig Pudding, but that's just me. If you like excitement with deep emotions, read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"Flying Solo was a great book. It told about what a good class would do if there was no teacher. I remember sitting in the class room waiting for the teacher to come. I guess it means a substitute is going to come. In Flying Solo no substitute came to Mr. Fabinos sixth grade class, so the students took over the class and didn't have a party. The whole class cooperated and got the school work done. I enjoyed reading Flying Solo. I hope you will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"This story is about a Teacher, Mr. Fabiano. He is planning a vaction. When the subsitute calls in and say's she sick, the people in the school forget. So, Mr.Fabs class is left alone. It was Bastains, the brat, last day at the school, so they did a rock ritual. They got stones and said something good about him. When it was Rachel Whites turn, because, when Tommy Feather's died she never talked anymore, she wrote down things that said how Bastain was mean to Tommy. This is a great book. The one thing I abseoultetley love so much is that this could really happen. Not one of those book's that is so fake not even the chareceter's could be real. This story is great and it is a fun story, figuring out if the class will go steady for one day, but then, sad, bacause the only person is Rachel who remembers that it was Tommy Feathers 6 month anniversery for his death. This book is for everybody!!!"},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"The book is about a class that has no sub and no teacher and they vote to see if they should tell someone or not.

It talked about how students were able to behaive properly without a teacher watching them and constantly telling them what they should and should not be doing.

Well these kids in Flying Solo had no teacher for a whole day. Flying Solo is a fictional book by Ralph Fletcher he has written more than 1 book and all of them are great like Flying Solo.Flying Solo is about 4 students(and the rest of the class)and they realize they have no teacher so they want to prove kids rule and decide to run the class themself.You will meet these 4 chracters along the way. Rachel who has stopped talking because a fomer student of her class Tommy Feathers died six months ago. He liked her but she didn't feel the same way and she was always a little harsh on him, so when he died she blamed herself. Bastian, whose dad is in the military, has to move a lot and today is his last day. He is worried about his dog Barkley and has no idea what to do with him. Jessica who is pretty much a neatfreak and will learn to hang a little loose. And last but not least is Sean who is sort of having rough time in life because his mom and dad are divorced. he lives with his dad and his dad's girlfriend barely 10 years older than him and acts like his mother.This book is a great book.

Throughout the day, that class followed the sub notes and tried to make it through the whole day without a teacher.

Overall, this book was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"I read this book with my reading group in school. I really loved it so much that during it I teared up a little bit. I really liked it in the beginning when it had a chapter of each character so that we were know who they are. One of the parts that I felt very sad was when Rachel stopped talking because tommy feathers died. I think every body should read this book. This book is sad and there are a little parts that are funny.

I also liked when they got out of enrichment.There was noting I didn't like about the book.I would recommend this book to parents to read with there kids."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"I loved this book! I was expecting a trite comedy of what happens when some 6th-graders are left alone - similar to a Louis Sachar story of the Wayside School. Boy was I wrong. Each chapter begins with the time of day. In this way, the reader is introduced to the first waking moments of several students who will become the important players. They are immediately intriguing, from Rachel who hasn't talked in 6 months, to Bastian who is moving to Hawaii the next morning, and even Sean who's alcoholic father's girlfriend is barely older than Sean himself.The day begins rather normally except there is no substitute who shows up to handle the class. The children decide they can do it themselves and carry out the schedule as usual. This continues for the next third of the book. This was actually where I got bored and set it down for a while. I'm glad I picked it up again - and I had stopped at just the right point. When I began reading again it was like a different book.The characters all of a sudden became so much more interesting. Fletcher is very insightful and has created a cast of characters that truly will hold your interest. They are so real you feel as though you want to meet them. The experiences of the day become very stressful and these kids must face them as a group. The book becomes a true testament of how intermediate students can be much more mature than given credit for when no adults are around.Why 5 stars?:Fletcher's writing makes these kids real. What's more - the problems they must face are very real. This book shows how children can work out situations together and the importance of discussing our feelings. It would be invaluable to start discussions in an intermediate classroom and will definitely be a part of my classroom library for years to come."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"It is not very often I can pull my son away from Harry Potter long enough to explore other venues, but this book kept his attention from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"Tommy feathers (a student) dies and Rachel (main character) stops talking.

The book was about sixth-grade kids that have the best teacher, Mr. Fabiano. One day he doesn't show up and the kids find themselves without a teacher!They don't care; they take a vote and see who gets to be the teacher. I think everybody would like to have a day without a teacher.I would recommend this book to nine-twelve year old kids, boys and girls. I like how the book was so descriptive.

My favorite part of the book is when they do the rock ritual and Bastian gets really mad. But it is really hard to understand unless you've had a man or woman that admires you and then dies suddenly.

It is a really good book and I would recommend Flying Solo to anyone who wants to read a quick story."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"This is a very funny book. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. A 6th grade class has its lucky day - NO TEACHER! It is a funny book because of the way the class reacts to the situation. Karen is the leader. The girls did work and the boys played games. That was my favorite part. I urge you to read this book. It gives you an eagerness that keeps you turing pages. Will they get caught?"},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"Flying Solo is a fun read. It isn't about a room full of angels and goody-goodies...but a room full of students who understand the process for learning set out by their teacher on a daily basis. Even the few who have their moments of horsing around contribute and collaborate to make the day successful. In this story, deeper understandings, broader perspectives, and continued skill development take place BECAUSE the children are making their own decisions. This story reveals what I would hope my own students would do in the classroom if for some reason they found themselves without a teacher/subsitute teacher. A fairly quick read...but the value in this tale is the messages from the complexity of life issues. This book will provide engaging learning experiences for children; each reader will bring insight from varied life experiences to the plot and setting. Reminds me of the days I borrowed Harry Potter's cloak of invisibility and sat in the corner to observe how well students could manage their time and efforts."},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"We thought Flying Solo was a great book because the kids were in charge. The characters were all diverse, because they all had different things going on in their life, like how Rachel was silent, Bastian has to move to Hawaii, and Karen is the class president. They also have different opinions, like how Christopher would always say \\"Fact\\" or \\"Opinion\\" or how the girls all wanted to do the work, which is a good thing. Class 6-238 has to run itself when Mr. Fabiano's (the teacher) substitute didn't show up, because she is sick. All the characters are very interesting.We would recommend this book to kids who love realistic fiction that is close to becoming fantasy, and is for the ages 9 and up. For some people, this book is too short, but it is still a great book because it has a good plot, and the beginning really drew us in. We loved this book and we hope you do too!"},{"Title":"Flying Solo","review":"I loved this book. It had many suspenseful scenes where you did not know how they would get out of it.

He does at least give a fleeting glance at his opponents and dissenters.As far as I can tell with my limited knowledge,his facts are accurate. While I do not agree with many of his points, I did find the book well laid out organizationally.He was very clear in his stating of facts and his opinions. He also separated the two very well. He clearly noted when he was stating facts and when he was stating an opinion. I did notice one rather unsubstantiated generalization in the party unity portion of his argument, but I found very few examples of strongly biased generalizations.The author seems to suggest a rather unrealistic goal of a compromise between the European system of democracy and the American government style. This idea would require too many changes in a society that generally resists change. This a strong book factually, though some of the opinions are open to debate.I do like his idea of setting out exactly why America is so unusual. This would be a good book for students to read to gain a bit of knowledge of America as compared to European and other industrialized nations. Though I personally did not care for the book because of the opinions expressed, I do believe that it was worthwhile to read if only to pick up the idiosyncracies of the American style of government.Peace, Mike"},{"Title":"Worlds of Maybe","review":"excellent stories, incl from asimov and niven. best is by poul anderson... time patrol."},{"Title":"Midnight Sun","review":"I've read Mickee Madden's work before and so I looked forward to trying this book --The story started well, although you occassionally ask yourself where she is going, but confident that she will tie things up for you neatly in the end. Unfortunately, she doesn't. You find that the person who you think is the heroine, gets less than 10% of the story in the last 50 pages. I think what bothered me the most is that Ms Madden makes the rules of her &quot;world&quot; but then doesn't follow them....Danielle should not have been able to leave Kiernan, but does, Tane should not have been able to make Alice his life mate without the &quot;hunger&quot; but he does simply by feeling rage....only a few examples of many.My advice to Ms Madden and her editors -- rework the last half of this book. You have an interesting premise, but you didn't follow through."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"When I first began to read this book I was concerned that it might be outdated. However, I found much of the subject matter to be quite timely. Of particular interest was the impact that Sherman's successful (albeit violent) trek through Georgia had on the 1864 elections. I never realized how close the Copperhead (Peace) Democrats came to winning that election and perhaps bringing the Civil War to a far differnet conclusion . Hart bring Sherman to life. He also vividly illustrates the behind the scene politics that almost prevented Sherman (not to mention Grant) from their historic roles in the Civil War. Don't be put off by the subject matter or the age of the book. It's worth the read."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"Sherman was both the most original genius of the Civil War, and \\"the typical American\\". His career provides lessons to the modern world and to modern warfare. It was his conscious exploitation of the economic and psychological factors of war in his \\"March through Georgia\\" which helped to end the Civil War. The long and expensive battles in Northern Virginia were replayed on the battlefields of France in the Great War.The Union attempted to take Richmond by the shortest and most direct route; but this way was blocked with natural obstacles. If the Confederates fell back they would be closer to their reserves, supplies, and reinforcements. These facts favored the entrenched defenders.The western campaign ended in the capture of Vicksburg and control of the Mississippi from St. Louis to New Orleans. Liddell Hart contrasts the maneuvers here to the stalemate back east. But the conditions, or politics, did not allow a wide flanking invasion through West Virginia or North Carolina. The threat to Richmond kept Confederate troops there. Longstreet proposed an invasion of Kentucky, a far flanking attack, but was turned down by Lee.It explains how Sherman out-maneuvered Johnston from Chattanooga to Atlanta. By threatening to outflank Johnston, the Confederates fell back. His replacement by Hood did not prevent the capture of Atlanta. This revived the hope of victory for the North, and helped to re-elect Lincoln.Sherman then abandoned his supply and communication lines (vulnerable to attack) and marched on to Savannah and the ocean. His army lived off the land. This enabled his army to be resupplied by the Navy. He then marched north, seeming to attack other cities, but passed between and continued to destroy railroads and bridges.The end came soon after this, as other armies invaded the South. Sherman designed an armistice and amnesty where the Confederates would be disbanded, and their arms turned over to the states. The latter would allow repression of bandits and guerillas. He was criticized for this.Sherman was a man of modest habits. When admirers raised [money]to buy him a house, he refused to accept unless he received bonds that would pay the taxes! He lived within his means. The resisting power of a state depends more on the strength of popular will than on the strength of its armies, and this depends on economic and social security (p.429).Liddell Hart gave preference to contemporaneous correspondence rather than Official Reports (which are written for history to justify a policy). Some of the ideas in this 72-year old book may not coincide with more recent history."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"Dispite having read most of major accounts of the American Civil War, I had not fully understood the central role played by Sherman until I read Hart's book. Hart makes it clear that Sherman's appreciation of the futility of attacking entrenched positions and his consequently developed strategy and tactics turned the tide for the North, salvaged the 1864 election for Lincoln, and saved perhaps tens of thousands of Union and Rebel lives. He also points out that the same insight accounts for most of Lee's success, i.e., Lee won battles in which he entised the North to attack entrenched positions (e.g. Fredricksburg) and lost when he attacked entrenched positions himself (e.g. Gettysburg). Hart fully disposes of the popular prejudice held widely in the South that Sherman's approach to war was more inhumane than the alternative of massive blood letting which was by virtually every other Civil War general. It is rare to find a historical account containing so much insight."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"This book was dense and at times I wasn't sure I was going to make it all the way through, but having done so I haven't been able to get it out of my mind. Hart's portrait of William T Sherman is so vivid and inspiring and informative that I almost feel like I have lost something not having known this of him my whole life. There is obviously the hated legend of Sherman as the man who ravaged and burned the South (which strangely enough was not most strongly felt by the actual Southerners who experienced his \\"wrath\\"). This myth belies his strategic genius, his mastery of terrain and his deep understanding of statesmanship and politics. For instance, the severity of his campaign through Atlanta and then up through Charleston was driven not just by an aim to end the South's will to fight, but to prevent it from devolving into a guerrilla resistance after the inevitable Northern victory. (Jesse James and his band of bank robbers are examples of what this could have been.)There is a stunningly profound quote from Hart in the book that I'll paraphrase here but I've put it on my wall to think more about: Sherman's success was rooted in his grasp that the way to success is strategically along the line of least expectation and tactically along the line of least resistance. Buy this book, struggle through it and you'll be a better person for it. (And if you like Sherman, or the Civil War, James McPherson's This Mighty Scourge is the next book to read.)"},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"This biography of Sherman is a study of the man Liddell Hart believes to be the great strategic thinker of the American Civil War. It is more a study of his psychology, much of it derived from original sources such as telegraphic messages, than an account of battles. Sherman was a complex man with a background in banking and commerce that served him well in planning his campaigns in the Confederacy. At the outbreak of hostilities, he was headmaster of a military academy in Louisiana and the local people tried to induce him to stay in spite of his open Union sympathies. He was offered a positon as Assistant Secretary of War but declined to seek a military command. His contempt for politicians was later expressed in his famous refusal to accept a nomination for the Presidency. He was the most intellectual general of the war and Liddell Hart is very interested in his thinking. This is a valuable book for those interested in leadership."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"This is a classic written by Liddell Hart in highly readable compact detail. Hart, an English veteran of WWI, was a 20th century military expert who had a great appreciation for Sherman's strategic ability and understanding of an enemy morale. In contrast to what Hart calls a game of \\"shuttle cock\\" in the east, Sherman's strategic maneuvers and splitting of command out frequently force Johnson to give up ground while shedding very little blood. Hart notes that he does not spend too much analytical detail on where every \\"man stood\\" in reference to regimental history but Hart provides the reader the necessary detail to appreciate the battles and over all campaign. Hart's appreciation of Sherman's ability to take the war to the Deep South, live off the land and take a great risk of literally disappearing from his line of communications is well detailed here as Sherman's penetration through three states eventually undermines Lee's great efforts in Virginia. Hart, the veteran of the stalemate battle of trenches that featured great loss appreciates Sherman's successful plan of warfare. Of course, there are many historians who believe that General Joe Johnston's propensity to retreat may have made him a weak opponent but Johnston did keep a strong army in the field until Hood decimated the Army of Tennessee. This is a great book written by a man who not only lived through \\"The Great War\\" but was highly capable of writing about a war that was very similar in the eastern theater by late 1864."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"B.H Lidell Hart has written a wonderful biography on William Tecumseh Sherman. Hart believed Sherman was the most relevant general of the Civil War and backed up his theory of the indirect approach with Sherman's campaigns. Sherman would maneuver the Confederates out of strong defensive positions and attack the enemies base of supplies, a perfect example of the indirect approach. B.H.

This author, British, has analyzed one of our most famous or infamous citizens/soldiers, and conveys the character and make-up of this very important men so well, I find all the other books sliding back, far back, in my estimation.

Not only did Sherman have a deep appreciation of Southern culture, he was also a grand strategist who possessed the ability to see the ramifications of his, and the Union's actions. The person who is presented here is one of deep thought, a classical education and deeply engrained values, who harbored no illusions as to the horrors of war. Since this book was written while there were still living veterans of the war, you are also presented with history that has much more immediacy to it. All in all it is well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"The details of battles from Vicksburg to Savannah provides the reader with a case study beyond the brutal details that often get associated with Sherman. The history of Sherman's boyhood does bog the story in the beginning and doesn't answer how he developed his strategy for cutting across the south. It is possible that the swamps and rivers, along with the strength of the Southern army...might have been the determining factors in Sherman's indirect approach to reaching the sea."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"Excellent look at the other Civil War General. Especially like the use of Sherman's own letters."},{"Title":"Sherman: soldier, realist, American (Books that matter)","review":"I will start by saying Liddel Hart is my favorite military historian/author and I own half a dozen books by him, and regard them as gospel. However I felt that Liddel Hart was not as well versed in this area as he is in European History. He lets his ingrained contrariness run away with him. He wants to create a &quot;great captain&quot; where there is none. He also, I believe, wants to convince the reader of the genius of the &quot;inderect approach&quot; which he expounds in his excellent book &quot;Strategy&quot;. However I think considering Sherman's campaign as indirect is like calling D-Day indirect because the allies invaded Normandy as opposed to Calais. ( I must admit that I am biased because I am a Lee fan) Like every other book by Liddel hart though, it is a very quick and pleasant read. I would recommend his book on Scipio as a great intro to his work."},{"Title":"The Last Pin","review":"Talk about long awaited!

Considered risque at the time of publication, they still read well today.

Howard Wandrei was a versatile writer in several fields and these mysteries are no exception."},{"Title":"The Last Pin","review":"I enjoyed this collection, far more than I expected to, but I'm a little ashamed of having enjoyed it. The writing is vigorous, the stories well-paced -- Howard Wandrei, for my money, writes much better than his more famous brother Donald --, and the plots generally preposterous in their details. Most of these stories are the kind that were called &quot;spicy&quot; back in pulp days -- lots of nudity, with the fact of the nudity but not the nudes themselves closely, even lecherously, described. Gunfights, car chases, nude girls, unmixedly evil villains, heroic rescues, more nudes, narrow escapes, and nudes.

He's not one to stint on depicting the grubbiness of Chinese trains, the ugliness of slums, or the crudity of inter-ethnic prejudices. If you too traveled to the four ends of China, this is basically what you'd see.Brown has lots of report-worthy conversations on his way, and he speaks good Mandarin. But the relationships he forms come and go between trains. They arn't like the months- or years-long friendships Peter Hessler or Leslie T. Chang write about. At one point, passing through Shanghai, Brown says with typical honesty, \\"Leaning on the stern handrail, muffled against the morning cold, I was utterly alone in a city of perhaps 15,000,000 souls.\\"Still, it's a well conceived adventure. Brown covers parts of China (like the goddess Guanyin's island of Putuoshan, Hainan, or Kashgar), that I'd wanted to know about.

This novel is not as strong an effort as the novels from his major phase, but it is nonetheless a book of great power and wonderfully illustrates most of the great themes that run through all of his books. I have a love-hate relationship with Conrad, because while I respond to the marvelously depicted male characters in his books (his women are usually implausibly stupid and cardboardish) and their conflicts with the universe and each other, I find the world he describes as being a little too bleak and the cosmos far too impersonal. All of his characters are doomed to ineffecual action, and their fates are determined by forces and factors outside of themselves, or perhaps to some degree by motives within themselves over which they have no power. I do not like Conrad's universe, but I admit the power of his creation.This is not one of Conrad's greatest works. It belongs in a tier immediately below his very greatest works like NOSTROMO, THE SECRET AGENT, UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, LORD JIM, and VICTORY. Nonetheless, slightly lesser Conrad is more rewarding than major works of other writers, and I heartily recommend this novel (as well as his other books) to any serious reader."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"&quot;I know the white man...in many lands have I seen them, always the slaves of their desires...&quot;This is Conrads second book and like his first it deals with the colonial enterprise but in this book white men are their own worst enemies. The native Malay characters are given more in the way of identity in this book and they are seen as having complex views. There is intrigue in this book as white men from different nations try to assert their dominance in the region but the Malays too have a plan and that is to take advantage of the whites aggressive and competitive natures and set them against each other. Great plot. But Conrad also gives you each characters story and each character is always more interesting than whatever role they are playing in the overall plot. One of the most attractive and elaborated themes in this book is the one of mans place in nature and mans own nature. The beauty of the tropical locale is made even more attractive and alluring by the women who walk through the foliage like &quot;apparitions&quot; veiled in &quot;sunlight and shadow&quot;. Conrad describes the forests, the light in the tree tops, and the shadows on the forest floor and all nature is seen as metaphor for mans own dualities and incongruites. A much matured writer from Almayers Folly. The plot is simpler than Almayer was but thats good. The simpler plot allows Conrad more latitude to deal with the individual characteristics and that is certainly one of Conrads strengths. He sometimes overdoes it with the repeated use of words like inscrutable and the always heavy darkness, and his overall view of man seems dim, as man in his eyes is an only partially lit(enlightened) being. To Conrad man remains a lost creature for the most part who just by chance or luck or ill omen gets caught up in events he cannot fully comprehend. A limited resource man may be but while reading it is hard not to see it his way. The summing up scene at the end of the book with a drunken Almayer(who also appeared in Conrads first book, the Almayer of Almayers Folly) relating the now long passed events of the book to a traveling and equally drunk botanist is an excellent closing comment on the continued folly that is the colonial enterprise and man in general."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"Conrad has a exciting style of writing which consists of artfully mixed poetic prose and moral analysis. The language of the text alone is enough to make this a great novel, perhaps even an epic poem. The intensity of the prose is such that I was driven backwards into my seat for most of the novel. A prequel to _Almayer's Folly_, An Outcast...is a true must read."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"There's something almost pathological about the style and plotting of Joseph Conrad's An Outcast of the Islands. Reading it, one has the sense not of an artist explicating an idea, but of a man picking obsessively at a festering wound. \\"His story is not so much told as seen intermittently through a haze of sentences,\\" H.G. Wells wrote of the book upon its release, and it's a fair judgment. The atmosphere of Outcast isn't merely built; it seeps from its author as if he were an emanating god in some theosophical or Qabbalistic cosmogony. In Conrad's universe, nature itself seems complicit in the downfall of men, and the weight of it is almost stifling at times for a reader.Writing in 1896, Wells also regarded Outcast as \\"the finest piece of fiction published this year.\\" That judgment is more problematic. Outcast was Conrad's second novel and would also be the second in his Malay trilogy. Typical of Conrad and his uniqueness as an author, Outcast moves backwards rather than forwards in time from the story of his first book, Almayer's Folly, and shifts the primary perspective away from Almayer, a trader in a remote Malayan outpost, to his boss Lingard and the outcast of the title, a clerk named Willems. While evidence can be found throughout the book of Conrad's facility as a stylist--its opening sentences alone signal that Conrad is an author to be reckoned with--it also suffers from limited characterization and what one critic, Tim Middleton (Joseph Conrad: Routledge Guides to Literature), has rightly called an \\"overwrought\\" and \\"hackneyed\\" plot.\\"The doomed man\\" is a character that Conrad writes as well as probably anyone in literature, but the shaft that must be mined in order to reach that level of insight is too deep and dark to allow for much light to be cast on the nature of other characters. To criticize Conrad for two-dimensional characterization of women or indigenes is banal at this point, but nonetheless necessary; it limits Outcast's effectiveness and adds to the impression that, at its worst, the book is essentially nihilistic melodrama, if there could be such a thing. As Ross Slotten writes in The Heretic in Darwin's Court: The Life of Alfred Russel Wallace, \\"Conrad himself had traveled through the East Indies between 1881 and 1889 but did not learn Malay and was unable to firmly grasp the Malay or Papuan character.\\" That human and linguistic shortcoming stands in stark contrast to the anthropological interest displayed by Wallace, whose The Malay Archipelago influenced Conrad and was regarded by him as a \\"favorite bedside companion.\\"One final thing: the 1966 Airmont edition of An Outcast of the Islands has very small and crowded type, so if you're looking for a used copy, stick with Oxford."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"As has often been noted, this novel was written before Conrad's period of greatness. Perhaps it doesn't measure up in psychological depth to such books as \\"The Secret Sharer\\", \\"Heart of Darkness\\", \\"The Secret Agent\\" or \\"Lord Jim\\", but written by anyone else, it would elevate them into the ranks of Great Literature. A scandal leads to the dismissal of a trusted agent for a Dutch trader in what is now Indonesia. His Eurasian wife, with whom relations have never been close, rejects him; he has to leave town. Looking for revenge for what he feels is an unfair dismissal, Willems, the former agent, plans to reveal a trade secret to an Arab rival. This, in the 19th century, was more than a business doublecross, it was a betrayal of \\"the blood\\". Colonialism was always about race and blood, so modern readers should understand that this is a subtext of the book. Various Malay pirates and rogues get involved. Almayer, a Dutch buyer stationed up a remote jungle river,(who appears in other Conrad novels) develops an unmitigated hatred of Willems. I should not reveal the denouement here, but believe me, it is melodramatic enough. Lots of jungle and thunderstorm atmosphere, Nature looms omnipotent in the background, not under threat from Man as in most of today's discourse.Motivations in some cases remain a bit murky and sudden jumps in time help the author avoid explaining what might have transpired. Still, Willems, the eventual outcast, fallen from grace with his employers, become an object of scorn to his fellow Europeans in the town (probably Makassar, now Ujung Pandang in Sulawesi), is a conflicted character worthy of Conrad's other novels. Capt. Lingard, his old benefactor, is too much a super-hero, a character way too big for his boots. He tries to help his former proteg&eacute;e, but eventually abandons him to his fate. Aissa, Willems' Malay lover, resembles the Dragon Lady a bit too much to be true-to-life, while the other Malay characters too seemed to be comic book or cardboard cut-out figures most of the time. The distraught Eurasian wife, weak and vacillating, is rather outr&eacute;. It's a good story, reflecting some of the historical patterns of the East Indies of that time. British and Dutch rivalry lasted for a long time. Arabs from the Hadramawt (now Yemen) emigrated to various European-dominated South East Asian societies and prospered mightily as middlemen and traders (see Engseng Ho's \\"Graves of Tarim\\", a historico-anthropological work). The rich Sayid Abdulla, plotting to take over the European trade network, is not an odd figure then. All in all, Conrad was impressive right from the start. This novel will definitely hold your attention. Couldn't give it less than four stars."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"So, yes, of course, I've read all the standard critics' and academics' judgement of this novel, meticulously recounted by many of the other reviewers here, that this second novel of Conrad's lacks the nuance or contains too much raw energy or something or other to count amongst Conrad's \\"top tier\\" of \\"mature\\" novels. Put simply, I profoundly disagree.It IS quite a different sort of book than the other novels, so much so that it rather overwhelms the reader. Indeed, it reads much more like a necromantic outpouring of lyrical genius than like any sort of novel at all. In other words, it is a poem, a dark, lush, bleak, anguished poem, a cri de coeur from an abyssal universe told in such a rich, enchanting language that the reader is left - quite literally in my case - stunned at its power.The description of the sea herein equally applies to the book itself:\\"...glorious in its smiles, irresistible in its anger, capricious, enticing, illogical, irresponsible; a thing to love; a thing to fear. It cast a spell, it gave joy, it lulled gently into boundless faith; then with quick and causeless anger it killed. But its cruelty was redeemed by the charm of its inscrutable mystery, by the immensity of its promise, by the supreme witchery of its possible favour.\\"Our outcast, Willems, is not so much terrified by death but by life in this world, \\"the horror of bewildering life where he could understand and comprehend nobody round him; where he could guide, control, comprehend nothing and no one - not even himself.\\"I think the problem most readers have with the book if they are honest with themselves, and quite a few of the reviewers here are so, is that they are simply unable to stomach a vision so unremittingly bleak, regardless of its linguistic magic and puissance.The novel is for the few and the brave, so to speak, for those unafraid to be lured into a world where he/she is forced to confront, \\"...the tremendous fact of our isolation, of the loneliness impenetrable and transparent, elusive and everlasting; of the indestructible loneliness that surrounds, envelops, clothes every human soul from the cradle to the grave, and, perhaps, beyond.\\"Embark upon this book only if you dare!"},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"Much -- perhaps too much -- has been written and said about Conrad's racism and/or racialism. By the second term, I mean the predilection of Conrad's contemporaries to explain culture and character by innate racial differences. In that sense, 'race' is one of Conrad's central themes, especially in The Outcast of the Islands, and Conrad is a bona fide quasi-Darwinist believer in racial determinism. Most of Conrad's 'South Sea' adventure novels are built around the clash of races. Again and again, both whites and non-whites devolve, degenerate, dissipate in reaction to each other. One might even say that Conrad is hugely antagonistic to and cynical about the white race in its colonial phase. Three of the white characters in Outcast - Hudig, Almayer, and Willems - mate with non-white women and father half-white children, and in every case the outcome is disastrous for all concerned. The contemptuous language that white characters spout about non-whites in Conrad's novels has earned him hostility from modern non-white readers, but wait! the non-whites in Conrad's novels are just as vituperative and derogatory about whites. Does Conrad take sides? It seems to me that he treats both sides rather harshly. Does Conrad really 'understand' his non-white characters? Now that's a good question, which I'm not anthropologist enough to answer. But it's clear that Conrad is pessimistic about the colonial encounter and the globalization of economic interests, that he perceives only obsessive, blind conflict leading to destruction for both sides. At this point in history, I wouldn't dare fault him as a prophet.Conrad is also a writer of his times in his consistent portrayal of Nature as powerfully indifferent to humankind's fate, animate yet without animus, a constant beautiful perilous prolific Nature that will outlast humanity, that implicitly mocks humanity's piddling drama and self-importance. Such was the portrayal of nature by Stephen Crane, Thomas Hardy, Jack London and other contemporaries of Conrad. The chief difference is in how gorgeously Conrad describes Nature, how well he treads the line between the emotional perceptions of Nature as \\"meaningful\\" for his characters and his own aloof awareness of Nature's unconcern.Outcast is, briefly, a love story, then a hate story. Sexual energies are seldom beneficent in Conrad, and his women characters are no doubt his weakest. As a previous reviewer, Herr Schneider, aptly points out, the woman Aissa in Outcast is utterly implausible if you stop to analyze her expressions. By the time she begins to have a voice, however, any reader like me will be so caught up in the rip-roaring emotional and physical violence of this novel that he/she will suspend all doubts quite willingly.The Outcast was Conrad's second novel, but curiously it has more syntactical tangles than Almayer's Folly, his first. One does have to wonder whether editors or colleagues played a role in Conrad's phenomenal command of his third language. Outcast seems to me to start very well, then drift for a few chapters, but then to build in tension and in verbal virtuosity along a parabolic curve of excitement. I swear, I read the 55 pages of the final Part Five without taking a breath."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"This novel cements my original impression of Joseph Conrad- that he is inconsistent: a gifted wordsmith, but poor storyteller.I enjoy his adventurous and romantic subject matter, and at times I love his descriptive prose: he is able to capture the moment beautifully.But more often, he gets too carried away with his own literariness. For all his expansive, melodramatic, flowery language, there is nothing to hold onto. He does not properly develop the plot or storyline, neither does he clearly narrate the action. What should be landmark events of the text are left vague. After a while, this obscurity causes the reader to lose interest: it just does not hold together. Jumping from one sub-plot to another deflates the tension. And everything is delivered with the same monotonous pace. The effect is no different with The Secret Agent, Heart of Darkness, and Under Western Eyes, all of which I similarly trudged through.Often his characterization is cartoonish. His portrayals of women lack warmth or realism. Willems' wife is practically a cardboard cutout: Aissa is the femme fatale from the underworld. In addition to the pantomime cast, the action can read like a stage-play, complete with theatrical, melodramatic interludes and unrealistic dialogues. Sometimes his insights and philosophical forays are memorable: other times trite or cliched.*Be aware of the large physical size of this particular edition, its dimensions are 20 X 25 cm. It makes a nice change to read a novel in such large format."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"Well, the slow march through Conrad's work continues...I wasn't a big fan of \\"Almayer's Folly\\" and when I found myself back in Sambir, for a second time, I had a little reader tantrum. About halfway through the book, however, I think Conrad hits his stride and I found myself positively enjoying reading the back story of Captain Lingard and Almayer and the rise of Sambir.I kept wondering, if my distaste of the previous book had been real, or if, in fact, what I took for a bad book, was actually Conrad writing such a detestable character as Almayer so well that I was rejecting the book... I guess it is possible. I have read villains and anti-heroes aplenty, but a central character, without a single redeeming quality, is a hard sell, especially as the basis for two books.The writing here is not to my taste, but I think has improved over the first effort and, at times, was quite enjoyable. I certainly hope Conrad finds another subject. If being a white man, alone in a savage world is his only theme, this project is going to drive me to drink."},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"I am not accustomed to reading book that ramble as much as this one although, l must admit, it KEEPS you wondee"},{"Title":"An Outcast of the Islands","review":"I love any book by Joseph Conrad and am on my way to reading just about everything he wrote. My next goal is to re-read it all again.However, Outcast of the Island is not a \\"GREAT\\" book or piece of literature. It is interesting and worth reading especially if you like Conrad. I see it as a colonial/romance novel critical of the \\"British Empire\\" and of a man caught in the empire trade game who is led by his own devices to survive in his own game.I like the descriptions of the exotic location, the dangerous love interest, and everything that is Conrad in style.His writing style is too generous in his early work. He could be more sparse (needs to put his language on a stairmaster and lean it down). Anyway, I don't want to be against the book. If you are actually thinking about it, then get it and read it.

The author explains the &quot;value of playful sex&quot; and gives one an inside view of chance to understand the motivations and rewards from engaging in the swinging lifestyle.As a long time member of the lifestyle, I am impressed with the amount of personal insight and candor from which the author writes. Most books on this subject are unrealistic or written by people that truly don't understand what it's like to be a part of the &quot;swinging life&quot;. Ed and Dana do and this book is a must read for anyone considering the lifestyle (and should be read by a few folks already in the lifestyle)."},{"Title":"Together Sex","review":"This book was originally written in 1976 and revised in 2001. According to the introduction the book is about swinging as it relates to group sex (sex parties). Personally, I wish they'd spent more of the book on just that, and less on a lot of other things.Too much of the book was, in my opinion, useless or outdated. Too often it seemed that the authors tried to sound over-educated and parts of the book came off too scientific and, in turn, too negative.While the book was revised in 2001, I'm not sure how much revision was actually done. The authors still focus their discussion on ad writing to doing so for contact magazines and pretty much state that they find little to no use with the online swinger sites (even though at that point they've already set up their own to promote the book).I would suggest completely skipping over the first 4 chapters and starting at Chapter 5, where the book finally gets into a bit of discussion on actually partying. From Chapter 5 on each chapter has some good points and some not so good.Chapter 7 discusses \\"Physical Matters\\" (from attraction to performance). The way the chapter started I thought they were going to say that beauty is relative and that beauty is about being who you are. But, they took a strong turn away from that to say that beauty is about being the best you that you can be, whatever it takes... even if that means plastic surgery - then you should do it. Once I got past that little \\"WTF?\\" moment, the rest of the chapter was actually pretty good, including their discussion on performance issues and how to deal with them.Chapter 8 \\"A Swinging Attitude\\" was also a good one and had a very good discussion of \\"tolerance\\" (aka the idea of being open-minded) something that has come up on this board many times.Chapter 9 \\"Handling Emotions\\" did a great job of covering the various emotions you may encounter as you swing, but really did very little in the way of discussing how to actually handle those emotions.The best chapters in the book were the last 3 chapters which were the most focused on actually sex parties and primarily gave instruction for how to throw a house party. Everything from what you need to have on hand, to how to properly invite your guests, to ideas for theme parties and contests (if you feel the need to go that route).Overall, I'd say this is not the book for those who are new to swinging and seeking to understand (or help their partner understand) swinging. I would most reccomend this book to experienced swingers who would like a good guide to \\"how to throw a house party\\"."},{"Title":"Together Sex","review":"We are just getting into this scene.

American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country by United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison navigates the lives and accomplishments of America's remarkable women, spanning from Mary Austin Holley to Sandra Day O'Connor and Amelia Earhart to Jackie Joyner-Kersee. The book reads like a collection of short stories, so it's perfect for the reader-on-the go. Read a chapter an evening, and be enlightened by a brief biography of an influential American woman, then commentary on the significance of her historical impact. Hutchison keeps the narrative light and lively, and she infuses the biography with her perspective on her subjects' lasting contribution.Diversity of subject strengthens this book. Senator Hutchinson groups the chapters into similar sections, such as \\"Pioneers and Preservationists,\\" \\"Education for Everyone,\\" \\"Conquering the Skies,\\" and \\"Public Lives, Public Service.\\" While Hutchinson is a political conservative, her biographical praise crosses back and forth across the ideological aisle - she gives equal admiration to Geraldine Ferraro and Madeline Albright as she does to Elizabeth Dole and Condoleezza Rice. And, her esteem reaches beyond politics. She commends healthcare pioneer Clara Barton, astronaut Sally Ride, and artist Mary Cassatt.The colloquial writing proves a little distracting. One more word-cutting and cleaning edit would have improved the work. However, Hutchinson voice is the book's finest attribute, and that remains clear throughout the biographies. Her admiring observations provide a personal touch to the history. An extraordinary woman herself, Hutchinson is the first woman to represent Texas in the U.S. Senate. The book highlights her own resourcefulness and intelligence and reveals her affection for her home state. She's a little partial to the ladies of Texas in her subject choice, but what Texan isn't?Don't read this book if you're looking for a challenging and intellectual dose of history - go buy a textbook instead. But, read American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country for an enriching, entertaining and comprehensive tour of the lives and accomplishments of 45 outstanding American women."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"Senator Hutchison is a woman who has risen above stereotypes to become the first woman in Texas elected to the Senate.

Put aside your political beliefs and you will have a book highlighting women who conquered the \\"glass ceiling\\" despite what was the norm of the times. These women may be from Timbuktu for all we know, but they are women whom our daughters can learn how to reach beyond gender stereotypes. Of course Senator Hutchison will include more women from Texas than from elsewhere, she grew up in Texas. These are women who influenced her and helped her achieve the \\"first\\" status as well.

That's what this book is about. Women who faced the challenge to use their talents and skills to gain offices and honors that had never before been attained by a woman.The first native-born American to be canonized (Elizabeth Seton); the first woman publisher (Elizabeth Palmer Peabody); the first woman to gain international recognition as a major artist (Mary Cassatt); the first woman to be elected to both houses of Congress (Margaret Chase Smith); the first African American to serve as National Security Advisor (Condoleezza Rice); the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for international reporting (Marguerite Higgins). Those are just some of the firsts you meet on these pages.Other heroines excelled in sports, broke color barriers or became known in music, nursing and government. By building on the stories of past heroines with interviews with women today, the reader learns what characteristics shaped these women into the heroines they have become and the qualities that made them great. The book includes an index and a section of suggested reading in case you want to know more about any particular heroine.

I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"In reading Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's (R-TX) book, American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country, I found a large error. The error was in her reference to NASA astronaut, Dr. Sally Ride;1. On page 207, 2nd paragraph Senator Hutchison writes: \\"Fast forward to June 18, 1983, and Dr. Ride became the first female astronaut for a mission into outer space.\\"2. Continuing on page 207, 3rd paragraph: \\"In 1983, she became the first women in space...\\"Dr. Ride was not the first woman to fly in outer space; she was the first \\"American\\" woman to fly in outer space and the third woman in outer space. The two other women that preceded her were Valentina Tereshkova (Vostok 6 in 1963) and Svetlana Savitskaya (Soyuz T-7 in 1982), both from the former Soviet Union. Some may argue that it is correct to say that Dr. Ride was the first women \\"astronaunt\\" as the former Soviet Union women were referred to as \\"cosmonaunts.\\" I do not agree, still incorrect information.One review of the book said that Senator Hutchinson's \\"combines biography and social history to shed light on what she calls the indomitable spirit of American women which has shaped both the country's history and its society.\\" Dr. Sally Ride's contribution to space flight and American women should be celebrated and she is an important a role model for women but it is also important that her accomplishments be presented correctly.It is unfortunate that this information was not researched more thoroughly or corrected by the editor. Several online encyclopedias contain the correct information.[...]"},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"Book only appealed to me because of the all but to brief sections on Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and Madeleine Albright, because these are two very independent women I admire.The book is a tad 'slap together'and many of the questions the Senator asks are lame. There is no even flow or lay out and in some ways I think the book is like a dinner party with to many odd guests and to many choices in food. Some of the time you come away satisfied, but often one is left hungry or wondering where the rest of the story is.I recommend Lazy B : Growing up on a Cattle Ranch in the American Southwest by Justice O'Connor and Madam Secretary: A Memoir by Madeleine Albright former Secretary of State who is still very much admired and respected in Europe, Asia and the middle east. Each tells the story of these independent thinking women who are both excellent role models for women of all ages and of a progressive mindset."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"That Kay Bailey Hutchinson is working to burnish her political credentials is evident in this thin tome. Her choices of American heroines are safe, politically correct and generally right-wing. Many of those chosen have had business or social relationships with Ms. Hutchinson, giving the impression that she is shoring up her own base. Without doubt, many of the women profiled - especially the Texans - have risen above female stereotypes and oversome other obstacles, but they seem bland and predictable. REALLY \\"spirited women who shaped our century\\" are conspicuously missing."},{"Title":"American Heroines: The Spirited Women Who Shaped Our Country","review":"It would be tempting simply to compare Hutchinson's book with that of another Senator----John F. Kennedy. Kennedy would of course successfully go on to the presidency in 1960 after rising to national prominence in the 1950's with Profiles in Courage. Certainly, there are some similarities between these two titles and authors.Kennedy was also roundly critiqued for writing a book about \`leadership' when he (certainly unlike brother Ted) had not been in the Senate leadership---or even in elective office----for a substantial period of time.While Hutchinson certainly could also find herself facing similar allegations today, her own work adds the layer of gender analysis which had obviously not been made available to Kennedy in the 1950's.Hutchinson's book has the benefit of being written well after the revival of American feminism. Feminism has subsequently encouraged many women to increase their public sector participation, find \`role models' for themselves, and make further progress on behalf of future generations. Whatever personal-political label she now claims (if any), Bailey had also participated in some of the feminist movement's activities-another claim which Kennedy could not make with his own earlier book. Whereas he was attempting to court swing voters who would not have recognized him unless he was representing their state, Hutchinson is also attempting to court women's rights advocates who might perhaps discount her interest in gender equity issues because of her state and party identification.The feminist movement is technically non-partisan, but the institutionalization of feminist and anti-feminist interest groups has entrenched the political parties. Hutchinson is hardly the only Republican woman serving in the senate (she is joined by four others) but she does take a more economically/socially moderate voting record than her New England counterparts Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe. This in turn causes state and national feminist PACS to give their \\"Republican\\" money only to the \`gypsy moths' and avoid the southern Republicans. Unfortunately, those feminist groups also overlook the common ground they do have with Hutchinson on women's rights.As a member of the Texas legislature, Hutchinson co-authored a rape reform bill with Sarah Weddington (who would later gain fame for successfully arguing Roe v. Wade) which reformed that state's rape prosecution laws. Removing the burden of proof from the survivor...etc, the Bailey-Weddington law successfully challenged the historical idea that \`good' women were not raped; rape was a crime of power---not lust or morals. Hutchinson also helped to pass the displaced homemakers bill, women who could no longer financially afford to be homemakers (whether because of divorce, breadwinner death, or the rising costs) deserved transition assistance such as college tuition credit breaks.Finally, Hutchinson came out against Admiral Frank Kelso's full retirement with military honors because she believed the women who had accused him of sexual harassment; her own personal experiences had subsequently built up her empathy for women in similar situations.This is hardly the resume of an anti-woman right wing extremist.Certainly Hutchinson has been careful with these \`woman activist' credentials. Local and state reproductive rights groups have criticized her position on abortion for being \`multiple choice'. Bailey wants to continue portraying herself as a \`moderate' while also being acutely aware the social conservatives who control the Texas Republican Party are not open to any compromise on abortion. Because they consider abortion (and even some kinds of birth control) \`murder,' these groups eye Hutchinson with suspicion-is she really their \`friend'?Since women's history remains generally underreported in Texas, I actually had considered the through inclusion of women's history important to the central premise of Hutchinson's book. Hutchinson understands that increases in women's political participation did not happen out of the goodness of somebody's heart, but instead took many years to see fruition. The individuals who are profiled in this book are only a fragment of the masses who were once formally excluded from political participation. Such a legal expansion had taken many years to achieve, and our democratic nation is still dismantling cultural vestiges against women's public sector participation according to interspersed narratives about the Senator's own life.The interweaving of her own personal life story (although definitely needing better editing for continuity purposes) throughout this book definitely serves a purpose. It is supposed to remind critics/potential critics that Hutchinson personally does not want to return to the \`good old days' when women's issues were only regarded as private-personal issues. She approaches it differently, but appears to share some common ground with left-wing feminists who have advocated for greater gender equity in both government and the general society, including former United States Representatives Bella Abzug and Patricia Schroeder.The fact that two women have served as secretary of state (and are both included in this book) illustrates how far we have come from 1955 when the only women in presidential cabinets had served in \`outer cabinet' positions. Frances Perkins was the first female cabinet secretary in 1933 (Labor), by the publication of Kennedy's book, Oveta Culp Hobby lead Eisenhower's Department of Health Education and Welfare Such expansion of women's leadership roles also demonstrates how the national definition of \`leadership' itself has expanded.I question whether some of the profiles which were included in this book would genuinely share Hutchinson's gender consciousness (however self-labeled). Even if they are not attacking it, it seems like some of these other women are not grateful for the gender/racial revolutions which made their public sector participation a reality.Considering that Iraq's ever-mounting casuality level is being facilitated through her promotion of false evidence about Iraq's (ultimately non-existent) \`weapons of mass destruction' program, including Condoleezza Rice among the leadership profiles is not wise. Because Rice's claim had comprised the backbone of the Bush administration's rationale for invading Iraq, the subsequent truth substantially undercuts her public weight for this---and other public policies. This person, who thought nothing of American troops deployed with fabricated evidence, does not convincingly demonstrate values and morals herself.It is important that we can recognize that women are not automatically better or more ethical leaders than their male counter parts. Although this proposition honestly is still being advanced by the editors of some other \`women in politics' titles, it is generally now in disfavor. Speaking only for myself, I would rather have a male public official in office with whom I agreed with on the issues than a woman public official with whom I did not agree with, but still increased women's numerical representation in government-such as Hutchinson herself. Even if she is confirmed by the Senate as the next Secretary of State, Rice is not likely to be remembered as an ethical individual who did the right thing for America.I do however applaud Hutchinson for wanting to show that talented women can (and do) cross all ideological and/or party affiliations. At this point, the only people who are considering books on women's leadership to be \`extremist' are themselves extremist in their scornful view of all women's public sector potential. Women's public sector participation (and their interest in politics) is not a passing fad, but has become a necessity for the national good."},{"Title":"Rand McNally Streetfinder","review":"This is the book all listings in the local MLS (Multipel Listing Service) reference. It makes driving around and house-hunting a whole lot easier. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Foundations of Reading Instruction","review":"E. A. Betts wrote a critical book in 1946,Foundations of reading instruction,: With emphasis on differentiated guidance,when it comes to reading instruction. In this book he discusses differentiated instruction, a \\"buzz word\\" in current education discussions and trainings. What I have found to be the most influential is his discussion on Frustrational Level, Instructional Level, Independent Level, and Capacity Level of the students. Betts was the first researcher to use these terms which are commonly used today. It is interesting that the terms original meanings have been shifted by publishers of leveled readers who want to define the Instructional Level for every child in a broad manner. For example, many will indicate this is an instructional level text for a student since they are in grade 2 and it is a 2.1 level text. Betts looked at it more in terms of the child's individual sight vocabulary for the respective text being read. For Betts, Instructional Level is when the student knows 95% of the words in the passage to be read, along with their meaning. This certainly puts more on the teacher to find out what the student knows, rather than pulling a book off the shelf or leveled reader rack because a comprehension test indicated the student is at \\"instructional level\\" with a 2.1 book. There is a current teacher training program that use Betts' research, along with current research, that is changing the way teachers look at reading [i.e., Instructional Consultation Teams ([...])].This book was written in 1946 and so some concepts and directives given to teachers have not lasted the test of current research. The overall reading instruction pieces in this book are solid and a good place for teachers to reflect on their own practices, as well as learning more about what quality instruction in reading really is. The book is a great find for those interested in the history of reading instruction, not to mention how great this classic textbook for teachers looks in your personal library."},{"Title":"Mac 911","review":"As of fall 2005, this book is now way outdated unless you are still running Classic.

It reads like skimming a stone across the liquid surface of current [digital] architectural discourse. Each bounce touches a relative key point maintaining enough speed to progress to the next without requiring any perceived depth of substance. This presents the reader with a wide scoping text offering potential to rethink architecture as a non-static art, but does little to critically place this mode of production within practice.The major difficulty I have with this book [animate form] is that the projects chosen have become already dated. Although monograph culture can be blamed for the presentation of more recent work, for a book's whose content is all about a newness of direction and dynamic qualities of change, the material seems incredibly inert. Even the CDRom is a very traditional piece of homepage publishing. It simply catalogues the animations for the projects and does not provide another level of understanding through hyperlink connections.The book competently collates the work of Greg Lynn up to 1996 and is still required reading for those involved with producing new modes of architectural design through technological advancement. I guess I was expecting a More innovative approach to the publishing of Greg Lynn's material."},{"Title":"Animate Form","review":"Again we should be amazed at these wonderful algorithmic creatures that have continued to sprawl for the last half a century or more.

Great story!"},{"Title":"On Reading the Constitution","review":"If you find youself reading this or any other work by Laurence Tribe, it is pretty safe to assume that you also find youself somewhere on the left of the political spectrum. I can only imagine that you would come to this book looking for a coherent theory on how to read and interpret that sometimes vague and confusing document upon which our country was founded. Unfortunately, you will not find much original insight in this book, though if you are merely looking for an argument with which to attack so-called &quot;strict constructionism,&quot; this will serve that purpose quite well.It seemed to me that this book did little more than offer up a series of comparisons between law and the Constitution and other disciplines like literature and mathematics. While that may serve a useful purpose, it is of little value for those attempting to find a workable liberal theory through which to interpret the Constitution. And repeatedly throughout this book Tribe and Dorf explicity state that they do not have such a theory, or at least refuse to claim that their ideas are in any way paramount or final.Nonetheless, it does offer up seveal solid critiques of conservative interpretations of the Constitution which might come in handy, or at least serve as a starting point for further investigation. I would also recommed that one read Antonin Scalia's &quot;A Matter of Interpretation,&quot; which contains a rebuttal by Laurence Tribe similar to the arguments found here, but also has a very solidly philosophical criticism of Scalia's &quot;textualist&quot; theory by Ronald Dworkin.Finally, and this has little to do with this book and more to do with jwhoeme's review below - jwhoeme seems to think that Tribe's chapter or arguments on how NOT to read the Constitution somehow presuppose that he knows how to read it, and I feel that that is a rather poor assumption on the part of jwhoeme. Just because one says they know how NOT to do something doesn't me they know how to do it. I know that bashing someone in the head with a rock is not how one performs brain surgery, but that doesn't mean I have any idea how to do it properly."},{"Title":"On Reading the Constitution","review":"Dr. Tribe of Harvard Law makes many interesting points in his book concerning the methods and approach one ought to take while reading or interpreting the Constitution. I would suggest this book to people that have read the Constitution not once but many times and who are looking to further their understanding. On the contrary you should not purchase this book looking for a formula to understand the Constitution! Rather this book promotes one's thoughts and helps the reader develop an approach in which they ought and ought not read the Constitution. Interestingly enough, for Tribe to claim that he knows the manner in which we ought not read the Constitution presupposes that he knows how we ought to. This then contradicts his final chapters when he claims that there is no correct approach to the Constitution and that any one person's interpretation is no more right nor wrong than the next reader's."},{"Title":"On Reading the Constitution","review":"As was suggested in the previous reviews reading this to find a cogent methodology for Constitutional exegesis is futile, and it was with that expectation I bought the book, relying on the reputation of it's authors.Several premises are disturbing, for they point out a lack of Historical background of our founding. It suggests there are significant anomalies, for example if the Constitution gives the States a right to republican government and does not define republican government then a pliant construction and application of the text is suggested, this kind of logic is furthered in describing the general terms of the preamble as granting a broad license for inerpretation. The number of explanations offered by Madison on the subject of republican form of gvernment alone is sufficient to dispell the former, and with regard to the latter the topic was first adressed by Brutus, an Antifederlaist, and well responded to in Federalist Essay 41. As the Federalist Essays were a response to fears and criticisms of the then proposed Constitution, the ratification debates as well as the Federalist Essays does grant a significant view as to the consent of the governed 'On Reading the Constitution' seems to deny existed, or may presently exist.The authors proceed to draw from confusions in the 'conservative' camp regarding constitutional specificity to further their point, quoting Rhenquist from a Texas Law Review article 1976, 'The framers of the Constitution wisely spoke in general language and left to succeeding generations the task of applying that language to the increasingly changing environment..' Alas poor Madison's efforts in describing the exertions of perspicuity found in federalist 37, having missed the attention of liberals as well as conservatives, has opened the door to a pliant construction of the Constitution. We were also cautioned by Madison to be wary of the changes of the meaning of words over time, Adams once described a church service as 'awful' he meant full of awe, this example is not solitary, and it's impact has not been fully examined.I hold no doubt both Michael Dorf, and Laurence Tribe are concerned and virtuous citizens, as well as skilled and erudite practioners of Law, yet the book allows little insight into Constitutional Exegesis. Lincoln warned at Cooper Union to never supplant the logic of the fathers when we realize they understood the question better than we, it is time we examine what they knew, instead of focusing on the confusion that might exist."},{"Title":"Avalanche Annie: A Not-So-Tall Tale","review":"The author writes the story like a rhyming poem, with made up words thrown in here and there.

Preface to The Collected Edition [vii-xiv]. Original preface without title [xv-xix].First published by Doubleday in 1931. Original preface without title.First published by Heinemann in The Collected Edition with a new 5pp. preface by the author in 1936==============================================\\"Life is really very fantastic, and one has to have a peculiar sense of humour to see the fun of it.\\"This very short quote from the not so short story Virtue is simply the best way to start my little essay on \\"Six Stories Written in the First Person Singular\\", Somerset Maugham's fourth mature collection of short stories and the second - after the previous one, \\"Ashenden\\" (1928) - which is not concerned with tropical locales and the fates of British Empire builders. But the main theme is the same as in all other of Maugham's short stories, as in his whole oeuvre indeed - the human nature pure and simple (although it is neither actually).I remember quite well the first time I read something by Somerset Maugham. It was the short story \\"Virtue\\". Don't ask me when this happened, it was many years ago. I was having my lunch in a little club near the Faculty where I had the pleasure to study just then. While eating the relatively tasteless Schnitzel (and the utterly tasteless mashed potatoes) I went through the table of contents of the Maugham's volume I had just bought and having liked the title of \\"Virtue\\", I read it chewing thoughtfully. I don't know whether I was just distracted by the eating or by something else (or not at all) but I found the short story uncommonly tedious. My mother had told me: \\"If you see something by Somerset Maugham, the short stories particularly, buy it for me!\\". So I did. Out of pure curiosity I started reading \\"\\"Virtue during my lunch and could hardly finish it. It seemed a (short?) story of inordinate length, with boring plot and uninteresting lifeless characters.Now I am simply astonished when I come to think that I could ever have had such opinion of Maugham in general and this short story in particular. Now I consider \\"Virtue\\" not only one of Maugham's absolute masterpieces but also one of the short stories closest to perfection. Not only has its plot several amazing twists but all characters are so alive and so convincing that I can actually hear their conversations and see their faces while reading. There is not even one superfluous word in the whole piece. Even Maugham, notorious for his simple but simply perfect style, rarely wrote passages, let alone whole stories, that combined revealing glimpses of the human nature, succinctness of style and dramatic action in so fine a way. From the hilarious introduction about the poignant and almost unbearable feelings when smoking cigars and eating oysters or lamb cutlet until the final and highly charged emotionally conversation, it is simply perfect. Or at least as close to perfection as any short story in this world could hope to reach. And its power to stimulate reflection on various aspects of life must never be underestimated:\\"...but if the folly of men made one angry one would pass one's life in a state of chronic ire.\\"\\"'Good gracious, she could have remained faithful to him in spirit while she was being unfaithful to him in the flesh. That is a feat of legerdemain that women find it easy to accomplish.''What a odious cynic you are.''If it's cynical to look truth in the face and exercise common sense in the affairs of life, then certainly I'm a cynic and odious if you like.'\\"Some people with more sensitive nature might well be offended, and even appalled, by such lines. I won't beat about the bush and I'll say right away that I find Maugham's cynical view of life simply fascinating. More important still, I find it truly believable and utterly convincing. Maugham's point of view about the human nature might not be real or true, he never claimed it was, but who can tell if this really is so or not? Who can tell with any certainty where the truth about the human beings lies: in the realm of cynicism or in the real of the romanticism? Or somewhere in the middle? I should like to think that the last one is the truest one; but I still find the cynical approach far more convincing than the romantic one. I don't mind telling you that Mr Maugham is the driving force behind that. I daresay such a warped view is not something very nice but there it is. And to finish with Virtue, I have never ever heard all my philosophy about women condensed in just one line. Here it is:\\"I prefer a loose woman to a selfish one and a wanton to a fool.\\"The most extraordinary thing about these \\"Six Stories Written in the First Person Singular\\" is that none of the other five are any worse than \\"Virtue\\" itself. \\"The Alien Corn\\" and \\"The Human Element\\" make particularly fascinating read, not least because of two locations, Munich and Rhodes respectively, that are not to be found in any other short story of Maugham. But there is so much more than that in these pieces. \\"The Alien Corn\\" is a brilliant and poignant study of art as the meaning of life in the hands of the aspiring pianist George, whereas \\"The Human Element\\" is indeed a very human drama with all its hypocrisy and egotism. When he was writing about the human element Maugham definitely was in his element giving you bits of human nature all along the story without slowing down the action at all:\\"People are always a little disconcerted when you don't recognize them, they are so important to themselves, it is a shock to discover of what small importance they are to others.\\"\\"The worst of having so much tact was that you never quite knew whether other people were acting naturally or being tactful too.\\"\\"I have always found the Bright Young People extremely tedious. The gay life seems dull and stupid to the onlooker, but the moralist is unwise to judge it harshly. It is as absurd to be angry with the young things who lead it as with a litter of puppies scampering aimlessly around, rolling one another over and chasing their tails. It is well to bear with fortitude if they cause havoc in the flower beds or break a piece of china. Some of them will be drowned because their points are not up to the mark, and the rest will grow up into well-behaved dogs. Their unruliness is due only to the vitality of youth.\\"\\"The Human Element\\" has one other and very compelling asset: Betty Welldon-Burns is surely one of the most charming female characters ever conceived by Maugham.\\"The Round Dozen\\", \\"Jane\\" and \\"The Creative Impulse\\" show a different side of Maugham's genius for short stories: his caustic wit and immense power to satirize the idiotic limitations of his contemporaries and the society they lived in. Yet, even without the darkest human passions and the most brutal climaxes, Maugham's stories always have, as he was very fond of saying, a beginning, a middle and an end. Quite separately from the perfect structure, the fine writing style, the brilliantly developed characters and the natural flow of the plots, these stories are a very rich mine of perceptive points about the human nature and you never know what you are going to dig out. \\"Jane\\", in particular, is not just a very amusing story to read but an exceptional revelation about the total insincerity of the society. On the one hand Jane is very remarkable woman because:\\"She managed (as so few people do) to look exactly what she was.\\"and on the other hand, she is an exceptionally honest woman indeed! I think the final few paragraphs deserve to be quoted in their entirety:\\"'You know, when I married Gilbert and settled in London and people began to laugh at what I said no one was more surprised than I was. I'd said the same things for thirty years and no one ever saw anything to laugh at. I thought it must be my clothes or my bobbed hair or my eyeglass. Then I discovered it was because I spoke the truth. It was so unusual that people thought it humorous. One of these days someone else will discover the secret, and when people habitually tell the truth of course there'll be nothing funny in it.''And why am I the only person not to think it funny?' asked Mrs. Tower.Jane hesitated a little as though she were honestly searching for a satisfactory explanation.'Perhaps you don't know the truth when you see it, Marion dear,' she answered in her mild good-natured way.It certainly gave her the last word. I felt that Jane would always have the last word. She was priceless.\\"The eternal hypocrisy of the human race, the enormous amount of bogus people and sham ideas, cruel as it sounds, was always one of the topics Maugham most relished to delve into. By a way of a little digression, here is a short excerpt from one of the greatest masterpiece for the stage Maugham ever wrote, \\"The Circle\\" (1921), where in just a few lines a whole universe of purely human phenomena is contained; and the last sentence is pretty much the same what Jane said, but expressed even more brilliantly.\\"C.-C.: My dear Arnold, we all hope that you have before you a distinguished political career. You can't learn too soon that the most useful thing about a principle is that it can always be sacrificed to expediency.ARNOLD: But supposing it doesn't come off? Women are incalculable.C.-C.: Nonsense! Men are romantic. A woman will always sacrifice herself if you give her the opportunity. It is her favourite form of self-indulgence.ARNOLD: I never know whether you're a humorist or a cynic, father.C.-C.: I'm neither, my dear boy; I'm merely a very truthful man. But people are so unused to the truth that they're apt to mistake it for a joke or a sneer.\\"Finally, a remark about prefaces and introductions must be made. The volume contains an original introduction written in 1931 for the First Edition and another preface written five years later for The Collected Edition. The latter is a wonderful essay on the different ways how a story can be written and is to be found, in greatly extended and revised form of course, in the \\"Art of Fiction\\", the introductory chapter of \\"Ten Novels and Their Authors\\" (1954), whereas the former explores in some detail the creation of characters in fiction and their relationship with the characters of real life. As all prefaces, introductions and forewords Maugham ever wrote, both of these make an absorbing read for everybody even remotely interested in the art of fiction. It is certainly worth noting that in the original introduction from 1931 there is the only place, to the best of my belief, in all Maugham ever wrote and published where he openly confessed that in this case only he had not used his usual method for developing characters through elaboration of qualities that belong to different living people as well as to himself but he had actually drawn a portrait of a real person. This is the notorious Mortimer Ellis, the principal character in \\"The Round Dozen\\", a short story first published in the London magazine \\"Good Housekeeping\\" in 1923 but reprinted next year in \\"Hearst's International\\" under the catchy title \\"The Ardent Bigamist\\". Nothing more need be said about the plot. As for the creation of fictional characters, Maugham's shrewd and pithy observations could hardly be bettered by anybody, least of all by me. They certainly deserve to be quoted.\\"...I have at one time or another been charged with portraying certain persons so exactly that it was impossible not to know them. I have been accused of bad taste. This has disturbed me, not so much for my own sake (since I am used to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune) as for the sake of criticism in general. We authors of course try to be gentlemen, but we often fail and we must console ourselves by reflecting that few writers of any consequence have been devoid of certain streak of vulgarity. Life is vulgar.\\"\\"I have known authors who declared that none of their characters was ever even remotely suggested by anyone they had known and I have unhesitatingly accepted their assertion. But I have ceased to wonder why they never managed to create a character that was not wooden and lifeless. I think indeed that most novelists, and surely the best, have worked from life. But though they have had in mind a particular person this is not to say that they have copied him nor that the character they have devised is to be taken for a portrait. In the first place, they have seen him through their own temperament and if they are writers of originality this means that what they have seen is somewhat different from the fact. They have taken only what they wanted from him. They have used him as a convenient peg on which to hang their own fancies. To suit their purpose they have given him traits which the model did not possess. They have made him coherent and substantial. A real person, however eminent, is for the most part too insignificant for the purposes of fiction.\\"\\"The complete character, the result of elaboration rather than of invention, is art, and life in the raw, as we know, is only its material. It is unjust then for the critics to blame an author because he draws a character in whom they detect a likeness to someone they know and wholly unreasonable of them to expect him never to take one trait or another from living creatures. The odd thing is that when, these charges are made, emphasis is laid only on the less laudable characteristics of the individual. If you say of a character in a book that he is kind to his mother, but beats his wife, everybody will cry: Ah, that's Brown, how beastly to say he beats his wife; and no one thinks for a moment of Jones and Robinson who are notoriously kind to their mothers. I draw from this the somewhat surprising conclusion that we know our friends by their defects and not by their merits.\\"\\"Nothing is so unsafe as to put into a novel a person drawn line by line from life. His values are all wrong, and, strangely enough, he does not make the other characters of the book seem false, but himself. He never convinces.\\""},{"Title":"MASTERING KEMPO","review":"I found this book to be a very interesting and informative look at the art of Kempo. The author presents information in a refreshingly unbiased, down to earth manner which is very easy to read and digest. While this book will by no means teach you Kempo (it focuses more on the WHY than the HOW), I have found it to be an excellent addition to my lessons. Many of the ideas in the book will blend well into any form of Kempo, and probably other arts as well. The author presents many interesting and effective ideas on training, both physical and mental, as well as loads of interesting history. The only complaint I could possibly make is that I wanted to read MORE when I finished! I hope the author chooses to expand the information presented here in future volumes."},{"Title":"MASTERING KEMPO","review":"I'd actually like to give the book ***1/2, but I figure since they only allow whole numbers, I'll round down. Much can be learned from this book, of you are a begginer, or practice another Asian fighting form. Particularly, I like the explaination of Embu, and the principles behind Kempo's fluid striking combos. One thing that caught my eye is how the author always tried to link Chinese, Okinawan, and Japanese martial history, ephasising Okinawan. I'm no historian, and though I doubt the links were as close as presented, it did pique my interest in seeing how accurate the history was, and has therefore opened my eyes to Karate/Kung-Fu/Kempo history. Some basic striking techniques are presented, but the bulk of the book is not &quot;how to do a front punch&quot;, it is &quot;do this to make any strike more effective&quot;. I dislike, however, that the author seems to call every Asian art Kempo, including Jeet Kune Do. Overall, the book is good to read, but mostly for the &quot;art/philosophy/history&quot; types. Folks interested in sport or protection would do better to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"MASTERING KEMPO","review":"A special method of Kempo training origins during class called &quot;Embu&quot;. Embu is extremely efficient way of teaching students how to apply their skills in actual combat while avoiding the contentiousness nature of sparring. Sparring is not the traditional method for teaching martial arts. The purpose of sparring to teach speed, distance, rythm, and timing. However, the end results of sparring while not create the desired quality and deep understanding of the art.Anciently, the fighting monks practiced kempo to improve personal security against bandits. It is very doubtful these monks would have engaged in actual fighting to practice the martial art. Monks regarded injury to an another human being as unacceptable. Often after a real confrontation, they would administer relief to the injuried attackers, when possible. The monks sought peace and esteemed themselves as pacifist. So, how did they obtain fighting skills second to none?The monks practiced kempo using the philosophy called embu. Embu in Japanese means &quot;Martial exercise.&quot; The first Embu method has two partner moving simulateously, without any prearrange techniques. They move softly and slowly maintaining safety. The one punch pull is required to avoid contact and serious injury. The flow between defense and offense is expressed during the exercise. To the viewer, it seems like the practitioners are engaged in a dance: weaving, entering, blocking, and striking. The use of hand and foot skills is encouraged. As the skill levels increase, vitals areas become the pin point targets. Embu should appear effortless and direct.The second embu method requires coreograph or a set of moves to be practiced. A group of four students work together with one student defending against the other three. Each student has a set of moves to perform, whether it be an attack or an defense. As students masters the old movements they can begin to create new movements. The new movements usually are created after a few years of study with the teacher. At first the student learns how to perform each movement. The movements are practice slowly at first, and the speed increased as their skill improves. Eventually, the practice increases in speed and power. The attacking students measure their response after each defense technique is performed by the defending student. The flow of motion can increase in speed and power until it closely approximates real combative environments. The one inch pull punch or kick is encouraged, to avoid serious injury, and allow for continueous training. If injury starts to occur during training, students are required to examine levels of control, slow the techniques down, and apply an softer application of the technique.Eventually, the subtle mysteries of the technique are revealed, and as the student reflects on the technique a vast range of application are realized: joint turns, throws, cavity presses, blocks, strikes can be seen in the technique. Additionally, the use of chi and mental focus changes the techniques consequences. Kempo real power is understanding vital points and how mental focus increase the effectiveness of the strikes and block. The most powerful material breakers are often practitioners of kempo. Softer and more penetrating potential is realized by the defending student. The student begins to visual the physical consequences resulting from each techniques. The degree of reflection depends on the understanding of the student and their perspectiviness. Students are required to reflect on their practice and work together to improve each others perfection.Kempo techniques are expanded to use grappling. Anciently and modernly, Chin na expresses itself within the philosophy of kempo. Throws, chokes, joint locks put the receiver down. Finishing strikes can be apply allowing the practitioner to clear the oppponent before moving to the next attacker.During practice Kempo trains against a vast variety of weapons: knives, clubs, staff, sword, and hand to hand. Embu philosophy still applies regardless of the attack pattern and type. The goal is to blend and work harmously and effortless against a wide range of spacial patterns. Position, speed, power, and feel are developed during practice.Embu does not encourage aggression. It allows realistic self-defense training. The result is a stronger feeling of calmness and control by the student. More importantly it enourages cooperation and control through a heighten sense of awareness. Movement can flow from one attacker to another, awareness of how space can be occuppied is anticipated. Vulnerabilities become traps with counters, locks, and strikes responding. In Kempo, embu is essential to proper training and development."},{"Title":"MASTERING KEMPO","review":"Having been a huge fan of Bill Durbin's many articles published in the various martial arts magazines during the 1990s, I was really excited to see another book out by him. What I have always enjoyed about his writing is that he provides an incredibly well researched historical background on the various topics, in addition to the technical/technique information. So many modern \\"martial arts\\" are so far removed from their historical lineages that few people truly understand where true martial arts (combat arts) came from and how the training originally happened. While there are some great MA history books out there (Draeger et al), all the emphasis on modern sport fighting/competition has really muddied the traditional true martial arts water, so to speak. Durbin seems to be a true traditionalist, and always backs up his theories with historical fact, which I appreciate very much; a nice breath of fresh air and a change from the \\"just do it this way bcause that's the way we've always done it\\" mentality of many MA systems. While it's true that this book is not even remotely a comprehensive kempo instruction manual, it IS a solid insght into the basic foundation of kempo in it's historical, combat-oriented context. I highly recommend it, and encourage anyone interested in books of this nature to see if they can locate and/or download any of his past articles (I have about 60 of them, and I know there were some that I didn't get) from magazines like Black Belt, and Karate/Kung Fu Illustrated."},{"Title":"MASTERING KEMPO","review":"I bought the book and have enjoyed the history and technique lessons it teaches.

I read chapters 20-32 as a review of electromagnetics. The treatment was quite superior to the standard texts that I used some years ago. Although my experience is limited to this 1990 edition of Physics Extended with Modern Physics, I suspect that more recent texts by Wolfson and Pasachoff would also be well worth pursuing.The authors do a creditable job of explaining mathematical concepts in the context of physics. The chapters are well-integrated and frequent reference is made to earlier topics. I often found myself browsing earlier chapters simply out of interest. The text follows the standard three-course physics sequence, but the authors maintain a high interest level by inserting modern topics throughout the text. I remember my first physics course as being somewhat unexciting. A student had to maintain interest in physics through outside reading.I highly recommend this text and these authors. I have looked at several other recent physics textbooks since I originally penned this review and I still favorably recommend Wolfson and Pasachoff."},{"Title":"Physics: Extended with modern physics","review":"I bought this book used at Amazon.com.

He expanded popular music by including politics, social commentary and philosophy into its vocabulary. He told more folks what was happening than the politicians and news reporters combined...and the counterculture loved him! We still do! While exploring and creating musical styles, Dylan did remain true to his roots in traditional American song.I am so sorry that the book is out of print.

If you have ever enjoyed watching the wonderful &quot;Upstairs Downstairs&quot; series or reading other tales which reflect the upstairs downstairs lives of the British class system, this is for you. It is light, entertaining and the author writes so fluidly, it has inspired me to begin reading more of her works."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"Monica Dickens, the great-grandaughter of Charles Dickens, fits into the &quot;good sport&quot; type of memoirist, recalling life experiences for which she was quite unprepared. I think of Betty MacDonald's &quot;The Egg and I.&quot; Apparently well-to-do, Ms. Dickens decided to work as a Cook General for a couple years during the 1930's. The book is a chronicle of her relationships and experiences with various employers. I fully expected that the various households would blend into each other but was delighted to discover how vividly the personalities were portrayed, and so they remained distinct. Most memorable was the clothing designer with a constant finger on the call button, a mistrust of her spending habits and a penchant for draping her in fabrics to envision his newest creations. Some may have a problem with the fact that Ms. Dickens took on the job as a lark and could return to her comfortable life at any time, but the fact is that she really was up to her elbows in the muck of a 1930's kitchen. All in all, I found it a delightful read, although the final chapter which recounts a lecture on &quot;The Problem of the Servant Today&quot; is tedious and merely restates in an arid manner the &quot;problems&quot; so well-documented in the rest of the book."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"Monica Dicken's autobiographical novels are some of the most delightful books I have ever read. I first read &quot;One pair of hands&quot; some 25 years ago after finding an old copy in my local library. I rarely remember novels, but her's were so entertaining, I simply could not forget them. Her exploits trying to make it as a servant, even though she knew little about cleaning or cooking, are really funny--something akin to &quot;I Love Lucy.&quot; I hope some day that some smart movie producer takes all of her novels and makes a series of movies about them--at least Masterpiece Theatre ought to be interested! Monica Dickens wrote about being a reporter, training as a nurse, and working in a factory making airplanes for the war as well. Her books are worth finding in a used book store. I got to reread them through inter-library loan from Meridith College, Raleigh, NC."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"I thought it would be difficult to make an interesting book out of someone's life as a kitchen servant, but this is a great book -- and a vivid look at British society's levels 50 years ago. A great read."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"This is a situational comedy of its times - of a well-bred English girl who, because she was bored, decided to become a cook among other things. She is not highly successful even by her own standards - the souffle went soggy, the scones were burnt etc. and she is sooo tired, and stressed and flustered - but for the reader, it is terribly hilarious.Its not &quot;deep&quot; (don't expect any sermons on the poverty gap - she spent all her earnings on clothes) but do expect a laugh or two."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"An quick and easy to read book, but thouroughly fascinating. Monica Dickens describes the life of a cook-general in 1930s England. The upper classmen she meets are described excellently. She meets a lazy bachelor, enigmatic owner of a vast country estate, and a kind family, her last employees. This book is not long and engages readers. The only thing i didn't like was that the only personal reflection included in the book was left to the end. The rest of the book was devoted to her life and the people she meets. However, i recommed this excellent book."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"Looking for a light but well-written book? This is it. Absolutely charming."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"Monica Dickens has a gift for relating things humorously and the ability to laugh at herself. This book shows the lifestyle of the very rich in old England compared with that of the very poor. A must read, if there ever was one."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"\\"One Pair of Hands\\" by Monica Dickens clearly demonstrates that writing skills are genetic. Like her great-grandfather Charles, Monica Dickens knows how to write well. The book is charming. It chronicles her life during her twenties when she decides to try her hand at domestic service out of sheer boredom. As they say, hilarity ensues! Readers who have ever made a complete mess in the kitchen or have ever had a stingy boss can relate whole-heartedly to her trials and tribulations."},{"Title":"One Pair of Hands","review":"Not only have I throughly enjoyed this tale relating the author's brief career \\"below stairs\\", but I've lent it around and everyone who's read it has loved it too. Highly recommended for \\"upstairs/downstairs\\" types, for humor, for those who are interested in mid 20 century london below stairs life, or for Monica Dickens fans -- grab her \\"Talking of Horses\\" too."},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"This is one of the better books on detoxification. Most others give various recipes and regimens to accomplish some form of detoxification without providing sufficient background information to understand how it is supposed to work and why. The author of this book starts with why you should detoxify, the five principles of balanced health, and the seven most important steps. People are much more likely to follow through when they know what to expect and understand why they are doing it. Written in an easy-to-read style the author explains concepts very clearly without introducing any unnecessary complications. Detox and Revitalize is highly recommended and especially so for those new to detoxification who want to gain a broad understanding of the purpose and process."},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"This book has really inspired me and my daughter to eat more raw food on a daily basis. We really notice our energy levels improving. The book outlines a detoxification semi-fast that we were able to do for two days. The book recommends a week.Some of it is a little too difficult for those of us who have 9-5 jobs and families, but in general the suggestions are easy to follow and have really quick pay-offs: more energy, no circles under the eyes, no water retention, belly gets flatter quickly, and skin clears up! It's no wonder that a lot of actresses go to the author's spa regularly!Another good thing about the book is that it gives smoothies and simple recipes that my 11 year old can easily make. It puts everything together into a plan that works and has lots of suggestions for how to modify the plan based on practicalities."},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"Susana L. Belen's Detox and Revitalise is easy to read and has a wealth of information in it regarding diet, nutrition, excercise, detoxification, juicing, fasting, and stress management-to name just a few. She also has many suggestions for a balanced diet and lifestyle to increase ones overall health and well being.I am already involved in alternative health and health foods and I still found many useful ideas. Ironically, I was given this book as a gift the day I bought a take-away dinner for friends. Afterwards we all felt sick and lacking in energy- a timely reminder while reading about the benefits of eating well and detoxification!!"},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"After spending one of the most eye-opening and amazing weeks of my life at Susana's We Care Spa in California, this book keeps me going daily with recipes, ideas, motivations, and is a constant tangible reminder of that week. I can't wait to go back, after a week learning about detox and clarifying the skin & body inside and out, this book is a must have for anyone interested in total body wellness, whole foods, and a long & healthy life."},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"This book may be useful for people who are already knowledgeable about detoxing b/c that way you can discriminate, know what to use and what not use. The book comes very close to sounding like \\"holistic mumbo jumbo\\" which is too bad since cleansing can be very beneficial. I would use Clean by Alejandro Junger, M.D. for first time detoxing, its more straightforward."},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"I have been doing a lot of self teaching in nutrition and alternative health for 34 years as well as obtaining a BS in nutrition, and I was happy to learn some things and very put off by some of the misinformation I found. The average reader won't of course know what is good to take away and what to skip over. Good luck"},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"This book was a good read....at first. Some of the detox ideas in the book are a little much for me and didn't seem safe in general. But mine is not to judge. You'll have to read the book for yourself and find out if I am not the one who is wrong. Just not my cup of tea, at least not all of the ideas."},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"Interesting guide on detox for your mind and body. Took several recommendations and incorporated them into my diet and life."},{"Title":"Detox and Revitalize","review":"As this was my first book on detoxification, I wasn't too impressed. The only reason I decided to give it a two-star rating is because it does have some pretty good information. The problem is that the author suggests things that at this time I can not afford, I'm a college student that is getting ready to graduate and pay off my schooling and I can not buy air purifiers, water purifiers, and I certainly can't through out my microwave as she suggests. Another problem I that since I'm only beginning to research this topic, I'm also not fully into my vegan diet and certainly don't know enough about fasting to actually do one yet. I assumed the book would be about cleanses, or at least discuss the ins and outs of fasting. All-in-all, not a good book for beginners. That is unless you only want the information contained in a portion of the book. Who knows, maybe it will be of use to me later on when I know more about cleansing and fasting."},{"Title":"Our Friend the Charlatan (Large Print)","review":"It is becoming a rare treat to visit a walk-in used book store and find something wanted and unexpected. I recently had the opportunity to browse in an old used book store, stuffed with two floors of books, in the Capitol Hill section of Washington, D.C. I have the habit of looking for books by the late Victorian novelist George Gissing, (1857 -- 1903), and on this visit I found a surprise: a 1976 hardback edition of Gissing's little known book, \\"Our Friend the Charlatan\\" complete with an introduction, notes and variant manuscript readings by the Gissing scholar, Pierre Coustillas and illustrations by Launcelot Speed from the original edition of the book published in 1901. I was elated; finding the book made my day.The edition I found does not seem to be available here on Amazon. Thus, I am doing the next best thing by reviewing the easily accessible kindle edition of \\"Our Friend the Charlatan\\". Gissing remains relatively unfamiliar to most readers, and this book is a rarity even to his admirers. The book was written late in the author's life. long after his novels set in the poor areas of London and his latter better-known books such as \\"New Grub Street\\"New Grub Street (Oxford World's Classics)and \\"The Odd Women\\"The Odd Women (Penguin Classics)On the whole, critics have not been kind to \\"Our Friend Charlatan\\". But I was glad to read the book.The novel differs from most of Gissing in that it is a sharp political satire and in its setting: it is almost a drawing room novel set largely in rural England and told, as is typical for Gissing, largely in dialogue. Unusually for Gissing, the book maintains a sense of distance and detachment from its characters. The reader does not become emotionally involved with most of them or with the story. Yet in its treatment of character and ideas and in its pessimism the book is worthy of its author.The main character of the book is a man in his late 20's, Dyce Lashmar. Dyce is described in the book, with great irony as \\"the coming man\\" which was Gissing's original title before the publisher demanded a change. Dyce is the \\"coming man\\" in his individualism, cynicism, lack of feeling, and continued pursuit of the main chance. Dyce is a vocal protagonist of the \\"new woman\\", a companion to the \\"coming man\\" and distinguished by her independence, intellect, and her freedom from false attempts at chivalry and her contempt for male chauvanism. Yet no one is more sexist, to use the modern term, than Dyce Lashmar. An in his relationship with women there is nothing of romance, love, or sexuality but only the quest for money and personal advantage. Although he is ever resourceful and opportunistic, this book sees Dyce's, \\"the coming man's\\", downfall.The child of a poor rural curate, Dyce is Oxford educated but his parents are worried that he has made nothing of himself. His father at last due to his own fiscal difficulties cuts off the young man's allowance, and Dyce must leave his position as tutor to the son of a young widow when the boy is sent away to school. The young widow has long been attracted to Dyce who has his eye on larger opportunities. Dyce inveigles the acquaintance of a dying, wealthy, and autocratic widow, Lady Ogram, who had in her youth been an artist's model and actress but who married well. Lady Ogram sees potential in Dyce and sponsors him in a bid for a seat in Parliament, running as a Liberal in opposition to the ensconsed conservative member with whom Lady Ogram has had a personal feud for many years. Lady Ogram is dictatorial and rigid in her old age and insists that Dyce marry her personal secretary, Constance Bride, a \\"new woman\\" whose affections Dyce had abused somewhat some years earlier. Dyce is reluctant to do so because he thinks Lady Ogram about to will her money to a long lost niece, May Tomalin, half-educated, addled, and ambitious. Dyce sets out secretly to woo May and to jettison Constance. As ambiguities in Lady Ogram's intent develop, Dyce shifts his attention from one woman to the other depending on where he thinks the money will land. At length, he is found out in a sharp, searing scene with both women and with Lady Ogram just before her death. Even after his exposure as a cad, Dyce proposes to Constance, who receives a substantial bequest, but is, finally, roundly rebuffed.The part of the book that deals with ideas centers around a French book called \\"The Modern City\\" by M. Jean Izoulet, a Professor of Sociology. Dyce Lashmar has read this book and claims its ideas as his own without acknowledging the book. As the novel unravels, Dyce is uncovered as a plagarist and a hypocrite,but Izoulet's book gets explored in its own right. The book, which fascinated Gissing, is an early version of \\"socio-biology\\". Izoulet took evolutionary theory and said it could be applied directly to human politics. The book advocates a form of socialism, of communalism, but with a twist. The more gifted, intelligent people are to be put on the top of society and the other people are to be happy with the places. In Dyce Lashmar's hand, Izoulet's theory becomes the basis for rampant egoism and self-pursuit. Gissing's point in the book is that socio-biology or scientific theory cannot be applied to the problems of human society. It is position still worth taking. Besides exploring Izoulet's book, the novel has critical things to say about Nietzsche -- Gissing thinks both Dyce Lasmar and Constance Bride are more like Nietzsche than they care to admit, and admiring things to say about Plato, Marcus Aurelius, and Thomas Huxley. The latter two figures are important to the only sympathetic character in the book, a poor English peer, Lord Dymchurch, who is rebuffed by May Tomalin and settles on the decaying family farm. In so doing, Dymchurch has an experience with a poor gardener which teaches him that human society operatates in a manner generally in opposition to the physical rules which govern nature.At the end of the story, Dyce, rebuffed by both May and Constances, loses his bid for parliament and is accepted by the young widow whose son he formerly tutored. Dyce believes the woman has an income of about 700 pounds a year but, alas, after the marriage, most of this money is lost to a corrupt trustee. Dyce and his wife and stepson are left to fend for themselves.As with all of Gissing, \\"Our Friend the Charlatan\\" is a novel of ideas with much of value. It is a book I might not have read if I hadn't found it fortuitously. It would not be my first suggestion for readers new to Gissing. \\"Our Friend the Charlatan\\", however, is worth reading. It deserves to be remembered.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The ABCs of Making Money","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and thus, I was excited to read it. What a waste of time!!

Evelyn Cameron and her husband, born into English society, established a ranch in eastern Montana early in the development of that part of the west. A need for additional income and a love of photography lead Evelyn to produce a large number of high quality photographs. Those photographs represent a historical archive of enormous value. The photos show the people of the time, how they made a living, and the tools that they used. My personal favorite is a photo Evelyn took of herself in her kitchen; she sent it to relatives in England to show them her life on the Montana frontier. It was a life of hardship, but also of achievement. The quality of Cameron's work is the equal of other great western photographers of the era, such as Jackson or Huffman, and it records a side of life not represented by anyone else. There is a balance in this book between text and reproduced photographs. It is a biography of Evelyn Cameron, including excerpts from her journals, as well as an exhibition of her photographs. A museum and gallery in Terry, Montana, is a repository of Evelyn Cameron's work and the total number of photographs is several times what this book is able to present. One hopes that other volumes of Cameron's photos will be published in the near future."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"Evelyn Cameron left her English home to become a rancher in Montana in the late 1800s: she used her photography skills to help support her family, and captured Montana life in the process. Photographing Montana gathers photos which portray early Montana life and deserves a spot in any Montana history collection as well as in art libraries seeking examples of regional photographic talent. Excerpts from her diaries and letters include plenty of autobiographical insights."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"Although she was born into British high society, Evelyn Cameron grew to love the desolation of Eastern Montana and photographed the beauty and emptyness of the landscape. Interesting reading about a tough, determined lady and her bookish husband, Ewen. Great photos of Eastern Montana and early homesteaders."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"This book, by Time-Life books editor Donna Lucey, has some very interesting photographs of Montana, taken about halfway between the Lewis and Clark expedition of two hundred years ago and today. Yes, the early 1900s were right in the middle of Evelyn Cameron's career.Cameron, nee Flower, was one tough and talented lady. She moved to Montana with her husband Ewen, going there initially in 1889, on a hunting trip for their honeymoon. I found the stories and pictures of life in Montana fascinating. Much of the book deals with the growth of Terry, a town in the eastern part of the state, on the Yellowstone river.At the time, the Kodak camera was the instrument of choice for most American photographers, however Cameron did much of her work with a 5x7 Graflex. There are dozens of her photos in this book.Although Cameron died in 1928, Lucey was lucky enough to obtain many of Cameron's photos from one of Cameron's friends, Janet Williams, who was 95 years old by the time Lucey met her in August of 1979.In 2002, PBS began shooting a documentary about Cameron, and it was released last year. It includes over 200 of Cameron's photos (over 100 of which are not in this book), and it won four regional Emmy awards.

I am dismayed that I have been unable to order this for friends!! Please republish."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"Evelyn Cameron (b. 1868, d. 1928) was a British woman from an aristocratic family who, with her Scottish husband, moved to eastern Montana and the Great Plains in 1889 and maintained a ranch there until her death in 1928. In 1979, author Donna M. Lucey discovered a treasure trove of glass plate negatives and photographic prints that Cameron had taken of her life in Montana, plus diaries and letters from her last 35 years. Those are the source materials for this book, handsomely produced by Alfred A. Knopf.In a sense, PHOTOGRAPHING MONTANA is two books: one the story of an unlikely (given her background) pioneer woman, who nonetheless was as tough and resolute as they come, and the other a special collection of photographs of life on the Great Plains, circa 1895 to 1925.I certainly don't mean to disparage Evelyn Cameron - she was tougher than any American woman from my own generation of my personal acquaintance - but her story, as presented here, is too lengthy, too detailed. While I stand rather in awe of her and so many other pioneer women, I really don't relish reading hundreds of pages about their rugged lives. I nonetheless had to do so in this book. Among other things, I learned about Evelyn skinning and butchering animals, mining coal from open seams and hauling it for miles and then across the Yellowstone River to be used at her ranch, setting the clock to the distant whistle of the train, treating her own abscessed tooth by wrapping wire around it and tying the wire to a rope thrown over a rafter in the barn and then lowering herself off a trunk thereby extracting it from her lower jaw, and inventing and introducing the divided skirt for the horse-women of Montana. But I also read about a lot of drudgery and rather mundane matters.It is the photographs that truly make the book. When Evelyn Cameron decided to acquire a camera and photograph the landscape, wildlife, and ranch life of eastern Montana, she decided against the recently marketed small Kodak camera. Instead, she employed first a No. 5 Kodet, a folding camera, and later a Graflex, the most advanced single-lens reflex camera of the day. She used predominately 5\\" x 7\\" glass plates, and she did her own developing and printing. Plus, she was both an artist and a craftsman. As a result, her photographs are of unusually high quality for photographs from that time. They comprise a valuable documentary record of the early years of settler life on the Great Plains."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"My family has a history of emigrating to the USA in early 1900's. Therefore the history of Montana from this period is particularly interesting to me - and even better, the photographic quality is second to none. Considering the pictures being over a 100 years old, this is truly a remarkable piece of history."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"I first became acquainted with the photography of Evelyn Cameron on a visit to the Montana Historical Society in Helena, MT. These were done in the 1890s and later and it was amazing how well they had survived and how brilliantly they had been restored. I really didn't know much about her life and was amazed at how the author of this book was able to obtain the photographs as well as diaries, cameras, and other items left behind in the basement of an elderly woman in Terry, Montana who knew and lived near Evelyn Cameron and her husband Ewen's ranch. It is quite a story of an English woman and her Scottish husband who come to Eastern Montana on their honeymoon mainly to hunt and enjoy the wide open spaces. That they stayed and learned to cope with all of the elements of frigid winters, an isolated environment, no amenities at all, and very few neighbors is an accomplishment of it's own! Evelyn seemed undaunted by all this and was even captivated by the buttes, wildlife, birds, and even the people who for the most part were largely uneducated and didn't have much in common with the couple. However, Evelyn became a good neighbor providing food, medical care, and help to those that were in need. It didn't seem to bother her to be so far away from England and all the trappings of society that she didn't have in the West. The author does a good job of taking from the diaries and providing what history was available of the couple and their families. The photographs have such great detail that one could almost feel like they were taken very recently--the facial features of the people were very distinct and she captured emotions from laughter to despair. The fact that she had the camera of the day that weighed about ten pounds is significant as one photo is of an eagle's nest which she had to do some climbing to reach. The landscapes are very picturesque and one wonders if this woman had made these photgraphs more available when she was alive if she could have published her own book or even gone into the tourism business. I think she would've been successful!"},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"I liked the photographs in this book but was disappointed by the authors commentary as I found it quite negative overall. I thought that the general picture painted of Montana and the life of Evelyn Cameron was deliberatly bleak. I stopped reading several chapters in and just enjoyed flicking through the photographs.An interesting collection of diary snippets and photos of early pioneer life."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"This book is required viewing and reading for anyone interested in western North American history, photography, early naturalist studies, and accounts of women's place in frontier life (and a pioneer activist!) Evelyn Cameron's story is as inspirational as they come, and Donna Lucey has captured her triumphs and pitfalls as if she were there to share them herself. In this day of digital photography, we should all revisit the hardships that made it all possible. I keep my copy of Photographing Montana handy, inspired and energized by Evelyn Cameron."},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"All Evelyn Cameron wanted was to be able to say she had lived a worthy life. By the end of her life, she thought she had not achieved that goal, but this book proves otherwise.I was fascinated by Evelyn's life, especially the hardships she endured, trying to make a living off the dry summer land and the bitter winter cold in eastern Montana, with a husband who barely lifted a finger to help her work the ranch.It was Evelyn, a woman brought up to live a leisure life in England, who milked cows, churned butter, did laundry by hand, plowed fields, tended a huge garden, dug coal, patched openings between slats in the house, painted walls, butchered livestock, broke horses, autopsied her own animals trying to discover what caused their deaths, and even stitched her own wound when she accidentally cut herself with an ax. She went on Fall hunting trips to provide meat to last through Montana's extreme winters. While her husband hunted, it was left to Evelyn to skin and dress the meat. She accompanied her husband while he researched Montana's birds, often waiting for hours for the perfect photographic shot from dangerously high rocky outgrowths.She rode horses for miles to sell her vegetables and to photograph other farmers, cowboys, and sheep herders far afield. Her neighbors counted on her when they wanted a photo to send to family, but Evelyn was also the person everyone called on when they were in need. She was a no-nonsense woman who learned to eke out a living in the worst of conditions. (After a month of such hard work, I would have been on the train back east.)Yet Evelyn not only worked like a horse all day, she found time to read and keep a detailed diary every day. She listed chores she had completed, how long it took to churn and how much butter resulted, every penny earned and spent, copied every letter she sent ---creating an invaluable record of her life. Some of her details were also invaluable to her ---figuring exactly how much coal was used one year so that she could estimate how much to dig for the next winter. When she became interested in photography, her detailed records of lighting conditions and exposure times helped improve her craft.Her photographs create a comprehensive record of her life and the times in which she lived. Considering she had to carry heavy camera equipment and fragile glass plates in unbearable heat (or cold) on horseback, deal with dust on the plates and guess at exposure times, her photos are remarkable.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in photography, women, or frontier life. (You could give this book to your teenager the next time s/he complains about doing a few chores around the house.)(I learned about Photographing Montana by reading Bad Land by Jonathan Raban. Raban found photographing Montana extremely difficult, thus he admired Cameron's photographs that much more for his own failures.)"},{"Title":"Photographing Montana 1894-1928: The Life and Work of Evelyn Cameron","review":"The main feature of this book is its 150 photographs taken by photographer Evelyn Cameron in eastern Montana during the years of its earliest settlement, first by ranchers in the late 19th century and then by streams of homesteaders in the early decades of the 20th century. In the latter regard, it is an excellent companion to Jonathan Raban's \\"Bad Land.\\" Most amazing is the vast range of photographs, including family portraits, group shots of cowboys, threshers, and sheep shearers, ranch buildings, open prairie, wild life, store fronts, wild horses, herds of sheep and cattle, badlands, social gatherings, and farm equipment.We get glimpses into the lives of the wealthy and the dirt poor. None of the photographs were shot in a studio, and taken together they represent a broad sweep of frontier life across a handful of decades. The text provides a detailed life of the photographer herself, a remarkably spirited and self-sufficient English woman who has left us this marvelous and revealing record of a time long passed."},{"Title":"French and German: Content Knowledge and Productive Language Skills (Praxis Study Guides)","review":"This is a great way to prepare yourself for the French and German exams that can determine your certification and future using these languages.

It puts it in a context that can be summarized as follows: About after the Muslims were expelled from Spain, the Muslims established themselves again in the Mediterranean shores of Northen Africa, had to learn quickly how to be become good seamen (something which they were not before) to survive further invasion and defend themselves, and also how they raised great leaders of the sea. The story is around these leaders: Uruj(Oruc) and Khizr-Khayreddin (Hizir Hayrettin) Barbarossa brothers; Dragut(Turgut) Reis; Occhiali (Uluch Ali Reis), in respective order, and the great battles of Prevesa, Malta and Lepanto. Coinciding with the peak times of the Ottoman Empire(i.e. Suleyman the Magnificient), they had a mutual relationship with the Sublime Porte, and they were appointed as Admiralissimos of the Ottoman Navy (\\"Kaptan-i Derya\\", literally \\"Captain of the Seas\\"). The interesting thing is, none of these four seamen were from North Africa. Barbarossa Brothers were born in a little island in the northern Aegean sea (to a Christian Greek mother and Muslim Ottoman/Albanian-Turkish father); Dragut was born in a little northwest Anatolian town on the Aegean seashore (Muslim Ottoman parents), and Uluch Ali was born in southern Italy (Catholic Italian, later converted to Muslim after he was captured as a child). Their rivals were famous seamen of their time: Andrea Doria of Genoa, Don Juan of Austria and Knights of St. John in Malta.The book has a major mistake I need to add: Sultan Mehmed I, the Conqueror (1451-1481) was not a 'Caliph'. Caliphate passed to Ottoman Sultans starting from Selim I, in 1517. However, maybe when the author wrote this book, that was a common misnomer title used for all of the Ottoman sultans, so we can forgive him for that."},{"Title":"Sea wolves of the Mediterranean (Nautilus library)","review":"When I purchased this novel from Amazon, I was expecting a history of German U-Boats in the Mediterranean. After reading the first few pages, I was initially disappointed but was soon drawn into the narrative. The original Sea-Wolves were masters of sail and oar in an era of land battles of spear and shield. Being little more than pirates, the sea-wolves by nature of their supremacy on the sea were able to create an empire. This book is a must for any historian. This albeit little known history would find a comfortable home in any library."},{"Title":"Sea wolves of the Mediterranean (Nautilus library)","review":"The Muslim religion was established in the 7th century AD by the sword in Arabia. It expanded with the sword across northern Africa until it got to the Straights of Gibraltar. Then the Muslims crossed over into Spain, in the 8th century and conquered most of Spain, including Portugal, which was a part of Spain at that time. The Muslims crossed into France, and were defeated by the Franks in 732 led by Charles, \\"The Hammer\\" Martel at a battle outside Tours. There were a couple more defeats in the 730s of the Muslims, and afterwards they stayed in Spain.The Muslims made their religion the religion of the state. Christians and Jews were allowed to live in the Muslim states as second class citizens, or dimmi, ruled by the Muslims. The Spanish and Portuguese fought the Muslim invaders for many years, pushing the Muslims back gradually over the centuries. Portugal succeeded in evicting the Muslims first, and became a separate country from Spain. King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella completed the re-conquest of Spain from the Muslims in 1492. This is the same year that they sponsored Columbus on his first voyage to what was the New World, America. The Spanish also evicted Muslims in 1492, making Spain a Christian country.Many of the Muslims who left Spain went to North Africa, to places like Tripoli, and Sallee, or Salli, now a part of Rabat, Morocco. They became pirates, preying on ships or shoreside communities and settlements of Christians. It was a conscience decision by the Muslims to become pirates and rob, murder and enslave Christians and Jews.This book tells the story of the Muslim pirates, also known as the Barbary Pirates, in the 16th century, essentially right after they were evicted from Spain. THe Muslim Corsairs sailed out of different ports, which were essentially separate city states. Each of the city states were nominally responsible to the Turks, but the arrangement was generally rather loose. Cdr. Hamilton does an excellent job writing the history of what he calls the Muslim Corsairs during this period. The European countries could have easily combined and put the Muslim Corsairs, AKA, the Barbary Pirates out of business. However, European countries were frequently fighting among themselves, and tended to only worry about their own country and generally bought off the different pirate cities for different periods, and at different costs.My only lament is that he does not provide the history of the Muslim conquest of Spain, and the re-conquest by the Christians. Without the context, the reader might believe that the Muslims had been in Spain before the Christians and Jews, which would be incorrect. He does an excellent job of covering the famous Muslim captains and admirals during this period, and their Christian foes. The Muslim Corsairs had some very fast ships, and some very capable pirate crews and admirals. The Muslim Corsairs or Barbary Pirates were a problem to western shipping and navies, for centuries. The Muslim Corsairs also raided seaside settlements and communities in Spain, Italy, France, as well as England and Ireland. President Jefferson sent the US Navy after them in the early 1800s, and was successful in suppressing them regarding raids on US ships. It was not until after the Napolanic Wars were over in 1815, that England and the Netherlands went and put an end to the piracy by essentially destroying Tripoli by a heavy navy bombardment.All in all, a very good read."},{"Title":"The Mighty Atom","review":"This book is a direct affront to the \\"High Decadence of the Yellow Nineties\\" and their moral deconstructions.

I saw the film first, but was not bored by the reading. I would love to be as great a writer as Mr. Arriaga. When I first saw the film I thought it was written by a born again Christian because it deals with the main issues of being born again: Sean Penn's character had to accept a new heart. When he did he was changed from a selfish person to one who could love. His wife had to accept freedom. She needed to be free from her negative relationship with him, but didn't want to let go. Benicio Del Toro's character had accepted Christ, but only in word. He went through the motions, but one could tell by his actions that it was not yet in his heart. He also had to accept the mercy and forgiveness of Christ. The other character had to accept her new life after her family was murdered. She could only move on after doing this. These are all things one must accept upon becoming born again: a new heart condtion, a new life, God's mercy & forgiveness, freedom & it must be in one's heart not in word only."},{"Title":"Gorse (Ulex europaeus L.)

Korstvedt not only clarifies the murky question of revisions, and helps us understand the creative process in this work and the structure and meaning - he also explodes what has become the conventional wisdom about editions. He makes a powerful case for the supposedly &quot;corrupt&quot; edition published in the composer's lifetime, showing how it profoundly changes our understanding of the meaning of the work, and discussing great early recordings based on this edition (and comparing them to some distinguished modern recordings). The chapter on performance traditions by itself is worth the price (only $10 used - what a deal!) A must-read, which I hope will be read not only by listeners but by Bruckner performers."},{"Title":"Bruckner: Symphony No. 8 (Cambridge Music Handbooks)","review":"The substantive content of this slender volume is in absolute contrast to the greatness of this monumental symphony, arguably the most imposing symphony of the second half of the 19th century.

Thus, despite its short length, the book overstays its welcome by failing to balance its technical minutiae with any larger musical issues such as where the symphony could proceed after Wagner or the sublime solution of Bruckner. All-in-all, it resembles an unfocussed and undigested doctoral thesis (which doubtless was its unfortunate genesis).

In the beginning of my reading this book I found myself grumbling that the map near the front of the book didn't list a lot of locations. (I have a hardback copy that was published in 1978).

The craftsmen involved in the details of the boat's construction are dying out and few are coming along in their stead.

To do this he had to research the probable type of boat that Brendan used, and try to extrapolate a likely route from the very obscure 'details' in Brendan's writings.Having established that the most likely vessel was a curragh, he had to gather the raw materials and a team of experts to construct it in the traditional manner. The tale of how he gets his experts is worth the price of the book in itself! The man must have the luck of the Irish to have everything fall so neatly into place (after a discouraging start).The unravelling of fact from fiction (or our interpretation of fact as fiction...?) took many long and painful hours of studying texts and maps. Given that latitude and longitude were strangers to Brendan, only the vaguest hints of distance and direction were available to Mr. Severin. However, a plausible map of Brendan's route was cobbled together, taking prevailing winds, tides and leeway into consideration.Armed with this, and a more than serviceable boat, the bold explorers ventured forth.I won't spoil anyone's enjoyment of the book by going into more detail. Suffice to say that almost everything that Brendan described is accounted for by natural phenomena - giving the lie to those academics who dismissed the voyage as a figment of a monk's fevered imagination.A very enjoyable read, with Mr Severin's usual hearty enthusiasm pulling you along with him. *****"},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"Not too much to add to the many positive reviews.

The natural materials and traditional techniques that Brendan used are authentically utilized to make the Brendan voyage a successful historical re-creation and a thrilling sea adventure.Tim Severin is a born storyteller. As far as a historical re-creation event, this voyage has some parallels to the Kon-Tiki expedition. The reason for making the Brendan voyage was to answer the question: Did Irish monks sail across the Atlantic centuries before the Vikings?This book relates an amazing seafaring adventure. There is one scene where the sea is calm when a pod of orcas spot the Brendan (boat's name). The orca alpha bull comes full tilt at the boat, dorsal fin eight feet above the water line. The crew holds their breath as the bull whale swims under the boat, checking out this strange thing. After an eternal minute of silence, they watch the bull surface and swim back to the pod. High drama indeed.Tim Severin and his crew are the very definition of intrepid. Severin's level of enthusiasm is amazing; it is never diminished by the cold, wet, and treacherous sailing conditions. His composure as the captain of this little boat is compelling and inspirational.I would also suggest getting a copy of the hardbound edition, which unfortunately is out of print. The photos of this voyage tell every bit as much of this story as does the text.Highly recommended.Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts"},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"The Brendan Voyage is the true-life story of what has been called the greatest epic voyage in modern Irish history.

Actually, The Brendan Voyage is all that and more! Tim Severin weaves together several gripping narratives, each as fascinating as the others. It is first and foremost an epic adventure story - the tale of an heroic band of intrepid men who brave every kind of danger to sail across the Atlantic in a tiny, handmade leather boat. It is secondly a research puzzle as Severin and his team attempt to recreate, down to the tiniest detail, sixth century technology, using only authenticated skills, techniques and materials. It is also an inspirational travelogue that overlays the seemingly fantastical accounts of St Brendan and his companions onto the actual experiences of Severin's crew to \\"prove\\" that the original journey not only happened, but did so in the way the medieval text describes. As a bonus, The Brendan Voyage is finally an uplifting tale of our common humanity, showing how ordinary people of diverse backgrounds and languages emerged at critical and unexpected moments to provide vital assistance without which the journey would never have succeeded.This is an all-encompassing book that educates, inspires and amazes.

While Severin's success does not prove the legend, the modern story alone is worth the price of admission, and his discussion of boat-building techniques &amp; the trials and pitfalls that his team overcame make for a great book."},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"Did Irish monks cross the Atlantic and reach North America long before the Vikings and Columbus? After reading this book you will cetainly believe that it is plausible. According to the Navigatio Sancti Brendani Abbatis (The Voyage of Saint Brendan the Abbot), an ancient Latin manuscript, indeed the Irish set foot on the Promise Land long before Columbus. To prove this point Severin takes us on a voyage. But not just your weekend trip to the state park. With meticulous detail, Severin- and many others- reconstruct the same sailing craft described in the ancient text, a leather boat, and sail it to Newfoundland. The Brendan Voyage describes how this idea came to be, how the boat was ultimately constructed, and the ordeals the team faced sailing across the Atlantic ocean. Imagine yourself and three others hunkered down in a leather sail boat in between Iceland and Greenland. You have a 1/4&quot; of protection between you and the frigid water beneath. Eight foot waves and 50 mph winds are crashing around you. Your tired, cold, wet, hungry, and you desperately want to make some forward progress, but instead your losing ground. I can't do Severin's writing justice but he made me feel like I was there. I'll stop my babbling now. In a nut shell, if your looking for a great adventure story that is calculated and honest, then give this book a whirl. I am a fan of Severin's writing and adventures now and will certainly purschase his further works. Nice job Mr. Severin. By the way, where is Brendan now? Is she on display anywhere?"},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"High adventure with historical relevance.Tim Sevrin, adventurer extraordinare, leads the reader on a dual voyage across the north Atlantic as well as through time to the medieval days of St. Brendan. Could the Irish have been to North America before the Vikings? The author sets out to prove that yes, it was possible. Using the collected works of the Navigato Sancti Brendani Abbatis, Tim sets out to reconstruct the currach (leather covered boat) used by St. Brendan on his epic voyage. The narrative of this book flows nicely, and is skillfully interwoven with informative historical documentation. THE BRENDAN VOYAGE is easy to start reading and not lay down until you have savored the... very... last... sentence.I've read this book many times over the years and it's definitely a keeper!!!"},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I've been fascinated for years by the legendary stories of the voyage of Saint Brendan - and Severin's brave re-construction of that journey is legendary in and of itself.It's a thrilling ride - the building of the ship itself was nothing less than a miracle - and the journey - well, you'll just have to read it for yourself. A truly gripping story."},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"A must read for any of Keltic blood, great detail about the materials and construction practices of the recreation of St.Brenden's ocean going leather boat.The courage and terror of sailing a square rigger open boat from Ireland to the New World, is thinly vailed, by the authors enthusiasm for his quest.Caught in the ice flows off New Foundland,in 0 degree water,one man hangs over the side with a stitch awl and thread,repairing the hull while the others man the pumps and tiller.This is a book to read curled up by a fire,you will praise God for home and harth."},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"Tim Severin has organised several voyages in part to prove that ancient peoples could travel far greater distances than previously thought. In this story he builds a traditional leather boat or 'curragh' to show that monks could have sailed from Ireland to Newfoundland around the seventh century. There is an ancient book called the 'Navagatio' (one old copy is in the British Library) which St Brendan wrote about his voyages around the Atlantic Ocean. It is thought from Brendan's descriptions that he island-hopped via the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland to get to America, and Severin follows this route in a dangerous and interesting adventure taking many weeks. There is much detail on how he built the boat using only traditional methods and materials which was no mean feat in itself despite their still being used in the south-west of Ireland for fishing. The book contains colour photos of the boat's construction and of the diverse and colourful crew who sailed her. The book reminded me of the 'Kon-Tiki' book by Thor Hayerdahl. Also, the pictures are brilliant - and Tim's descriptions of the ports of call such as Iceland and the Faroes are very vivid and realistic. It's a well-written, interesting book and well worth a read."},{"Title":"Brendan Voyage (Mainstream Series)","review":"Tim Severin borrowed an account of the voyages of Brendan the Navigator, an Irish Monk from the dark ages. He was taken by the factual nature of some of the sailing directions and descriptions, and got the mad idea into his head that a group of monks sailed across the Atlantic to America hundreds of years before Columbus was born.Then he got an even madder idea, to replicate the voyage.The book intersperses an analysis of the original voyage with the trials and tribulations of recreating it. Along the way we learn a great deal of respect for the quality of the technology in the dark age period. Their skills with wood and leather. Their ability to preserve food, and the skills of sailing.The voyage itself becomes compulsive reading. And how anyone allowed a Faroese Islander to fish for Whales out of a leather boat is beyond me! Sounds incredible? It is. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Mysticism and logic, and other essays (Pelican books)","review":"While the essays on physics are rather outdated, Russell's sarcastic comments on the philosophy of Bergson, education, ethics or vegetarianism are still well worth reading.BergsonBergson's crucial idea of \`dur&eacute;e' is an error: \`Since the past has effects now, it must still exist in some sense. The mistake in this maxim consists in the supposition that causes \`operate'. The belief that causes \`operate', results from assimilating them to volitions.'EthicsFor B. Russell, \`ethics is essentially a product of the gregarious instinct, that is to say, of the instinct to co-operate with those who are to form our own group against those who belong to other groups. Those who belong to our own group are good; those who belong to hostile groups are wicked,'Education\`The endeavor to teach virtue has led to the production of stunted and contorted hypocrites instead of full-grown human beings\\"Vegetarians\`Even vegetarians do not hesitate to save the life of a man in a fever, although in doing so they destroy the lives of many millions of microbes.'Philosophy and man's place in the universe\`No heroism, no intensity of thought and feeling can preserve an individual life beyond the grave; all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction in the vast death of the solar system.

He was inspired by American crime writers and wrote his first book \\"No Orchids for Miss Blandish\\" which was published in 1939 and still claimed to be one of the best selling mysteries ever published. He published some 80 books and a number of his books were attacked for their violence.\\"You're Lonely When You're Dead\\" builds a mystery of a series of murder which is finally broken down by an intelligent detective. The story is woven around a millionaire's wife who is suspected of kleptomania. It begins one sunny morning around 11'o clock in mid-March. Mr. Vic Malloy, head of Universal Services, goes to meet a millionaire, Mr. Jay Franklin Cerf, who hires him to watch his wife, Anita Cerf, whom he suspects of kleptomania. Malloy appoints one of his operator, Dana Lewis, for the job but she was found dead after a few days of work. The millionaire's wife also vanishes. As Universal services guaranteed secrecy, Malloy had to beat the cops to the murderer.The novel introduces us to a number of characters. Natalia Cerf, Cerf's daughter, who is in a wheel chair after meeting with an accident, Ceaser Mills, the millionaire's guard, who was a boxer and then disappeared suddenly, Brandon who is captain and Mufflin who is a cop. The Malloy's operators are Dana Lewis, Jack Kerman, Paula Bensinger and Ed Benny. The author introduces one more gorgeous lady, Miss Gail Bolus, who was the only person helping and swore she was just going along for the ride.At the centre of the Chase's novel is Anita Cerf who disappears after the Dana's murder. When Cerf threatens to sue Malloy if he goes to the police, Malloy decided to play a lone hand find the killer. He was caught up in a series of ruthless murders and macabre situations that succeed each other with the punch and at the speed of a rivet gun. All the leads he got were found dead before he reached there.Chase has a unique style on which his explanation of the situations and plot development makes the reader create original thought feel himself in that situation. Due to in depth description, an inexperienced reader may find himself too lost in his description and loose the storyline in the process. The narrator always distances himself from any and all characters, yet reveals the thoughts, feelings and emotions of each of them through the course of the novel.Chase's masterpiece has such lucid characters and precise attention to emotional details to construct a clever plot that is both witty and thought provoking. In addition to its specifically literary virtues, it is a wonderfully edgy thriller."},{"Title":"Spanish On The Move For Kids (1CD + Guide)","review":"Well produced and catchy songs.

While neither of them wants a lifetime commitment, they can't help but be totally attracted to each other.

The maps are nearly useless: most of them are from Ruby & Sapphire, and the items and trainers on them are not marked. The author/editors decided it was for some reason a good idea to sort everything by location, leaving the player to flip backwards to see what to do next, a completely ridiculous notion for a WALKTHROUGH.But perhaps most importantly, the games' various puzzles are completely unexplained. The phrase \\"After you have solved [the puzzle]\\" appears more than once in this guide, when it shouldn't appear at all. For example, players new to Emerald without having played Ruby or Sapphire will have to figure out BY THEMSELVES how to: 1) navigate a sea route that consists of a maze of fast currents because there is no marked map, 2) decipher braille to learn that you not only need a pokemon with Dig, but two Pokemon in your party in a certain order, because the author was too lazy to just include what the braille says in the guide. Amazingly, the guide tells you how to decipher braille, instead of doing what a guide is supposed to do and doing the work for you to save the player time. Have fun spending an hour deciphering the code.It's clear the author was just incredibly lazy when writing this guide.

I can tell because I compared them with my Ruby/Sapphire guide, and they are exactly the same on most routes. Most routes in emerald, though, have some stuff changed, mainly small graphical details, but in many routes there are lots of new trainers, which the map doesn't even show!!!The guide is also laid out very poorly, as whenever you need to revisit an area, it's not in the next page of the guide, but rather you have to flip back to the section where you first visited the area and look around for the section that talks about what you need to do.

The author, now deceased, had a degree in theology, a doctorate in psychology and taught at Union College, Schenectady, N. Y.The book began as a doctoral thesis. Subsequently, he was encouraged to expand upon its theme and it's expansion, he once told me, extended over a fourteen year period. Basically, it is a psychological, not a theological, interpretation of those teachings commonly known as the Beatitudes.It is Dr. Ligon's thesis that, if one truly lives a life psychologically grounded on these teachings, that person will enjoy good mentalhealth regardless of his or her external circumstances. He very accurately defines, or so it seems to me, the true, psychologicalmeaning of meekness, of mourning, of being merciful and pure in heart. As he states, &quot;Happy (instead of Blessed) are the peacemakers...&quot;; happy are those that are persecuted.... Strange happiness indeed, but his interpretation is very convincing.Some will find the book not to their liking because Dr. Ligon does not spare those who promote psychologically false doctrines even those that are of a seemingly religious nature. As far as I am concerned this is a masterpiece and will, as long as I am among the quick and not the dead, be in my library. You too should be so fortunate."},{"Title":"THE PROPERTY OF THE ROBERT R.

Mrs. Young's furnishings matched the magnificence of the architecture of her homes, however, as pictured and described here."},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"This is a classic story about the horrors of slavery. I've heard this compared to &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; but I don't think that's an accurate comparison. The story is about Orookono, an African prince who is deprived of his true love by his grandfather, the king. He is betrayed and sold into slavery, and happens to encounter his lost love in the New World, in the British colony of Suriname. The valiant prince (now called 'Caesar' by his overseers) tries to gain freedom for his wife and family, but in vain. If there is a story that does justice to the horrors of slavery, this is it.I don't think this is the typical slave narrative because Orookono is a prince. Even the overlords treat him that way, and he seems more a victim of cruel fate than of slavery. Still, this valiant, brave-hearted soul is subjected and finally overcome by the cruel actions of the English colonists.This story was written at the time the novel was first coming into being in England. It is revolutionary, and becomes even more so when considered that it came from the pen of a woman. Aphra Behn was one of the first major female English writers, and is arguably the best of her time. This is is great (short) novel, definitely well-worth your time."},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"This book was required reading for my American Literature course. Why read a story about an African prince in Surinam in an American Lit class? Voyage to a brave new world! That was the theme of the class. It encompassed the whole colonial experience in all of the &quot;Americas&quot;. I am glad my professor went that route or I probably would never have read OROONOKO. This is a wonderful read. It is more a love story to me than a slave story. This book was written centuries ago but it is a very easy read. The footnotes in this version are a great help but the context of the story is enough for most readers to not get lost in archaic language. Add this one to your library. It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"Young Oroonoko, a Prince of Surinam, falls in love with a beautiful young maid named Imoinda. but unbeknownst to Oroonoko, his grandfather the King also has designs on the young maid. While the Prince is away, the King sends his vail to Imoinda, a sign that he wants to bed her. She reluctantly goes and staves off all his advances, professing her love for Oroonoko.Upon his return, Oroonoko learns what happened to his love and finds her at the King's seraglio. they share a night together, but when the King finds out, he sells Imoinda as a slave, telling Oronooko that she died.Despondent, Oroonoko is tricked by a British captain and becomes a slave. Taken to a new land, he accidently discovers his true love Imoinda and determines to escape the bonds of slavery no matter what it takes.This story deals with true love and is probably one of the first novels to deal with the issue of slavery -- even though it wasn't a hotbed issue during the 1680's. The characters are very well-defined, either incredibly good or monstrous, even though they sometimes act more over-the-top or overly dramatic than normal. Oroonoko himself is even based upon a real prince that Behn had met from Surinam. It does take a bit to get used to the lingo and word usage of the 17th century, but I found myself seriously enjoying the story."},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"This book is two great stories in one. It'd make a great movie.Oroonoko is an African prince, in love with the beautiful Imoinda. When his elderly, impotent and slovenly uncle the king takes her into his harem, we get a nice Romeo and Juliet scenario that ends with Oroonoko thinking his lover is dead.Later, the mighty prince is tricked by a sea captain and taken into bondage. He is sold into slavery in South America, where even his owners recognize his majesty. There he discovers his lost love, and something about the nature of bondage.An compelling look at the nature of bondage, slavery, the human condition, European customs, love and passion, and honor. Especially intriguin because it was written in the 17th century, when slavery wasn't even a disputed practice.The author is of note as well; Aphra Behn was the first woman to make a living as a writer. And she knows that her perspective is unique, and uses it to add to the story. How does the narrator really feel about this handsome African prince?Pick it up. It's worthwhile."},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"I bought this book for a class and was dreading the read. In the end, I was surprised to find that I like it.

Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"While I enjoyed the story, I must admit that I enjoyed reading the introduction and footnotes even more. They were very interesting and enlightening, and the introduction creates an awe inspiring portrait of Aphra Behn, and what a diamond in the rough she was during the Restoration period of English history."},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"As the first novel written in the English language, Oroonoko holds a special place in our heritage of literature. That it was written by a woman is an even greater accomplishment. The story follows the stream of consciousness of its author, and often skips around in time. There was no editor for this hand written novel, and to a modern audience that can be confusing. Oroonoko is not a tidy book, but it is an amazing book.Oroonoko is a true romance. The slave-prince, Oroonoko, is a hero, and his main quest is to find the love of his life, Imoinda. After many adventures on his own continent, Oroonoko is swept away to the Caribbean where he is miraculously reunited with Imoinda. From there he continues his nearly unstoppable heroism: he fights immortal tigers, leads an army of slaves against the slavery he sent them into, and faces everything that comes his way with unwavering bravery. The romantic notions of the young narrator further elevate Oroonoko into the status of a man above men; a form of renaissance superhero.While many claim that the book is distinctly anti-slavery, the true feelings of the narrator and the times are difficult to unravel. They are certainly against the enslavement of this \\"young Mars\\" and his \\"beautiful black Venus\\" (Behn) but as for the rest of the slaves... Well, you be the judge."},{"Title":"Oroonoko or the Royal Slave","review":"The book arrived on-time and in really good condition.

One must also obtain &quot;street smarts.&quot; Oronooko relied on tutors ending in slavery and death. Frederick Douglass, on the other hand, was a slave with a commitment to learn to free himself.

This made the story of Eve come alive and you could feel as well as see where the characters in the story would take you in each chapter.Evelyn Panelli witnessed the death of her parents at an early age, injured in the shoot-out even though her mother tried to shield her with her own body, but not from the pair of blue eyes of the murderer that was burned into her memory.Growing up, Eve l earned the trade of the street, how to hustle, steal, almost whatever it took to live among her peers and be accepted and respected in her neighborhood and the gang she was in, the infamous Twenty Gang. Eve was very street smart and had a good head on her shoulders, but the streets were what she craved and her secret love she found in Felon. Eve's feelings did not change after spending two years in jail because of Felon.After being released from jail, Eve returned home to her Uncle Bobby's house but life for her would never return to normal as she knew it. Instead of finding a job and turning her life around, Eve found herself in an all out penchant bent on revenge after her best friend, Cassidy, was killed by the same crime family responsible for taking her parents away from her as a little girl.You will fall in love with Eve as she comes to terms with her feelings for Felon, and he for her, but with street life there is always a price to pay... death.Review by Sharel E.

Since the loss of her parents at an early age, the only family Eve has is her crew the infamous Twenty gang. With two years of prison already under her belt, Eve is now eighteen and back on the streets of Harlem getting money the best way she knows how :strong-arm robbery. In the midst of all of this, she has some strong feelings for her longtime friend and hustler Felon that she doesn't know how to express. But things are not the same on the Harlem streets since Eve has been away. The number one drug supplier the dominant DeNardi family is trying to solidify its presence on these streets through Felon, his right hand man Butter and their crew. Felon and Butter are on top of the world and plan to stay there. But Butter's resentment toward the DeNardi family and his cowboy antics may lead them down a deadly and dangerous road. Things get ugly when Eve's best friend and crime partner Cassidy is killed in the crossfire of this drug war. Eve vows to get revenge and won't let anybody step in her way. She has to not only avenge the death of her best friend, but also the death of her own parents. When the smoke clears, will Eve succeed or will this be a deadly mistake?Eve is an incredible novel by K'wan. K'wan once again brought a fast-paced storyline that showed the gritty violence of the hustling game. This author showed great creativity in developing the main character Eve and her crew Twenty gang. K'wan showed that even while doing dirt in the streets, Eve was still a woman that can have a softer side. What I liked most about this novel is that Eve was not the average sleep with men for money type female hustler. She was getting her money in the most dangerous way possible with strong-arm robbery. By tapping into the female psyche, K'wan made Eve a believable character which is a true testament to this author's talent. Eve is a riveting, chilling, page-turner that grabs you and won't let go. K'wan once again brought a widely entertaining novel that will satisfy his fans and will gain new ones. With Eve, K'wan proves why he is one of the best urban fiction authors of today and in the years to come."},{"Title":"Eve: A Novel","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Kwan. This turned out to be a awesome book and I would definitely read another one by him, especially if it's anything like this one. Kudos Kudos Kudos !"},{"Title":"Eve: A Novel","review":"K'wan brings us the story of Evelyn Panelli. Eve is a young girl who has seen a lot in her short life. Her parents were brutally murdered, and the only family she has left is a wheel-chair bound uncle. Because of this, Eve's friends have become her surrogate family. Loyalty to her \\"family\\" has landed Eve in a bad situation as the book begins. Although, she didn't want any cookies, she takes the rap for having had her hand in the cookie jar.As the story progresses, we meet the characters that Eve holds dear, Cassidy, Butter, Bullet, and Beast. And we meet the character who holds Eve's heart, Felon.I don't get some of the reviews for this book. The story was bananas! The characters were well-developed, and three dimensional. I grew up in the city, so I know somebody like EVERY one of these characters (except for Beast). The story line was straight flawless, and the subplots were ingenious the way they connected the characters.I LOVED this book. Eve was realistic, relatable and likeable in this story.

Before her eighteenth birthday she had been incarcerated for almost two years. Eve took a rap for two of her homeboys, Felon and his partner Butter. It was a tough choice, but they were family and with 'family', it goes with the territory. Now back on the streets, she is ready to start slanging and banging with her crew.Things changed the two years Eve was gone, Felon and Butter are on the come-up in Harlem's drug traffic. Butter is with Eve's girl, Cassidy and Eve is feeling Felon. Although Felon can always roll with any homie, Eve unknowingly has his heart. But both are to hard to trust the relationship game.Life was chillin, and then out of nowhere their idyllic world begins to crack. The one person Eve loved unconditionally is killed and a crooked-cop, who worked for the mob, is murdered. Harlem becomes a battleground. Felon needs to clean things up before Eve, trying to avenge her friend's death and even a score from her past, goes after some heavy hitters in the mob.EVE is raw, gripping, gritty, and authentic. K'WAN has captured scenes from street life that adds empathy to the perception of urban youth. Their code of honor will surprise and confound readers. I was impressed with how K'WAN was able to write this story from a bangers view and still maintain an almost eloquent style that juxtaposed readers into the lives of a man and a woman engulfed in a world that forces them to 'come with it'. The climatic ending is straight, no chaser.Reviewed by aNNof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Eve: A Novel","review":"K'wan will never let his reading audience down, once again K'wan takes you on a tour of Harlem, New York with the five star page turner that you can NOT! put down.

It was a days worth of reading but it wasn't something that I would have a discussion about. REAL TALK."},{"Title":"Eve: A Novel","review":"K'wan is one of the best urban writers; one of the few whom I believe could step outside of the genre. He paints a believable picture of hood life, leaving the tired ghetto fabulousness to the many writers who lack creativity, and therefore use this same aspect repeatedly. K'wan has the skills and talent to tackle multiple points of view and perspectives. His characters are multi-faceted opposed to the once again tired ass hustler with limited thoughts, feelings and actions.Despite all of that, he didn't impress with \\"Eve\\".Like I said, K'wan tries to step outside the usual as far as street lit is concerned, but I noticed that his females are always light-skinned with long hair and hour glass shapes. I mention this because Eve is the single novel in which he focuses on the female as the main character - he even dedicates the book to the sisters. But this archetypal of the hood girl with video vixen looks and a biracial background is constant in K'wan's books, and that is contradicting when everything else he does is not repetitive. This is obviously the kind of woman he feels is the epitome of beautiful, but do we really need to read this description in every single book he writes? In Street Dreams, one of his best books in my opinion, the smutty girl with nappy hair is sheisty as hell while the red-bones are good as gold, but honestly I was glad the nappy headed biotch got her just deserts. Also, Street Dreams typically cute main female is sweet to death but meets a horrible fate. I just wondered why, out of all the other no-good female characters he writes about, K'wan had to do this one dirty. In Hoodlum the female character was nothing but a brain-dead tramp, but because she was the typical beauty her faults, though acknowledged, were not focused upon or really even deemed as bad. The main character, who was actually somewhat intelligent and should have wanted more in a woman, chased after this girl as if she had actually impressed him with something other than her \\"my lip gloss is poppin'\\" attitude and stripper body. It disappointed me to read about a decent young man who did not pursue a decent young woman. In Hoodrat, the two once again typically pretty girls have happy-enough endings while the less attractive ones do not (though I know one of them rightfully deserved what she got).Again in \\"Eve\\", the girl who is not black as it is defined - as if a fully black female character is a horrendous thought for K'wan - has as close to a happy ending as is allowed in the game. (I must be fair though and mention that in this book, another of these typical, low-down but cute females met her demise, which was rare to read in a K'wan book). Eve's character was not quite right, I must say. She was meant to be hardcore (nearly dyke-y), but she was a virgin with an emotional side. The fact that she was only turning 18 in the middle of the book made me shake my head. So I was supposed to believe she was this hardcore when she was 12 years old? What is the rush to play commando? Actually, Eve's need to be in the streets robbing people as a little girl never made sense to me. Her parents were murdered but she had an uncle to take care of her, so she was another character who simply chose the streets. As a matter of fact at the beginning of the story she is just finishing up a bid in a correction facility for something she didn't do.To finally cut to the chase, this story was scattered and it dragged on and on when nothing interesting was really even happening - and that's not like K'wan. Surely he does not rush his stories, but a faster pace would have done this one good. The climax, however, seemed a little TOO rushed, so he actually rushed in places he shouldn't have. Also, the climax of the story was dull in my opinion. Eve seemed incomplete in development, as if she were three different thrown-together people throughout the short time-span of the book. Her sides didn't seem to connect to me. I took me longer to read this book than any other K'wan book. Read \\"Eve\\" because the \\"star\\" is female, though an oddly put together female, is all I can say in the end."},{"Title":"Eve: A Novel","review":"After reading Hoodrat, Kwan could do no wrong or so I thought!

The man forms a kind of grandfatherly relationship to the little girl who lost her family. The locals believe that this girl has supernatural powers. Underlying all this is the struggle of Indian tribes in the early 1900's to keep their land.The story is told in a Falknerian way.

The time period is between 1912 to 1924. The author has picked an amazing setting for the book, with an equally amazing plot. The Native American culture is threatened as a result of the Industrial Revolution. Ancient rituals that consisted of a sacrifice now consist of drinking and gambling. New religions are introduced onto the reservation, and many Natives lose their faith that the chieftains have tried so hard to preserve.What I loved about this book is that the main character always changes. I found it very confusing to decipher whom was talking, but I liked re-reading what I didn&#8217;t understand. Although there were many main characters the most important one was an old man named Manitou-geezis. The story is told from every character view, but it only makes since when it is explained by Manitou-geezis, then it is fun to look back and with knowledge of what has happened see it from the view of every character. The main dilemma of the book is that a young man named Eli falls in love with a wild woman named Fleur. Since Manitou-geezis comforted and befriend Fleur when her family died as a result of the measles, Eli goes to him for advice on how to &#8220;tame&#8221; her and get her to love him. Manitou-geezis feels that Eli is the right person for Fleur even though he&#8217;s very foolish so he tells Eli about his experiences with his wives. Eli sets out to find Fleur and Fleur excepts him so they fall deeply in love. Yet when Fleur produces a baby as a result of their relation ship, Eli heads for home. Eli then has an affair with a young girl named Sophia. Eli decides that he was better off with Fleur so he returns to her but Fleur rejects him. Eli then goes to Manitou-geezis for help. Manitou-geezis and Eli are trapped in Manitou-geezis cabin due to a snowstorm and Eli eats all of the food. The storm clears up but it is to cold to go outside, but Manitou-geezis kicks Eli out. The story ends tragically when Eli wanders through the woods in look of Fleur he dies of hypothermia, and Manitou-geezis goes to look for him but ends up dying to. Fleur is rejected by civilization because people think she cursed Eli and Manitou-geezis. She goes into the woods to live wild again with her newborn son.

Her writing was of course, wonderful but I didn't find the story to be as original or captivating.

The novel was a little confusing, being that it switched from narrator-to-narrator, and as well, there seemed to be very little driving the story. I was dissapointed by the lack of rhyme or reason behind the story, and found it, in general, bland."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"After reading several different Native American authors, I finally had the privilege of reading Louise Erdrich. TRACKS captured my imagination as I listened to Nanapush and Pauline tell their stories. Erdrich brilliantly has the two narrators cast doubt upon each other's tales- a tactic which makes the book all the more enthralling to read. Pauline's zealous quest for sainthood, filled with sacrifices that border on ridiculousness, contrasts with Fleur's relationship to nature, embodied in the forest and the lake creature, Misshepeshu. Erdrich's characters endear themselves to the readers with their first-person revelations, their bawdy senses of humor, and their uncanny strength. The sexual banter between Margaret and Nanapush brings the characters to thriving, realistic life. TRACKS presents these characters against the backdrop of a dwindling forest, which government agents consume piece by piece, selling to American logging companies. As Fleur and Nanapush's homeland disappears, their struggle to control their own future becomes present and touching. Each of the characters reaches out in a different way to attempt to determine their future in some way. TRACKS deserves several reads, and Louise Erdrichs deserves high praise for an incredible and entertaining work."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"\\"Tracks\\" of Fleur and through her the end of a way of life for a Native American tribe in the early 20th century. Her story and the tribes story is told through the eyes of two people, Nanapush an elder who is sympathetic to Fleur and the Native American lifestyle and through Pauline a woman twisted with a sort of love/hate obsession with Fleur and a repulsion of her own heritage.Nanapush tells the story to his \`granddaughter' Lilly, Fleur's child. He does this to explain her incomprehensible mother who seems to have abandoned her for no reason as well as a way to explain the politics of the tribe. He wants to save Lily from what he sees as an unsuitable marriage and reunite her with her mother and fully with her Native American heritage.Pauline, narrates to who knows what or who or for what purpose. Her madness is captivating and is a manifestation of the sickness, literally and figuratively, that the alien (white) culture brings to the Native American people.At the same time this is a story about women. Fleur, is an incomprehensible woman who breaks the rules of what it is to be an Indian woman and is feared and respected as a consequence of her actions. Her beauty and fierceness make her a force of nature. Pauline is a woman who is treated without worth as a woman. It is this, and her soul sickening envy, I believe, that drives her madness. Margaret, Lily's grandmother represents the traditional strong Native American woman I believe, and while her methods for survival are of the Mac tuck variety she ends up surviving and living the best of all three of the woman.The book covers 12 years and is a lyrical look at a culture's struggle to survive."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"In keeping with the development of Erdrich's rich, fictional Native American saga, &quot;Tracks&quot; takes her characters one step closer to reality. Contrary to initial impression, the novel does not limit itself by cultural lines. Erdrich's work provides an insightful and engrossing tale, which highlights the struggles of a frayed culture. However, spoilers abound and surprises go unappreciated for those who haven't read her previous works first. Erdrich makes brilliant use of alternating narrators. One speaker is a highly spiritual grandfather named Nanapush, and the other a crazed and confused Indian woman called Pauline, retelling the life of protagonist Fleur. Both offer differing slants when shedding light on Fleur's troubles, including passage through a suicidal youth and falling in love with shy Indian boy Eli. Rich imagery, and the short-and-sweet figurative way of Native American storytelling may be a bit much for some. However, the manner of speech fits the novel beautifully for those so inclined to a book of this type. Interesting, not mind-blowing, it is an honest and sufficient work in the representation and preservation of a culture."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I read this book in a Native American Literature course about 12 years ago. My father is full blooded Native American and my teacher was white and I thought he couldn't teach me anything. I had a chip on my shoulder and my teacher knocked it off of me with this book. He told me he wanted ME to teach this book to the class so I had to read this book like I had never read any book before. Perhaps my unique connection to the book made me enjoy the book more than these other reviewers, but I think that it would still be one of my favorite books even if had not read it for class. I teach high school English and have read A LOT of books - all kinds of books, not just classics. Even if you read this and find that you can't fully understand it, that's OKAY. Part of the problem with my students is they are always looking for the AUTHOR\\"S interpretation or the TEACHER'S interpretation - just enjoy your own interpretation. The book is not that hard to understand, but the imagery and symbolism is deep. This is an important book, as pretty soon there will be no Native Americans left to tell our stories. Less than 1% of this nation is Native American and it's important to read these stories. The mixing of Christianity with Native traditions is particularly significant in this story. In fact, I based my Master's thesis on the themes in this work. I met Louise Erdrich a couple of years ago at a book signing and I wanted to tell her this book changed my life, but how cheesy would that be?"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"In all of her work, Louise Erdrich writes with rich visual language, and always from the heart. Until I read Tracks, I held up Love Medicine as Erdrich's best, and one of my all-time favorite novels. Tracks surpasses Love Medicine in scope, personality, and drama. The early lives of Erdrich's legends - Fleur and Moses Pillager, Eli and Nector, Lulu Nanapush,the Morrisseys, and even Sister Leopolda unfold in the despair and heartache of the early part of this century, when the Chippewas were just begining to lose their land and their lives to alcohol, disease, and other pressures from the ever-encroaching whites. What I love about both Love Medicine and Tracks, more than, say, The Beet Queen is the amazing number of characters Erdrich can master, and the way she interweaves their lives. Tracks does Love Medicine one better by making the circle of voices a bit smaller, and the stories more intensely personal. This book made me cry at work and laugh out loud on the subway. If you love the way Erdrich creates many varried personalities to tell a story, you will love this book. If you've never read any of her work, this is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Louise Erdrich has written I don't know how many novels featuring Fleur Pillager and her still-increasing North Dakota Chippewa clan. Tracks remains my favorite, mostly because of Nanapush, surely one of the most wonderful characters ever to inhabit the pages of a novel. \\"Talk is an old man's last vice,\\" Nanapush says. When he gets ill, he says \\"I got well by talking. Death could not get a word in edgewise, grew discouraged, and traveled on.\\" You won't, you'll sit at Nanapush's feet and never want to get up, not while he's still talking. My only complaint about Tracks is it's too short.The Beet Queen: A Novel (P.S.)andLove Medicine: A Novel (P.S.)are about the same characters, not really sequels or prequels, just more stories about the same great folks. You'll be happy you get more than one visit."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Erdrich is an amazing weaver of words. There are two narrators in this book, each chapter alternates between Nanapush an older very traditional Ojibwe man and Pauline a contemporary of our main character Fleur, who is shunning the traditional ways.I had a hard time with this book because I really enjoyed Nanapush's narration, he is funny and wise and insightful. But then I would get to the next chapter that was narrated by Pauline--who in a way reminds me of Elphalba from \\"Wicked\\" she is determined to be always right, essentially destroying herself and those around her. She is a selfish and mentally deluded character.The twin narration follows the life of one character, Fleur. She is like and adoptive daughter to Nanapush and a sort of sister/rival to Pauline. While Pauline is rather homley Fleur is beautiful and other worldly. Her tribes people suspect her of a liason with the monster that lives in the lake.Its the story of people being pushed off their land by the government and some of their own people. Ultimately the story is a tragedy with some mythic elements and great dashes of humour (courtesy of Nanapush--he is a brilliant character, I'd almost reccomend reading this book on the strength of him alone)."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"A story of an elusive woman(Fleur Pillager) entangled in the larger event of the Native American peoples' loss of their homeland. Erdrich is masterful in her ability to express both Fleur's human and mystical qualities through the voices of two narrators, each revealing complex lives and relationships of their own. A perspective is presented so that the new white order, who wield &quot;this method of leading others with a pen and piece of paper&quot;, becomes a foreign way of thought(though it is of course our modern Western way), which consumes the Native American culture as fast as it wipes the trees from its landscape."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This is a beautiful novel that captures the mystic qualities of the lives that Native Americans lived. Yes, I too read this in college, but count it as one of the best books I read during that time. It is a book for discerning readers who have learned to appreciate the skill it takes for an author to re-create the ethereal nature of the characters she has dreamed."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Erdrich's Tracks offers a new and intriguing perspective on Native American life. Rather than following conventional writing techniques, Erdrich offers a short story cycle narrative in which two characters, Nanapush and Pauline, tell a story from two very different perspectives. I will have to admit though, the story is confusing due to this feature, but it also adds a personal touch that sets it apart from other novels. As unique as the novel may be, the tale is clouded with imagery that often leaves readers confused as well as frustrated at certain points. Moreover, the descriptions of Native American life and the events that unfold in the novel seem almost mythical and very unrealistic. This seems to suggest that Erdrich has a certain reverence towards Native American culture and views it with awe and vivid imagination."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I most likely would not have read this book if it wasn't required for and English Literature class, yet it wasn't the worst novel I have been required to read.One thing is for sure, it is very confusing at first. This is partially because it switches narration often, and it is difficult to grasp what exactly is happening because time doesn't flow in a consistent rate. However if you can get past this, it reads pretty well.The novel is an allegory for the plight of the Ojibwe people as they amalgamate into, or resist the urge to conform to modern society, through the eyes of a few key characters representing different aspects of the culture.That being said, it's not the most entertaining story. I found that I was only interested in the half of the novel focusing and narrated by the character Pauline, whereas the half from the point of view of Nanapush drug on tediously.While my Professor simply adored this novel (as well as the rest of Louise Erdrich's work), I guess it just didn't do much for me."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I did not receive the other book that I also ordered by the same author, Louise Erdrich. I did pay for it on my credit card. It has a long title, something like \\"The Last Miracles at ...\\" Please let me know when or if it is coming. I really want that book. thanks, Sr. Mary Rogers"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I appreciate an author's attempt at using creative narratives and vivid imagery, but only in small doses and when it serves to enhance the story. The problem with Tracks is that the narrative and imagery don't enhance the story. Instead, they confuse it and drag it down, slowing down the pace and making me wonder if it isn't just an attempt to flesh out what should really be a short story. Sometimes, more is just more, not better. I kept wishing Erdrich would stop playing with words and just tell the stupid story and get it over with. Just another great example of how Fiction has lost sight of storytelling in favor of novels that are so bogged down under the weight of their prose that they fail to engage readers."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I very seldom not finish reading a book but I could not take more than half of this book.

It started off hard to follow, and then as it progressed, it became more and more difficult to comprehend. There is a lot of old people sex and sexual inuendos. The plot is slow and to be honest, i am really not interested in reading any more books about indians. I'm not racist, just sick of all the indian books! I do think that the book was written well and it was interesting how Erdrich switched narrators. Overall I wouldn't have picked to read this book on my own, but if you like nature stories about the troubles that Indians had to go through, then go ahead read this book."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I was required to read this book for a literature class at my university. This was quiet possibly the most wretched book I have ever had the misfortune to lay my hands on, since I am an avid reader it took alot to earn that position with me. The story line moves horribly slow. The narration flips back and forth with each chapter between a wise old man, and an illogical, mentaly ill future nun who engages in strange practices of self torture. The parts narrarated by the nun do not make sense, do not enrich the plot and break the flow of the book since it is mostly nonsense taking place in her head. To much nonsense and unneccesary sex. Don't waste your time on this book, your time would be better spent watching grass grow."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a piece of \\"literature\\" before. I really couldn't believe the fact that I had no connection with these bizarre series of events or any of the characters. Not only that, but I didn't just start counting pages, I started counting paragraphs, and then sentences and then words. If I didn't have to read this book for an English class I think I would've ripped all the pages out and then burned it, okay, maybe not something so dramatic.I guess now that I've given my initial review of the book, I'd like to explain myself.First of all, I went into reading this book expecting something great. Perhaps this is one of the reasons as to why I was so dissatisfied with its content.For the first time, in a long time, I was given something besides African American and Hispanic/Latino literature for a multi-ethnic literature class. Going into this book I was all excited that we were going to discuss something different in class. I was happy to be learning something about a culture that I haven't been that exposed to.Unfortunately, this book was not the book I was looking for.The book had two narrators and they would switch off with every other chapter. The first narrator was this older gentleman who had lived a long time and experienced a lot, but may have been slightly senile. His name was Nanapush. The second was a slightly insane, self-hating, hypocritically religious, crazy woman (because I don't think bad words can be said on amazon.com) named Pauline. These two, were able to put together the most deranged story ever, leaving you with a skewed series of events in your mind that really left you with nothing but confused.One thing that I would say I liked a little bit about the book was that in Nanapush's sections Erdrich was able to slip in some important information about the compromising situations that the Native American people were put through. The book actually starts out with Nanapush describing the \\"spotted sickness\\" and the way it was killing off so many of his people. Being one of the stronger men on the reservation he saved a girl named Fleur from the disease. Fleur was this mystical character that had some strange connection with the water, because she was so beautiful that the water monster wanted her. Basically the story was about Fleur. She was beautiful, she was strong, and in some ways powerful.Pauline would explain her perspective on the way she saw Fleur, but she loved fleur and hated her at the same time. Pauline was jealous of Fleur and angry that the men loved her, but at the same time she loved Fleur because that's what she wanted to be.Nanapush had kind of turned into an uncle to Fleur ever since he saved her from the sickness and they became part of each other's lives.All this may seem a bit vague, but it's only because this is what the book leaves you with, bits and pieces of vague stories that are hard to make sense out of."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"we had to read this book for english class, and it is awful. I dont believe i can repeat the things that i think about this book in this forum, but i think you guys get the idea. If you enjoy boring stories about non-relavent things, feel free to bore yourself with this boring novel."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks was a very interesting novel. The author Louise Erdrich has a style about her writing. The book is written from two different points of view. A young woman and an old man tell a tail that kept me reading on. The story starts with the introduction of one of the main characters Fleur. Fleur is found almost frozen to death but is nursed back to health by Nanapush on of the narrators. Flue grows up surrounded with rumors and bad luck. Fleur has a few accidents involving water and after that she changes forever. A few males that try and court her wind up drowned. People start to wonder about her and she is thought of as surrounded by dark magic and dangerous. This is just a demonstrating of how complex the plot is.The novel is very action packed and full of surprises. The novel has a lot of talk about magic and superstition. The way that the book is narrated is the most impressive thing. The two different personalities of Nanapush and Pauline the two narrators are what make this novel great. You hear what Nanapush thinks and sees and then hear the same for Pauline. The two different personalities make me think about which one is right and I find my self thinking along with one of the narrators.This book is not for any quiet reading; it jumps out and shows you a side of Native Americans that you don't hear about. You also see the difference between the Native American culture and the white American culture. The plot is well developed and makes for some complicated reading. I liked Tracks and would like to read one of Louise Erdrich other novels. Tracks is a dark book with all the magic and superstition but it had moments of passion, anger and surprises. I would recommend this book to almost any one who posses the reading ability."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"My husband had to read this book for a history course on Native Americans several years ago. When his eyes were too tired to read, I often read sections out loud to him. Those small glimpses of the book were intriguing and I have long intended to read it fully.It is the story of a people on the edge of cultural and physical extinction. The characters are so alive and the story, told in first person by two alternative narrators, is vivid, mystical and entrancing."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Louise Erdrich writes with an articulate, to-the-point beauty. She creates a compelling and heart-wrenching story in TRACKS by following the daily tribulations and struggle of four Native American women. This story is divided into several smaller tales. Each woman's story reveals her adventure and strife. Erdrich brilliantly meshes points of contact between the characters to create a powerful novel centering on the search for identity and the struggle of the Native American woman to survive in an unforgiving world."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I found this to be a wonderful book. I read it for a women's novels class in college and could not put it down. Erdrich has really shown the importance of Ojibwe culture. Nanapush is the respected elderly member, Fleur is the free spirit and Pauline is trapped between white society and the culture she grew up in. This was a truly enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"What an inspiring story. Once you read one of Erdrich's books, you have to read the others. They are so accurate and respectful of Native culture."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I first read a short story by Louise Erdrich in an American Literature class. Her writing immediately captured my interest. Since then, I've read several of her books (all excellent) and &#34;Tracks&#34; did not fail to live up to my high expectations of this author.Erdrich continues to focus this story mainly on the Kashpaw and Nanapush families of Ojibwa people. Her beautiful writing drops you right in the middle of the ancient tales of tribal elders, sometimes making you wonder if this is really a work of fiction or a compilation of the oral history handed down through the tribes."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This made me want to seek out Louise Erdrich's other books. She has an excellent style that blends humorous, sad, and political."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is an a very good book. It gives you in site of the Native American culture. Pauline was a favorite character of mines because she is crazy and has an imagination of her own. I really love how Fleur was such a mystery throughout this book which captures the reader's attention. Sometimes, the book can be a bit confusing to read, and you may have to re-read some parts to get a better understanding of what is actually taken place during the story line. I think this book is a pretty good book to read, and it is very interesting."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I made two mistakes in reading this book. First, I read it very quickly, and I think that's why I tended to get the relationships of the characters confused. Second, this book is one of a series, and, although its events occur first, it was written later. Therefore, perhaps the author intended for the reader to be already familiar with the characters. The book has alternating narrators. One is Nanapush, a Chippewa elder, who is telling Lulu her mother's story. Lulu's mother is Fleur, the central character in the book, a beguiling woman whose parents died from a white man's disease. The other narrator is Pauline, half-white, vengeful and somewhat crazy, who becomes a nun bent on self-flagellation, perhaps attempting to assuage guilt from having lured Fleur's lover toward a young, beautiful girl. I was somewhat puzzled that Nanapush seemingly so easily forgives a huge betrayal by his lover, Margaret, and I was amused by Fleur's wily act of trickery at the end."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Great book-- I don't see why a couple of other respondents said this book is lifeless, etc. The plot is excellent, and the dual narration adds to suspense. Certainly worth reading, and a must if you are into Native American literature."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"A general look at American history between 1910 and 1920 will mostly focus on America's involvement in World War I. In Erdrich's work that is placed in this time period, the focus is on another American event: the displacement of Indians from their land. The tale is carefully crafted and the magical realism allows the reader to feel like a part of the story - like he or she is taking part in it. If you want a quick read, or a really thoughtful read, this book provides both."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is such a complicated novel that it is difficult to briefly describe. Like most other Native American Stories there is the main conflict of the Indians versus the white man and Christianity. However, Erdrich's story goes beyond that. Her novel seems to mystify everything. The characters are so complex: throughout the story you wonder if Fleur actually has magic, if Nanapush tells the truth, or if Pauline the masochist is actually inflicting all of these punishments. There are several motifs/ themes in the novel: Christianity versus traditions, elusive money, family pride, and the supernatural. Lastly, the point of view alternates between Nanapush telling his story to Lulu and Pauline telling her story as a confessional. The book is not easy to read, I would definitely not call it a page turner. However, it is interesting and Erdrich has a way of pulling you into the story."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks jumped out at me in a bookstore in Northampton, Massachusetts 12 years ago. I was just browsing the shelves and I randomly picked up and bought this book. I have read it several times since then and keep reading Louise Erdrich's other books following the same characters trough generations.I fell in love with Nanapush, Fleur and their way of life. I feel uneasy about Pauline and everything she represents. Louise Erdrich has a way of weaving together dreams, smells, present time and past time. She has a way of writing poetry I can understand in the form of Nanapush and how he sees the world around him.This book is one of my most treasured books and I keep discovering new things in this and following books as I grow older and change perspective on things. It is not just a book about Native Americans but about life."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I first read this book for a high school multi cultural lit class. I was fascinated by the story then and almost 10 years later this is still one great read (at least to me). It take a little brain power to get through, this is not an easily read novel, but if you enjoy challenging reads that focus on the non-white perspective of America (like Push, or The Bluest Eye) then you will appreciate Tracks"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is a brilliant rendition of early Native American culture and the different conflicts within the Ojibwe society, as well as conflict Native Americans experienced with the imposition of white Europeans. Waves of varying emotions swept over me with each different short story, which were contrasted in an effective way through the narratives of Pauline and Nanapush. Nanapush's desire to retain traditional Native American culture is juxtaposed by Pauline's inherent need to be white and her great determination to spread the Christian faith through the reservation. Through these and other characters, Erdrich takes the reader on a journey through 12 years of Native American pain, hardship, and cultural struggle."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"I was assigned the task of reading Tracks for a college English class. Though I was weary of what the novel would resemble, for I had not previously read Erdrich, I was pleasantly surprised by the ever-changing story line.This story is told in an alternating point of view by two characters, Nanapush and Pauline. The changing narrators made the novel that much more interesting to me, for I was able to see two different story lines and thought processes because of this. Another reason I recommend this novel is because of the action packed plot. Each chapter brings a new, exciting event to life. Erdrich constantly provides new twists and turns in the story for readers to contemplate. She definitely leaves her readers fully satisfied. Because I had never read a Native American novel of this sort, I felt Tracks provided a wonderful example of authentic Native American culture. I was able to enter a world besides my own, observing a lifestyle completely different than that of which I am used to. This was an honor to be able to do.Though I have given much praise to the novel, I will say that this is not a book I will read again. However, that is simply because it is not my favorite style of reading material. While I feel it is an extremely intelligent, well-written novel, it is not something that I found great pleasure in reading. It is a heavy, sometimes hard to read novel. However, if you're looking to get an insight into the true life of a Native American while reading a legendary piece of work, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"Tracks is another one of Erdrich's amazing novels. Combining Ojibwe and Catholic beliefs, she creatively portrays the events that have been detrimental to Ojibwe for hundreds of years. This novel has many twists and turns in it and is very hard to put down!"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"This is my all time favourite of the books of ErdrichI have read. It has a special poetic feel to it. It is subtle and interesting at the same time. It stayed with me long afterI finished reading it."},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"TracksThis my first book from Louise Erdrich. The setting is North Dakota and the timing of the story is early 20th century. People in the story are mostly Indians living on reservations. The main characters are Nanapush - an elderly wise man, Fleur - an odd character who was supposed to be a witch and Pauline - a mixed bred woman undergoing penance in a nunnery. The story is told from multiple first person points of view, alternated by Nanapush and Pauline. There are other characters like Kashpaw, Morriseys, Margaret (Kashpaw's mother).Fleur is supposed to have an influence on the water monster living in the lake Machimmanito. This book depicts the struggle of people to make a living in harsh winter, trying to pay taxes to keep their land, Indian folklore, politics and cultural clashes, internal feud between two clans - Pillagers and Morriseys.The narrative voice for both Nanapush and Pauline is different but in some chapters Nanapush is telling the story to someone and I couldn't figure out until few pages later on that Nannnapush is telling the story to Lulu. Erdrich has succeeded in building interesting characters. I don't recall I had come for a long time such a masterly prose. Almost every sentence is a gem. How does Erdrich do it?But if you read this book and I strongly recommend you do, you need to keep the dictionary nearby. I had problem understanding the meaning of some of the words she used.I am sure to read her next book \`Love Medicine.'"},{"Title":"Tracks","review":"When I used Love Medicine in a university level English Literature course I thought I'd hit gold for getting my students to open up to literature with Erdrich's book. Lipsha's quest for identity connected with the young men and women alike. But Tracks was even more efective. Fleur's fight against the loggers and land developers turned 32 college sophmores into hardy land conservationists. The incredible transportating of a successful hunt with the meat tied to the hero's body struck a cord of awe at having been given a view of survival that took them beyond their trips to their local grocery stores. Erdrich opens windows to another culture, different values, and to history in ways that made my students begin to &quot;see&quot; the world beyond their dormrooms. What other author writing today can do the same with such poetry?"},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"i cant believe all the positive reviews for this book.it was one of the lamest biographies that i have ever read.and i speak as someone who enjoys a good hollywood biography.save your money and look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"Has anyone noticed that most of the rave reviews of this book are by devout Christians?Now -- For those of us who are NOT religious, O'Neill's book is interesting mainly because this woman is a jaw-dropping psychological mess. I feel truly sorry for her children, since O'Neill is obviously someone who should never have had kids. As another reviewer pointed out, she married every man who showed any interest in her, had as many kids as possible, and immediately dumped them in the care of whoever happened to be handy -- even people who had proven themselves untrustworthy or even criminal! I hope that her born-again Christianity has made her a little bit easier for her family to live with.I also was a bit disappointed that there were not more pictures of this very beautiful woman -- especially since her looks seem to be her only redeeming quality!"},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"I'm stumped.

Get a grip."},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"Interesting story of the life of a celebrity. However, nearly every page has at least one type and numerous pages have typo after typo. It's hard to believe a publishing company would print a book that, literally, appears not be have been proofread: words like held instead of help, mean instead of meant, 'eds' left off where required, and on and on and on. If you are a fast reader this has a tendency to slow you down a bit when you have to skim twice to get the meaning of thought after thought."},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"Splendid!

A real encouragement to anyone who has had a life of emotional abuse."},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"It is probably one of the best celebrity autobiographies I have ever read and I've read plenty. Jennifer's writing is intelligent, witty, and engrossing.

The real beauty of this book is that it is written for the honor and glory of God."},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"An intimate and inspiring chronicle of a triumphant journey of faith.

It's exciting and Spectacular!! Funny, daring, endearing and unpredictable. It's an explosively thrilling book. Can I say more!"},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"It is odd to read an autobiography where an author tells so many personal things and still leaves me feeling she's leaving so much out or maybe living in a state of denial. Eight marriages, yet there's more information about her pets than her husbands...but then her relationships with her pets appear to be more profound than with those of humans. Ms. O'Neill comes across as distracted and distant and often unaware--filming &quot;Caravan&quot; in Iran, she blithely states that the entire country was, at the time, addicted to drugs and also that they HATE dogs. Little asides like this were hard to take--an entire country taking in their aging relatives simply to have access to their prescriptions for morphine-based drugs? A country of people that, to a person, HATE dogs. More like a country in which families--extended families--live together as a custom, and a religion (Islam) that regards dogs as dirty (a muslim must wash his hands seven times after touching a dog). Perhaps I'm putting to fine a point on my critique of just a couple of paragraphs, but this kind of misinformation along with O'Neill's other vagaries make me question her editor and her ability for introspection and, truthfully, her intellect. She is very beautiful, and that includes an internal beauty that she exudes...but I don't find her moral convictions totally believable, and I wonder why she leaves out so much about what makes her interesting in the first place--her looks and her modeling and her acting and her many marriages. There is no index to this book, and the only photographs of a woman who was THE spokeswoman for Cover Girl make up for something like thirty years appear on the back of the hardbound edition."},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"Funny, tough and tender. A book that is a class act! The true-life story of Jennifer O'Neill is simply magnificent. Hollywood is destined to make this novel into a mini-series or film. This book communicates on the level of deep human feelings, and leaves an unforgettable impact. It is my pleasure to recommend to your attention this book!

Jennifer is gorgeous, talented &amp; has the luck of the stars following her everywhere, BUT . . . gads what a mess of a person psychologically, nothing, I mean nothing is explained for her behavior &amp; [incompetence] especially in regards to her main victims, her children. Didn't many, many miscarriages give her the hint, DON'T HAVE CHILDREN? And in any age &amp; time her disbelief of her daughter's abuse by one of her husbands is a crime alone. And then to send her son by the same abuser to live with him (an admitted felon when she married him) after she was informed what he did to her daughter? And the fact that no one can stand her for long, not her brother, or her first ex-husband and his new wife who tried to help her abused daughter, or anyone? And then to keep having children, throwing them to the current nanny (or whoever) some of which were sexually aggressive towards Jennifer herself? And to marry one after the other every time her hormones said GO? If she wasn't so unbelievibly luck, (not accounting for her beauty, lots of us are gorgeous but don't have her golden touch) in the real world outside of Hollywood, she would be HOMELESS right now!At the end of the book, she throws herself at yet another man, marries again with little or no investigation, makes him the 8th, thereby victimizing her last son to another 10 years of abuse, and she now claims to know God.What is she leaving out? That she is deaf, dumb &amp; blind? That she has been a total alcoholic for years &amp; years? That she has such an abrasive personality that no one can stand her but animals? Or that she is just plain crazy with a knack for making money every time she turns around?Why doesn't she tell us what really happened?Still, this is an amazing book! It is as entertaining for what is says as for what it doesn't say! Anyone who reads it is going to long toknow the truth.I give her credit for her writing, it's good. I just wonder about WHY? No one who reads this &amp; gets to the end where she claims to have found God and after all that she has done in her past, has not had one day of self reflection or gotten a good psychiatrist with all her money, but just gets &quot;Born Again&quot;, &quot;married again&quot; and expects us to believe that she &amp; her minor children are ever going to be all right?I have one guarantee, she will be fine, her children need intervention.Let the horsies have this girl!"},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"Jennifer O'Neill has written a powerful book that rises above other celebrity biographies. &quot;Surviving Myself&quot; goes beyond the headlines and offers her real-life story -- one which is often shocking and tragic, yet inspiring.Through the honest, transparent sharing of her experiences... and the miraculous way in which she's risen above them... readers will find great encouragement in the midst of pain.

In her lifelong search for love she married nine times, rushing in and out of marriages, always choosing grossly unsuitable husbands, and never seeming to learn from her mistakes.

I am delighted to know what Ms. O'Neill has done with her life and this book fills in details leading up to her present success within her own self."},{"Title":"Surviving Myself","review":"In this autobiography, Ms. O'Neill shares the ups and downs of her life. Although she never really wanted for monetary rewards as a child, she seemed to be rather emotionally isolated from her peers and her brother, to which I could relate. Her parents denied her the horse she always wanted. She grew up in a generation of young people who tried different ways to reach happiness and it took awhile for Ms. O'Neill to find herself. Ms. O'Neill gained success at a very young age as a supermodel and therefore was easy to be taken advantage of in the 1960's. She is an inspiration to young people who do not always \\"fit in\\" with the crowd, either because of appearance or social status or both. Ms. O'Neill seemed to see herself as somewhat of an outcast in her youth. Her deep love for horses continues throughout the book, perhaps because animals always love us, no matter how they have been treated in the past. This book shares the highs and lows of a beautiful woman, inside and out, and is funny as well as emotionally thought-provoking. A worthwhile read for any young girl approaching adolescence or already there."},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","review":"This fine book is a collection of essays that weave together remarkable accounts of four generations of the author's ancestors, from their settlement in central Montana in the 19th century to the latter years of the 20th. Pioneers of strong fortitude, originating in Pennsylvania, her father's family, the Hogelands, are among the first settlers along the headwaters of the Judith River.Good years, wise management, and a faith in the rewards of hard work serve them well - until the early death of the author's grandfather, followed by a decade of severe drought and then the Great Depression. While half of the homesteaders around them go broke and move on, her family continues to scrape a living from the land, the women on her mother's side of the family supplementing their incomes with teaching in remote one-room country schools.Reconstructing her family's story, the author brings vividly to life her father and mother, grandmothers, aunts, and her great-grandparents. She deciphers and transcribes the writings of her great-grandfather Abraham, interviews living relatives, and studies family photographs, many of which are included in her book. While the primary theme of the book is the survival of her family, she also has much to say about the role of women, focusing on the circumstances that invariably compromised their hopes and aspirations.There is her father's mother, Grammy, who does the work of a man while providing home and shelter for a live-in hired man without benefit of clergy. There's her mother's mother, who teaches school into her seventies to support her family and pay for her husband's care in a nursing home. There's the author's aunt Imogen, who remains unmarried and also teaches school. There's the author's mother, who marries a handsome cowboy and then struggles to make a place for herself in her husband's domineering family.Meanwhile, the men in her stories make equally interesting studies, especially her strong-willed father, Jack, who's a natural horseman and top hand; her mother's father, who cannot withstand the pressures of a lonely, hard life on the prairie; and a husband in later years, a wildcat oilman who is in complete denial that he is dying of pulmonary fibrosis.I highly recommend this well-written, absorbing and sometimes harrowing book that renders such a vivid picture of Montana homesteaders and the extremes of rural life. Thanks to the University of Oklahoma Press for keeping it in print. Readers of this book will also like Judy Blunt's memoir of growing up on a Montana ranch, \\"Breaking Clean.\\""},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","review":"While I enjoyed this book - it made me aware of just how fragmented my own family history is. How I wish my ancestors had written (or kept) diaries and especially wish they had written on the backs of all those old photos to know what states, counties, cities, villages they were in at the time of the photograph and what was the event or celebration, etc. Thanks for a good read, Ms. Blew"},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","review":"To paraphrase what another reviewer has said: These people become your family. You love them as your own. Possibly you end up knowing them better, and more coherently than your own family from stories and memories you have pieced together. One senses an extraordinary effort on the part of the author to bring poetic exactness to, to reinvigorate the pain, the wind, the vast loneliness and silence, the indifference to ultimate human concerns of the Montana landscape."},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","review":"Mary Clearman Blew pulls no punches in telling the story of the Hogeland and the Welch families and the tellingly tough times they faced in frontier Montana from the turn of the twentieth century onward. Drought, the Depression, inexperience, madness, bitterly cold winters and dust storms all conspire against these families, and yet they somehow managed to persevere, if not to prosper, at least to survive. Blew's finely wrought essays weave a tapestry that brings these people to life, from 1900 right up to the present day. Her own difficult marriages and fierce, almost ruthless, determination to succeed are not spared in the telling. This is one helluva good read, one which I will recommend highly. I have nothing but admiration for Mary Clearman Blew, both as a writer and as a woman."},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","review":"This book is the story of the author and of the men and women of her family over the generations as they settled in rural Montana. Mary painstakingly and no doubt at times, painfully, lends a glimpse into the life and persona of each of these family members. She somehow mangages to tell the raw truth and yet does so with such sensitivity and respect that one cannot help but be moved by the stories that each life tells.As one reviewer noted, it tends to skip around. Admittedly at first I almost gave the book up in the first couple of chapters, thinking that it would be too meandering but I am so,so glad that I stuck with it. It does all tie together eventually. After the first few chapters I was captivated, and found the book hard to put down. I found each story to be so honestly told, the characters so like members of my own family who I have tried to understand....this is a tale that stays with you long after you put the book back on it's shelf. Personally, it helped me to appreciate and understand some of my own relatives better.I am grateful to the author for sharing these stories. It must have been quite a decision in a way to stick her neck out and tell about these things, especially coming from a small rural community. She writes so with such tenderness that her telling only makes the reader respect and admire this family all the more. She writes as one who has comes to terms with the past."},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","review":"This has a nice balance of the nature and the people of 1880's Montana. At times, the writing made me feel as if I was actually floating along the Judith River and watching the fields being worked. At other times, I wanted more information, and frustrated that there wasn't any way to find it - just like the author working with her great-grandfather's notes written on scraps of paper, fading away after so many years.I think the best part of the book dealt with her ancestors, but her own generation probably should have been omitted. The change in attitude and even the descriptive prose was jarring after the 1880's views. It didn't detract from the story overall, but it just didn't seem to fit.Recommend especially if your study anthropology like me !!!!!!"},{"Title":"All But the Waltz: A Memoir of Five Generations in the Life of a Montana Family","review":"The book All but the Waltz is something you should read if you are interested in learning some things about Montana life from the 1880's on.

The plot is clever, but built just the same way as every other Mason story: A client who doesn't tell all the truth to his attorney; an attractive woman with a secret; an unpleasent fellow who dies; a policeman who merely functions as an example of how not to do police work; a D.A. who is mad at Mason; and a twist that comes out all right for our heroes. It's written with Gardner's typical style, too: He uses words inaccurately (&quot;commenced&quot; for &quot;began&quot; is the one that always annoys me), and has dialogue no one would ever use (Mason always, inevitably, calls his detective &quot;Paul Drake&quot; ~ never &quot;Paul&quot; or &quot;Drake&quot;, or even &quot;him&quot; as a real person would). That all being said, i still read Gardner, occasionally. Why? Because he is fun, and an entertaining way to spend an evening. That's all the time he takes (all he took, too, to write each book, i think); all i'm willing to give him. But, for that evening, he's worth it."},{"Title":"The Case of the Phantom Fortune (A Perry Mason Mystery)","review":"Perry Mason is probably one of my all-time favorite comfort food writers. He is always reassuringly smooth and arrogant. He's faithful to his Della, who is clearly both competent and a serious babe. The clients never tell the truth (is this where House gets its \\"patients always lie\\" trope?) and Lt. Tragg never catches up quickly enough. The books follow enough of a formula to be reassuring, but are never so formulaic that they are uninteresting.The Case of the Phantom Fortune is a late Mason novel (1964) and honestly one of the weaker books in the bunch. The plot is oddly convoluted and seems to move in fits and starts. It isn't quite as slick as some of the other books. But still, it gets you where you are going, more or less. And it still is fine entertainment value, sure as shooting.When a new client goes to a huge amount of trouble to retrieve a single matching fingerprint, Perry Mason is amused. When the same client hires Perry to protect his wife from the owner of the fingerprint no matter *who* it might be, he is even more intrigued. The fingerprint, however, came from the least likely person that could imagine and the story gets even stranger from there. With all the blackmail, double identities, and suspicion running around in this novel it is no wonder that somebody ends up dead..."},{"Title":"The Case of the Phantom Fortune (A Perry Mason Mystery)","review":"The Case of the Phantom FortuneThe 'Foreword' is dedicated to Shigeo Ogata MD, a professor of Legal Medicine in Kyoto Japan. His research on an unknown dead woman led to her recognition, and the to the man who killed her.This story begins with a new client, Horace Warren, who wants Perry Mason to attend a dinner and observe a person to judge his character. There is discussion of fingerprint identification. Warren wants his wife Lorna protected from a blackmailer; her past is a mystery (Chapter 1). Perry and Della join other guests at this dinner party, and are introduced (Chapter 3). [Is this 'hiding in plain sight'?] The fingerprints of the guests are recorded and checked out. They find one person had been arrested, but acquitted; it is Lorna Warren (she had worked for a man convicted of fraud). The police are interested in Collister Damon Gideon because they believe he has hidden funds. Smooth-talking Gideon shows up at Perry?s office, he knows about Lorna (Chapter 6). [This also explains how agents shadow a person of interest.] Gideon wants a 'donation' to help him disappear. But Perry has some trump cards he can use against Gideon (Chapter 7). Perry baits a hook to catch Gideon (Chapter 8). But Gideon disappears while being followed by six operatives (Chapter 9)! Perry's plan to scare Gideon away develops a flaw (Chapter 10). But Perry thinks of a sure-fire scheme to thwart this blackmailer (Chapter 11). But there is a surprise here when Lt. Tragg arrests Perry's client for Gideon's murder (Chapter 12). Now Horace Warren comes clean and tells all to Perry after he's arrested (Chapter 14). The police go to question Mrs. Warren, but Perry got there first and tells her to answer \\"no comment\\" (Chapter 15).Perry's scheme to scare Gideon away appears to back-fire (Chapter 16). District Attorney Hamilton Burger will complain to the Bar Association (Chapter 17). Perry finds out what happened to the fortune in the suitcase in Lorna's closet (Chapter 18). If both Horace and Lorna deny shooting Gideon, then who did? Chapter 19 discusses the recurring theme about the unreliability of eyewitness identification of a stranger viewed for a few seconds under stress. Perry may be charged with witness tampering for having a private detective question witnesses with the sketch of Gideon. One problem is the incomplete search of the crime scene. Then new evidence is found with a second search, but this crime scene had not been guarded (Chapter 20). The effect of this new evidence is the dismissal of the murder charge against Horace Warren (Chapter 21).In the last chapter, as in other cases, Perry Mason provides a solution to the mysteries. The past of Mrs. Warren is kept secret. Any person could make deposits to an account that wasn't theirs in those days. Perry deduces the solution from the facts given in earlier chapters. [I did wonder about that strange event after the hold-up.] I couldn't put this book down!"},{"Title":"The Case of the Phantom Fortune (A Perry Mason Mystery)","review":"This Perry Mason story deviates somewhat from the formula. In this one, there is no climactic courtroom scene where Hamilton Burger takes over the prosecution and Mason demonstrates that he is a fool. While there is such a scene, it occurs early and the climactic scene takes place in a warehouse where the police complete a search for evidence that had been bungled earlier.The buildup to the end is much less pronounced, there are fewer distractions and no great tension in the end. Since we all know from the start that Mason is going to win his case, the power of the story is in the march to the end rather than what the end happens to be. This book is not one of Gardner's better efforts."},{"Title":"The Case of the Phantom Fortune (A Perry Mason Mystery)","review":"Horace Wallen retained Perry Mason to protect his wife from somebody who was trying to blackmail her. He provided a single clue, a fingerprint. Mason investigates, only to find that Lorna Wallen, the wife of Horace, made the fingerprint in question.Mason reveals what he knows about the ways to deal with a blackmailer; pay off (never works; the blackmailer always wants more), go to the police (wise in some cases), or kill the SOB. So he gets a police sketch of the blackmailer in question, then pays off to allow him to ditch the shadows of both the feds, and the government.After the blackmailer ditches his witnesses / alibis, Mason simply has his sketch shown to witnesses of major crimes, and scores a match. When shaken down for a \\"final payment\\", Mason just tells him that a police sketch identified him as an attempted killer. The end result- the blackmailer is killed, but Mason's client is picked as the killer.To win the case, Mason has to find the evidence require to both clear his client... and that of a witness tampering charge. He does both, in his usual manner."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"I have used this book so much I wore it out. I now have a second copy. This is no doubt the best recipe book I own. It is geared towards the extract brewer and is a great companion to Papazian's \\"Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\". It is not an instruction book for the new brewer but rather a comprehensive book or recipes. There are simple recipes that a new brewer can use instead of purchasing a kit. There are also more advanced recipes for the more experienced brewer. It contains recipes for nearly every style of beer as well as cider and mead. My personal favorite is the Saison recipe, which most recipe books do not include.Unfortunately I don't see copies this book at the local bookstores or LHBS anymore. Grab a copy before this gem goes out of print."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"If you're looking for a &quot;how-to&quot; book with regard to home-brewing, this ISN'T it, but if you just want RECIPES than this is the one to get. There is a mix of both extract and all-grain recipes. The emphasis on the former is not as great as advertised which I found slightly disappointing--for me, home-brewing is a hobby and not an occupation. (With a little bit of practice, however, it's not too difficult to convert an all-grain recipe into an extract version.) No matter what your style or taste, you'll find at least several different choices here, with recipes complete and easy to understand, and usually presented in a very entertaining fashion. Lots of tips, &quot;history of beer&quot; vignettes, and quotes from famous people on the subject of beer, many of which I have found fun to use in label-making. There's also some very good food recipes in here, all using beer--the Chicken with Roasted Garlic Cream Sauce has become a family favorite, and I'm anxious to try the Chocolate Cream Stout Cake!"},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"Anyone can put together a list of recipes for all the classicstyles of beer, throw a cover on it and hawk it for ... ... or put up a web site and collect a thousand different ways to combine malt and hops... recipes are easy to come by. But this book is more than just a collection of formulas.I give it a wholehearted five stars because the authors fill the pages with their passion for brewing great beer. The pages are a combination of anecodtes, brew tips and best of all quotations from all the greats of literature... Shakespeare to Orwell, they all had something to say about beer. I never tire of flipping through the pages when I am getting ready to make the next batch, and laughing at the wit and wisdom found within. I'll say it again. Get this book, it's worth twice the asking price."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"It's fitting that Charlie Papazian wrote the foreword for this book. \\"The Homebrewer's Recipe Guide\\" is written very much in the spirit of Papazian's \\"Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\". The book is filled with famous beer related quotes and bits of beer related prose, most of it quite good. The recipes are divided into the usual categories, most of the recipes have whimsical names and a little information about the brew or the person who made the recipe. Everything about the book is light and fun, much like \\"Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\". I've tried a few of the recipes and they made good beer. I'm sure all of them will make good beer. One of the more interesting ones is a Belgian Wit that involves dry hopping Cascades, definitely not to style but I bet it tastes good.The authors are right up front that this is not a technical manual but rather a guide, hence the title. I'm puzzled by all the negative reviews that criticize for not specifying IBU's and not including instructions for partial boils. If you've brewed a few batches of beer, you should be able to look at these recipes and understand how to adapt them to your system and your personal taste, it isn't difficult. The authors weren't out to write a textbook but rather to share whats worked for them and inspire the reader to brew beer. This, like \\"Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\", is an excellent book just to browse through on rainy days when you can't brew. For me, both books really capture the spirit of homebrewing. You can follow these recipes to the letter no matter what size boil you're doing or what %AA your hops are and make great beer or you can change these recipes to hit whatever marks you want to hit. There's all kinds of software you can plug the ingredients into to figure out what you're going to get, or you can calculate with pen and paper, or you can just wing it. I don't think it's fair to criticize this book for not nailing down all the specifics and for not providing specific conversions for extract, partial-mash, and all grain versions of each recipe. It's not that kind of book and it doesn't pretend to be. It is a great recipe guide with some wonderful bits of literature. It's not a beginner's guide but it certainly can be used by beginners and it's not an advanced manual but you'd have to be pretty heartless not to like it.If you didn't like Papazian's \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\" because it's a little too whimsical, not specific enough, and contains \\"outdated\\" information, then you're not going to like this book either. However, if you love \\"The Complete Joy of Homebrewing\\", this book makes an excellent companion. As for the politics several people have mentioned, there are no political discussions in my edition (1996). There is a reference to Jimmy Carter since he's the one who made homebrewing legal in the US and there is a reference to Thomas Jefferson also in a beer related context, but I find no references to Newt Gingrich or the Democrats in my edition and I've read it many times.Amazon has the \\"Search Inside This Book\\" feature available for this book. The sample pages are a good representation of what you get. If you like what you see, I highly recommend purchasing it."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"This is a delightful book of recipes, tips, and antecdotes.

I found the asides and exerts amusing. I would higly recommend this book for anyone who's already brewed a few batches and is looking for more recipes."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"This book has some really good recipes in it. I've tried only a few, but plan on doing a lot more in the future. The problem with this book is that I got it when I first started brewing. I wasn't looking for a step by step (I've got another book for that), but I was wanting a little more guidance in the individual recipes. They rarely (if at all) give you the amounts of water to use in different stages of brewing. Another problem is that the gravity predictions are WAY off. For example, the Oak Leaf Brown Ale on p. 43. The recipe calls for almost 8 lbs malt extract and 1 lb brown sugar. They say the OG should be around 1.044. I haven't even tried this recipe, but I can tell you there's no way that in a 5 gallon batch of beer that with that much malt and sugar you're going to have an OG that low. This was confirmed by both the local brew shop (who after I brought this to his attention pulled this book from his shelves and is contacting the publisher) and the brewing group I belong to.My other problem with the book is that it really should be titled \\"The Homebrewer's Extract Recipe Guide.\\" Almost all of the recipes in here are extract so if you want to brew all-grain, you have to modify them. Not a huge problem (it's very easy to convert the recipe), but with how generic the instructions are, it's clearly not targeted for a beginning brewer. I don't know many experienced brewers that don't brew all grain.Don't get me wrong, this book is a great place to start with recipes, but be ready to modify them to get something really good."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"Ok, so some recipes are in need of adjustment, but the book is loaded with recipes and interesting brewer tips. It is simple, but it is not a step-by-step how-to. I suggest that this is good for the homebrewer that is ready to experiment and try new things and of course, the more experienced can tweak the recipe when and if needed. The beginning section touches on the framework for all the recipes provided, explaining the amount of water used, yeast type, batch quantity and more. Other than that, it's recipe after recipe and the occasional brewer's tip and back story on beer styles.This is a fun book with a variety of recipes that will be enjoyed by any homebrewer. Those new to homebrewing will enjoy reading and making, but will be ready after some experience or the help of their local brew supply shop. I made a few and they came out quite well.This is a good book to give as a gift or add to your library."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"This book provides a good mixture of recipes including some cloned ones.

It definitely is, but don't discount the possibility of converting the recipes to all grain as well. In fact there are instructions in the book for doing this on page 86-87. These guide rules have been really useful when I wanted to continue making some of the great extract recipes as an all-grain brewer. One note though: use some common sense because even though the conversions get you in the right ballpark you shouldn't use more than makes sense. For example the 'Grandma's House chocolate mint stout' recipe calls for a hefty 8.5 pounds of dry and liquid malt extract for a 5 gallon batch. When you use the conversion formula in the book that comes out to 11 pounds of malt to mash (not even including specialty grains). That is a lot of malt to mash for 5 gallons of brew; so don't take the conversions out of reason. For the grandma's house 9-10 pounds of malt will be fine :)Seriously awesome book, I am constantly coming back to it for ideas and inspiration."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"This is by far the best book on brewing beer I have ever read.

However I can't seem to get past a few of the fundamental flaws this book has:1. The book is politically charged. The authors should have titled this book \\"The Homebrewers Recipe Guide of the Democrat Party\\". The authors admonish Newt Gingrich, sing praises to Jimmy Carter, and fill the book with their \\"progressive\\" social commentary. This took me by surprise because I thought I was buying a reference book, not a book on political commentary.2. The authors do not provide any guidelines for hop bittering. The recipes explain how much of which hop to use but do not indicate bittering units in the recipes - This is important because hop potency can vary from year to year and because bittering units can help you make adjustments incase the required hops are not available at your homebrew shop.3. Most of the recipes are for extract users who can boil their entire 5 gallon batch. Most extract users only have the means to boil 2-3 gallons at the most. This makes a big difference in the homebrewers use of hops.The recipes look good but I plan on returning my copy for another politically neutral recipe book."},{"Title":"The Homebrewers' Recipe Guide: More than 175 original beer recipes including magnificent pale ales, ambers, stouts, lagers, and seasonal brews, plus tips from the master brewers","review":"The people who wrote this book had a fun time doing it! I give the book a 4.9 star rating because it seems that for a lot of the recipes, they only brewed it once before including it in the book. Therefore, there's a chance that some of the recipes have room for improvement. But like the authors say, it's never the exact same batch twice, and changing the recipe to your liking is part of the fun.Otherwise, this is an awesome resource. There are all the classic beer styles including meads, ciders, lambics, Christmas-time ales, and some yummy-looking food recipes as well. The tips are quite helpful too.

The story is set in 1630. I found it very well written, with a story that kept me wanting to read more, interesting detail (but not too much) and interesting unique expressions (these days, anyway). This novel was written in 1894! After reading this novel, I looked up the author, and was not surprised to read that \\" his authenticity and attention to contextual detail caused his works...to be widely acclaimed for their romantic content and faithful historical accuracy\\". [...]. Even better, this is a free book! Wow!The story begins with a gentleman, while playing cards at his club in Paris, is accused of cheating. Not one to allow an insult like that to go unchallenged, he challenges the young brash fool to a duel. He wounds the young man, and since dueling is illegal and also he has duelled before (and killed 6 men previously), he is brought before Cardinal Richelieu, a very powerful man, who is about to dispense justice. The Cardinal is eventually convinced to give him an option - his life or find and arrest a M. de Cocheforet, most likely through less than upright means, which is distastful, but what choice? The adventure continues from there. And there is a lot of adventure."},{"Title":"The Psychology Of Hate","review":"I must confess that I did not get satisfied with this book as somebody outside of the psychology as a profession. It mainly deals with the semantics and there are enormous repetitions. Besides, it is not lucid. It may be of value for somebdy preparing a scientific research about hate as a psychological phenomenon, but it is not for somebody who inquires about the history, evolution and basis of hate. I put two stars, because I did not want to say I hated a book which's subject is hate."},{"Title":"The Psychology Of Hate","review":"Unfortunately, this book failed miserably as an empirical attempt to understand hate, and instead leaned heavily towards simplistic formulations to try and eliminate hate by merely describing it, and implicating Whites most often in its cause and effect on others. I really didn't expect anything else, but occasionally surprises do happen. I know Robert J. Sternberg's work, and he comes from the Marxist wing of the deniers of racial differences. With Sternberg as editor, I suspected this book would be biased, and I was correct. So the best I can do, rather than shed any more light on the evolutionary basis of hate, anger, fear and disgust, is to shed some light on how even today's psychology is very close to the Standard Social Science Model (SSSM), and therefore unable to produce good research.I am reading the book Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature, by David J. Buller, 2005, and he states, \\"But Gould's argument fails to substantiate even this weaker charge. For Evolutionary Psychologists answer Gould's question by claiming that there are three sources from which we can obtain information about the [Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation] EEA: the design of our adaptations, studies of extant hunter-gatherer societies, and primate studies. Therefore, showing that we can't possibly have any evidence for Evolutionary Psychology's adaptive hypotheses requires more than Gould's rhetorical question about how we can know what our ancestors did two million years ago; it requires examining the three sources of evidence that Evolutionary Psychologists claim can substantiate their adaptive hypotheses. Gould, however, fails to discuss these sources of evidence and their relevance to his argument.\\"Likewise, as the introduction to The Psychology of Hate admits, \\"Psychologists have not generated a lot of theories of hate, certainly fewer than theories of love. A survey of some recent introductory social psychology texts revealed love as an index term in all of them but hate as an index term in none of them. The goal of this book is to help redress an imbalance--to propose a number of different theories that answer questions about hate in related, but different, ways. The theories proposed in this book cover the gamut, including clinical, cognitive, social, and eclectic emphases on understanding hate.\\"Authors have been asked to address a common set of questions to ensure unity of their contributions: How do you conceptualize hate?; What evidence is there for this conceptualization?; How does your view relate to other views?; What do you see as the role of hate in terrorism, massacres, and genocides?; How, if at all, can hate be assessed?; How, if at all, can hate be combated?\\"Note how they did not include \\"is there a genetic component to hate,\\" or \\"how do we know that hate was not just as important as love in human evolution, and continues today as a mechanism for protecting a group's or an individual's self interests and resource acquisition?\\" No, the agenda was a more dialectical one, one conveniently used to establish fighting hate as a political tool for furthering an egalitarian agenda. That is Sternberg's style, set out a political agenda, then use pseudoscience to support it.In psychometrics, the leading method for factoring behavioral traits is the Big Five or OCEAN: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. If any person is evaluated on these five factors, their personalities can be defined using the five scales. So why doesn't a book like The Psychology of Hate at least touch upon a supposed behavioral trait profile for haters or racists or authoritarian type people? Apparently, having primarily a political agenda and not a scientific one, such obvious questions would get in the way.Sternberg then looks at \\"hate propaganda\\" as a process for persuading others to behave in a certain way. It seems his logic is what is heard every day on talk radio between Democratic and Republican advocates. The hate is venomous on both sides, it is devoid of empirical evidence, and it could easily fall into Sternberg's description of \\"hate propaganda.\\" It is hard to unravel, because Sternberg has a habit of defining psychological mechanisms out of whole cloth, conjuring up new terms and labels, and then pathologizing anyone who disagrees with him on moral grounds."},{"Title":"The Psychology Of Hate","review":"The contents of this book make the book's academic style almost disappear. This is an important read that educates, fascinates and should motivate the reader. There are probably over a dozen doctoral dissertation opportunities within the book, as well.We must all learn to understand hate and have a plan that we follow to overcome it and prevent it from operationalizing. This book can help us all.William C. McConkey, Ph.D."},{"Title":"The Psychology Of Hate","review":"I have only finished the first four chapters. There are some great knee-slappers here, but most people would not seek out such a work for the humor.Here all the tired baseless assumptions are trotted out one after another. Hate \\"caused\\" by people not liking each other...gosh, what an insight! Hate \\"caused\\" by people having bad things happen to them as children; yes, if only we can somehow guarantee that nothing bad will ever happen to any more children, then we might have a peaceful utopia! Hate \\"caused\\" by \\"devaluing\\" those who are different. So, like, we hate people because we hate them? And if only the two sides knew each other better...like for example in Bosnia where they had lived together and married each other for centuries? Yeah, that worked out great.... Of course, what they need is therapy! If only we can methodically destroy their illusions about themselves and others with \\"cognitive therapy,\\" then we will manage to create people too depressed and suicidal to kill others! (Trivers, 2002, Taylor and Brown, and Mele, 1997, show that self-deception is adaptive and that those with an accurate view of themselves invariably suffer from depression, but that means more clients for these quacks!)Meanwhile they work far harder to avoid knowledge than to find it. Staub cites 14 of his own works, while Beck and Pretzer manage to prove they are incompetent. Guys, a study that \\"shows\\" the effectiveness for \\"cognitive therapy\\" by comparing a treated group and a completely untreated group, without any sort of \\"blind\\" for subjects or researchers, and completely dependant on self-reporting, is not an \\"empirical\\" source of evidence for anything. Ever hear of the placebo effect? Researcher bias? I guess not. Real research has shown that none of the psychology models is more effective than another, and that minimally trained high school grads that offer an empathetic ear are also as good as any of them (see Dawes in Codes of Conduct, 1996). If any of the mound of garbage that they all pass off for an academic field was valid, surely one method would prove superior. How is it that two methods based on completely opposite views produce the same results? Why not just give everyone a sugar pill and save time?One sees the wheels turning madly as they try to avoid any hint of the knowledge that humans have evolved psychologies which just happen to have a lot to do with the topic of hate, especially group hate. Guys, it is not all culture and how sucky a childhood we had.Beyond the gross errors and the absurd, like Sternberg actually starting his paper with a dictionary definition (not OK after 9th grade...), the standard misunderstandings are all there as well. Conflation of individual level hate with group hate, for one (Ummmm, one is based on prejudice and one is not, one can be built on pro-social emotions towards one's group or nation, the other one cannot, etc.), and the jaw dropping inability to see that there are plenty of \\"others\\" that we are fine with, it is not just that they are \\"other\\" that starts the ball of hate rolling.Then it just gets sad when they trot out their little solution kits. Yeah, let's go give therapy to Bin Laden so he can see our side of things and hear about our suffering. That's the ticket! It would be hilarious to seem them try. Let's see, Staub's grocery list would do any late '60's hippy proud...\\"love and affection...constructive fulfillment of basic human needs; humanizing the other...self-awareness...healing from past victimization...\\" Of course we must also toss in \\"Helping young people who come from difficult backgrounds or who have had painful experiences...\\" Well, who has not had a painful experience? Strange that there is no correlation between such a background and one's being willing to become a suicide bomber. College degrees, on the other hand, do make one more likely to blow oneself up. If they had one of these winners for a professor, I guess I can understand.Great book if you want to laugh hard. If you want to understand the topic, the contents of this book have only negative value. The more you read, the less you will know, just like watching Faux New's coverage of Iraq."},{"Title":"Finger Weaving: Indian Braiding","review":"Just received this little booklet and have started my finger weaving project.

It's true that comments about televisions (When you next see Oliver Stone's Wall Street, check out the tv in Bud Fox's NYC penthouse...) and ranch houses are a bit dated, but the book shows that the craving for status and acceptance simply doesn't change. The book was published in 1949, and with a little imagination one can easily replaced dated status symbols with contemporary ones.

Some of it is quite dated, some is still relevant, but overall it presents a good look at how life was 40 years ago. Recommended, if you can track down a copy."},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"The author explores the workings of American society's opportunity structure, specifically, how social class, status striving, and social mobility (upward, static, and downward) influence the behavior of people who live in and compete for resources in our stratified, free-market social system. The significance of, and impact of social class is not generally acknowledged in the U.S., thus Packard's book offers insights uncovered by way of surveys, polls, interviews, and in-depth investigations from various social science fields; in addition, for source material about the impact of class on social situations, he made several of his own informal, intensive investigations and brought together the findings of 150 American social scientists, primarily from the fields of sociology, psychology, and marketing research. In various parts of the book, he often refers to work done by the Lynds in their famous study, \\"Middletown,\\" and by sociologist William Foote Whyte. Some of the investigated social situations, and how they are influenced by social class, include the following: how class differences form an invisible wall; how one's family origins influence or determine one's life chances; conspicuous consumption as a status signifier; the significance of dress codes; interplay of class with race and gender; how religious and political persuasion influence voting propensities; how received imagery (such as today's slick political TV ads), rather than careful thought, determines voting decisions; how appearance and image, rather than construction quality, determine the value of a house; some societal sources of marriage and family stresses; wives are more class-conscious than husbands; clubs and other social organizations; impact of class on stress and mental illness; school and educational attainment; upper-class college students and the \\"gentleman's C\\"; the ideal of American individualism versus team-player reality; cliques and snobbery in school; the upper class; the diploma elite; the working class(es); social hierarchy in corporate bureaucracies; occupational prestige; and social factors which determine who are likely to be friends. Although there have been some fundamental cultural shifts since the late 1950s - such as the effects of deindustrialization - I think most of Packard's insightful findings involving social class, status-striving, job specialization, and the increasingly caste-like class stratification of American society are as applicable today, perhaps more so, as they were in the 1950s. The book is reader-friendly and should be suitable for high school students as well as adults."},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"I read this because Tobias Wolff mentioned it in This Boy's Life. He was exactly right about it. It is a manual for changing your class.Since social class is basically a secret in the United States, it doesn't change very much -- the basic structure is pretty well intact since 1960. The list of prep schools he names, the hierarchy of religions; they're still valid.He has some pretty powerful inights. For example, he predicted that, in the future (today) the major qualification for wage jobs would be the ability to endure boredom. GOOD CALL.He says things about some groups (women, Jews...) that are a bit appalling in a modern context, but do paint a picture of the fifties that's worth pondering (this is not that long ago, after all).His observations about the changing nature of business are very interesting."},{"Title":"The Status Seekers","review":"I read this with interest not because it describes today's society, but it certainly gives some background to why things are the way they are in America today.

It's astonishing to see the differences between the 1950s and now, but more astonishing were the similarities. Society is as stratified as it was back then, and although the status symbols themselves are different, the spirit of social division still remains. This book also shows the real reason why many never rise from the lower ranks to even the middle class, and why \\"rags to riches\\" is the exception and not the rule.

Paulo Coelho's stories make me proud and contented I have followed my dreams, and inspire me to reach for even more. This is a great book...don't recommend for your first Coelho read though. Try Warrior of the Light or The Alchecmist. Don't miss the epilogue of this book."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This is a thin book, written for adults. Nevertheless my children and I sat each night and read each chapter dissecting it to discover the true meaning which led to indepth discussions. Paulo Coelho is a favored writer ever since reading his book The Alchemist (another great work).When you are searching for inspiration, you don't need to look much further than these 200 some-odd pages. Read and be fulfilled on an inner level which you may not have been familiar before now."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"After reading this book, I went ahead and purchased The Alchemist. I can't get enough of his books. They are eye-opening and moving. Great reads and I wish I had known about this author earlier. I'm currently reading By the River Piedra I wept... and have 2 other of his novels waiting on hand. You won't be disappointed. He's a phenomenal writer."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"I give this book four stars out of my appreciation for Coehlo's body of work, although this was not one of his best. It can't compare to The Zahir, Veronika Decides to Die, Eleven Minutes or The Fifth Mountain. But I still read most everything Paolo writes out of fascination with this author's oeuvre. I no longer view his spiritual philosophy as enlightening, and can see its flaws and peculiarities, but I read him because few writers integrate spirituality with story in the way he does, and I am always fascinated with how he weaves a tale. I read this book more to understand the man than because I was enjoying or getting much out of the story. Also, I'm not sure how much truth there was to any of it, despite his claims -- girl biker gangs? Really."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Personally, the theme of the this book was too overwhelming for me to to consider factors like the literary style and genre of the book.I read the Alchemist and thought it was great and inspirational and thought provoking, hence I went on to read By the River Piedra I sat down and wept (which was rather bad, in my opinion) and decided to give The Valkyries a chance too.I was frightened upon reading the book. I feel that somewhere along the way Paulo and the ladies he met in the book have got their idea of spirituality and religion wrong, and it seems to me that the powers they are invoking are rather dubiously from the God of love.In addition, I find it rather difficult to take The Valkyries seriously when they travel around the dessert clad in leather, sleeping around with whoever they want to, and on motorbikes. Religion is a serious and scared thing, not meant to be belittled by such garish acts.The book is informative of alternative impressions and opinions on religion, but don't read it if you are going to be influenced by the ideas and upon completion, decide to find your own personal angel via Coelho's methods because they really seem to be on the threshold of dabbling with spirits and forces that are dangerous and not necessarily from God."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"The Valkyries is a metaphysical tale, very much in the spirit of James Redfield, only this epic tale is authentic.This is Paulo Coelho's astonishing true story of his encounter with darkness, his search for the light, and the seeking of his personal angel. He chronicles his journey from Brazil, with his wife Chris, and their 40-day sojourn in the Mojave Desert, seeking the Valkyries. The Valkyries were rumored to be able to speak and to see their angels. Having fought a battle with darkness, Paulo has redeemed his life and is a seeker of the light. Paulo was also told that \\"people wind up killing what they love most\\" as he seeks to rectify certain, if not all, areas of his life.This book is journey of faith, of trust, of forgiveness, of love, of self-discovery, and of battling the darkness within ourselves, and wanting to change. As Paulo states, \\"Faith is a different conquest, and it requires daily combat in order to maintained.\\" His faith is tested to the very end, as he seeks contact with his angels. His journey within transforms him as well as transforming his wife at the same time. Their two soul journeys will inspire you.\\"We are responsible for everything that happens in this world. We are the warriors of the light. With the strength of our love and our will, we can change our destiny, as well as the destiny of many others.\\" In this age of angel sightings, angel occurrences are happening with intense frequency. It is as if God is sending his messengers with a message and that message if one of love. The stories being written give hope to those in need of hope and bring home the message that there is another way - love.\\"If on the other hand, we accept all that is wrong about us - and despite it, believe that we are desiring of a happy life - then we will have thrown open an immense window that will allow Love to enter. Little by little, our defects will disappear, because one who is happy can look at the world only with love - the force that regenerates everything that exists in the universe.\\"This is an amazing book, which will cause you to think and revaluate parts of your life. I read the book in one sitting and had to keep going with it till the very end. If you are on a spiritual journey or even on a transforming journey at this point in your life, this is one book that you will want to read. As Paulo says, \\"God is love, generosity and forgiveness; if we believe this, we will never allow our weakness to paralyze us.\\" I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"I have read other of Coehlo's books, ie the Alchemist, The Fifth Mountain and Brida, and I have foud the Valkyries, to be his best book! I couldn't put it down since I began reading it. It is so simple yet so deep! It is all so true, how Coehlo describes us destroying everything good that we have in our lives, because we are always too blind to see it. The most wonderful part is to realize that we must always choose love over anything else and that we must forgive others and ask for God's forgiveness. It is a book that helps you regain hope in life, love and God in this crazy world we are in now. With so much war, so much hatred, so much violence, so many killings, so much hunger! Well, we must believe in God's love and protection, believe in our guardian angel to guide us and to protect us always. And it is up to us to change this world!"},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This book really helped me to see how there are forces at work in our lives that we do not know about. Coelho has made me believe through this simple story that God is still present with us everyday, and active in our lives. He is not religiously pushy, however, like some writers in this genre. He leaves a lot of room for the reader to make his own interpretation of what is presented, broadening the prospective audience. This simple story of Coelho and his wife's quest renewed my faith in a lot of things. I had mixed thoughts about reading a religiously focused book when I picked up The Alchemist a few months ago, but the message therein really helped me put a lot of things into perspective, and Valkyries was no different."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"In this story, which is purported to be \\"true\\", the author and his wife journey to the California dessert so that he can see his guardian angel. Toward this end they journey from town to town with a horde of biker chicks, perform various meditations and pagan rituals, and generally work through their own issues.The story itself is interesting, but as a Christian I found the religious content disturbing. The author seems wrapped up in an occult-like and mystical form of Christianity that ironically seems to have left Christ out of the equation. Whereas Jesus advocated the banishment of the ego to bring our spirits into agreement with God's will, the type of Christianity we see here is all about self - pagan rituals, creating a feeling, and traveling to another continent to \\"see\\" an angel. I'm pretty liberal in my Christian theology, but at it's core Christ's message was one of loving God and loving each other. The Bible tells us that the signs of a Christ-based life are \\"Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control\\". But despite the fact that these characters are supposedly highly \\"spiritual\\", their lives, at least as they appear in this story, are instead characterized by anxiety, detachment, and underlying hostility amongst themselves.Furthermore, the author at one point deigns to cast aspersions about the spiritual slumber that the average person is in. I'm the first to admit that modern-day Christianity needs a good kick in the arse, - but (to use one of the lead characters, Valhalla as an example) I don't think leaving our spouses and children, becoming prostitutes, joining a biker gang, and performing odd pagan rituals is an improvement over the status quo.At the end of the book, the author tacks on a 2 or 3 page dissertation about Jesus and Love that seems strangely incongruent with the story that was just told.If you haven't read The Alchemist, read that instead of this book. If you have already read The Alchemist read it again instead of this book."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"There's a lot of wisdom and truth presented here in this book. The question is, will you or can you understand it? I admit that several places in the book, I would go back and have to reread something, and still not totally get it. But a little further and BAM! -This beautiful piece of writing would pop out and be clear as can be. I am thinking that what you get out of this book most likely depends on several things, like how open minded you are, where you are in your life and where you are spiritually. It's a metaphor people! (to those reviewers who didn't get it so they wrote negative things about it, which makes me think of how a lot of times we [some/most?] are quick to condemn that which we do not understand?) The things that you don't conciously understand, you most likely (hopefully anyway) sub-conciously get. Get it? - Course that may not be the case for all.Book club choice? This book would make for interesting group discussion between the right people, -an open minded group who's not so quick to judge by skimming the surface. I think open discussions about this could bring a lot of hidden meanings out in the open because for example, one part that I didn't get could be clear as a bell to somebody else.I loved this and am planning to read it again. And I feel sure that I'll probably read it several times throughout my life. That's the kind of book this is.So, if you read it and don't understand, maybe it's not the right time for you? So many times, I have been drawn to exactly the books I needed for what I was going thru at that time. This proved that to me, once again."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This is my first Coelho book that I have read recommended to me by a friend. It is a simple book to read, so you'll get done with it fast. Although it is not the best book I have read, it is without a doubt, the most inspiring book.This book is about Paulo trying to converse with his angel. He brings his wife, Chris, along so that he's not alone basically. But soon Chris starts getting more interested and wants to become more interactive, especially when Paulo discovers the Valkyries--women who ride on motorcycles and preach about angels. The Valkyries is just what Paulo needs because they are the ones that can help him see his angel.This is a book where you need an open mind. It is a book that a fifth grader can read, but perhaps not understand as well as a high schooler might. Either way, this book is good and I would recommend it to those with open minds and who are in need of something settling to read. A simple book, but not bad at all."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"The Valkyries is a personal account of Mr. and Mrs. Coelho's journey across the Mojave desert in California. Coelho is determined to seek the angels that are known to visit there, since he's already been advised by his teacher to do so. The only link that he depends upon is the Valkyries: a group of women that roam the desert on motorcycles and who may just have the answer to what Paulo is after. There are many surprises to unravel in the novel, and some passages will keep you thinking for a long time. The novel also expresses inner feelings and thoughts of the author and his central characters, including his wife. The personal accounts are strong and there are times when the suspense is hard to stand on!"},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This was my first book by Coelho and it was terrific! I've since read the Alchemist (his first) and The Pilgrimage. The Valkyries remain my favorite in what I found were interesting twists to the 'story'.

The poetic and passionate style is intense reading but worth it. There's almost a crescendo of activity in the middle of the book that leaves you compelled to read on. I think viewing the text &quot;holistically&quot; helps, and thinking about the metaphors will let you extract more from the book. It's not my favourite Coelho book but still, I have to admit it is beautifully written and full of hysterical passion. I would recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Great book at a great price!!!!

Loved it myself!"},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This is my favorite of Paulo Coelho's books...written just after \\"The Alchemist\\"The Alchemist(also highly recommended), it's wonderfully detailed with the author's personal quest for answers - the answers to his soul's most important questions.As he weaves his story while journeying to the desert in Arizona in search of The Valkyries, you'll find yourself learning some very important life lessons...- We destroy what we love most- We have an internal contract to not win when victory is possible- We always use the best weapons we have against ourselves- We're prisoners of our pastHow to overcome? Ah, that's the soul filling answer that Paulo describes ... as it relates to his own quest.If you're searching for your own answers, reading this book can only bring your closer to an understanding of who you are and how you hold yourself back from fulfilling your life purpose."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This is the first Coelho novel I've read. I had been meaning to pick up the Alchemist, but during a flight from Toronto to Seattle a friend on the plane loaned me this book. It is an easy read (I was done the book before we landed), but I think I may have gotten more out of it if I hadn't sped through it so quickly. The book is a mystical and spiritual journey of a man who heads into the Mojave desert with his wife in search of an answer - how does one talk to and see their gaurdian angel. Sounds weird - right? Well I thought so too. I kept changing my mind as to whether I thought this whole book was a bunch of gobley-gook to thinking that perhaps this could be real. I remember having the same mixed feelings while reading the Celestine Prophecy. But, I wasn't quite hooked by this book - after finishing the book, I can't say that it has had any sort of lasting effect on me that I've been told it has had on others. I'd like to think I read it with an open mind (which is definitely required) but, as I said before, perhaps I just sped through it too quickly not giving enough thought to some of the ideas being presented before me. So...do I think this is a Hokey Tale or a Spirtual Guide?....I think I'll need to read this book again to decide. All in all - this book is worth the read - read it and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This was the third book I read for Coelho, the first two being the Alchemist and on the River Piedra..., although this is a different one, I still enjoyed it. However, my personal view is that this book is not for anyone anytime, it is written more for persons who are indeed going through an intense self-searching phase. If you are coming out of a personal crisis or feel like you are entering such one in your life, this book can be a big help. Don't let all the talk of angels and mysticism put you off as this is Coelho's style and you can easily replace them as metaphors."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"As I finished The Valkyries I find myself more and more disillusioned with Paulo Coelho. As I learn more and more about the man behind the books, through his own books, I find I don't like what I see.He described it as The Hunter and The Farmer type people in Valkyries. It was in the words of his wife, but it was there. Thing is, even after seeing that reality in himself, I don't think he took the right message from it.He sees himself as The Hunter--going off storming across the country, across the world on this nobel quest. He's spent his life trying to be a priest (Jesuit?) and stopping, getting into Wicca, into Knights Templar (seeing them as holy when many others see a much darker side), into the Tradition. He walks across Spain, he goes into the American desert seeking enlightenment, he hangs with biker chicks on a \\"holy\\" mission. And he continues to feel that \\"living\\" is running around doing these ridiculous rituals, many of which are made up by him or these weird groups. You could stand back and see him in the same way we look at the Incas, making human sacrifices as part of their sacred rituals---it is bizarre, puerile and misguided.In short, he continues to confuse DOING with KNOWING. And to know, all you have to do is shut up, be quiet and realize what you already know. You don't have to run off anywhere to do it, you don't have to GO anywhere, you don't have to \\"fight the good fight\\"--there is no fight to be had, except within himself.The lesson of the Hunter, him, and the Farmer, his wife--was that they were attracted to each other because they both needed to assimilate some of the other in themselves. HE needed to stop hunting and just be. SHE needed sometimes to be open to experiencing that which is put in front of her. And all of it was really HIM not seeing the lesson in front of him.In Valkyries he kept indicating that Heaven (or his equivalent) would only be \\"open\\" for a certain time. And like many right now, he decided that only some of us, the enlightened few, would make it to the evolution of the planet, while the unenlightened masses would go through some sort of purging process.If you understand Light and that it exists for us to see, to feel, for ALL, you couldn't entertain any idea of Us and Them. THEY wouldn't leave anyone behind because they aren't learning lessons fast enough. Any scenario that makes an Us and Them means you haven't yet seen that we all come from One.On to his inability, unwillingness to deal with his own excessive appetites--for women, specifically, and probably for booze. He continues, through all the books, to acknowledge his own filandering, and then goes on to justify it in numerous ways. She doesn't really mind, they have an open marriage, guys are meant to \\"notice\\" other women, women and men are made to be attracted. He is always actively plotting the conquest of the next woman or women, falling \\"in love\\" with the woman of the moment. But somehow he still \\"loves\\" his wife in a special way and expects her to just accept that. He encourages his wife (and himself, of course)to sleep around, and never asked questions because he didn't want questions himself. The fact is, he has never come to terms with his own excessive appetites. These kind of issues block you from the Light, keep you from communication with spirit (Angels in his terminology)--but he hasn't yet really grasped that concept.I did disagree with his terminology, although I think we each get a life view from our society. I have noticed that those raised Hindu or Muslim or Catholic or Protestant--each have their own predisposition to believe in certain ways.But, with great pride in his knowledge, Coelho names off four kinds of beings. One is of spirits passed (who have incarnated). He blows them off as being basically unworthy because they're just \\"men\\" like he is. [Ah, yes, but these \\"men\\" have lived many, many lives, progressed perhaps to no more incarnations. Is their guidance worth nothing? Isn't that the majority of spirit guidance--those who were once carnate because they know the difficulties of being in body? Make sense to me, but he dismisses them as inferior knowledge.]Next he talks about Angels--his whole book (Valkyries) is about finding his, which is apparently like a Master Guide in my terminology. My understanding (and it can be as wrong as his) is that Angels have never incarnated. To me, those who have never incarnated might not be the best Guides. Then there were two other categories of beings--oh, Saints. What the....? Saints, who become saints only through a religion of some kind? Who were men also, maybe not even really good men, but maybe men who had influence in the church. And were the stories of a particular saint ever right?I do accept that people who pray to specific angels (Archangel Gabriel, Michael) might be contacting some spirit. But are they all communicating with the same Gabriel, Michael? It probably doesn't matter, but likely not.Just like William Buhlman talks about there being a virtually stable \\"thoughtform\\" in astral that is the Pearly Gates--literally, because so many people believe it and visualize it. But it is, nevertheless, a thoughtform also--not a \\"reality\\" (whatever that means).In earlier novels I was disturbed by the violent images in what he was doing. Why a Sword? What spiritual aspirant needs an instrument of war? He refers to it as war, as there being righteous wars (I strongly disagree here), that there was a justification for fighting one's enemies. He calls it \\"the good fight\\". It's more of the Hunter here--just an excuse to be active and not to be within his own soul, higher self. Had he spent more time there, these might have been real novels of discovery not Tipping at Windmills all over the world. And maybe I'm reading too much here, but these novels (Valkyries, Pilgrimage) might have been when he was still in search of power through magic, wicca--and not the White Witch kind of way.Coelho mentions that he \\"did\\" astral travel and he didn't find any passed souls, no higher spirits. Which says to me his energy, his own vibration was not high enough to get out of astral--an indication to him that he should work on those negative-inducing qualities that block out the Light for him.[Over the holidays I watched some movie about a guy with tinnitus (ringing in the ears). It is driving him crazy and his girlfriend finally plays the \\"complement\\" note to what he hears and it wipes out the sound. She says that there is a complementary color for every color (you can see that when you close your eyes), and there is a complement to every note. And that made me wonder if, as souls, we don't \\"see\\" the Light or feel the vibations around us are because we are putting out the negative complement ourselves, blocking ourselves from hearing or seeing. Just a mind detour.]The scene at the end of Valkyries was cr*p to me--the idea that he had to See his angel, and finally accepting military jets as the \\"sign\\". Now, he'd made the distinction earlier that spirit can work through other things--people, animals, and that one could just hear their Angels (but he'd made it clear that wasn't good enough for him. He wanted to See these beings.)But Coelho, lagging behind his wife, who already talked to her angel just by being herself, had to find a shortcut, a way out. His experience in the desert was no different from experiences any of the rest of us have when we feel spirit strongly through nature or whatever is in front of us. But he lies to himself, saying that he finally \\"saw\\" his Angel in the form of light and jets--so that he could end his adventure. Same with his Pilgrimage---he ended it prematurely and took a bus when because he couldn't find the sword.He admitted in the Valkyries that the song lyrics (and I think he implied even some of his earlier books) were written in pursuit of the Devil, of evil power--but that the public was so dumb, they followed him anyway. He happily took it to the bank and continued to write. So, in my mind, this is not the type of writer I want to emulate --or enrich. He doesn't deserve it. His impulses were wrong to begin with. It's one thing if someone is well-meaning but missing the mark. But to intentionally be pursuing evil, write about it and then profit from it--maybe explains why he is so apologetic about his owb success. He truly doesn't deserve it. There are far more honest and deserving voices out there."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Never have i read anything so bad, so stupidely constructed and so well received by amateurs.

Reason number one is because Paulo Coelho wrote it, and I became a fan of his work when I read &quot;The Alchemist.&quot; The second reason is because I first heard of the Valkyries on a televison show. I had hoped to sit down to a reading of immense enjoyment. I was disappointed.I believe in order to fully understand and enjoy &quot;The Valkyries&quot;, you must be on a different level of spiritual enlightment and be open to strange expressions of faith and of hope and of love. Paulo writes of his experiences in the Mojave Desert searching for his angel through first a young man and then leather wearing, biker running women. Will you find love, faith, and hope with these types of elements? I have no idea. For each person, I suppose it is different.For me this novel left unexplainable ideals. I wanted more of a description of the channeling, the rituals. What were they feeling? Describe what the second mind is in more detail. Is it the conscious, is it deeper, did I miss the description all together? I didn't find it fullfilling, and I was extremely disappointed.I will add this, the &quot;The Valkyries&quot; is a true story according to Paulo Coelho. He admits to adding two fictional details in his accounts, but overall it is a true story. If you like to read about soul searching journies, this will do it.Joy."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This is the worst book by this author that I've ever read. He apparently said everything he had to say in the Alchemist.

The story may not be for everyone, but for me, I was transformed. I've read it years ago, and looking back it's one of the books of most personal impact I've read. The story is beautiful, the message is beautiful, affecting, moving. It will give you a wonderfully new and exhilirating perspective on the meaningfulness of living. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Coelho's writing can only be described as Genuis. Hes a natural and will certainly touch your heart, mind, and soul. He inspired and motivated me with every word that he has written throughout the years. Word in a review cannot begin to describe the writing of this brilliant man. All of his books are highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"In this book coelho talks much more directly to his readres. If you are emerged in his world you will find this book as a friend relating his own experiences. if you are not into mistiques of this nature you will gather a lot of info about it. You may even go so far as to develope a more keen interest into this world. I can't call myself a believer yet I can say that after reading this book I would like to know more about the world that was presented here."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"It is not a book about angels, it is a book about a relationship. Please forget the angel stuff, and concentrate yourself in the way that Paulo Coelho describes his relationship with his wife. That's all about! And I don't understand why this book is not translated into Spanish!"},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Another stunning book by Cohelo. It ended with good taste and left me contemplating for days. I highly recommend this book to those who enjoy Cohelo's enchanting work."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"I have been told by many to read the ever-popular Coelho & picked up this book without knowing the others. It didn't matter. This sophmoric 9th grade homework essay was far from \\"a suspense novel\\" and even further from the angels in our lives. While I appreciate that this was a sort of memoir, the epilogue was much better than the entire preceding story, and if Paulo could have actually imbued his novel with those thoughts, ideas & story lines, well, it would have been a book to remember.Unfortunately for readers, like Dan Brown, just because it's popular doesn't make it good literature. But at least Brown knows how to carry a story. Just like Dan Brown, Coelho recklessly tosses in writerly fantasy, biblical quotes and half truths in order to give us a punishing God, devil worship, and a satanic ritual as he comes closer to experiencing the love of angels??It's unfortunate that this writer has such an influence as his 'transformation' from the 'dark side' however superficially treated will still have an impact on people who will equate Jesus, Mary, Angels and God as anything other than LOVE.Readers (and Coelho) who wish to know about angels and other New Age concepts would be better off picking up a copy of any of Deepak Chopra's books and, if you want a book that reveals one man's encounter with angels read Nick Bunick's The Messengers.The Messengers: A True Story of Angelic Presence and the Return to the Age of MiraclesWhile not great literature (although he doesn't pretend to be a writer like Coelho), Nick's story shows you can meet your angels without having to head to caves in the Arizona desert and commit sadistic acts.I wish Paulo and others who read this tome--good luck on your spiritual path, because if you start here, you will certainly need it."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Every page I read, I found myself shaking my head. Raising my eyebrows, tryingto speed read, hoping there woudl be some redeeming quality to this book. There was none. I was actually frustrated that I had wasted my time on this. He is no Salman Rushdie- but you might say that is because the book is in translation. Well that would be incorrect Milan Kundera's books are a case in point. So then I found myself trying to justify the lack of engaging narrative or believable characters in this quite frankly rather boring book by saying his style is different and very simple. Like in The Alchemist. But in that book- even though it had ideas that refer to certain esoteric philosophies- they were stated in simple terms and in a highly engaging narrative. I have no clue what Coelho was doign in this book. But thing i felt throughout this book was disbelief that he could write something like this. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This just may be my favorite book ever, and I read A LOT. I have read this book several times, and have given away at least 5 copies. I sold it from the shelves of my 'Angel Store' and my customers loved it too. Coelho writes with such a presence. He weaves the spritual story as the reader rides on the back of the words of the story. After writing this review, I think I will go and read it again. I think I just may be a Valkyrie. How about you?"},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This book was not easy for me to get through. You are being told that it is a true story but parts seem extremely hard to believe. Not that he isn't telling the truth but maybe it just wasn't being told in the best possible way for you to find it believable. Maybe there wasn't a message for me to get out of this book. And maybe there will be a message for you to get out of this book. Coelho's books are always sprinkled with messages. As a fan of his work I was compelled to read it. I may read it again in the future and who knows I might think it is the most brilliant book written."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"The problem begins with the categorization of this book. The back cover says that the book is fiction, yet the author repeatedly states that this is a true story in the prologue, epilogue, and everywhere in between. After this, the problems of the international bestselling author become even more dramatic.Setting himself as the main character, Coelho sets on a journey to find his angel. Making contact with an angel in itself is not a radical concept for a plot. However, equating Christianity to sorcery is downright blasphemous. The elaborate ceremonies described for summoning angels are in no way related to Christian doctrine. To contact his angel, Coelho seeks a motorcycle gang in the Mojave Desert called the Valkyries. It is possible that a motorcycle gang could be spiritually gifted. However, the idea that the Valkyries sleep with men to make money for their missionary work is appalling.Coelho lost my respect in this book the minute he suggested \\"the beast\\" was present on the cover of The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonley Hearts Club Band\\". How much more hokey and unoriginal could an author be in stealing an idea. While I enjoyed \\"The Alchemist\\", I felt betrayed after reading this book. A once promising author has lost his direction and now pedals weird concepts that resemble cults."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Coelho did it again, the book kept my interest from begining to end. He is a Master."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"After enjoying The Alchemist, I was extremely disappointed to read such a poor book. While the story is interesting, it is recounted with such cliche, that the story becomes 'cheesy'. I would not recommend this book to someone unless they have an absolute fascination in Paulo's life."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"The book is terrible, Paulo Coelho is Terrible and all of his books are terrible. He's only good in one thing: Writing stupid stuff and selling millions of books to people that think it's mistic, supernatural , etc, etc."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Coelho has really gone over the edge with this nonsense. Not one single incident is to be believed and instead of penetrating is funny. He either overdosed on drugs or alcohol or was hallucinating. I couldn't stop laughing at what I know was meant to be a very serious book. If Coelho believes this actually happened to him, he's in bad shape and can't be taken seriously. The promising author of Veronica Decides to Die is quickly deteriorating. How sad!"},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Although I consider The Alchemist as one of the best books I have ever read, Coelho's effort with The Valkyries disappoints me somewhat. The story of him and his wife Chris crossing the Californian desert in search of their individual angels is told in a truthful, heartfelt way. The story is beautifully told as only Paulo can.I appreciate the honesty and openness Paulo demonstrates by sharing his true story with us. I don't belong The Tradition, and don't profess to know its secrets. Fundamentally I disagree with Paulo in this book. The main point I do disagree with is that he states that only angels can show us the way to paradise, no one else can. I think if Paulo read the New Testament a bit more carefully, he would realise that this is not necessarily so. Angels are indeed real, they are messengers, they minister us, we do get angels of Death and Wrath, they fight for what is right, etc. Yet Paulo also mentions that in the kingdom of angels there is no good and evil. But, since they are fighting for us, how can this be true? Since angels fight in the spiritual world, there must be a good and evil side. There are a lot of basic truths that I agree with Paulo, and I think that those make the book worthwhile. Unfortunately it does not compare to the quality of The Alchemist. I found this a tedious read, even though I'm very fond of his writing."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"There are some great insights into the human condition, much like in The Alchemist, but this story is bizarre to the point where its bizarreness detracts from the message being conveyed.In The Alchemist the storyline served as a vehicle to convey deeper human truths, and these truths were the point of the book. In The Valkyries, the storyline itself seemed like the point. It seemed like Coelho wanted the world to know the weird magic/drugs/psychedelic jaunts he's been on; it's 187 pages ripped out of his personal journal with no real point. The deeper human truths felt like a literary afterthought.If you haven't read The Alchemist, read that first. This book would have spoiled me on the author. I'd give it a pass."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Me encantaria escribir mi critica en ingles, pero es muy malo, asi que espero que alguien pueda entenderme. Soy de Argentina y es la primera vez que veo este libro, no se si quiera si esta traducido al catellano, me gustaria saber si hay alguna traduccion.Con respecto a otros titulos de Coelho, les puedo decir que es uno de los mejores escritores que ha pasado por mis manos, El alquimista, La quinta monta&ntilde;a, El peregino de Compostela, son verdaderamente maravillosos, sinceramente creo que ademas de ser una lectura agradable dejan muchas lecciones de vida, si tienen la oportunidad se los recominedo, les aseguro que ademas de disfrutar de la lectura de un muy buen libro, aprenderan asombrosas lecciones de vida."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Unfortunately, I don't think this book is as great as The Alchemist or Veronica Decides to Die. In general, I am a great admirer of Paolo Coelho's work. I enjoy the simplicity of his style a lot and the topics he chooses for his novels. But while this book is interesting and challenging, it is too mystical for my taste.The book is even more fantasy oriented than the Alchemist, introducing us into an unbelievable world of angels and saints. Here, the author sets himself on a journey to see and talk to his guardian angel. He is accompanied by his wife, who balances Paolo's faith, as she is skeptical about her husband's practices and faiths.We are introduced into an occult world, a context full of mystical rituals, some of them quite frightening. In the Mojave Desert, Paolo meets the Valkyries, a band of bold women dressed in leather riding on motorbikes, who spread the word of angels.Despite the many unbelievable experiences which give you the feeling that the book is only for the &quot;initiated ones&quot;. I still believe it is enchanting; a lot of this charm comes from the fact that is it very personal.I recommend this book only to the very mystical personalities."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"There were times while I was reading this book that the things he wrote spoke to things that I had felt so well that I started underlining them. Other parts I was so confused and really disturbed by the things that were written (and in a way that condoned the same) that I really wished I had never started reading.It talks in depth about making a pact with yourself to fail when success is within reach. I see that in myself. Not so much a fear of failure but a lot of fear of success too. So I liked hearing that idea mentioned. The struggle to feel at peace with what you have achieved or to feel at peace with achievement in general.At one point a group that he is traveling with \\"the valkyries\\" starts up a sidewalk show where they are preaching to passersby telling them to be true to their hearts and follow their dreams. Some of the people object that they have obligations and families that tethered them to the lives that they were living. One of the characters \\"Valhalla\\" says that family never kept anyone from living their dream. As I read that I thought \\"wow that's awesome, we shouldn't just sit back and excuse ourselves from doing what we love because we have obligations. We should do them anyway, even especially because of our families. kinda like \\"Set the example for those we love\\" that we can still follow our hearts even when our hearts are knit together with those around us. Like \\"hey don't puss out and live a wo-is-me life cause you got \\"bogged down\\" with responsibilities. Find a happy medium or just recognize that your family should feel like your great work and highest achievement.Then further on in the reading it is revealed that the same character \\"followed her heart\\" by abandoning her husband and two children to sleep with high rollers at casinos for money to support her biker gang. So.... yeah I guess i felt like either I wasn't getting the message or the message was just a bunch of \\"if it feels good do it\\" B.S. \\"Take no thought for how your actions will affect those around you in the end your only really responsible for yourself\\".Honestly after reading the Alchemist I was excited to read this but if this is really the way the author feels then I feel sorry for him. He's not only confused but he's propagating that confusion to millions. It's like mixing 75% awesomeness with 25% dog S#!+ and expecting the people eating to just smile and wolf it down like gravy train."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"I wouldn't suggest this book, but it could be just where I am at on my path in life. I did not find it particularly interesting or inspiring. I kept reading though hoping it was going to get better.One interesting part to me though from the perspective that it was based on events from his actual life supposedly, kind of scary actually, he was into..I will call it the \\"dark side\\" of things before coming over to the \\"other side\\" and it tells about his experience and how it led to his path to the good side. Otherwise I did not get much from the book.Oh the most positive thing I took from the book which I never thought about before is when you look up and towards the horizon it changes your view of everything vs looking slightly down or straight ahead......I guess that applies literally and figuratively also as in positive uplifting thoughts vs negative thoughts."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"The Valkyries continues Paulo Coelho's series of books on self-discovery, spiritual questing, love and relationships. It is the largely autobiographical account of Coelho's quest to speak to and see his guardian angel - as facilitated by both his wife and a mysterious group of motorcycle riding women known as the Valkyries.The path to self discovery takes Coelho through both light and darkness, and forces him to confront his own demons as well as angels. Only through self awareness, self-understanding, accepting forgiveness, breacking a pact and making a bet is he able to finally achieve his quest. The common theme of balance, unity, love and acceptance is ever present in the book, as are the threads of esotericism and the occult that really weren't in the Alchemist, but are very evident here.A good, entertaining and enlightening read."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"I have been enjoying the writing of Paulo Coelho for only a short time but I have become addicted to his writing. It is so in depth, exploring the deepest spiritual conflicts of the characters. His writing is a refreshing change from popular fiction. In my estimation, it is \\"timeless\\".In this novel Paul wants to see his Angel. He takes his wife Chris along for the journey and discovers that his search cannot be completed unless he helps her discover and speak to her angel. Their journey and their marriage are both complicated and strengthened when they meet the Valkyries in the desert. The story is a real \\"page turner\\"."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"First of all, I must say this is the first of Coelho's books I've read. I found it to be enlightening, though not extremely action-packed, which is much more of my genre. This book maps out a spiritual journey taken by a man and his wife, and goes into detail about significant changes that have been made in their life.However, I have a problem with the numerous people criticizing Coelho's literary work on the grounds that it doesn't conform with their ideas of spirituality. I'm sure this was not written to be an accompaniment to the Bible, or a religious guide. If an author wants to express his ideas of spirituality, he should be entitled to do so without getting poor reviews just because the reviewers believe his ideas are WRONG.I personally thought this book was very thought-inducing. It gave you a lot to contemplate, and if you pause to consider how it relates to your life, you might be pleasantly surprised. I recommend it to anyone who would like to learn about , and possibly analyze, other perspectives to spirituality."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"I found Paulo Coelho's The Valkyries a bit of an enigma. I suspect the author at least partly intended it to be so. In a nutshell, the author seeks to discover new aspects of his psyche, to develop new angles on his existing skills. After a consultation with his mentor, he and his wife set off for a jaunt in the Mojave Desert to find what it is that they seek. Our author is in engaged in a quest, a search for his personal Angel. The reader, I am sure, will be convinced from the start that she accompanied him throughout.They wander off in full sun one day, take their clothes off (for some reason) and have to be rescued by Gene, who has seen it all before. He reassures the travellers that they will find their valkyries. And they do. They turn out to be a band of leather-clad women on motorbikes, ladies who have profound mystic powers which they practise amidst their regular partying.I was a bit perplexed by the narrator who claimed to have trained as an engineer in one breath and then discussed the existence of the universe in terms of ancient Greek elements. I suspect that the high performance motorbikes relied on a rather more complex analysis of matter. But honing the skills of a magus apparently requires the application of ancient knowledge, no matter how wrong, whatever the context. And sure enough the revelations come flooding in and lives are duly transformed. I have just a suspicion that there is something in the observation that no matter what one does with reality, spirituality is necessarily a personal experience, its significance purely internal, even when shared with others.The Valkyries has all the Paulo Coelho elements. There are short scenes presented in a variety of literary shorthand. The text is suffused with magic, religiosity and self-realisation set in an earthly medium. It's a quick and easy read but ultimately a satisfying one, even for someone like myself, who cannot suspend belief long enough to share in the book's experiences.But Paulo Coelho is a magus and a magician of the highest order. He has sold over 90 million books and, as a writer myself, I will read more of his books in the hope that I might discover his magus touch, his waft of a wand that will reveal his secret. Even without sympathy for the detail, it's a lovely, rhythmic read."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"This novel is so different from the Alchemist or the Pilgrimage. I would skip this if you are going down the list of Coelho's writings."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"As usual with Coelho's books, I felt a little lost when reading this. I suppose this is because he writes about the mysteries of life and I can't predict where his journey will take me.I'd say more about this book but I'd be addressing the plot and not the intent. I think this book can only be evaluated by each person's individual experience."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"Who knew Valkyries were such bores? I was expecting another great story with a great message such as \\"The Alchemist\\" but I think that book may have been Coelho's one hit wonder. This one was rambling, whiney, self-absorbed and way too full of itself."},{"Title":"The Valkyries","review":"After being so well-fed by Coehlo's THE ALCHEMIST, I hungrily read THE VALKYRIES.

Who else could make Californa's beautiful Borrego Springs Desert seem bland and boring? The prose is so spare, we don't really experience the story as we should. It reads like some children's stories, full of wonder, empty of details.

Two years later, I find out about it. In racing circles, it should be noted, a marital divorce is when each spouse succeeds in placing the other back into the claiming ranks.)The story of the long-shot Cash Run beating Chilukki (Breeders' Cup 1999) is also detailed, as are my own margin notes about my ill-advised $10 exacta boxes at Saratoga in 2000 - which preceded the fantastic inspiration that Cash Run \\"can't do worse than 2nd\\" (in a four-horse field, he ran 4th. There is also some nice personal racing memorabilia etc. taped into the book, including the amazing evidence that at Belmont Park in 2001, I uncharacteristically managed not to screw up cashing a 1/3/6/7 triple).Post Note: I write reviews before reading those written by others. So my vehement objection to the book lacking an index existed prior to noticing that \\"Eric S.\\" & I both think it is insane that the publisher saved about $193.69 by eliminating the cost of creating an index.Great books get five stars; good ones, four.

For one thing, the author is an award-winning sportswriter for the \\"New York Times.\\" For another, he is a dedicated horse-player---Damon Runyon; bettin' on da gee-gees; bookies; \\"The Daily Racing Form\\"---that sort of scene. Finally and perhaps most importantly, he owned and raced a Quarter Horse named Oh Desperado, who turned out to be a whiz at dressage.Joe Drape begins his story in June, 1999 when the big, beautiful Charismatic, a former claiming horse fractured his foreleg in the Belmont, just seconds away from becoming the first Thoroughbred in twenty-one years to win the Triple Crown. The book ends with Tiznow's victory in the 2000 Breeder's Cup Classic and the death of his eighty-three-year-old owner, Cecilia Straub-Rubens, three days later.In between, Thoroughbred owners \\"spent $510,834,975 on 8,779 yearlings at auctions in the United States in hopes that one of them was the right horse for the 2002 Triple Crown.\\"The author writes primarily of the owners and trainers, by turns foolish, determined, and hopeful, and some of whom were real S.O.B.s. One of the prominent players is the trainer D. Wayne Lucas, who won the first two races in the Triple Crown in 1999, and then won the third leg in 2000. He is also one of the aforementioned S.O.B.s---one might even call him the Patton of Thoroughbred training. I finished this book with a tremendous admiration (although not liking) for Lucas, especially for winning the 2000 Belmont with a mediocre horse and sheer tactical brilliance. The author is still kicking himself for not betting on Lucas's horse in that race. It would have been his fifth winner on a Pick-Six ticket.\\"The Race for the Triple Crown\\" is rich in the detail of what it takes to purchase a Thoroughbred at auction (lots of money, lots of testosterone, and lots of research). It portrays the agony and ecstasy of owning, training, and riding a potential Triple Crown horse. Here is the true story of the relationship between D. Wayne Lucas and Charismatic's jockey, Chris Antley. Here's what it feels like to try and outbid a Maktoum at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale. Here are the reasons why you shouldn't plan a celebratory dinner in advance of a Thoroughbred race. Here is Bob Baffert, \\"intoning, \`Houston, we got a problem' into the microphone at the 1996 Preakness when his horse Cavonnier was on his way to a fourth-place finish.\\"This is an absolutely riveting story for readers who are already somewhat familiar with Thoroughbred racing. I loved it. However, I disagree with the cover blurb that says it is \\"a delight for both aficionado and novice.\\" If you're looking for a starter book on Thoroughbred racing, try \\"Secretariat: The Making of a Champion\\" by William Nack, or \\"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\\" by Laura Hillenbrand. \\"The Race for the Triple Crown\\" has so much insider detail that a newcomer to racing might become totally confused if he or she doesn't already recognize some of the players, e.g. Pat Day, More Than Ready, Sheik Maktoum bin Rashid al-Maktoum, Jenine Sahadi, and The Deputy (for starters)."},{"Title":"The Race for the Triple Crown","review":"About two thirds of way through this book I just gave up and skimmed the rest. This book is filled with page after page of names - names of horses, owners, jockeys, trainers, and others. There are so many names that it's impossible to keep track of them all (one of the major deficiencies of the book is the lack of an index; with this many people and horses, plus the way that Drape jumps around from subject to subject in an almost random manner at times, an index is an absolute necessity). What's really lacking from the book is any kind of excitement. Drape has managed to take something that I thought was inherently exciting and make it as dry as dirt. I think it was about page 180 (out of 261) before he even gave a play-by-play of an actual horse race!I had just come from reading Laura Hillenbrand's &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; so I was very much looking forward to this book, especially gven Hillenbrand's own glowing review right here. The Race for the Triple Crown thus stands as a huge disappointment for me. Drape is, after all, a newspaper sportswriter, and this book is written just like it's one long newspaper column. It's all one note - informational - with no attempt to generate any kind of feeling behind its words. If what you're interested in is a detailed description of the people and horses involved in the 1999-2000 thoroughbred season then this book is what you want. But if you want something that's a good *story* and that gives you the excitement of horse racing, you won't find it here."},{"Title":"The Race for the Triple Crown","review":"Racing fans have heard it many times before...There have been only eleven winners of the Triple Crown. Sir Barton was the first in 1919 and Affirmed, the last, in 1978. Eddie Arcaro won two Triple Crowns, one on Whirlaway in 1941 and then on Citation in 1948. There was a drought of twenty-five years between Citation's sweep and the coming of Secretariat in 73'. Secretariat is moving like a tremendous machine... So that's an overview of racing's classics. Now for something meatier...Thank you Joe Drape! Finally someone has gone beyond the legendary telling of this story and put it under a microscope. Drape's portrait of the Triple Crown is like a Robert Altman film with people and horses, owners, trainers, jockeys, everyone weaving in and out in search of victory, or at least a ticket to Louisville. The book goes happily beyond the soundbytes of trainers like Neil Drysdale and Todd Pletcher and delivers us a story that is intense, hopeful, sometimes funny, sometimes disappointing, but always interesting."},{"Title":"The Race for the Triple Crown","review":"Joe Drape takes the reader to the top of the horse racing field with clarity and tight prose worthy of a master storyteller.Insightful behind the scenes coverage makes you often forget that is a true story about the fight to win the run for the roses and the glory that is the Triple Crown.Drape covers all that and more in this gripping read. A true delight."},{"Title":"The Race for the Triple Crown","review":"Drape took on the task that all of us outside the world of racing should be grateful, that is, giving us an inside look at the horses and connections that take a 2 year old colt from Derby wannabe to Triple Crown contender. What I found disappointing was the lack of detail in the races themselves. Drape sufficiently builds up the Derby and details the race, but the other prep races, Preakness and Belmont are slighted. I guess I am used to William Nack's detailed descriptions of Secretariat's races. You won't learn anything new about Lukas or Baffert here that you haven't already read. You will at least learn a little about Todd Pletcher, Neil Drysdale and Jenine Sahadi."},{"Title":"The Race for the Triple Crown","review":"Forget Seabiscuit. This is the racing book of 2001.

However, as a previous reviewer posted, this book was like a giant list of names. Name after name after name appeared, it could confuse even an expert at horse racing, which I do not claim to be. Overall, an average book, though it depicts the connections of each horse quite well."},{"Title":"The Race for the Triple Crown","review":"This is a great book.

The main problem is that there is no continuity. The author jumps around from character to character, story to story, with no way of knowing how (or if) anything is connected to anything else. The behind-the-scenes gossip and backgrounds of the major players in Thoroughbred racing was interesting, and the writing was smooth and graceful, but I became more and more frustrated the more I read. Maybe the audience best served by this book is made up of people who like horses but only read during five minute bathroom visits."},{"Title":"Taken Liberty","review":"\\"Taken Liberty\\" is the impressive and thoroughly enjoyable first novel by author Steve Wilson. In a style reminiscent of early Heinlein, it blends technology and characterization in a fascinating story that tackles such diverse themes as sexuality, spirituality, genetic manipulation, slavery and bigotry in a novel with characters it's a pleasure to get to know.The central protagonist, a girl barely out of her teens, was raised as a sexual predator and pleasure slave on a planet where such practices are allowed and which are overlooked by the more enlightened races in the galaxy. She managed to escape, joined the intergalactic navy, and has risen to a position of authority on the fleet's flagship, Titan. When her past is uncovered, she and her friends and the ship's captain must prevent her from being returned to her homeworld and captivity. The characters are richly drawn and finely developed and include a not-so-androgynous telepath, a much-maligned Terran, and a Wiccan doctor who heals the soul as well as the body.While this is a first novel, the author is no \\"stranger in a strange land.\\" He is the latest product from that great training school of fan fiction, and he has also written about 13 radio plays which feature the same set of characters put forth in this novel. Some of the plays have been recorded on CD (available from the author) or performed as podcasts or at conventions as productions of Prometheus Radio Theatre. Familiarity with the earlier works is not essential, however, to enoying this novel.While many of the characters are young, this is definitely not a book for children. The writing is sexually explicit and the themes are mature and profound. It's an admixture of social commentary, philosphy, and technology, which is what all good science fiction should be.I look forward to more from this author, and predict that he has a bright future"},{"Title":"Taken Liberty","review":"The first novel in what I hope will be an ongoing series, Steve Wilson has taken the characters from his successful audio theatre series \\"The Arbiter Chronicles\\" and given us some ofthe background story we've craved.

Her ignorance sometimes causes her needlessly to speculate about well-known facts (such as the physical characteristics of the NOI founder, W. D. Fard, whose huge portrait has graced many of the movement's public events). She repeats old mistakes (that Farrakhan was expected to succeed Elijah Muhammad, that Malcolm X was more powerful than Elijah Muhammad) and initiates new ones (Farrakhan never mentions in speeches the old NOI goal of a separate black state, that the NOI does not follow up on its threats of violence).Despite these shaky underpinnings, Levinsohn does offer insights to help decipher Farrakhan, showing the role of his family's West Indies background and explaining the &quot;aura of madness&quot; that surrounds him. She calls him &quot;the most influential man in the black world&quot; but also &quot;one of the shrewdest opportunists in recent history,&quot; someone who &quot;doesn't care&quot; about such issues as job training and the problems of the black poor.

A must have for everyone that want to understand everything in the Bible."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was a typical Jane Austen love story and a well-written piece. I actually found it quite quick. My only gripe is that this story (compared to \\"Mansfield Park\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope. I was slightly shocked to see the motives behind two of the characters. It was a good read but it did feel a little incomplete."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen's novels are characterized by their limited plot and their freedom from deep philosophical musings, complicated image patterns and symbolism. As a result the reader is presented with a skilfully crafted novel in which setting, character delineation, acute observation of social interaction, accuracy and realism are all very important. The early novels were characterized by the use of irony, humour and satire. These are much less evident in Persuasion, as Austen seemed more concerned with the sympathetic and sensitive expoloration of her heroine's character and situation. Persuasion is a simply structured novel, for its plot is concerned only with bringing Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth together. A major theme of the novel is Austen's examination of pride and vanity - pride in one's social position and vanity of one's personal appearance. The idea of persuadability is tied up with another major concern of the novel - the right quality of mind. As the novel develops, Austen strives to achieve a right balance between contrasting opposites. I started to read the book reluctantly (as it was for school); but when I was familiar with the characters and the language, it was very enjoyable. If you have ever been in love, or thought yourself to be, or even had a crush on someone; you will identify with Anne Elliot's behaviour when she is around Captain Wentworth. It was amazing how real the characters came to be, and the events which occured can be compared of those today. I recommend the book to anyone with an interest in love stories. It was the first Austen book I have read, and it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"To be absolutely truthful, Anne Elliot may be too \\"nice\\" for you to find her as enjoyable as Emma Woodhouse or Elizabeth Bennett. Don't let that put you off however, this production was a joy! Persuasion is thoughtful and mature, and beautifully brought to life by Juliette Stevenson's reading. Her delightfully modulated voice, switches with ease between characters: she really shines as Anne's annoying sister Mary, you find yourself wishing for more of her! Male characters are believable as men - really, each character is rendered with admirable distinctness and individuality. Naxos' technical recording is of excellent quality as usual, seamless between takes. Jane Austen's keen insight into people's motives and character is piercing as always and her wit at society's expense is as apt today as 200 years ago. I have thoroughly enjoyed this recording and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's *Persuasion* was her last book before she suddenly, unfairly died, and it is profoundly different than her earlier works.In this book, Anne Elliot, the protagonist, is past the bloom of her youth, all of 27 years old. She gave up the love of her live, Captain Wentworth, when she was twenty because she was persuaded that he was not socially a proper match for her. Considering the vast importance of a proper match, or a good match, in Jane's earlier works (such as *Pride & Prejudice* in which Lizzy Bennet, who is essentially penniless and perhaps soon to lose her home, makes the ultimate \\"good match\\" in which she marries Pemberly, er, Mr. Darcy) it is interesting in this book how Jane examines the results of declining a socially and economically imprudent match. Anne Elliot's life is blighted when she gives up love merely because Wentworth is not enough for her. She becomes an old maid. This book is an admonition to the flighty young girls who sought \\"good matches\\" at the expense of love. It's a grown-up's book.*Persuasion* also funny as all heck. That first sentence, \\"SIR WALTER ELLIOT, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs, changed naturally into pity and contempt,\\" is a damning statement about people who don't read good literature, but only read books of mere facts, like the Peerage. Anne's older sister is just as daft and great for an eye-rolling laugh.TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have read all of Austen's novels except Northanger Abbey, and I found this one to be in the top three, along with EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (my personal favorite). This book is very unique compared to her other masterpieces.Let's begin with a summary. Anne Elliot fears life as an \\"old maid\\" as she reaches the age where most women during the pre-Victorian era are supposed to be married. She regrets not marrying the one man she truly loved, Captain Wentworth. At the time, he was not considered suitable. Now almost seven years later, Wentworth returns, having made his fortune and is now considered a fair prospect. Now every girl is fawning over the strong, sea worn Captain Wentworth. Emotions Anne thought she could never feel again overpower her. Despite her attempts to control her emotions, she realizes that there is no man she could even consider marrying over him. The question now is does he feel the same way? This is a page turning novel that you just keep reading wondering if Anne and Wentworth will ever get it together.I found this novel so different in a good way for many reasons. First, there really isn't any fair leading lady or dashing young man. Anne Elliot, I believe, is Austen's most realistic character. Don't get me wrong EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE fans, I love Emma and Elizabeth and admire them for all their characteristics. However, I find myself wishing I was them rather than relating to them. I loved how Anne was quiet, but beautiful and witty at the same time. She also is very proper and doesn't really know how to compose herself in front of the man she loves. She is too influenced by what other people think, like many of us. I personally loved reading about a character who I myself can relate to in many ways. Yes, Anne is flawed but she's real.Second is the eternal question that haunts us all when crossed in love....does he feel the same way? Austen was an early psychologist of her time and really understands human behavior. I loved how Anne (and Wentworth as we find out in the end) really is fearful of getting hurt and really doesn't know what to do with herself. It's just so real and life like and I guess she gets lucky because of the ticking clock with Wentworth, but I believe it provided hope for those during Austen's time and now who are faced with the same problem. I loved how Austen wrote about this which I think really kept me reading the book.Well, I could spend all day talking about this book, but basically I'm saying read it, it's not quite as long and detailed as Austen's other works but strong at the same time. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Many would have Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; determine her status as one of the greatest of all novelists; however, this critic will always stand by the quiet and profound maturity that defines this lovely masterpiece &quot;Persuasion.&quot; Here the characters are all terribly human and flawed and the narrative so touching without ever resorting to maudlin prose. There is an underlying sadness in this book which tells the reader that at some point in her life, Jane Austen loved deeply. This book is a celebration of that love; indeed, she would not have felt comfortable mourning it before her family or her readers. Therefore, instead of indulging in self-pity, Austen gratifies the soul by telling the story of one woman who refuses to sacrife her integrity and &quot;secures&quot; the man she loves in her way and in her time. This is more than a great read; it is truly a magnificent work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"8 years has passed since the break up of Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth. Because of Frederick's lack of fortune and connections at the time, Anne was persuaded to reject his proposal. Now, he's back into town, with a fortune amassed at sea and still single. The feelings that were never quenched on Anne's side, are burning stronger than ever. And it has been turned upside down with (now) Captain Wentworth's renewed presence. Sure, she still wants him. But she's not sure if he does! Especially with the Musgrove sisters now in the picture. Not that she's lacking for suitors, but they just pale in comparison with Capt. W!What a classic. Jane Austen, 200 years ago had the romance and chemistry right. Even for an ordinary girl like Anne who had let love pass by her once! Oh the suspense. You didn't know which Musgrove sisters Captain W was going to choose... let alone be sure if he even harbored any feelings for Anne! Or was Anne going to fall for the smooth and suave Mr. Elliot, her cousin? But all the waiting was worth it. Oh, the letter that he writes to Anne at the end is so worth it! I think the romance between Anne and Capt. Wentworth rivals any of the contemporary romance stories."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austenites such as myself dive in most willingly and blissfully into her stories. We bask in the sway of waves bearing her lively pitch, her precise and playful interaction with the language - and we bemusedly acknowledge that such magic has never even yet come close to being rejuvenated by anyone, despite so many attempts made within the some 200 years since her novels were written.PERSUASION quaintly commences on a quiet country estate in Regency England, and on a fanciful whim journeys on through to the seaside resort of Lyme, thence onward through the social promenade of Bath. The story follows Anne Elliot, daughter of snobby baronet, Sir Walter Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter, in between older sister Elizabeth, the apple of her father's eye, and married younger sister, Mary Musgrove. Jane Austen makes very good use of her exquisite wit in the depictions of shallow, haughty Elizabeth and selfish, frivolous Mary.Anne, however, is cut from a different cloth. Having fallen in love at age 19 or 20 with a handsome young man of no fortune, Anne denies her passion for what she sees as her duty and breaks her engagement with Frederick Wentworth - after, of course, some persuasion from Lady Russell, a friend of her late mother. Then, some eight years later, after Anne has apparently lost her youthful bloom, Captain Wentworth returns - still very handsome, and now quite rich after having made his fortune in the Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.As Captain Wentworth brandishes warm, flirtatious attention upon the young, lively Musgrove sisters, Louisa and Henrietta, sisters of Mary's husband Charles, Anne silently harbours the certainty that her deep affection and love for Wentworth had never faded despite all those years apart from him, and that his aloofness bears witness that his feelings for her have forever disappeared. She all the while keeps those pangs of loss and regret subdued, and stays steadfast in her knowledge of what is right and what is good in the complex modes of interaction with others. After her father's frivolity with money has necessitated moving his family to Bath and leasing out his estate, Kellynch hall, Anne must search for her place in the world.Although PERSUASION may not be the wittiest, nor the liveliest, nor the brightest or most luminous of the six novels written by Jane Austen, one cannot deny that it is perhaps the most moving. Our heroine's allure takes the reader gently into that era of innocent romance, that beautiful country where sometimes what once had been lost might inexplicitly, almost magically, be found...if sought."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"&quot;Persuasion&quot; was Jane Austen's last novel, and the more sober and pensive quality of the book, as compared to some of her earlier works, most notably &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, reflects her maturity both in age and as a writer; no one in their early 20's could have written this book. The heroine of &quot;Persuasion&quot; is Anne Elliot, seven years after she rejected, at her family's insistence, the young man she had fallen in love with at 19, when he was just starting a naval career and was too poor, in the eyes of her pretentious relatives, to be considered acceptable marriage material. Now he has returned, financially secure and promoted to captain, and she finds herself still in love with him. Without giving away the rest of the plot, the book gives a powerful argument for following one's heart instead of the prejudices and snobbisms of society. Anne does not have the same appeal to many modern readers as Elizabeth Bennet; she is more shy, retiring and reflective. But as the book progresses and she finds the strength to act on her feelings, she grows in personality and character. This final work by one of the greatest writers (and my personal favorite) in the English language is a lasting testimony to her incredible talents as a novelist."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the last novel that Jane Austen finished before she died.

Captain Wentworth comes back eight yers later, successful and rich looking for a wife. Jane Austen weaves her magin threads and the story unfolds with unforgettable characters and final union of two people who had loved each other all these years inspite of social prejudice and class difference.Of all leading men in her books, Captain Wentworth is the most dashing man with his good looks, intelligence and fearlessness of a strong man who knows his own value inspite of social injustice.This is the kind of book to read over and over again. and every time you read, Jane Austen will take you to the charming regency time in Bath."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"While more expensive versions may have slightly better readers this version was overall a great value."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In my opinion, this is Jane Austen's greatest book. Anne Elliot is a beautifully written character, and Austen subtly conveys her strength of mind and depth of emotion with the best of her skills. Many critics have declared that Austen's greatest talent was creating characters that stay in character without getting stagnant, and I think this novel is the best showcase for that talent. Though often not as comical as some of her other works, this novel is a beautiful portrait of hopeless lovers, and the dialogue (always done well by Austen) is superb. What makes this novel stand-out in my mind, is that though it includes somewhat less of the social satire than her other books (though it is of course still present), it creates a very honest portrait of family relations and how filial duty can not always inspire love, even in the best-mannered of individuals.For those wondering what exactly makes Austen a truly classic author, and not just a fun feminine writer, I suggest a close reading of Persuasion."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although Persuasion is generally overshadowed by Jane Austen's more well-known novel, Pride and Prejudice, this is a beautifully written, poignant love story about the strength and endurance of love. Anne receives a proposal she very much wants to accept but is discouraged by a friend of the family who is advising her in the place of Anne's deceased mother. Anne listens, breaks off the relationship, and then regrets her decision. She turns down at least one other proposal that we know of (Charles, who later marries her sister) because she still hasn't gotten over her love for Wentworth. Through a series of coincidences, Anne meets her beau again eight years later and the spark is still there although they both try to keep their feelings hidden. They finally acknowledge their love for each other and ignore the protests of friends and family who would keep them apart. There's a very interesting discussion between the characters in the book about who keeps love alive the longest in the absence of the one they love -- men or women. If you haven't tried this one yet, I think you'll find it very satisfying."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persusion is the story of Anne Elliot, a girl trapped in a classic example of listening to bad advice.Anne falls for the charming Captain Wentworth, and after many sunny days spent toghether, the couple decides to marry.When Anne tells this to her dear and only friend, Lady Russell, she is informed that he is too poor and far below her status as a daughter of a baronet. After succumbing to Lady Russell's persuasion, a broken-hearted Anne ends the engagement. The miserable pair then goes their separate ways.Eight years later, the Elliots are struggling for money and decide to lease their house and move to Bath,leaving Anne with her sister Mary. Who should be their new tenant, but Cpt. Wentworth's brother. Anne and Wenworth are soon thrown together again. This begins a journey of reconciliation, leaving the reader with the constant question,\\"Will they forgive their past and rekindle their love?\\"I thought this was an excellent literary classic that truly captures the point and makes a great romance without being sappy or the characters being shallow. I would recommend this book for middle school on up, and primarily for girls. I can't picture many males sitting still for this one. The characters are perfectly molded, and some, like Sir Walter are humorous and very entertaining.I would give Persusion 5 stars and 2 thumbs for an excellent novel!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The subject of unlikely love is one we will never grow tired of, and as long as that is true, Jane Austen is an author we will always treasure. She always gives us such enthralling glimpses into live in nineteenth century England that we can little help but wish ourselves back to a time when love was courtly and appearances were everything. Somehow, she knew that love went beyond her society's rules. She knew that rank and name were not enough to silence love. In PERSUASION, she gives us all that she gave us in Pride and Prejudice. We shake our heads at the embarrassing families, yearn for the hero and heroine to admit their feelings to each other, and long for the man who causes trouble between the heroes to just go away. But, this time, not only do we have the suitor who keeps the man of our heroine's dreams at a distance, we have a malicious sister. We see Anne struggle with internal and external pressures while she deals with the seemingly outright malice of her sister, Elizabeth. Elizabeth is mean! She is not indifferent or aloof, but downright nasty and greedy. Her sister's happiness is something she would rather not see until her own is firmly in place, and she seems like the type to use sabatoge to succeed. I, for one, will never tire of reading of the ups and downs of a forbidden or unlikely love, and always feel a sense of exultation when the dashing man and striking young woman finally feel free enough to admit their feelings to one another, despite the dirty looks their pairing may draw."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Having read all of Jane Austen's books, I've been very impressed with her style. Reading Persuasion, I immediately noticed the difference between shy Anne Elliot and Jane Austen's other characters: Emma, Elinor and Marianne, Elizabeth Bennet, Fannie Price, and Catherine Morland. Anne is not the most beautiful, the cleverest, or the most-spirited. She is shy, quiet, thoughtful, somewhat plain, and honest. She reacts to emergency situations calmly and clearly, proving that she does have a backbone. I think the fact that she is older and more mature than Austen's other characters shows a maturity in Austen's writing. I highly recommend this book to those who love Jane Austen and can understand being shy and strong."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"is Austen's novel which begins with Anne Elliot thinking about a lost love instead of a future love.Beautifully written, it is a novel that makes readers wonder if there is going to be the \\"characters meet and finally get married\\" ending that is so typical in Austen novels. Anne Elliot is 27, unmarried, and living at home with her father and older unmarried sister who are concerned about appearing more wealthy than they actually are. When the family is convinced by Lady Russell to rent out their home and move to a more economical space, Anne ends up going to care for her younger sister Mary Musgrove.Anne's visit with her sister's family becomes uncomfortable once Captain Wentworth becomes a frequent visitor there. Wentworth is the love that Anne regretfully let slip away, having been influenced by her good friend Lady Russell that his social status was inferior to Anne's. Wentworth and Anne are both convinced that their relationship is over and their communication with one another is formal, yet limited.Anne is not sure what to make of Captain Wentworth's interest with Louisa and Henrietta (Charles Musgrove's sisters), and more than one gentleman takes a romantic interest in Anne. Both Anne and Wentworth distance themselves from each other in an attempt to forget that they ever loved each other.It is when Anne is away from Wentworth, and at home with her father and sister that she begins to realize how much she loves Wentworth. She wonders if she is too late, if the chance for love has really passed. Even though she loves Wentworth, Anne is still concerned about what her father and Lady Russell will think of him.Readers can only speculate as to the ending of the novel, which appears to be more uncertain than the endings in Austen's other novels. The art of persuasion, as well as social status, and the contrasting views of the elders and the youth, makes this novel one of Jane Austen's best."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It's another great book of Jane Austan. I really enjoy her writing and endings,especially this one of Jane's. This is (I think) the last book Jane wrote before her death."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Amazed at how much easier it is to read these long classics electronically (which I love!) than bulky books. Jane Austen is one of my favorite authoresses, and this book did not disappoint! I love this time in history, and this was one of her books I had not read, or seen in mini-series form. Plan to read more of her lesser-known novels...her style and characters just keep you wanting more....this novel was up to her usual excellence."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"After getting through a long period of rather dull set up, this book rewards you with a funny, romantic, light hearted diversion that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The wording was a bit too antique for my liking. The storyline was good but I was disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's later novels. She wrote about the satire of society and its effects on the chance of marriage.Synopsis:Anne Elliot has listened to friends and family when it comes to the men in her life. Should marry them or not? Anne met the love of her life Captain Wentworth earlier but was discouraged from pursuing him. Will Anne be able to break away from her family and make her own decision about love and happiness? Will society affect her choices?My Thoughts:I feel that classics are important, but I often have to give my full attention to it. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice but also have a greater understanding of the story. I feel that I will come to appreciate Persuasion in time once I have given it more time.Should we let marriage decide our future? Does our family have our best interests at heart? It is interesting that this marriage and family connections were so important back about one hundred fifty years ago.I look forward to reading my next Jane Austen novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I couldn't get into this book.

Undervalued by her arrogant baronet father and prideful sisters, meek Anne Elliott's main goal when she sees her jilted ex-fiance is to hide her regret.Not as involving as some of her other tales, with fewer likable characters and a very draggy storyline. I gave up halfway through."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Beautiful story--as are most of Jane Austen's works. The book was high quality although the cover make it appear as though you are reading a romance novel. :-)"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"After viewing several versions of Jane Austen's works, it seemed that reading at least one was overdue. Since I had just seen the latest Masterpiece Theater version of Persuasion on PBS, that seemed a likely choice. The possibility of two problems loomed as the book was purchased: First, the book and the taped version would probably have major differences. Second, Having been written 200 years ago, the style would also be different, more narrative than action, for instance. I was to discover that sentence structure was also very different. (Although I have read many books in this style in my lifetime, the popular style today is, of course, more fast-paced and active in comparison.)I was quite right about the pacing and the style. At first, it was a difficult read, taking more concentration than modern popular fiction requires. But as the machinations of the Elliott family and their kin unfolded, I was drawn into the story. How could Sir Walter be so oblivious to Anne's favors? How could Anne have listened to Lady Russell and rejected Wentworth's proposal eight years earlier? How could anyone have wanted to wed Anne's sister Mary whose ailments and spells are so blatantly self-serving? And would a man of Wentworth's personality, station, and eventual rise wait eight years to marry in an era when marrying well was so important to the upper and upper-middle classes?All of the shenanigans listed above and many more are documented in detail in the book. There is no way one can get the same flavor of scheming and hoping in a play or film. At least I've not seen one that accomplished that. It is tough going sometimes for the modern reader. However, it is well worth the effort. Seeing society as Jane Austen did is one of those experiences one can most often get only from books. I'm glad that I picked up this one and now plan to read more of her work: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, and Emma among them. It should be an interesting summer."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The volumes I purchased all prove excellent. These are texts most useful in an academic environment in contrast to casual reading. As such, they are splendid."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As far as reading the text goes, it's easy to read. It's just like any other version of Austen that I have read.HOWEVER, I do want to make a very important point for those considering this version and others by this company. The pictures really ruin the flow of the book. You will be reading, then there is a huge blank space after the text. Click next page and you get a picture that is really hard to get a look at, then next page you see the caption and some space before the text continues. It really disrupts the reading to have this randomly throughout the chapters.Aside from that, the kindle version is decent."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I just recently went through a really rough break up and a friend of mine suggested that I read this book to start working on getting over it. It is a beautifully written book and the story is not at all predictable. It twists and turns and the whole time you find yourself on the edge of your seat, not able to put the book down untill you find out what is going to happen between Anne and Mr. Wentworth... will they see eachother? Will they speak? The characters are all very clear, and all very different. There's the annoying \\" it's all about her\\" sister, the well to do Friend, the loner bookworm, the bitter widow, the scheming cousin, each character is unique. Anne is polite and loveable. Everyone loves her and you will too. In the end, this beautiful love story gives a single girl like me hope that there is that perfect someone out there for me, but you don't have to be going through a loss to love this book. Everyone should read it. It is one of my new favorites of all time!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"this one and northanger abbey are my favorite. both of them are surprisingly easy to read. i like this one best of the two because i like the character of Ann so much, and i like her silly sisters. there are a lot of characters but i never got lost amongst them all. i recommend, for a first time Austen reader, to read this one becasue it is much easier to understand than most of her other works and it really is a good story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen, and I tend to read it when I have that need for some \\"Austen therapy\\". Anne is much older than any other Austen heroine (she is 28 by the end of the book), but that difference in age has made her more wise, thoughtful, intelligent, and sensitive. She has known the pain of disappointed love, and has lived through it. She didn't \\"die of a broken heart\\" or anything like that. She suffered, learned from it, and managed to come out the other side with her senses intact.Like all Austen heroines, there is nothing sentimental about her or her romance with Captain Wentworth. In fact, their interactions with each other, after an absence of eight years, illustrate how very realistic the story is. Wentworth is angry and resentful, and uses the young, spirited Louisa Musgrove to make Anne see that she has no power over him, even to make her jealous. Most of us have had similar experiences with ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends. The book is completely relevant to the lives of modern readers, which is the very thing that keeps Jane Austen fresh after all these years.Persuasion is also supremely entertaining, with delightful and hilariously vapid characters, such as the vain Sir Walter Elliot, the conniving William Elliot, the the petulant and constantly ill-used Mary Musgrove, and the scheming Mrs. Clay. Any fan of Austen will already have read this book, but any beginner Austen fan, or someone who has not yet ventured to try Austen yet, but is curious, should read this book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I bought this for my kindle..50 cents! Goodness I am almost ashamed. Sick with a cold, I read it almost straight through. Don't know how I missed this before. It is a joy. So much better than much of what is put out today."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have to admit I am a Jane Austen addict. I just can't help but enjoy her witty dialog set in old English times. Sometimes I wish we talked more like they did. I feel like she just takes me back to a time long past, but very much alive and rich. This is the fourth book I have read of hers, and I loved it just as much as the others. I highly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a small novel, but it is Jane Austen at her best. Her commentary on the English gentry and the restrictions of \\"society\\" are well presented in this story of Anne who was once persuaded not to marry a man with no prospects and no station in life, at least compared to hers as the daughter of a baronet. Jane Austen proves there can be passion without being graphic. A great lvoe story!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book answered a lot of questions that came up after I saw the movie i.e. what's with Mrs. Clay and the young Mr. Elliot? A must read if you really want to understand the movie."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I finally got around to reading this lovely novel by the infamous Jane Austen. It was written in her middle age and published posthumously. Slightly shorter and less intense than Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is still detailed and enjoyable, full of Austen's trademark wit, deft dialogue, and insight into human nature.The protagonist is Anne Elliot, the twenty-seven-year-old daughter of a baronet. Like other Austen heroines, Anne shares little sympathy or similarity with her family members. Her one romantic attachment is over half a decade old - she was engaged to a naval officer whom her friends disapproved of. At the beginning of the novel, Anne goes to stay with her married younger sister. Her father and older sister have been forced to give up their family home because of their spendthrift habits. Captain Wentworth, Anne's former fiance, reappears in her life, and Anne is forced to learn to interact with him in a polite and detached way. She must watch him pursue others, and decide how to respond to her own suitors.The entire novel is engaging and good, though at times I found Anne almost too calm a heroine. I absolutely loved the climax of the story, near the ending. It is so sweet and surprising. Persuasion is not to be passed over by a Jane Austen fan, or anyone who likes an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Anyone who enjoys reading Jane Austen, will be very please with this book. After reading it, you will find yourself still thinking about it and enjoying it's memories."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen has been one of the most influential writers of all time. Her beautiful love stories will always be remembered. Her work was ahead of its time, which is why a lot of today's writers emulate her style. My favorite Austen novel is Persuasion.After the heroine, Anne Elliot, was talked into leaving the man she loved, an attractive and financially challenge man named Frederick Wentworth, she felt she couldn't possibly marry a poor man. Eight years later, however, Wentworth returned to his homeland with a fortune and a place in society. It is obvious that those were the times in which social status was the most important thing, not love. Jane Austen had created a beautiful story that people can still relate to. The characters are beautiful and the story is memorable. I have read Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but in my opinion, Persuasion is her best work.This is a beautiful piece of literature, and if you haven't read it, I suggest that you do."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Starts out very slow and too much background detail, but once the characters are established it is a good read. Typical Jane Austen style"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have always enjoyed her work and this is no exception. Very good from the first word to the last"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"What a wonderfully written account. Without giving anything away, I would encourage the reading of the intricacies of relationships, motives, and the awkwardness and variety of such. Nothing in humanity has changed, but the written expressions of such."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This fully satisfying tale of destined romance is sure to please. Austen's tale of true-love's fulfillment impeded by the perceptions of others' views about the appropriateness of the parties involved leaves the reader questioning his or her own pursuits of love.Austen writes of the how the road to one's soul-mate sometimes takes a long and twisted journey, through time, one's self-doubts, and the perception of others. It may take Anne and Capt. Bentwick over eight years, but true love prevails as Austen's fans all know.Also, Austen takes her sharp-witted pen once again to people's views of love, social climbing, societal views on women, and status-bound troglodytes. Austen still inspires today readers to question his or her own motives in love, as well as the motives of others.Finally, Austen wraps this beautiful tale of true love in the exquisiteness of her style--both vividly concrete and syntactically challenging--and her character study of the status-quo breaking heroine."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I chose this reading because I am a Jane Austen fan and have not read Persuasion since in high school. Her style is definitely refreshing for that period of time."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Personally, I think this is Jane Austen's best work. It's certainly her most mature. Anne Elliott is born into a prideful aristocratic family. At a young age, she nearly marries the love of her life, only to break it off after being persuaded by a mother-like figure (on grounds of his not being able to support her properly). He tries to drown his sorrow in his career in the Navy while she stays quietly at home and suffers the Cinderella-like treatment she receives at home.Circumstances throw them back together again 7-1/2 (I believe) years later; Captain Wentworth did well in the war and is now the object of all the young ladies. Watching them re-unite and deal with the hurt of the past is well worth the read. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"A charming story.

Last night I stayed up to 2:00 am, determind to finish this book. I could not last the whole night without wondering the ending, whether it be happy or sad. And so, I finished my first Jane Austen book. I loved this book and everything in it. The characters were amazing!! If you haven't read this book you're missing out!! Now, if you are still in question as to whether you have the ability to read such a book, no worries! Just pick this book up and READ it!! You won't be sorry!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have now read all of Austen's completed works and wrote reviews for all them as well ^-^. (I'm feeling very proud of myself by now) It's not my favorite, but it's definitely not the worst. And for Jane Austen, even the worst is an enjoyable, entertaining read; I only mean the worst compared to her other novels not on a general scale.To get down to the book, it was quite different from the others. Anne is twenty-eight at the start of the book, she is plain and unattractive having lost her \`bloom' seven years earlier due to the loss of her love, and isn't as witty and sparkling as Elizabeth Bennet or Emma. Yet you don't come to despise her; she's not weak. And when you come to think of it, her agreeing to break off her engagement with the hero was a wise thing to do at her age. If he hadn't acquired a great fortune or perhaps died in service, then where would she be? Plus the fact that she was young and smothered with disapproval all around and the woman she thought of as her mother was dead against the match.So anyway, she also has the most despicable family out of any of Austen's other novels-even Mansfield Park-they are conceited, selfish and self-important. The sad thing is that you realize that people like Sir Walter really exist, people who care solely for appearances and rank. Even Anne's sister Mary, perhaps the nicest sister, is selfish without really meaning it, and treats Anne the way a spoiled child treats it's parents; nicely when it wants something, but all the while thinking: what else do they have in their lives to do but to cater to all my whims?There are a few trivial things I didn't like: first that Sir Walter Elliot is such a snob; Walter is my absolute favorite name! Austen gave it a pretty bad impression. Secondly, I wish that James could have married Anne; I really liked him, much better than the hero, and he suited her so well! I didn't really like the hero of this book; I'm a sucker for the rich, dashing gentlemen of her other novels. You don't really know the hero of this book so well.Anyway, like all her books, the prose is outstanding, her usage of the language remarkable and the reader's attention is never lost; Austen's greatest gift. I have always loved Austen's style of writing, it's great! Great book, highly recommended! Add it to your classics shelf. Don't have one? Get one!!!=^-^="},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As a big fan of Austen's, I read this book and wasn't disappointed. All of Austen's trademarks are there: her witty commmentary of the British elite, silly men and women who both exasperate and amuse you, and a good love story. Persuasion is about Anne Elliot, who after breaking off an earlier engagement with Captain Wentworth, is suddenly in his company 8 years later, and longing to rekindle the romance. This book wasn't as fun as Pride and Prejudice, mainly because the struggle between Anne and Wentworth doesn't resonate the same way as that between Elizabeth and Darcy. Neither characters are particularly arrogant (though Wentworth is hostile at being rejected before), but it's still interesting to see how the two will find one another among the silliness of the people and situations around them. Jane Austen just has a way of keeping her reader in suspense, no matter if you feel sure you know the ending. The question is always How will they get together rather than if, and the How here will please any romantic reader satisfactorily."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I downloaded the sample chapter onto my Kindle and yes, the line breaks are strange. It does not read flush left to flush right, but rather like poetry in couplets. Which is ironic, given how poorly poetry line breaks are done on many e-readers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen created a literary treasure with this book. The story has all the the usual Austen charms, yet also deals with lost love, age and family pressures. Anne and Wemtworth are qonderful charecters."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"All of Jane Austen's heroines are unique in different ways; Emma Woodhouse was rich and had no pressing need to marry; Fanny Price was shy and introverted; Lizzie Bennett was witty and self-mocking; and Elinor Dashwood had to share the spot-light with her younger sister Marianne. Anne Elliot's defining attribute is that she is considerably older than her literary fellows; for at the grand old age of twenty-seven is nearly past her prime (in the eyes of her contemporaries) and entering perpetual spinsterhood. In a time when a woman was defined by her society almost solely on her success in marriage, things are not looking so good for Anne.This is especially bitter for Anne considering she was once in love with the handsome but poor Frederick Wentworth, but persuaded to break relations between them on the advice of her deceased mother's dearest friend Lady Russell, who disapproved the match. Regretting such an action in the years that followed, Anne has almost reconciled herself to a life of maidenhood, surrounded by self-absorbed relatives.However, fate is about to give her a second chance. Set (and written) as the Napoleonic Wars were ending, Anne learns that Captain Wentworth - now a wealthy and respectful officer - is about to re-enter her acquaintance. After her father is forced to rent out their estate in order to pay off debts, Anne travels to Uppercross Cottage to stay with her sister Mary Musgrove, unsettled with the thought that one of the tenants left behind is the sister of Captain Wentworth. Settling in with the Musgroves and the beautiful Henrietta and Louisa (Mary's sister-in-laws), it is only a matter of time before Mr Musgrove returns with Captain Wentworth in tow.Anne is understandably nervous given their unhappy parting, but forces herself to remain calm and polite in his presence - and to her sorrow he behaves the same toward her, focusing his attention on the Musgrove girls. To stir things up a bit, Anne also meets her estranged cousin Mr Elliot, who is immensely attentive and charming toward her and almost certainly intends to make her his wife.Anne herself is neither pretty nor witty; rather she's patient, kind-hearted, sensible and part of a family that doesn't deserve her. It's not that her father and sisters are unkind, but one can feel Anne's discontent and loneliness in being part of a family that places importance only on riches and rank without any conception that their minds are weak and uninformed. As the only sensible person in a world of self-absorption, Anne trudges through her duties unnoticed and uncomplaining. But she's not perfect, for every reader knows that she's made a mistake in giving up the love of her life (though she comes to a surprising conclusion concerning it in the last chapter, placing her duty to society and family above the demands of her own heart), and as Frederick and Anne dance around each other, hopelessly trapped by the silence that conformity demands, the modern reader will share their frustration in their inability to speak their minds, especially in a world where there are no such restrictions.But of course, this is an Austen book and you don't have to be physic to know that a happy resolution is on its way - but the way in which it is settled is perhaps Austen's most touching union between two characters, made even more poignant by the fact that that it's taken them two tries to find one another. One feels especially happy for Anne, who truly deserves some joy in her life - her reaction to the warmth of the Musgroves' familial life is heartrending when you realise her surprise and appreciation for it is caused by the lack of such warmth in her own family.\\"Persuasion\\" is the shortest of all Austen's novels, as well as the last one she wrote before her death, which should appeal to those who are a bit stretched for time. It's not her best, most beloved or most famous novel, as many of the character simply aren't as vivid or involving as some of her other novels, but it contains the same themes of social commentary, verbal wit and wry insights into the human condition that Austen is famous for. A sweet, slim novel about loyal, love and second chances."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first time I read this book. I know it's a classic and all that, but I really enjoyed it. It was a bit hard to get into right away, but once all the players were introduced I was hooked.

This is one of a particularly attractive set published by Worth Press, including some interesting literary criticism and Regency background articles by Austen experts."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen is famous for her English dramas of marriage, love and societal acceptance. Her latest novel Persuasion continues the theme of society, love, and marriage and how money and jealousy interferes. Published posthumously, Persuasion is a dramatic story about persuading others of love, adhering to wishes of family and society, and the subtle hints that foretell every climatic chapter.Widower Sir Walter Elliot lives on his Kellynch-hall estate with his two daughters Elizabeth and Anne. Both girls had unsuccessful chances at marriage: Elizabeth was turned down by Mr. Elliot, a family cousin and heir to Sir Walter's estate who married a plain woman of fortune instead; Anne had a great affair with a Mr. (now Captain) Wentworth, a naval officer who had nothing--and was therefore ineligible--to marry Anne. As Sir Walter falls deeper into debt, the Elliot family leases the estate to an Admiral Croft in order to save money. And Admiral Croft, naturally, is a great friend of Captain Wentworth, who reappears eight years after he and Anne parted. Can Anne persuade Captain Wentworth to lover her once again? The answer lies in the story.Like in her other novels, Jane Austen incorporates the manners and social customs of the early 1800s in her novels. The novel speaks of the \\"great war\\" with Napoleon that the British Navy fought, and the characters are forever thinking about money and royal connections. Anne very much wanted to marry Captain Wentworth when the first fell in love. But English custom demands that a couple gets approval of their marriage from the bride's family. And as Captain Wentworth was poor at the time, the Elliots strictly forbade Anne from marrying him, and she didn't. Throughout the novel the characters also maintain an air of sophistication and elegance--an air required of everyone in the British court. And as Sir Walter Elliot was known in court, the whole family had to behave with \\"utmost decorum.\\"\\"It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again.\\" (Austen 197).Foreshadow is prominent in the novel. In Chapter 2 both Captain Wentworth and Mr. Elliot are mentioned, assuring the reader that they will be prominent main characters. It was not until the end that the characters discover the reason behind Mr. Elliot's first marriage, but one character hinds that \\"money, money was all that he wanted\\" (Austen 178). After page 17 it becomes obvious to the reader what would happen between Anne and Captain Wentworth, for \\"repeating his name so often...was a new sort of trial on Anne's nerves\\" (Austen 44). Little hints along the way suck the reader deeper and deeper into the story.Although \\"Proper English\\" is intimidating when reading Jane Austen's stories, her plots are classics in love and marriage. Anyone who has gone through a painful break up or a dramatic relationship knows just how much money, family and jealously can ruin a relationship. Austen dramatically tells the stories of her heroines while maintaining a 19th century setting, and drops subtle hints along the way to keep readers hooked. Persuasion is a classic that is understood and loved by all who read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am not quite sure why Persuasion is not quite as good asSense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice. It is a well constructedstory, and if anything, the secondary characters are more amusingthan those in her other novels. However, the main charactersare just too restrained (maybe repressed is a better wordhere). Their exchanges, and frequently lack thereof, makes it a bitfrustrating. However, this is still an excellent read - entertainingfrom start to finish."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Everyone else has said all there is to say about Austen, her writing, and this plot. I want to thank Penguin Classics for the endnotes in this edition. They were comprehensive, clear, attractively presented (instead of being wedged into the text), and helpful to 21st-century readers of this early 19th-century novel. The scholarly introduction (with a spoiler warning, how thoughtful!) and the biographical timeline help place the book in both literary and chronological context, and were substantive additions to this work."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This novel, written by the mature Jane Austen and published after her death, reveals the strengths of Austen's art. First, she is a careful and exact observer of human character, as compared to those that base a novel of emotion or behavior. Second, she is totally aware of class distinctions and the determinism that is created by a rigid class structure. She explores how character is independent of class but often mistakenly associated with upper class persons. Third, Austen is also a comedic writer, full of wit and funny portrayals of hypocrites, though many may find fault with my interpretation below since this aspect of Austen's art is rarely discussed. Fourth, Austen carefully portrays the world of 17th century upper class women which could be viewed as oppressive, paternalistic, and deterministic. However she continually portrays women as resilient actors rather than victims.She was a superb observer and interpreter of human character. This is different from those contemporary authors who are more likely to explore emotion and behavior. Character in the work of Austen is destiny and good character eventually leads to better outcomes and poor character leads to worse outcomes. Whereas at times her characters exhibit emotion, they are more likely to withhold emotion and when this withholding is done carefully and discretely, Austen would see this as signs of good character. Whereas she has high regard for honesty, she seems to see honesty as having both a proper method of presentation and to have proper timing in order to have impact. The letter Captain Wentworth writes to Anne Elliott at the end of the novel is a perfect example of suppressed emotion transformed into carefully strategically timed truth-telling.Class differences play and huge role in the works of Austen and Persuasion explores this with the romance of a rich girl of noble family in love with a handsome but middle class young man who both have reversal of fortune and 8 years later re-encounter each other. Anne Elliott is surrounded by a father, two sisters, and her deceased mother's best friend; all of whom use social class as a cognitive short hand for who is worthy and who is not. Anne is the character that can penetrate the smoke of social class to see the true strengths of character underneath. Interestingly, when Persuasion was written, the Napoleonic wars were over and many young men who made their fortunes in the British navy returned with fortunes into English society. Here the new rich encounter the old landed rich, a formula for social upheaval. Austen perfectly articulates this as the Elliott family vacates their ancestral home, Kellynch, and rent the mansion to an Admiral and his wife.Austen was witty and could be considered a comedic writer. Her descriptions of human folly, prejudice, snobbery, and hypocrisy are all skillfully handled. She never preaches. She allows the snob, the fool, the hypocrite to reveal themselves through their speech and interactions. The outburst of Anne's father, Sir Elliott, upon hearing this his daughter is visiting a sickly poor school friend instead of visiting barely know distant rich relatives is priceless.In summary, Austen's Persuasion is a good example of Austen's considerable skill at character analysis and revelation and development of character in social interactions and social contexts. She is delightful to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have no right to review Jane Austen. I give this book 5 billion stars."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is an utter delight to read. This book was written almost 200 years ago but the story could just as well have been written today. It is still fresh and gives a tremendous light on the life and mannerisms of people that lived long ago - nothing much has changed i take it! Jane Austen is witty and has the tremendous ability to describe situations and relationships. She is also the master of suspense. Persuasion is a moving story that describes the human ability to patiently and agonisingly wait for happiness or love as it were. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and will never forget the character of Miss Anne Elliot. A delightful read indeed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I hold very firmly to the belief that this book cannot be fully appreciated in a first reading. It is necessary to read it at least twice, and preferably more.It's not as immediately pleasing as some of Ms. Austen's other works, Pride & Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility etc., but those who take the time to appreciate this book will find it well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, the last novel that Jane Austen completed before her death in 1818, tells the story of one Anne Elliot, the second daughter of a baronet who has spent his waythrough his fortune and has nothing but his title to lean on.When she was 21 years old, Anne fell in love with and was engaged to Frederick Wentworth, a young captain in the Navy. Her belated mother's best friend, Lady Russell, dissapproves of the match as being below Anne, due to Anne's claim to nobility, and Anne cancels the engagement, much to her and and Captain Wentworth's grief.Nearly eight year's have passed since she broke off her engagement to Captain Wentworth when she, Lady Russell, and a Mr. Shepherd, a friend of her father's, are forced to pose and intervention and tell her father that he must quit his estate and find someone to lease it to, or he will be sent tot he poorhouse. Her father, his only pride being in his social position and personal appearance, relents, but only if they can find suitable tenants - which they do in Admiral Croft and his wife, the sister of Captain Wentworth.Anne thinks that her broken heart has mended, until she sees him again. unfortunately, he is now attached to another . . . and yet Anne sees clues in his behavior that he may be hers once again. Anne and Wentworth must negotiate their past, their different social classes, and proper behavior to find their way back to one another.What sets PERSUASION appart from Austens' other novels is how modern it seems in comparison. Austen takes more liberty with point of view in this novel, the characters have much richer inner lives than the Bennet's or Dashwood's ever did.This novel is highly recommended to anyone who would enjoy Jane Austen. Though the ending is predictable, it does not always seem so, and therefore the novel was a very suspenseful read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my favorite of the Jane Austen books.

It's one of her shortest. It was published posthumously, and I think that she meant to flesh it out or add subplots, like her other books.As it stands, it's a wonderful work. *Emma* is supposed to be Austen's masterpiece, but I think *Persuasion* is a more mature work and, probably, more personal. The main character Anne Eliot is Austen's best character: mature, responsible, intelligent, and more wise than witty. She was persuaded to not marry for love when she was young, but to wait for a chance at a wealthier man. That chance never came, and now Anne is past her bloom, probably unmarriageable, and her inane father and sister are shoveling the family's little remaining money out of the coffers as fast as they possibly can. Anne gets a second chance with the man she loves, a chance that Jane may not have had.It's beautifully, and poignantly, told.I love Jane Austen.

Though she loved him and continues to love him, he could not provide her with the security and prestige her family felt was her due. He goes off to sea and Ann settles down to a life of servitude to her family. Years later, a wealthy Captain Wentworth returns with the idea of marrying -- not Ann but one of her young in-laws.When I first read Persuasion, I was too young to understand Anne's position. Being utterly selfish, like Anne's family or utterly cowed, like Anne at the beginning of the book, was foreign to me. It took some life experience on my part to be able to appreciate the theme of duty to oneself vs duty to one's family.Though much shorter, Persuasion is a harder read than Pride and Prejudice. It takes time to warm to the main characters. If you give it that time, Anne and Frederick's love story is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"extra period piece.

The heroine Anne Elliot is an interesting lady caught in a times where women had very little independence and means to pursue their own happiness, and where family connections dictated most social interactions. Her journey to reclaim her love and more important her sense of self is very heartwarming. And her dashing Captain Wentworth, while still a pround gentleman finally lets his own emotions towards Anne steer him, and her to a happy conclusion.

Austen presents a very strong heroine in Anne Elliot, whose only false step in life seems to have been her allowing a trusted friend to persuade her not to marry sweetheart Captain Wentworth. When they next meet, years later, he has made his fortune in the wars, and she has become the official spinster of the family, deeply regretting her decision not to marry him. What happens next is enthralling not so much for the plot, but the detail with which Austen describes the turbulent emotions of the outwardly calm, collected and staid Anne Elliot."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan.

Love lost and regained. This also shows how a young woman can mature into a self-confident and very responsible young woman in the face of a daunting and selfish family.

But that was years ago before Anne's well-meaning friend and her less-than-good-intentioned family discouraged the acquaintance and Anne was convinced to give Frederick up.With years to think of her decision and years to consider all that Wentworth has accomplished without her, Anne has little hope of seeing him again or changing things between them.That is until a change in her father's circumstance forces the family to rent their estate. Given the identity of the new tenants, it seems inevitable that Anne and Captain Wentworth will see each other. It even seems inevitable that Wentworth will be angry and Anne hurt. Only time will tell if they can once again be something more to each other in Persuasion (1818) by Jane Austen.Persuasion is Austen's last novel. It is also a favorite among several of my friends.*With a book that is already such a large part of the public consciousness and the literary canon, there isn't a lot to say in a review that hasn't been said before.Jane Austen is one of my favorite classic authors so it is not, perhaps, especially surprising that I enjoyed Persuasion. In addition to a story that kept me on my toes,** Persuasion features a lot of strong, or at least interesting, characters. Wentworth is appropriately dashing even at his worst. Then we have Anne who is a delightfully forward heroine for a novel from 1818. It was invigorating to watch Anne come into her own as the novel progressed and she developed her own agency and the wherewithal to pursue her own wants and needs.Like many classics Persuasion is a book many people will read on the merits of its reputation (or for school) or it's the kind of book they won't touch. One review might not change whatever opinion you might have but Persuasion is an obvious must read for romantics and anyone who likes their heroines level-headed and ready to stand on their own two feet.*Though one does add the caveat that Pride and Prejudice first has to be taken out of the equation as Pride and Prejudice is arguably everyone's favorite Austen novel.**My only experience with Persuasion before this reading was Diana Peterfreund's post-apocalyptic retelling For Darkness Shows the Stars. I had never even seen a movie version so I really had no idea what to expect from the story. At. All. It made for a pleasant surprise while reading.Possible Pairings: Graffiti Moon by Cath Crowley, Middlemarch by George Eliot, The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banksby E.

And it didn't. I only purchased this book because it was free and because I was OK with Jane Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY, introduced by my sister. I promptly forgot about it. The only reason I ever got around to reading it was because I was bored out of my skull, and looking for something to read. I saw this book, remembered NORTHANGER ABBEY, and decided to read the reviews. It looked decent, so I gave it a try.I couldn't put this book down! I stayed up till 11:00 p.m. reading it! Normally I go to bed at 8:30 to 9:00. And just to give you a better idea of how much I liked it, I read it in two days. This is not a \\"short read.\\"Jane Austen has a skill in making characters come to life. I have been able to connect with each and every one of her heroines, though Elizabeth in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is too contemptous of others. Her books give an idea of the value placed in rank back then. It makes one glad for the semi-equality in the modern world. I loved the dialogues, and Mary, Anne's sister is so ridiculous you want to laugh.Anne falls in love with a poor sailor, Captain Wentworth, but is persuaded that she can make a much better match. She spends the next eight years regretting this decision, and wishing she had followed her better instincts. Captain Wentworth makes his fortune, but his pride is too much damaged to return to Anne. Fate throws them together again in the end as Anne's father rents their house to the Crofts, close relations to Captain Wentworth, and they begin to see each other much more often than they are comfortable with. I will let you discover what happens next, as one review spoiled it all for me.I have now broadened my knowledge of Jane Austen's novels. All of them are very good.

It's the constant talk about class, and who is good enough for whom, and the woman and man who just can't seem to get together until the very end when they admit their mutual love. It's all very tedious. I don't find a clever word or thought in her books. I only got through 1/2 this book, and then, in boredom, threw it aside for SINISTER STREET by Compton Mackenzie. Besides, there were many characters introduced throughout the novel, and I couldn't keep them in mind. They were not at all developed as characters. They were relatives and friends, and I didn't care about any of them for they were not portrayed in enough detail to distinguish them apart.I guess, I will give up on Austen. My favorites are Trollope and Hardy. Sinister Street, so far, is superb.

However, in the future if I want to read something of this caliber I would write NBC and ask for the script of their least watched daytime &quot;soap&quot;.

Most great literature is so wonderful because of its timelessness, touching on universal feelings and ideas. While it may have been groundbreaking in its time, it is so dull now. We women have already established our desires of equality in culture and have already acknowledged at least an inkling of what feminine independence is but this novel is a back step. Also, it is so predictable. Of course all of the characters will end up married, and most likely to their man of choice. This book is dull and predictable and is restricted by its time period. If you want to delve into the past then maybe pick it up, but otherwise, it's unexciting, and it still feeds on social classes and marriage as a woman's reliance on a man for social and fiscal support."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was the last book Jane Austen wrote and in many ways it is the most complete example of the style that endears her as much to modern readers as it did to readers from the nineteenth century.Persuasion's plot is based around the possibility of the rekindling of a romance which burned brightly when the protagonists were younger and which was thwarted because the forces of familiar persuasion made Anne Elliott reject her love for Captain Wentworth. All of Austen's plots are romantic staples revolving around the constant impediments placed between the heroine and her ideal man but unlike the plots of many novels contemporaneous to Austen's these impediments are not Gothic in nature - they are merely the frustrating minutiae of everyday life. To be sure, the denouements are invariably happy but when we think about what would happen (if these people were real) afterwards, we can foresee myriad problems and further barriers to happiness. (For example, in Pride and Prejudice, how is Lizzie going to cope with Darcy's family and in Persuasion, how is Anne, happily ensconced with her paramour, going to cope with her own disfunctional family?) No matter, Jane has done her job and brought the two lovers together.One of the most entertaining aspects of Austen's technique is her ironic narrative asides. We, as readers, are given access to the feelings of the main protagonists before they reveal them to the world (in Pride and Prejudice we know that Darcy is besotted with Lizzie well before he declares his amour, and in Persuasion we know that Captain Wentworth still carries a torch for Anne Elliott while she is still assuming that all hope of a rekindled romance has been dashed because of her earlier propensity to be persuaded against her emotions).One of the most curious aspects of Austen's wonderful assortment of characters is the strangely brutal way she portrays families. There is always at least one member of the principle family who is deeply flawed - both Lizzie's parents in Pride and Prejudice, Marianne and Elinor's weak brother and vile sister-in-law in Sense and Sensibility, and Emma's neurasthenic father (a mild critique compared to the sharpness of the other characterizations). Nowhere is this &quot;critique of the family&quot; more keenly delineated than in Persuasion. Anne Elliot's father is a complete fool obsessed with physical appearances above all else, and it is clear that Anne has little respect for him or her own sisters. Austen invested all her idealization of character in her main protagonists - in this case Anne and Captain Wentworth. While not always physically attractive, Austen's heroines are always morally complete (except for the ever-so-slightly capricious Emma) - and Anne Elliot, the heroine of Persuasion, is surely more a portrait of Jane Austen than any of her other heroines. She is no longer young, has lost the full bloom of youthful beauty, and has been disappointed in love because she heeded the wishes of others, and not of her heart and her mind.We know by reading any of Jane Austen's books of her fierce intelligence, biting wit and brilliant observational powers of familiar human behavior. And she could be deliciously bitchy, as this example from Persuasion shows: &quot;(Anne and Captain Wentworth) were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily made room for him - they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove. It was no insignificant barrier indeed. Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment; and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son, whom alive nobody had cared for.&quot;Anne Elliott is certainly less ironic than the voice of the narration (Austen herself), but she seems to be a manifestation of what Jane Austen thought of herself, or at least, how she would like to be - intelligent, kind, sensitive to other's feelings, and most importantly, someone who is valued for these qualities rather than for beauty and money. Persuasion is a good read - it's not as cheeky as Emma or as involved as Pride and Prejudice, but there are plenty of the great Austen ironic (and even sarcastic) flourishes. And the intelligence of her writing is a delight."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I like Jane Austen, but this is a very special book, even for her.When I was widowed a few years ago, I read Persuasion. Lots or people here love this book, but it holds a special place in my life because it gave me the will to go on. We live in a youth-oriented culture which tries to tell people that only the young, the rich and the beautiful have a right to love and happiness; this book says that all people can have a second chance at happiness. Persuasion taught me that the pain over losing the one you love does not have to end your life. You can start again, and perhaps be even happier than you were the first time around, when you were young and didn't know what life was about. I know some people prefer the dashing heroes in Austen's other books, but Anne and Captain Wentworth are much closer to who most of us are. We are not flashy or rich; we don't always have supportive families; our beauty might only be seen by the people who love us the most because they've looked in our hearts. Love will not bring us land or access to the powerful, and it won't make our families act more kindly to us. But what love does is act as a shelter from the storms of life- death, sickness, insensitive people.While women now have more freedom to love than they did in the early 19th century, they are still hampered by unrealistic ideas regarding how the mind and body ages, the value of maturity, how having 'baggage' can be a sign that one has been places and seen things, and how common sense and human decency may be more important in the long run than beauty or good fashion sense. Most women are still afraid to be alone with themselves or to carve out a satisfying life without a man. Because most women and men don't value these concepts, Persuasion is not ranked as highly as Austen's more exciting earlier novels. Still, if I could only take one book with me to a desert island, this would probably be the one."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When I saw that this was the preferred edition for kindle I presumed that the text would be organised in a way to fit the kindle comfortably. Instead I found that the text does not uniformly fill the page. It is written as a full line follwed by a half line. I had to increase the font size in order to make it slightly less annoying. One thing it taught me is to ALWAYS download the sample chapter first before purchasing and don't presume that 'kindle preferred' means you'll be getting the best one for the kindle. Of course the book itself is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was Austen's last completed novel before her death and was written whilst the novelist was dying, which may explain its shorter length when compared to her other novels. Although briefer in the telling, it lacks none of the hallmarks of Austen's style including the omniscient ironic (and sometimes in this work cynical) narrative voice and her witty yet extraordinarily subtle comments on her societies approach to women and the social hierarchy. The action of this novel centers on the character of Anne Elliot who under the influence of a close family friend, Lady Russell is persuaded to reject the advances of Wentworth. The main body of the plot takes place eight years after this rejection; Wentworth is now known as Captain Wentworth and has made his fortune through the collection of enemy booty in the Napoleonic Wars. Now with England in peace he has returned ashore seemingly having forgotten Anne and his rejection and ready to take a wife.As the romance unfolds the novel covers a number of themes, for instance the idea of being \`persuadable' per se. Initially the notion that Anne allowed herself to be won over by Lady Russell's influence is seen as a fault, however as the story progresses the sub plot involving the character of Louisa Musgrove shows that rather than being a fault, Anne listening to Lady Russell's advice shows that she is susceptible to reason and practicality. Seemingly the error occurred rather in Lady Russell's judgment of Wentworth than in Anne's decision to follow her advice.Lady Russell's preference for Mr Elliot Jnr as a more suitable marriage partner for Anne over Wentworth seems to be based solely on the class distinction that divides these two men. This class based prejudice by Lady Russell may be regarded as a critical reflection upon Austen's society which closely associated (and often without valid cause) moral virtue and class status, the assumption being that the higher your class, the better your moral decency. The reader discovers the error of Lady Russell in relying on such a system of character judgement as it produces such corrupt results.Possibly the greatest achievement of this work is the very quiet proto-feminist message that Austen manages to slip into one of the closing chapters. Every the ironist, Austen has the meek Anne Elliot, who seemingly conforms to all of societies rules about what a women \`ought to be' speak out against the confining nature of a woman's expected place in society. When discussing the fate of love affairs between men and women, Anne argues that it is easier for men to forget as women \\"live at home, quiet, confined...You are forced on exertion. You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change.\\" Anne then goes on to turn on its head Captain Harville's ideas that the supposedly stronger and more robust figure and mind of man is better capable for love than that of the mind of women.Austen's novels are never innocent of the issues which affected their period and this is yet another example as Austen deftly and subtly critiques gender roles, social class and the notion of \`appearances.' In its whole, this is a great book, perhaps the fact that it was written by an older and dying Austen may explain the nostalgic tone of decline or sadness that seems to pervade it. It is well worth the money you would spend to buy it and the time you would take to read it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I've hated the fact that Persuasion isn't one of Jane Austen's most famous works ever since I read it. It is truly a beautiful love story, and it is written perfectly (as only Jane Austen could do).The story is about Anne Eliot, one of Austen's most likeable characters. Seven years before the novel begins, Anne had been persuaded out of a marriage to Frederick Wentworth. Neither Anne nor Captain Wentworth, had been persuaded out of love, though. Both have basically wasted the last seven years. Fortunately for the couple, circumstances arise which through them back together, and the two have to attempt to build a new relationship and deal with there own actions from years before.Persuasion is possibly Austen's greatest love story. It is much less satirical than here other novels. Anne is also a much more sympathetic character than say Emma. The novel is, of course, in Austen's incomparable style. Any romantic or lover of great literature would adore this beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book is one of my favorites of all time. Many people dislike it or don't like it as much when compared to Pride and Prejudice or Emma, but there are many reasons why Persuasion should not be compared to Austen's other novels. This novel was the last one that Austen wrote before she died. It is a more mature novel, dealing with many issues not found in Austen's previous novels. One reason why people find faults with the book is that Anne Elliot, the heroine, is not as spunky or witty as an Elizabeth Bennett or an Emma Woodhouse. There is not so much wit flowing in the dialogue between characters, or even dialogue in general. But these differences between the novels make this one so unique.It is a novel of second chances. Anne Elliot, no longer in the bloom of youth, is a grown woman of 27 or 28 years. Eight years ago she had been happily in love with a handsome man named Frederick Wentworth. But, unfortunately, due to his financial status, and Anne under the influence of her family and close friend, was forced to reject his marriage proposal and they parted ways. But now, he is within her closest circle once again. Circumstances led to Anne staying with her married sister, Mrs. Muskgrove, while her own house was being let to Wentworth's sister and husband. Wentworth visits his sister and on calling on the Muskgroves finds Anne among them. Anne finds Wentworth, not only looking as good as he ever did, but is now Captain Wentworth, who has made his fortune. Wentworth, still angry with Anne over being rejected, causes him to treat Anne very coolly. But over many weeks of contact here and there, you catch on that Captain Wentworth isn't all that oblivious to Anne anymore, because of all the little 'glimpses' he throws at Anne. The tension between the two is amazing. You can sense a connection between the two, even though they are on opposite ends of the room. In Bath, the tension builds and builds until it culminates into one of the most moving and romantic reunions ever. The letter that Wentworth writes to Anne declaring his love is bound to bring a tear to your eye and a pang in your heart. Happily, all ends well, but throughout the novel you can easily sympathize with Anne. No longer youthful and no longer as pretty as she used to be, she is full of self-consciousness and confusion. She still loves him after all those years, but she is unsure whether or not he still loves her.Austen, yet again, excels in portraying her characters. Anne and Captain Wentworth are full and delightful characters that one must love. Her descriptions of Anne's vain father and snobbish older sister, Elizabeth, hit the mark on satirizing the members of society during that time. She wittingly describes how everyone tolerates Mrs. Muskgrove's hypochondriatic self and how everyone deals with her in their own way. There is not so much dialogue between characters in this book, compared to Austen's other novels. Most of the book is in observation of Anne's character and feelings, which makes it so much easier to relate to everything that Anne feels and you understand her situation all the more. This is a wonderful novel, with many qualities, differing from those of Austen's previous novels, to enjoy and admire. Reading of getting a second chance in love is enough to lift anybody's heart and spirit and leave them happily satisfied with the book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This story is heart-wrenchingly agonising. This is a good thing! Never have I been so moved by a love story. When Anne and Captain Wentworth finally overcome their own guardedness and the pressures of society and re-declare their love for each other...... It is the most wonderful scene ever written. I have never read a more wonderful love story. I think this to be the most romantic of Jane Austen's novels. The mercenary marriage market Jane Austen ridicules in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is portrayed in a darker and more destructive light in &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Two lovers torn apart by a society fixated on class, wealth and position, only able to find happiness together once this obstacle has been overcome, but in the mean time..... OH THE HEART ACHE!!!!! I recommend this one for a rainy day when one can lie in bed, or sit in the favourite arm-chair, and wallow in the brilliance of this timeless and heart stirring romance. Don't forget your tissues!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel because of Jane Austen's lyrical prose, her timeless subjects of family relationships, love (and/or the search for it), her heartwarmingly drawn characters that I think any reader anywhere and at any time can relate to easily, and her usual witty and critical social commentary. I find it amazing to think that she wrote this novel nearly 200 years ago! I can think of several people in my own family and among friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who match her descriptions of Anne Elliot, her father and sisters Walter and Elizabeth Elliot and Mary Musgrove, Lady Russell, Captain Wentworth, etc. Times and mores may have changed in 200 years, but human nature has not changed! Reading her descriptions of these characters and well imagining Anne's reaction to them, whether it is with resignation, amusement, or exasperation mirror my own thoughts on them.Austen has created a wonderful character in Anne Elliot. I found that I liked her more and more as I read the novel, and, had she been real, would liked to have had her as a sister, friend, or relative. She is such a wonderful character because readers have a chance to see how she has grown up, has changed, and is willing to go for what she wants now that she is older and wiser (much like anyone else).The story is not like Austen's other novels (Pride and Prejudice, Emma) because it deals with the issue of a true rarity in life--a second chance at love. Anne Elliot met and fell in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth, a naval officer, when she was 19 years old. Against her better judgment, she is \\"persuaded\\" by family in the form of family disapproval of her choice. Her mother is dead, her father and her elder sister Elizabeth (who have a very strange, almost-marriage-like relationship themselves) are social snobs and do not consider a mere captain in the British navy good enough to marry into their family because they are ranked above him socially. Anne's feelings, Frederick's feelings, and the possibility that he could earn a great deal of money by capturing privateers and enemy ships, or be rewarded with a title for distinguishing himself in battle does not occur to them. Anne is also strongly influenced by Lady Russell, a close family friend and a particularly close friend to Anne. Lady Russell, since the death of Anne's mother, has become a mother-figure/friend to Anne (since Anne is ignored by her father and sister Elizabeth). Lady Russell also disapproved of Anne marrying Captain Wentworth, and Anne, because she was young and easily influenced by those around her at age 19, breaks off her engagement to Captain Wentworth. She has regretted it ever since, and has not met anyone (her father and sister went out in Society, but did not take Anne with them; her younger sister Mary is married, but spends her time complaining about non-existent ailments and about all the wrongs and hurts she has suffered at the hands of family and friends to take any interest in introducing Anne to eligible young men) she would consider as a husband. Eight years pass, and, by chance, Captain Wentworth (now considerably wealthier though not titled) re-enters her life due to the temporary lull in the Napoleonic Wars. He too was very hurt by Anne's breaking off of their engagement, but, like Anne, he has not met any other women who compare to her. Both are wary of eachother--and Austen handles both their introspection and their gradual establishment of a stronger, more mature love for eachother with sensitivity and passion. I loved this story because it clearly shows an older (though still young) heroine who is offered the rarest of all things--a second chance at love with the love of her life. She is wise enough to reject the opinions of her family and Lady Russell this time, accepts the love offered, and offers her own love in return! Captain Wentworth's letter to Anne at the end of the novel is the kind of love letter every woman would cherish. Wow! What a beautiful letter! It warms your heart, touches your soul, and nourishes your spirit. The story is all the more poignant because Anne and Captain Wentworth appreciate eachother and their relationship because they know what they have and what they could have missed had they followed social conventions.For the die-hard Austen fans, there is plenty of social commentary, and I thought that Austen illustrated the snobbishness of the upper classes very well in her characterizations of Anne's father and sisters. The criteria they use to accept or reject a person are based on such things as whether the man owns property and how much, how many servants he has, title, family background, connections, and, in her father's case, physical appearance is very important. None of these things have any intrinsic value compared to whether Anne is loved and respected by Captain Wentworth, how he treats people, his ethics, morality, etc. Austen's subtle humor and way of poking fun at these values contribute to the tone of this novel.Give this novel a try. I do not think that you will be disappointed. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is one of Jane Austen's five novels as a mature author. As with four of the other five, it follows the same formula of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her owns means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work.\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.So, where does that leave \\"Persuasion\\" among her novels? The present novel is good and it is generally thought of as one of her five best. It is one of her mature novels - as opposed to Northanger Abbey, an early work. It has a good story and good characters. I liked her treatment of Captain Wentworth. The description and the story about the primary character, Anne Elliot, is vintage Austen writing and story telling. But overall it does not quite reach the heights of those other two great Austen novels. Still, I rate it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. It is more a question of whether you like the story or not, since it follows the Austen formula. All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humor and irony.Austen wrote the novel based on contemporay life in England from approximately 1814 to 1815, in the post Napolean period, and it was published in 1816 after her other works. Overall I would rate it as excellent but not her best. It is similar to \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"and much better than her early novel \\"Northanger Abbey\\" in terms of literary sophistication and the characters, and it ranks behind the two novels mentioned above and \\"Emma.\\" Those three (Emma, Pride and Prejudice, and Mansfield Park) are her finest works.Most Austen fans will love the book, and I would recommend the novel."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is one of my favorite books -- and probably my favorite Austen, though I go back and forth between this and Pride and Prejudice. P&P is more sparkling and witty; Persuasion feels more mature. Definitely a book to read over and over. And the letter from Captain Wentworth to Anne(you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there!) is the best-written letter in fiction. Read it! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last novel, posthumously published in 1818, is about the possibility of having a second chance for love after one's made the mistake of following advice contrary to natural inclinations. The story centers on Anne Elliot, descendant of an illustrious family from the nobility of Somerset. Her mother has died and she lives with her father, an insufferably vain and irresponsible character, who has spent most of his fortune in a stupid way. Anne also lives with her elder sister Elizabeth, another unlikable person. They treat Anne with contempt and humiliation. The youngest sister, Mary has been married to a good man with a good social position. Turns out that the Elliot's have run out of money and they must move to a more humble house in order to lease the manor. The new tenant is an Admiral Croft, married to the sister of Captain Frederick Wentworth, a former boyfriend of Anne. Eight years ago, this man had proposed marriage to Anne, but he had been rejected after Anne's family, and in particular a fomer best friend of her mother's, had convinced her that she could find a much better prospect (Wentworth was by that time a beginner in the Navy and didn't have money). Anne has suffered ever since, because she really loved him and the much better prospect seems never to appear. Wentworth himself was deeply hurt by the rejection, but now he has come back from the war rich and with a promising future. The Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves (Mary's husband's family) develop a good social relationship and Captain Wentworth is frequently invited to parties and reunions.The rest of the novel is centered on Anne's feelings and her ambivalent emotions: on the one hand, she tries to be as little as possible in the company of Wentworth, but on the other she is very anxious about finding out if he still feels something for her. But Wentworth is cold and silent with her, showing respect but also letting her know how offended he feels. Mary's sister in law, Louisa Musgrove, falls for the handsome captain, and it seems like they will get married. That is, until she has an accident in the resort of Lyme, which changes the course of action.With a conventional and almost predictable plot, Austen manages nonetheless to write an acute psychological portrait, and a wonderful story. Her prose is terse and fluid, with a subdued sense of humor. Anne is a credible and likable character, always a good friend even if her relatives despise and ill-treat her and her beauty has started to fade. She is fully conscious of what a terrible mistake she made when she rejected a good, hardworking man who loved and respected her, and who is now an attractive option for many young women. Sexual tension is ever present in this world of repression and hipocrisy, and the self-affirming and independent Anne stands above the rest of the characters, as a prefiguration of the modern, self-reliant woman. One of the best by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Even though Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's lesser known novels it is very well written and also a very good story. The story is centered around the romance of Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth. They had fallen in love eight years before the novel takes place, but Anne broken off their engagment after Lady Russell persuaded her that he was not a suitable match. They end up seeing each other again after Anne's family runs into money problems and Anne and Wentworth realize that their feeling for each other are renewed. Problems from their past and also their families hurt their chance of a fresh start.I thought this novel was very interesting and another one of Jane Austen's great novels."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"At the end of the day, Persuasion is worth reading because it offers a simple hope for how we can live together. Unlike, say Pride and Prejudice, where in the end the characters more collide than marry, the orbits of protagonists Anne and Captain Wentworth eventually come to revolve around each other.When I read Austen, I often wonder whether the author likes her characters. In Persuasion, it seems like the author strives to make her characters contest to find their proper standing, and neither breeding nor education (nor gender) determines the mettle of a man or woman. However, determining how we can live together, faults and all, is probably more important than the sort of personality and tribulation time trials that some of Persuasion's characters attempt to determine among themselves. More important is the comparison of the various family units, the Elliots, the Crofts, and the Musgroves, and what a wise reader would learn from each.Make no mistake, this is no drawing room bodice ripper, of the \\"she slinked into the room scantily clad\\" variety. And its indolent upper class ever-vacationing denizens may appear quite impossible in today's society. However like occasional dessert, I found it better digested slowly, at the end of a day of intellectual toiling, rather than as a main course, or as a substitute for breakfast, lunch or dinner.I'm not sure if I would have enjoyed this as a younger person. This is apparently the author's final work, and she did not live to see it published. So it is probably the artist at the height of her craft. If she left us with anything to think of how we might all get along, this is, in my estimation, it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"You know it's very difficult to choose which of Jane Austen's books it the greatest but I can say that this is one I re-read every couple of years. This, the last of Miss Austen's fabulous set of novels, is of the woman who was forced to give up her love and then never loved another. The heroine is more mature than those of her others books, not quite so insentive to others, nor as judgemental. Maybe the most exasperating aspect of this book is that you can see that once reunited, the two still love each other, but obey those deeply instilled lessons in behavior to the point that I find myself almost saying 'for goodness sake, just tell him you love him still'! But that wouldn't be a Jane Austen novel, for you'ld miss the ongoing narrative of families who behave even as families do today, and all of the love knots would not be tied only as neatly as this queen of the early novel could do. Oh, if only she had lived longer, but at least we still, almost 200 years later still have her masterpieces to read over and over!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a big fan of Jane Austen. She has so much wit and characteristics within her characters. For one, In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, it is apparent that a thinly disguised Jane Austen is the heroine. The romantic comedy is played fondly between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, but in this case, it is Anne Eliot and her former beau, Frederick Wentworth. Under &quot;persuasion&quot;, she is forced to lose her regard for him because of his low connections. Seven years past and he again re-enters her life when his sister and her husband rents Kellynch Hall, since Anne's father needed the money. She avoids meeting him, but when they had no choice in their accidental visits, he meets her with cold civility. He courts the rash and young Louisa Musgrove, but an unfortunate accident changes the direction of his eyes to fall upon Anne once more. As the begin a steady friendship, the ones they are involved with fall for others, and they reflect upon what they once had and have a pleasant life together. Anne might not appear as strong as most of Jane Austen's characters, but she still has the firm beliefs of the world and would not allow things such as vanity or fortune to stand in the way of her happiness."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Every person has the power to influence those around us. Although very few people hold such high positions, like the president, to sway the masses, everyone has the ability to influence their friends and family members. Moreover, anyone who is a role model, mentor, or parent has a moral obligation to take their power of influence very seriously. Under what circumstances should you try to persuade another? What happens if your arguments persuaded someone towards the wrong decision, whether intentionally or not? And on the flip side, how much should we allow others to influence us?Persuasion tackles all of these questions and explores so much more. It is a rich, thoughtful novel full of romance, social critique, and, of course, many variations on the theme of persuasion.The novel opens in 1814 with the introduction of the baronet Sir Walter Elliot of Kellynch Hall and his three daughters: Elizabeth, Anne, and Mary. Elizabeth, the eldest daughter, is Sir Walter's favorite. Anne is the often overlooked middle child, and the youngest, Mary is an attention seeking hypochondriac, who also happens to be Sir Walter's only married daughter.Sir Walter is a spendthrift, and consequently, his household finances are a mess. In order to get his finances under control, he rents out Kellynch Hall and moves to Bath with Elizabeth. Anne remains behind for a few months, and lives with her sister Mary and Mary's husband, Charles Musgrove, at Uppercross. By coincidence, the tenants of Kellynch Hall are Admiral and Mrs. Croft, and Mrs. Croft's brother just happens to be a Captain Wentworth, a former love of Anne Elliot. Hence, under these circumstances, Anne and Captain Wentworth are brought together after eight years apart. In their past history, the two were very much in love, but Anne was persuaded to break off her engagement to Captain Wentworth, for he was deemed an unfit husband for her. When the two meet again, there is so much delicious, suspenseful tension between them that lasts throughout the entire novel.As with all of Jane Austen's novels, the language may be difficult for some readers. Just be patient, and you'll likely get used to it.I must admit that Pride and Prejudice remains my favorite Jane Austen novel, but Persuasion is nonetheless an excellent and thought-provoking novel with a simple and beautiful romance. I highly recommend it, and hope that you are persuaded to try it."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Let me just start this review with that fact that I am a HUGE Jane Austen fan. I love the language and I think it's a shame that we don't speak like that anymore. However, this is not my favorite Austen book. There is not a lot going on in this book besides the pining of Anne Elliot and while I was reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen. Although I do have to say that I LOVED the ending, which I won't go into cause I do not want to spoil anything for future readers. I do not want to discourage anyone from reading this book because Austen is great either way but for me personally this book was just a little underdeveloped in comparison to her other novels. Still a must read though for any Austen fan!!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"PERSUASION, Jane Austen's last completed novel was written between 1815 and 1816, with final chapter revisions in August of that year. Published posthumously in late 1817 with her earlier work NORTHANGER ABBEY, each of the novels represents the alpha and omega of her writing career. Even though they are divergent in tone and topic, they each share a commonality in being partially set in Bath and display Austen's trademark play on social strata, money and courtship. Austen finished the manuscript of PERSUASION in declining health which may account for its slim size in comparison to her heftier previous efforts MANSFIELD PARK (1814) and EMMA (1816). Or, quite possibly it is exactly the length that she preferred for her story, allowing for a simpler plot and focus on fewer characters. Its size in no way diminishes it value. Some scholars consider it her finest achievement and readers have long cherished it for its jab at social mobility and moving love story.In 1817 Austen wrote to her niece Fanny Austen Knight in her usual ironic manner, \\"You may perhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good for me.\\" At age 27, Anne is not your typical Austen heroine. The middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot she is from a distinguished family of a landed Baronet. Her vain father takes their aristocratic ancestry and social position very seriously and expects his three daughters to make prominent matches. Quiet, reserved and not as pretty as her father values, Anne is often overlooked and her opinions dismissed by her family; \\"but Anne ... was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight; her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne.\\" Eight years prior Anne met and fell in love with a young naval officer Frederick Wentworth. Because he did not match her social and financial status, Anne was persuaded by a well meaning family friend to reject his marriage proposal. Wentworth returned to sea and forgets her. Anne never forgets him and remains unmarried. When he returns eight years later a wealthy and successful naval hero he reenters her social sphere with heightened status. On the other hand, Sir Walter's extravagant lifestyle has out paced his income to the point of serious debt and the family must retrench, let Kellynch Hall and remove to Bath. As Anne watches the younger ladies of the neighborhood swoon and play for Captain Wentworth's affections she is painfully aware of her lost bloom of youth, deeply regrets her decision and pensively longs for his favor until a tragic accident at Lyme Regis and events in Bath renew her hopes.In yet another brilliant reading of a Jane Austen classic novel, British actress Juliet Stevenson interprets Austen's poignant story of fidelity and second chances with wry humor and sensitive pathos. Her depth of characterization is remarkable and I am never in doubt that she is relaying Austen's intension faithfully. Those who have previously read the novel will find new enjoyment in this beautifully produced audiobook and those new to Austen's masterpiece will be treated to an unabridged eight hours and forty three minutes of pure perfection. Such equal blending of masterful story and artistic integrity is rarely encountered and I highly recommend it.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm persuaded to find this a most charmingly written story.

Captain Wentworth's culminating profession of love to heroine Anne make that case better than I ever could: \\"You pierce my soul. I am half agony and half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. ... I have loved none but you.\\" Nonetheless, this novel and its characters still rank inferior to Mr. Darcy and Lizzy in my eyes. Not greatly so, mind you, but enough to make this merely an enjoyable read as opposed to an unforgettable one."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I almost feel ashamed that I did not like this book, after all it is Jane Austin!

She brings an asperity to the text often missing in film adaptations of Jane Austen. Anne Elliott, unlike Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny or Emma, is older and the novel has a subtle autumnal quality, which, of course, gives way to spring in end. Jackson captures the novel's rhythms and invests her narration with heightened humor and poignancy. My only regret is that this version remains available in cassettes only."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am an Austine fan, and I particularly like the audio versions of her books. The audio book is especially charming since it's read in the very witty British accent. Maybe it's just me :)I use to drive long distance alone very frequently and the various audio books of Jane Austin were something I would look forward to while driving."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion was Jane Austen's final novel. It is often criticized for being too short and not up to par with Austen's other novels. Persuasion was in fact written during the onset of the disease that eventually killed the author. Her final novel may indeed be considered different from her previous novels. It is the only Austen novel where the female protagonist is close to becoming a spinster. Persuasion is a very different type of novel with a love story told in retrospect, an unexpected villain, and an unintentional, but very bad piece of advice that negatively impacts many lives.The main protagonist in this book is Anne Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Sir Elliot was once a man of property and weath, but his ostentatious manner of living has considerably dimished his fortune. The great Elliot family retain only a much respected name and a fine estate named Kellynch Hall. Sir Walter is forced to confront his inability to retain the standard of living once enjoyed at the estate. He is asked to consider many options, including trimming down the number of servants, but all options seem appalling to the proud Sir Elliot.Under the advice of a family friend, Sir Elliot agrees to let Kellynch Hall and retire to Bath with his eldest and middle daughter. Sir Elliot is not the only one in the family who takes the advice of the much respected Lady Russell, a widow and friend of the deceased Lady Elliot.Anne Elliot was once engaged and very much in love with a poor, but honorable naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. Anne, however, broke off the engagement after Lady Russell convinced her that it would be a grave mistake for a young lady of her station to marry someone so far beneath her.Eight lonely years go by for Anne, and the years have not been kind to her. The author writes that her beauty has considerably dimished. One who may have known Anne years ago would hardly find her recognizable. Over the years, Anne has forced herself not to think \\"of that person\\" as Anne often refers to Frederick Wentworth. The reader is immediately aware of Anne's lingering feelings for the man she heartlessly and foolishly rejected.She is forced to confront her feelings when the family that leases Kellynch Hall turn out to be relations of now wealthy Captain Wentworth. There is much awkwardness and dread as Anne prepares to face the man she once loved and let go. Captain Wenworth, however, appears indifferent and one would hardly suspect from his cold behavior towards Anne that the two were ever even acquainted!Throughout the novel Anne desperately looks for and finds small little details in Captain Wentworth behavior that the love he had for her has not diminished entirely. But can he forgive her for snubbing him?I absolutely adored this novel about the one who got away, but there is so much more to the story than just Anne and Captain Wentworth. The book is full of lively characters, such as Anne's pompous father, her self-indulgent sister, Elizabeth, and many others. Most people are aquainted with Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but Persuasion should be recognized for the fine novel that it is."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the first JA book I've ever read, I really enjoyed it, and not in small part because of the footnotes, and discussion included in this penguin edition. It really helped me to understand the story and the times they were living in much better. If and when I do venture again into the classics genre I will look for others by this publisher to ease the transition from modern day reads."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is the best version of Persuasion on CDs! Amanda Root does an excellent job of reading Persuasion!!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I liked this book more then i thought i would but its slow for a while, i like it more as a book then i think a movie,I LOVE (Pride and Prejudice) as a movie,better then the book. so all n all a good read!!!!!...;)"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Would you let someone persuade you to leave the one you love? That is what Anne Elliot does. Frederick Wentworth is a dashing naval officer, but well beneath Anne's station. She is, after all, the daughter of Sir Walter Elliot, baronet and master of Kellynch Hall. Not only is Wentworth a penniless officer, he is also ambitious and confident. According to Anne's particular friend Lady Russell, those qualities are unbecoming in a man. And so, out of safety, Anne severs her engagement to Wentworth. Fast-forward eight years. Anne is now twenty-seven, still single, still disinclined to marry. Her father has little money and is now forced to let Kellynch Hall to a well-respected admiral. Among the admiral's society is Anne's former fianc&eacute;, now Captain Wentworth, well respected and very rich. Anne's love for Wentworth reemerges, but is it too late? Is his indifference so big that he won't even speak to her? Could she somehow persuade him to give their love another try?This is Jane Austen's final finished work. It was published in 1818, one year after her death. Persuasion is a masterpiece and my second favorite Austen (after Pride and Prejudice). This novel contains Austen's signature comedy of manners, but it's not her funniest effort. It is, however, her most romantic. Whose heart doesn't break when Anne watches Wentworth court both the Musgrove sisters, and listens to her sister and brother-in-law argue over who Wentworth should choose to be his bride? Who hasn't choked up with The Letter? (Persuasion fans know what I'm talking about.) This is the third -- or is it the fourth? -- time I read this book, and I still tear up when I read that bit! Persuasion is a wonderful novel, but it isn't perfect. Various secondary characters are either one-dimensional or underdeveloped, and I would have liked the scenes in Lyme to be expanded, for those are my favorite scenes. Alas, if you're an Austen fan, there is plenty of her signature stuff here: the pretentious gentry, the unscrupulous opportunists, the parties and get-togethers and courtships and descriptions of the countryside. I like that this novel is partly set in Bath, giving it the genuine Regency setting that makes Jane Austen unique. If you've never read Persuasion, I cannot persuade you to read this enough! And if you've read this and are a fan, may I perhaps persuade you to read it again?"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although also a romance like Austen's better known novels, Emma and Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion is a subtle one, with a theme not of whirlwind passion but of constancy and devotion. The main character, Anne Elliott, was very much in love with Captain Wentworth as a young girl, but was persuaded by friends and family to reject him as a husband. Broken-hearted, Wentworth went to sea, and the novel actually begins when he re-enters Anne's life eight years later, having made his career and his money.Anne is a character to whom the reader can easily relate: introspective, analyzing everything and flawed, able to make make mistakes and recover from them. She narrowly averts an unhappy life by not letting her friends and family persuade her again to marry her cousin, who has money and manners but turns out to be quite despicable. And while Captain Wentworth does not have the dash or charm of a Mr. Darcy, he is Anne's one true love, as prone to the follies of a broken heart as she is subject to the strong influence of those around her.The underlying theme is about choices and following one's heart. If Anne had only listened to her own feelings instead of allowing others to sway her, she would have found happiness sooner. Despite what seems like an afterthought of a speech at the end of the novel, when Anne justifies her earlier behavior, this seems to be a strongly feminist novel, advocating the rights of women to choose their own way in life and their own partners for life, rather than be guided solely by considerations of fortune and class.This is also one of Austen's funnier novels, particularly the scenes featuring Anne's sisters and father, who are incredibly self-absorbed. Their dialogue--constantly misreading the situation in their own favor or stating something when the opposite is true--brings a welcome lightheartedness to the story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"excellent book, love the characters and its an easy and quick read. i love reading the books more the watching the movies."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My favorite Jane Austen book.

Maybe it's the older heroine that makes it more relatable to me. Enjoy the journey through this book . It's not about getting to the end. It's a book that I've enjoyed reading again and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Sometimes there's nothing better than settling in with an old favorite. Austen's Persuasion is a story of rediscovering what is lost. More than lost, what was let go. With her apt view of society of the day, the story still bears out all these years later."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Just what you'd expect from a Jane Austen novel. Romance, suspense, jealousy, unrequited love, all of it. By far one of the best books I've read since Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen's books really draw the reader into the story and cause the reader to empethize with the heroine. She knows just how to tug at a person's heart strings through the plight of the main characters. A wonderful book, and one that I will read again and again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I love all Jane Austen's books, but this is my personal favorite. The way the characters interact is very humerous, but the story is touching. I feel more of a connection to Anne than to any of Austen's other characters, and I love the way she and Wentworth fall in love... again."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is a very good book. It's slower than the contemporary novel, which is to be expected (it is nearly 200 years old, after all). Like all of Austen's other novels, it is of course a social commentary. It's a story of delayed love and patience. It's been called her 'most romantic.' The idea of the old love, Captain Wentworth, coming back after years apart and both parties still being in love IS very romantic, but I disagree with it being her most romantic. It's a very sweet story, and also pretty straightforward. It was a lot of fun to read, and a good story."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As an avid fan of Jane Austen, I began reading \\"Persuasion\\" with great expectations. Although I cannot say I am dissapointed, I must admit I did not like Persuasion as much as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility.First of all, although I sympathized with Anne when he was slighted by her own family and she was taken no notice of in the company of foolish women just because she is not as pretty and \\"fragile\\" as them, maybe because she is not as strong and passionate a character as Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice, I could not particularly attach myself to her. Still, I read the novel from beginning to the end in a very short time because it has more than enough to keep our interest. Especially the character of Mrs. Croft, the sister of Captain Wentworth is worth notice; because among the \\"ailing\\" and \\"fatigued\\" women of the higher classes of that time, this woman who walks long distances with her husband, who accompanies him on long sea journeys and takes the reins of their carriage to manoeuvre out of the way of a post is very interesting. In this novel, Jane Austen says quiet a lot of things which can be thought quiet feministic. Well she says similar things in P&P;, for example she makes Darcy say that Elizabeth's complexion is greatly improved after a long walk, when Bingley's sisters criticize her for such an unlady-like behaviour.Another thing about the novel is that we don't really know the feelings of Captain Wentworth. It is true that the letter he writes to Anne at the end is full of love but I didn't feel his passion as I did Darcy's when he proposed to Elizabeth the first time.All in all, I recommend the book to readers who have read Austen's other novels. But as a first read it may not be so enjoyable as Pride and Prejudice or Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Though not as well known as the novels that established the author's name (Pride and Prejudice, Emma), Persuasion is certainly worth your time. It's extremely well-written with superb characterization. The plot isn't too original by today's standards, but is interesting nonetheless. Anne Elliot, the smartest and most pleasant by far of three upper class sisters, is 28 and still single. At 19 she fell in love with and almost married a dashing naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. However, great pressure from her family and relations &quot;persuaded&quot; her to reject Frederick due to his lower station in society. Frederick was greatly hurt and promptly went off to engage his energies in naval action.Eight and a half years later, Anne still hasn't met another guy she likes as much as Frederick and remains single. But now Frederick returns from war, retired, extremely wealthy from privateering with mercenaries, and more mature. He's ready to settle down and a chance family connection puts him back in the same neighborhood as Anne! He's still upset with Anne. And this time, other women are catching his eye too...While not up to the standards of Anne Bronte's outstanding The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Persuasion is a good classical romance novel. I think it beats out Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd on plot and characterization, though Hardy's prose is generally more powerful. Nevertheless, Austen can be quite poignant when she wants to be: Wentworth's shocking letter to Anne at the end of the book moved even me, a generally left-brained emotionless creature!A highlight of the novel is the illuminating social commentary that Austen subtly inserts into the prose. Clearly, she felt that the class system entrenched in British society at the time had its shortcomings. The endnotes in the Penguin edition do a good job of explaining the finer points of Austen's many jabs at class-conscious folks including Anne's self-absorbed father Walter and hopeless sister Elizabeth. Anne's other sister Mary is rendered superbly by Austen as a basically good-natured woman unfortunately marred by a touch of vanity. I personally know a Mary or two.Recommended to all adult readers!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm surprised that the other reviewers on this page are so lukewarm to Persuasion. True, it is not a perfect book, but I found it immensly enjoyable and well written. It is different to Austen's other novels, and having just finished Emma the difference was obvious to me, but it is also a completely different kind of book. It is written by an older and more serious woman than the one who penned Pride and Prejudice and Emma, and tells the story of an older, though still relatively young woman, who is haunted by a terrible choice she made several years ago to please her family and friends.The book is far more Romantic than anything else Austen wrote, and I also found it more streamlined and focussed. There are no chapters on how to set the table, like there were in Emma.I was a little disappointed in the end, as Austen doesn't record the conversation between Anne Eliot and Captain Wentworth, but instead tells us in a detached way what topics they spoke of. Still, that's a fairly minor quibble against what was really a very good book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"i've read this book twice, and it has highly recommended itself both the times. its a more mature work of jane austen perhaps it being her last book.anne elliot, the heroine is reserved, elegant and reflective ..she had fallen in love with a very desirable young man, wentworth, but his connections and moreso his position in society made it not all desirable for anne's beloved friend, lady l to allow her to continue her relationship.now 7 years later they meet again to renew their love and affection; he being a captain now and possessing a large enough fortune. though at first he receives the attentions of louisa musgrove and anne the attentions of her cousin, mr. elliot, the heir to her father, they soon come to realise that what felt from the heart is the truest meaning of love. with the help of her many friends anne soon returns the affections she once held for captain wentworth."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although the social formulas are not compatible with the present times, I was moved by the power of the emotions and the psychology of all the characters.

It starts out very slow, but once you get into the story, it is splendid."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is the 6th published novel by Jane Austen. Anne Elliott is a sweet 27-year-old woman of good breeding and integrity. She is intelligent, thoughtful, considerate. This may come as a surprise, given that, after losing her mother at 14, she has been encumbered with a father, Sir Walter Elliot, and an older sister, Miss Elizabeth, who are both vain spendthrifts and find her inconsequential; both of whom are blind to the fact that Elizabeth's poorer \\"friend\\", the fawning Mrs Clay, is intent on marrying Sir Walter to become Lady Elliot. Her younger, married sister, Mary is selfish and self-centred. The only person in her life who cares about her at all is a friend of her mother's, Lady Russell, who, when Anne was nineteen, persuaded her not to accept the offer of sailor Frederick Wentworth, as he had no position. Lady Russell tries to persuade Anne, when her estranged cousin, William, heir to the Elliot estate, reappears, that it would be prudent to accept his offer. But Anne is suspicious of his change of attitude. This is the last full novel written by Jane Austen, probably her most mature novel, and it is a great pity she died not long after this novel was completed. This novel has intrigue and humour and, of course, romance. Truly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My Thoughts:Persuasion is one of my favorite movie adaptations in the world. I could watch the Masterpiece Theater version over and over without getting sick of it. That's how much I love it. Since I had never read a Jane Austen book before, I decided to go with that one for my Summer Romance Challenge. I have to admit it was not easy at first. The very beginning with the details on the family and friends of the family was a struggle to get through. I think the reason why is because I know the story so well from the movie. Once more dialogue came about, it became very enjoyable.Anne Elliot was once engaged to Frederick Wentworth when she was very young. Since her friend Lady Russell didn't approve of the match, she persuaded Anne to break off the engagement. Fast forward eight years later. Anne's father Sir Walter and sister Elizabeth have nearly brought the family to bankruptcy. They have to let the house to someone while they get things back to where it should be financially. The person who takes up residency is Admiral and Mrs. Croft. And guess who happens to be the brother of Mrs. Croft? You guessed it--Frederick, now Captain Wentworth.So now Anne is forced into being around him often, watching him from afar, imagining him as not wanting anything to do with her. Especially when it seems he is preferring the company of another. As time goes on, he gets to see a different side of her, how selfless she is. And when it seems he is attentive to her, Mr. Elliot, her cousin, seems to be very interested in Anne. But where does Anne stand? Does she have a chance with Frederick again?Like I said, this is one of my favorite movie adaptations. Reading the book was like icing on the cake, completely put it all into perspective, getting into the mind of the characters. Jane Austen really is an amazing author. I wish I hadn't taken so long to read one of her novels. Definitely one of the best classics I've read so far.My Rating:Very Good... Stay up late"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is only the second Jane Austen book I have read, having read Pride and Prejudice some time ago. It took me a little while to get into it. The early chapters feel like they get bogged down in bringing us up to date with the back story. However it's worth persevering as the book gets much easier to read as it develops. Jane Austen's observations on society of that time and the way that she captures the feelings of the protagonists feel so fresh and modern that at times it is hard to believe that the book was written almost 200 years ago.The heroine is Anne Elliott, the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliott: a vain and snobbish man who has been living beyond his means for some time. For financial reasons he decides to rent out his family home, Kellynch Hall, and moves to Bath with his oldest daughter who shares his obsession with status and appearances. Anne goes to stay for a time with her younger sister, Mary, who is married and lives nearby. Anne is easily the most likeable of the three girls, but is still single at the age of 27. Several years ago she met the love of her life, Captain Wentworth, but she was \\"persuaded\\" by her friends and family that he was not an appropriate match for her. She has never forgotten him.As it happens, Captain Wentworth comes back into her life, as it is his sister who has hired Kellynch Hall. However he appears to no longer have any interest in Anne and spends his time with the daughters of Mary's husband's family. In the meantime a new suitor has come into Anne's life, being her father's probable heir. He is pleasant and polite and certainly a good catch - but she finds it hard to let her feelings for Captain Wentworth go. When she finally realises who she is meant to be with, the book feels as alive and the romance as intense as any chicklit novel you might read today.I read the Brandywine edition of the book. The font size is quite small and densely packed. I probably would have preferred to read another version with an easier layout to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This book may be pure fantasy, but it is my favorite Jane Austen novel. Who doesn't enjoy the idea of love lasting, even after betrayal, for so long. Anne made a mistake, but all is not lost.

You can feel it jump out at you from the pages and so like the unforgettable characters that make up all Jane Austen's BooksA true masterpiece"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"SLIGHT SPOILERSSo, Persuasion. Austen has an uncanny ability to create characters who are so petty and unlikable that one simply wants to put the book down, for lack of someone with sense. This problem, for me, brings Northanger Abbey to its knees, and weighs down Persuasion for the first seventy pages. It's a while before we get to be inside Anne Elliot's head, and in the meantime we must satisfy ourselves with her imbecilic, preening father and his protegee daughter, Elizabeth. But finally, we get to Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth, to marriage intrigue and the questioning of glances and motives--all of the things for which one absolutely loves Austen. This book provides the goods, so don't give up on it too early.Persuasion is it's own creature, however. I was immediately struck by the difference in style from her earlier book Pride and Prejudice; in Persuasion, Austen strings together dependent clauses as though the story desperately required the reader to be in suspense as to what verb she will next employ. Take, for instance, the reader's first impression of Bath:\\"They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer; the rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.\\"Some will take pleasure in reading these lines, but I personally think they do her no credit. At its best, her prose style is lucid, and suffused with that clean, English wit we expect. That being said, I find Austen more charming than aesthetically stunning, and to my tastes, her simplicity of style adds to that charm. Her convolutions detract from it.This issue was exacerbated by the decision of the editor, Gillian Beer, to not standardize punctuation. Austen has a tendency to interrupt an otherwise complete clause with a comma, which is off-putting to modern readers and detracts from her otherwise fluid style. Likewise, there has been no attempt to regulate her use of the semicolon, which 19th century authors used with abandon. Beer might argue that these editorial decisions might affect interpretation, but I never noticed a moment when emphasis might depend upon an otherwise superfluous comma. Furthermore, if there had been any instance where punctuation greatly affected meaning, I think Beer would have mentioned it in her notes--she was so very thorough. Incidentally, this lack of editorial judiciousness brings me to my final contention with the edition.While there are different opinions as to the proper domain of footnotes, I believe they exist for only a few purposes. 1.) They should explain historical and cultural references that may otherwise be outside the reader's ken. 2.) They should explain a historical use of a word that a modern reader may otherwise not know. 3.) They should give manuscript variations, when applicable. They should not (in my opinion) explain turns of phrase, or help the reader interpret the plot, or offer critiques of the novel. My reasoning is that these three tasks belong to the reader; for an editor to do all the heavy lifting actually detracts from the pleasure of reading the book. For instance, when Mr. Elliot implies that he would like to marry Anne, he says,\\"The name of Anne Elliot,\\" said he, \\"has long had an interesting sound to me. Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change.\\"To this excellent, shining line of dialogue, Beer graciously provides a footnote: \\"An oblique proposal: her name and his are the same, Elliot.\\" This is completely unnecessary, and for me mars the beauty of the original sentence. Also, it is inconceivable that the reader might not yet know that both Anne and Mr. Elliot share the same last name, as this exchange occurs late in the book. Unfortunately, this is not the only stupid footnote in the Penguin edition. For the sake of space, I will refrain from listing any others.On the whole, this is a fine novel; not as accomplished as some of Austen's other work, but very engaging and fun to read. She seems to be a bit more moralistic as here well, which is not to my taste, but may be to others. Oh that Mr. Elliot and his \\"Sunday travelling\\"--ought he not to be in church? My only complaint with the novel itself (other than the occasional tortuous/torturous sentence) is the speedy resolution, which I felt could have benefited from a couple more scenes concerning the novel's two main antagonists--a confrontation would have been nice here. Also, I felt Austen took the easy way out by not forcing Anne to make a choice between two eligible suitors. Otherwise, if you like Austen, this is probably exactly what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was my first foray into Jane Austen. I must admit it took a while for me get accustomed to the literary style, but once I got into the flow of it, I quite enjoyed it. I am looking forward to reading more of her classic works!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although I am an English major and have always loved reading, I confess that when I picked up Persuasion, it was the first Jane Austen book I had ever actually read. Watching the films had made me love the stories, but I had never truly experienced the original text. This is the only one I have read so far, and so declaring it my favorite seems a stretch. However I can say with confidence that at this moment, I can't think of another book I've read this year that I liked half so well.The characters in the book have personalities that range from immature to mature, logical to illogical, playful to disdainful, and shallow to deeply heartfelt. Jane Austen has a true talent of capturing real people, in moments of weakness, in strength, and just about everything in between. Anne's sister Mary is one who feels that the world is never quite kind enough to her, while her father feels a lack of need to be terribly kind to the world. Lady Russell, a friend and mentor of the heroine Anne, is logical and sensitive to family connection so much so that occasionally she cannot see the inherent flaws in those whom she is trying to reconnect. The main character, Anne, is a complex creature through whose eyes it is fascinating to watch the world. She is sweet and humble, yet occasionally sarcastic and unfailingly realistic.Another aspect of the book is the implicit value of integrity. Anne does not do anything which she feels to be untrue or unworthy, and she stands up for what she believes in despite the disapproval of her worldly father. One example of this is when she decides to visit an old school mate who has been both widowed and crippled instead of going with her father and sister to visit Lady Dalrymple, a distant cousin of the family who hold a title of nobility. Consistently throughout the book, there is a deep and unwavering determination to do the right thing.Jane Austen is able to capture the complex relationships between people and the intricacies of human nature in beautiful and captivating language, and her skill of tone allow the reader to be completely transported and involved in the world she writes from. I look forward to reading the rest of the books as soon as I can, for through fiction she seems to speak poignantly about my life in a way I couldn't. Sometimes she goes against the adage of \\"Show don't tell,\\" by summarizing conversations and describing peoples attributes without allowing the reader to see them in action. However, this is a matter of style, and no great downfall for the book itself."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Take this opportunity to read Persuasion, it will take your breath away.Anne Elliot was \\"forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older.\\" She was not given the choice by her family and friends to marry the man that she loved and who loved her. She sent Fredrick Wentworth away to the navy with no promise of ever having their love renewed. Fredrick spends his time in the navy honorably, becoming a captain, and tries his best to forget Anne. Anne, left at home, realizes what a mistake it was to ignore her heart and follow the advice of those who she thought she trusted.Persuasion takes place almost ten years after these events when fate pulls these star-crossed lovers together again. They must find a way to forgive each other, one for being sent away, and the other for never returning.Jane Austen wrote Persuasion at the end of her life, and thus had a different perspective while writing it then she did when writing all the rest of her books. This is the only Austen book written after the two protagonists have met and fallen in love. Austen pulls you into Anne's story, demanding that you stick around until you know what happens between Anne and Wentworth. The reader can easily see the emotions that both Anne and Wentworth feel, while both characters are blind to the feelings of the other.Anne taught me that I have to trust my heart. I can listen to the people in my life that I trust, but they will not be able to tell me what to do to be happy. Anne becomes miserable because she followed the advice of those she loved, but she doesn't blame them because she realizes that they told her to do what they thought was best. I enjoyed watching Anne grow and become an amazing woman who knows what she wants and is willing to stand up to the people in her life.One issue that I had with this book is the language that is used in it; it was not written for our day. The language is archaic and difficult to decipher. It is best to know the basic plot before reading this book or else you will get lost in the details of what is happening. However, the joy that is elicited from being part of Anne's life is without a doubt worth the effort."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Somehow I never read this one and found it to be a good read with Good Writing by a very good author"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Everything was as expected.

Unlike other Austen's, it wasn't full of young and overwhelming love. However, the more I pondered it and reread it, the more I enjoyed its honesty. The main storyline moves slowly but surely and I found myself invested in each decision made, willing the characters to bend to my will. Definitely one of the most hopeful and satisfying endings and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My first impression of Persuasion was that Jane Austen writes some interesting and detailed characters. Right from page one, Sir Walter was my favorite character. He's a jerk, yeah, but he's hilarious. I don't know that the characters in this book are as modern as they are in say Pride and Prejudice, but the author's brutal honesty, especially about the less appealing characters, is always entertaining. The whole story made me really think about how much other people influence our lives and whether or not that is always a good thing.And can Jane Austen write a romance. The flirting, the dashing hero that you want but can't have, and that beautiful love letter! I do have to say that there was one major climactic scene that just felt cheesy to me. Oh the horror! Other than that, it was refreshing and fun to read a Jane Austen novel that I didn't even know existed until a few years ago."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Yet another great story by Ms. Austin.

(So many commas.) But as I began to get into the story it held me entralled. I could easily visualize the characters and relate to their feelings. The discriptions are so appealing of the countryside in which the story takes place. Ms Austen paints a broad picture with her words.I found it very hard to put down. I wasn't sure that I could enjoy this book on the Kindle but found it just as engrossing as a hard cover book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Although a genius in providing commentary on her time, I have often struggled with the way Austen reveals the inevitable love interest in early in her novels.

This is quite frankly well written happy tales - much like today's best sellers in pink dust jackets. Persuasion is very similar to Pride and Prejudice - the mood is the same, the excessive one-dimensional characters are the same and the message is quite similar. Still, the strength of the novel, apart from some splendid literary gymnastics, is how it does not take itself very seriously at all. It seems as if Austen simply wanted to write another \\"pretty little piece\\". Call it formulaic, if you like, but Austen knew her strength, as well as her audience.The heroine, Anne, is quite delightful - similar to Elizabeth Bennet in her thoughts and actions. The vain father figure, Sir Walter Eliot, is as comedic as her hypochondriac sister, Mary. The villain, however, is not as good as her other ones - he is bland and dreary, and not all that deliciously bad.My favorite parts of the story are the various observasions of female beauty. Of what does it consist - and how does it change through time? A woman's \\"years of dread\\" are still her thirties - if she is unmarried, that is. The lamentations over hideous crows feet, freckles, faded or coarse skin and the general loss of blom are in many ways just as prevalent in current female literature...Recommended as a sweet little treat - nothing more, but nothing less."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I can't stop reading this book andthe fact that it has kind of an old english doesn't seem to bother me at all."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not only did I receive my purchase in a timely manner, but I also found the book to be in excellent condition and exactly what I asked for.

It is also poignant, thought-provoking, heart-wrenching, satirical... I re-read it at least once a year, and am always amazed at how much Anne's story has come to mean to me.This book makes me laugh and it makes me cry. It combines all the elements that make an Austen novel an Austen novel. Sir Walter is a most hilarious buffoon, Mr. Elliot is as evil a villain as there can be, Mary is the quintessential spoiled, selfish baby sister, and Captain Wentworth (sigh) is her most dashing, romantic hero. Yes, I will always have a soft spot in my heart for Darcy, but his love and devotion were not tested for &quot;eight years and a half.&quot; IMNSHO, someone who is NOT moved by Captain Wentworth's letter has a heart of stone."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is a novel written by Jane Austen during the Regency Period in England. It was a time where single women were not allowed to be left unchaperoned with a gentleman. A time where people wouldn't dare say impolite things to others, and marriage was a way to improve your wealth, circumstance, and station.This is one of the 6 completed novels written by Jane Austen, while this one isn't as popular and famous as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" that does not mean it is without merit or any less worthy of praise. If you found yourself liking the movie or book \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" you should give this one a try.Our herione \\"Anne Elliot\\" is the middle daughter out of three. Her mother died when she was young, her father is a silly, vain, and selfish man who spent so much money they are now facing financial troubles. They live in a lovely home called \\"Kellylynch Hall\\" which they must leave to find cheaper lodgings. Now they rent their home out to this couple (Admiral and Mrs. Croft) and take up residence in Bath.Anne is an admirable heroine. One with much sense, honesty, and simplicity. Her two other siblings are not so worthy, her oldest sister takes after their father, selfish, vain, alway self-promoting. Her younger sister is already married with children and very needy. She is also very selfish and a little bit of a hypochondriat.Now when Anne's family leaves for Bath she does not go with them, instead she stays close to their family home while staying with her younger sister. Here Anne is able to live without the shadow of her family, make acquaintances, and be of much usefullness towards everyone. She soon meets up with Captain Wentworth, who proposed to her eight and half years ago and was rejected. Anne did not reject him because she did not love him, she was persuaded by her family. What will they do now seeing each other again after eight and a half years?Overall the story was a very intersting read, you grew very interested in all the characters and their personalities as you always do when you read Jane Austen. It is one of her shorter books around 250 pages. The beginning is the only hard part to read, you might lose interest there but keeping reading it gets better real soon.This edition includes a chapter that was omitted in the completed version, it was kind of a first draft option and Jane Austen chose another scene instead. I don't know if other versions of this book have that chapter. It was interesting to see the alternative ideas Jane Austen had."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, Jane Austen's last novel, is the story of Anne Elliott and Frederick Wentworth, two young lovers who are persuaded to be separated rather than marrying when they first fall in love around age nineteen because of lack of prospects. The story picks up eight years later when circumstances have changed and the now Captain Wentworth has returned to the area with a successful career and Anne's family is now reduced in financial status. Anne wonders if perhaps Frederick might still harbor feelings for her, but this being Austen, things never go smoothly and there is quite a lot of wondering and subterfuge, and colorful characters to keep things amusing.This is not my favorite Austen; things started off quite slowly and there is not a great deal of dialogue. I did enjoy the fact that Frederick and Anne rediscovered each other relatively later in their lives, and as always, the build-up to the happy ending kept me smiling. While Persuasion doesn't have quite the emotional zing that Austen's earlier works do, it is still enjoyable. I doubt there's such a thing as an Austen novel that won't capture you in some way, and Persuasion accomplishes just that in its subtle, quiet style."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Those who read PERSUASION by Jane Austen tend to view it as a book primarily concerned with marriage in the typical Austen romantic comedy sense of young ladies seeking to marry upward and young men also seeking partners--but not necessarily to each other. While much of Austen's novel deals with precisely that, to view this solitary strand of thought as Austen's most telling point is surely to miss that point totally. In PERSUASION, Austen took her earlier PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and sought to show that her view on how single women relate to their families, their friends, their proposed husbands and to society at large underwent a significant change from the latter to the former.In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, Austen places Elizabeth Bennett squarely in the traditional role of the 18th century woman who sought somehow to gain economic equality with men in such a way so as not to upset or circumvent the established social order that dictated that women must obey their parents and marry the men whom they selected as suitable candidates. Miss Bennett uses reason and general smarts to cause changes in Darcy that would in turn cause changes in the larger social order that acted as a behind the scenes puppeteer. The comedy then was a function of a small change in Miss Bennett causing a larger one in Darcy. In PERSUASION, Austen takes the similar plot of a young woman breaking up with a man that perhaps needed breaking up with and updated it to include Anne Elliot doing much the same thing with Captain Wentworth. In Elizabeth Bennett's case, Darcy determined not be chased away. In Anne Eliot's case, Wentworth made no such determination and left the scene for eight years. The difference between the two acts of breaking up and their respective reconciliations did not lay in a profound change in the social order. What changed was Jane Austen, who became more finely attuned to the winds of Romanticism that were then wafting from one country to another. The relentless focus on rationalism that dominated the Augustan Age had slowly morphed over just a few decades to one in which human feeling and emotion trumped human reason.Austen, in her choice of \\"Persuasion\\" as the title, subtly implied that what was at stake was not simply potential marriage partners waltzing a predictable if unstable dance towards the altar. Rather, she wished to point the reader in the direction of seeing not only how and why persuasive rhetoric might impact on lovers' lives, but also to ascertain the consequences of treating emotional people as if they were devoid of those emotions. In Miss Bennett's case, \\"persuasion\\" was used in the context of rational discourse used to alter the world view of Darcy. In Anne Elliot's case, it was used to fortify the existing social order at the expense of using \\"right reason\\" to convince Anne to break up with Wentworth on the grounds that he was simply too low on the economic and social pecking order to marry a woman who is supposed to be a few rungs higher than he. Actually, Austen satirizes Anne by implying that, if anything, her loftier position in society, exists mostly in her and her father's eyes, not at society's at large. Anne differs from Elizabeth Bennett in that in PERSUASION, Anne sees that she has erred in being falsely persuaded but is allowed to show and vent emotion in re-establishing accepted marital order even if the somewhat stodgier and old-fashioned social order balks. As Anne Elliot uses both head and heart to win back the love of a man who felt rightfully scorned for no good reason, Jane Austen focused attention on basic human romantic entanglements that for many frustrated lovers remain tangled even today."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of Austen's shorter, simpler pieces, sweet and charming without as much intrigue as her other novels. It tells the story of sweet, quiet, even-tempered Anne Elliot, a plain spinster disregarded by her family because she is not attractive enough for them. Anne's only share of romance had been years before, with a naval man deemed beneath her --- a man named Wentworth, who she was persuaded to reject because of his lower connections.Anne's father is a lazy spender who cares more for his vanity and title than his family, and spends them all to the point of bankruptcy and they are forced to move to Bath, giving up their long-time home of Kellynch Hall. While the rest of the family moves, Anne is left to take care of the more menial tasks and visit her sister --- a woman who delights in \\"fancying herself ill.\\" While visiting Mary and her family, Anne is once again thrown into the company of Wentworth --- now CAPTAIN Wentworth.As is typical of Jane Austen, this novel is filled with charm, wit, and humor. The story is perfectly thought-out, with just enough twists to keep it interesting, and enough romance to make you sigh. The characters are flawlessly designed.I laughed and I cried in this novel. After \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" this is my favorite of hers."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Any person considering reading PERSUASION by Jane Austen must have several thoughts in mind before beginning. This book is a classic, written by a master. It requires an investment of your time, your patience, your understanding and your attention. It is a book to be savored, not galloped through as if it were a modern fiction bodice ripper. If you are willing to approach this book with an open mind, expecting only to receive pleasure from the written word, you will most likely enjoy it tremendously.I read a lot of modern romance fiction. One of the things I have noticed on researching a book through the Amazon review system before I buy it is that so often reviewers state that they were able to finish the book in two hours, three hours, four hours. Do they honestly think that is a compliment to the author? One thing I can guarantee here, you will never be able to say that about PERSUASION. Slow down, read for pleasure, read for the pure joy of observing Jane Austen's manner of combining words. Her punctuation style is totally different from modern fiction. It requires that you hold thoughts in your mind long enough for her to have completed her lengthy and complicated sentence structure.Fans of Jane Austen often say that one specific book is their favorite. My favorite is the one I happen to be reading at the time. I've read them all multiple times and am always able to find nuggets of pleasure either not noticed before or now understood from a fresh perspective. PERSUASION is a book which shows very clearly Miss Austen's feelings on the English class system and how appearances are very often deceiving. Anne Elliot's own family is (in their minds at least) in the top strata of society. In actual fact, they are very small fish in a wide pond and do not amount to much except when within their own corner of England. Anne spends much time with the Musgrove family and all those surrounding that happy, boisterous group. Although lower in the social standings, they are loving, kind and generous, traits which are totally lacking in her own father and older sister. Anne is considered of no consequence to her family yet is loved and admired by those outside her social set who can see her value and worth. This is a story of young love lost with the opportunity to reclaim that love when maturity has given new insights into reasons, details and personalities. This book does not specifically leave you with a \\"happily ever after\\" feeling. Anne will never be mistress of Kellynch-hall, probably never even live there again. Captain Wentworth is a career naval officer with all that implies in his future service during wars. And yet, you cannot help but feel that Anne and Frederick will be quietly, calmly, gloriously happy for their remaining days. Partially because of the eight long years of separation which allowed them both to mature and grow and partially because they are just so very right for each other.Do not begin reading this book expecting a \\"romance\\" novel as written today. If you do, you are doomed to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I recently finished reading Jane Austen's Persuasion. It wasn't originally within my reading plans for the year, but I was inspired to read it by both The Lake House and the recent Pride and Prejudice film.Jane Austen's work is notable for reflecting on the class structure of its times. Written in the early 1800s, at the time of the end of the Napoleonic Wars, England's upper classes are well structured, with rules in place to dictate exactly who has greater stature, and constricting how discourse occurs, and how romance should proceed. In Persuasion, the main character Anne Elliot finds herself ruing the decision she made some 8 years previously, that saw her send away the man she loved, because her family saw that the man had little stature. Well, he went off to fight in the Wars, and has come back, as many have come back, with greatly changed riches and improved stature. Anne finds herself still in love with the man in question, and over time the poor man finds that he has not changed his thoughts either, and they persuade themselves to re-unite, and marry, finally.Some of what's observed, herein, is how the rules of society are changing to accommodate the newly-rich...and how Austen distinguishes between \\"gentlemen\\" (those who act as good people) and those with stature, but then doesn't allow her characters to be guided towards the gentlemen so easily. In today's terms, we would think Anne Elliot foolish for turning her back on love because her parent says the man is not a good match, because of stature, but these things happen even today. So, I think in this respect that the novel remains a good reflection on how poorly people navigate through the minefields of love, and how poorly people can themselves fare when they don't act according to their own true wishes.This was Austen's last completed novel, as I understand it. It was a little more adult in terms of how it handled its themes, and it surprised me with some of its skill. A major character nearly dies part-way through the story; it happens abruptly, and it is handled as a natural abrupt event in a way that was momentarily shocking...a true sign of skill. Definitely, this is worth a read for fans of novels of this time period."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"It being my 27th year of spinsterhood (the same age of our heroine Anne Elliot), and being Austen-inclined, I picked up (and consequently couldn't put down) my beloved, aged Complete Works of Jane Austen in order to reread Persuasion, a close third favorite (only just after her masterpiece P&P and the profound S&S). Oh, Jane, how I love you, my most favorite author. So funny; I was cackling with laughter at your comedic timing, your witty and ironic eye, and your amazing attention to detail in human psychology, character, and behavior. Not just moved to laughter, but even to tears (Captain Wentworth's final love letter still gives me collywobbles). Falling into Jane's books is like falling into a vat of literary chocolate. Oh, yes, there is the beautiful love story (one of her absolute best, by far her most mature, perhaps her most moving and emotional) between the broken-hearted and angry Captain Wentworth and the spinster, past-her-prime Anne Elliot, torn asunder years before because she was persuaded that he was unworthy of her, now reunited, yet distant. (How Jane so perfectly and honestly describes the pining, unrequited heart!) But--as with all of Jane's works--the love story is really only a vehicle for her greater messages and observations about society, reality, human psychology--messages that are still profoundly pertinent. It's not only that her characters and situations could be walking around onto on our concrete streets. It's that Jane knew humanity down to its core two hundred years ago. When her incredibly real and troubled characters find romance, it is a meeting of internal discovery. Persuasion, needless to say, is about the necessity of finding the balance between yielding to outside forces (i.e. advice) and staying true to your own desires and conscience. What human being hadn't had to contend with that? This book is perfection itself. Still powerful, meaningful, humorous, moving, and utterly delightful. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The magic and sheer excellence of 'Persuasion' lies in the personalities of the variouscharacters: Anne Elliot, the heroine of the book, is quiet, caring and proper but beneaththat surface of hers, she's a woman who has loved and lost. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot,and her sister, Elizabeth are like mirror images of each other, both are shallow, self-proclaimedsnobs and conceited. Captain Frederick Wentworth, Anne's love from her past, is just excellent!He's the male image of Regency cool: tall, handsome, a man of hard work and lady-killer.As a novel, 'Persuasion' is a thoughtful insight into the women left behind because ofbad choices, yet it is never self-pitying. I couldn't understand why while I was reading the bookand at the end, I saw what Austen was trying to show.That is the wicked factor of 'Persuasion', Austen allows you to eitherbe persuaded or dissuaded.As a social commentary, it is subtle in how it mocks certainaspects of society such as the 'dandies' of Regency England, the men who indulged in vanity,personified by Sir Walter Elliot. Yet, the books acts as a platform for the debate of marriagebegs the question, is marrying outside your station suicidal?One critic said that 'Persuasion' was like a Regency version of the Cinderella tale: Anne Elliotis Cinderella, Cpt. Frederick Wentworth her Prince Charming and Lady Russell as theWicked Stepmother. This is a blatant over-simplification! Persuasion is at first sight abeautifully crafted and touching romance but is also a book of many layers.Last Thought: Enough to convert an Austen cynic into an Austenian."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\" accomplishes the feat of rewarding both extremely casual and deeper, more analytical readings. It certainly contains enough genuine insight into humanity, and social relationships in particular, to be considered a \\"serious\\" novel. But \\"Persuasion\\" defies the stereotype that accompanies this genre. Rather than being ponderous and solemn, it is instead a work of sheer joy to read. Readers are treated to a complex novel that reads like a summer beach book.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of \\"Persuasion\\" is how it balances the depth and richness with pure entertainment. Anne, her sisters, her father, and of course Captain Wentworth, are all very complex and fully fleshed-out characters. At the same time, however, they are all delightful people to read about. Anne in particular is charming and compassionate. Austen's prose is wonderful; witty, intelligent, and clear. And the story itself, a tale of people in love, is universal in its appeal and yet never once becomes formulaic. The novel, then, is a fantastic success in every possible way. It provides the richness of great literature with the charm of the greatest writers. I can't recommend \\"Persuasion\\" highly enough."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's Persuasion stands shoulder to shoulder with the best of the author's work. Emma and Pride & Prejudice are equally extraordinary novels and I don't think one has to engage in a tug of war over which is best: each has its charms and delights. The story of Anne Elliot, who enters into an engagement at age 20, only to succumb to family pressure and break it off, is 28 and alone when we meet her. Time has proven what she instinctively knows: Frederick Wentworth was the right man for her and she was foolish to let him go.His reappearance sets the stage for what is, at once a masterpiece of comedy, romance and satire. Anne's vainglorious father and sisters are deftly skewered, but in that mocking but never mean Austen style. The appearance of an estranged cousin and Captain Wentworth's apparent attachment to a neighborhood belle complicates matters wonderfully until we reach the inevitable happy conclusion.What sets this novel apparent, I think are two characteristics. Picking up the story eight years after Anne's mistake is a wonderful device. We don't meet a perfectly sensible woman (Elizabeth Bennett) or a delightful ingenue (Emma Woodhouse). Anne Elliot is a mature woman, indeed by social standards close to an old maid, and one left to regret her own poor judgment. Her situation is one any empathetic reader can identify with (who hasn't judged wrongly in Romance?) and creates a humility that is quite appealing. Unlike Elizabeth and Emma who need to learn the error of their ways, Anne already knows--she simply needs to be excused them.Secondly, unlike some Austen works, characters are far more dimensional. Anne is weak, but well-intended. Wentworth acknowledges he is bitter and resentful and acknowledges he fails to initiate a reconciliation out of pride, losing further years they might have been together. Elliot pere and Elliot the heir are quite cartoonish as is sister Elizabeth. However Anne's friend and confident and her sister Mary are more nuanced and therfore more appealing than most of Austen's minor characters.Is Persuasion worth reading? Without a doubt! Where does it fit in the Austen cannon? I think in the first rank. But everyone should decide for themselves."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Austen's last is one of the famed four -- Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, and this novel, the most melancholy but also perhaps most romatic of the quartet. I also highly recommend the filmPersuasion"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I started reading this novel years ago, when I was reading all of Jane Austen, and I didn't finish it. It was too tense and agonizing. The suspense was almost painful: here is this young woman in her late twenties, still in love with a man she rejected because of family pressure eight years ago, and he comes back into her life. At first he seems cold and distant, but then she begins to think that maybe he still loves her too. But in this society, the woman can't speak first. She can't simply say to him, \\"I still love you, and I'm sorry I didn't accept your proposal eight years ago. I was given bad advice by my family.\\" No, she has to wait for him to put aside his pride and ask if maybe she's changed her mind about him. She's on pins and needles the whole time, and there are terrible humiliations, and she's treated very badly by her family, but in the end it all works out.Still, it's so painful to think that women once lived like this: utterly dependent on marriage for survival; dreading being an old maid; prevented from doing any kind of real work at all; prisoners of a rigid class system; and silenced by rigid gender role conventions."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed work before her death. It differs from her other more well known works such as Pride & Prejudice, and Emma. It focuses on a relationship who have a second chance to re-ignite true love but whether or not they will depends on so many things that make a good story and are still applicable today.A crazy family, social expectations, unforgiveness, competing love interests, and a little bit of that classic Austen wit that bites in just the right places.It's shorter than Austen's other works as well, and the plot less complicated and detailed than Pride & Prejudice and Mansfield Park.If for no other reason than the famous \\"you pierce my soul\\" letter, this should be a must on everyone's read list."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Persuasion is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Persuasion, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, works inspired by Persuasion,comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The story is good but I don't like the edittion, is to small and for me is hard to read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"One can get lost in this story and spend some time in places of beauty, both in the heart and in the world.

Austen had only 11 months to live when she completed it in 1816. Austen is the best writer in the language at taking a few upper-middle class rural families, a few love stories and arch social commentary into the heady mix that is her literary genius! Her observations of the social mores and balls, clothing style, music, literature, architecture and daily life of Regency England(1811-1820-the Prince Regent George IV assumed responsibility while his father George III became insane). is superb in its comic prose.The tale's main theme is how humans are persuaded to perform and also avoid moral actions which will determine how they live their lives. Eight years prior to the novel's opening we learn that Anne Eliot had earlier rejected the proposal of British naval officer Frederick Wentworth. She was persuaded to pursue this action due to the advice of her of a well meaning wealthy woman.Now Anne's impecunious and fatuously highfaultin baronet of a father has to lease his home due to pay his many debts. Her older sister Elizabeth is a hypocritcal prig who has to be one of the most odious creatures in Austen's work. Captain Wentworth returns to the village of Kellynch since his sister and her husband have rented the Eliot home. (they have departed for the watering hole of Bath). Eventually Anne and her Wentworth met, reconcile and are wed. Along the way we meet such characters as Anne's idiotic sister Mary and her husband who spends most of his time hunting. There are also a few subsidary love stories featuring Anne's siblings and the Musgrave girls. The fall of Lousia Mulgrave off the cob at Lyme is famous at is shows Anne that Wentworth still has feelings of love for her.The novel is lighter and less complex than such tomes as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", \\"Mansfield Park\\" and \\"Emma.\\" It was published in four volumes along with Jane's early work \\"Northanger Abbey\\" following her early death.One is left to wonder how many more small but elegant literary gems would have been produced by Miss Austen. Her books take us back over 150 years to a relatively stable and staid society. If one would be allowed b by the literary gods to invite three authors to dinner this reviewer would choose: Samuel Johnson, Oscar Wilde and Jane Austen. \\"Persuasion\\"will be broadcast on the BBC production to be shown on Masterpiece Theatre this autumn. Hopefully viewers of the series will turn to the real McCoy and enjoy the many pages of the preacher's kid named Jane!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I especially love the extra information for further study that is provided within this edition.

It is a beautifully written story, and every Jane Austen fan should read it. One of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel. I love Anne. Despite being a sensible heroine, she's also a true romantic and I can completely relate to that. Even the sensible girls love and want to be loved in return.

She's never gotten over her first love, Frederick Wentworth, whom she was convinced not to marry, as he lacked both status and wealth. Now, at 27, she's fated to be a spinster for life, passed back and forth between her father and equally status-conscious elder sister and her hypocondriac, self-centered younger sister.Frederick Wentworth, on the other hand, did not pine away, but joined the Royal Navy and made a not-inconsiderable fortune. A series of strange events forces them into each other's company again, but Anne is reluctant to show any favoritism for fear of looking like a fortune hunter, and Captain Wentworth has no desire to be burned again.This is one of Jane Austen's quieter novels. We know from the beginning Anne and the Captain will fall in love all over again -- the enjoyment is in getting there. Not quite up there with her other novels, in my opinion, but if you're a fan of Jane Austen or just the genre, it's worth a read."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I'm slowly becoming a Jane Austen fan.

I did my share of Jane Austen in English classes, a long time ago, but picking up Persuasion this Thanksgiving Day holiday, I could not put it down, where in the past, I could. I am in my forties now and seem to have gained a deeper appreciation for Anne Eliot's heroic character-- heroic in the moral sense...if we had had Anne Eliots for Wallstreet Bankers we would not be in the trouble we are in now, and truly, honestly, Austen is superb in subtly building her arc of suspense with enough plot twists worthy of any Hollywood blockbuster...which is why, if she had lived today she'd be a Nora Ephron and have a great movie out every other year.The novel also served as the proverbial mirror, or as so many have argued, true art is holding up a mirror to Nature...looking into that mirror myself, I felt many personal shortcomings vis a vis patient and virtuous Anne, and I think the next generation, my children's generation which I think of as the \\"on demand\\" generation would greatly benefit from exploring this novel and mirroring their own commonalities and shortcomings on someone like Anne...Inez Hollander Lake[...]"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"My wife loves owning the classics (including Austen) and went looking for a good hardcover publisher of her favorite books.

Two sisters (a third is already married) and their father, a minor noble, have fallen on hard times. Sir Walter Elliot has been widowed, they have lived beyond their means, and now they must rent out the family estate and live in diminished circumstances in Bath. The putative heir to the estate, cousin William Elliot, is vain and arrogant, refusing any interaction with the family.The main character of Persuasion is Anne, the disregarded middle Elliot daughter. She is kind, gentle, and tolerant, which puts her is rigid conflict with the rest of her family who are pompously jealous of rank and privelege. In fact, the rest of the Elliot family supplies much of the satire for the novel: their scheming to arrange meetings with their betters and the scorn they show to their lessers. This reviewer might even go so far as to say that the humour is not so much satirical as it is ascerbic - nowhere else does Austin seem to dislike her characters so much, and to make them the objects of such ridicule. This is not a criticism, as this ascerbic wit sets up many funny moments and observations; more, I think, than any of her previous works.Unfortunately, I found this to be the most confusing of Austin's works: I had trouble keeping track of all the characters. Confusion is increased because all the men seem to be named Charles! Luckily, a thorough knowledge of all the characters is not required to follow the main storylines (although the reader might miss a few subtle jokes).I'm not an expert on Jane Austin, nor on English literature. However, I have read most of Austin's works, and this layman's opinion is that Persuasion is enjoyable and the funniest of Austin's works."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I have read a couple of other Jane Austen novels, and I think this one stands with the best of them. Although we all know it will have a happy ending, Austen sustains the emotional suspense of *how* Anne and Wentworth will finally reunite, and I was not disappointed. Wentworth's letter brought tears to my eyes; it was so wrenchingly emotional and bare. Aside from the romantic plot line, this novel also draws a clear and humorous picture of the characters and social dynamics of the time, which I found fascinating. I recommend this book highly, especially to those who may be new to Austen, as it is shorter and less complicated that some of her more famous ones. The ending makes it all worthwhile!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"The novel Persuasion by Jane Austen is very good. Although slow at places, it definatly redeems itself throughout the novel. The protagonist, Anne, is in love with a man, but is persuaded out of love because of his social status. The book is a classic romatice novel, but is not cheesy to say the least. I encourage everyone who enjoys a good novel to read this book, but especially females. This book is centered around the social status and appearance of the people in the early 1800's. The way Anne doesn't care, makes her differant than the rest of the characters, but also helps the reader consider thinking for themselves instead of being persuaded by other people's thoughts. By the end of the novel, the reader has the decision whether persuasion is good or bad. I really enjoyed the novel. The reader just needs to be able to make it through the first couple of chapters, then the book is really enjoyable."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Not all readers are captivated by this quiet, sad, reflective work. But it is also very joyful. It is Jane Austen toward the end of her life reflecting once again on love, companionship and the eternal knot of family, class and society. Anne Elliot is one of the truly abiding heroines of the modern novel: gentle ,wise, politic and balanced. She is a young, beautiful woman thwarted in an early love by societal and family interests. But it is a joy to see her rise again by the recognition of others seeing these same virtues. This is very different novel than Pride and Prejudice but if you don't think it as great a novel meditate again on its resonant power."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"As a fan of Jane Austen and one who ranks \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" among the great literary accomplishments of the millennium, it disappoints me to rate \\"Persuasion\\" as a ho-hum novel. Unfortunately, the book fulfils the expectations of a two-hundred-year-old romance novel from Old England: dull.The book has a strong and compelling intro. Anne Elliot is one of three daughters of widower Sir Walter Elliot, a vain but financially challenged baronet whose daughters have reached marrying age. As a young lady, Anne had a romance with a certain Captain Wentworth, but this relationship breaks up for reasons that are dribbled out over the course of the book, and Wentworth goes off with the Navy for many years. The story line then wanders off in no apparent direction for a couple of hundred pages as we are introduced to other characters and led thru events with unclear purpose or relevance. But Wentworth reappears on the scene and slowly the plot evolves. Austen tries to persuade us to keep reading with mild intrigue over the Elliot estate, conniving cousins, convoluted love triangles, and the ultimate question: will Anne and the Captain reignited their romance?Although Anne Elliot is a strong and likable character, she seems to do little to advance her own cause. Things just seem to happen to her. While Austen's sentence-by-sentence prose is as beautiful and lyrical as ever, she does an insufficient job in the book's middle of persuading contemporary readers, who prefer faster-paced fiction, to brave the huge passages of wordy exposition and press on to the end. Rabid Austen fans, readers of romance novels, and lovers of classic literature will undoubtedly appreciate Persuasion, but I hesitate to recommend it as an introduction to Jane Austen. I'm afraid that if this were her only novel, she'd have been lost to the ages. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion is Jane Austen's most sophisticated story and writing. She lovingly and incisively demonstrates the problems of being a well-bred sensitive person in a society that's more intrigued by social standing, money, and polite conversation than by good character.Persuasion is Anne Elliot's story. The title's initial allusion is to Anne's brush with matrimony when a promising, but not rich, naval officer, Captain Wentworth, proposed and she fell in love with him at 19. But Anne's deceased mother's friend, Lady Russell, persuaded Anne not to make the match. Up until the time of the story, Anne hasn't had another suitor and she's now well past the usual age of marriage at 29 and \\"her bloom had vanish early.\\" Her father's spendthrift ways mean that Anne could bring little money to a marriage so she's expecting not to marry.While in her social class that lack of a husband is a drawback, in reality her family is a greater problem. Her father, Sir Walter Elliot, is a baronet who spends too much money, is obsessed by social rank, loves to be around the \\"beautiful people\\" and admire himself in a mirror, and keeps company with an unsuitable, scheming widow, Mrs. Clay, who is looking for a husband and has latched onto Elizabeth as friend. Anne's older sister, Elizabeth, is also unmarried and is as equally obsessed with social status as their father. Both Sir Walter and Elizabeth fail to value Anne and looked to her to suit their conveniences. The other daughter, Mary, is married but the connection doesn't thrill either Sir Walter or Elizabeth. Mary sees Anne as a virtual servant who should wait on her every beck and call when Anne is her guest.Due to Sir Walter's over spending of his income, it is decided he will rent the family estate, Kellynch Hall, while he, Elizabeth, and Anne take up less expensive quarters and a reduced social life in Bath. This change sets lots of new events into motion, not the least of which is Anne being re-introduced to Captain Wentworth who now has a fortune and seems to be looking for a lively, young wife. Only their common commitment to being polite makes time in one another's company tolerable. What strong emotions burn under the surface? She's very embarrassed, but Captain Wentworth is hard to read.In the course of the book, you'll find out a lot about social climbing in Regency England, the finances of the social elites and those who were up-and-coming, how marriage agreements were struck, and how the naval officers differed from the gentry. You'll also be impressed, I'm sure, by the patina of politeness that served as a social lubricant among people who often didn't care a trifle for one another.In such a society, people mostly wore masks of being thoughtful, considerate people while in reality they were seldom thinking about very much and didn't care much for others. Anne Elliot is the exception in that her heart and mind are actually devoted to the service of others.One of the most interesting parts of the story is how it was possible (mostly by accident) to sort out the phonies from among those with glittering manners.Anne Elliot is one of the most memorable and admirable characters in English literature. Do read this book and find out about the other kinds of persuasion that took place during this year of her fictional life. You'll be delighted that you did."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"When Jane Austen finished \\"Persuasion\\" in 1816, she was already suffering from the effects of the disease that would kill her the following year. \\"Persuasion\\" is rather shorter than its precessors such as \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It is however the polished work of a mature author, and easily holds its own with her other finished novels.As the story opens, Sir Walter Elliot, a vain and foppish baronet facing bankruptcy, is persuaded to rent his home and move his family to Bath in order to economize on expenses. The middle daughter, Anne, unmarried and ignored by her family, is shocked to learn that the prospective renters are an Admiral Croft and his wife, whose brother is one Frederick Wentworth. Eight years earlier, Wentworth, then a young naval officer lacking wealth and status, had wooed Anne, who was persuaded by her mentor, Lady Russell, to reject his suit on the grounds of his lack of prospects. The kind-hearted but much put-upon Anne is left behind by her family to close up the house and to take care of her hypochondriac married younger sister Mary, who lives nearby.While visiting with Mary and her husband Charles Musgrave, Anne encounters the now Captain Wentworth, wealthy with prize money and looking for a potential wife among Charles' two sisters. Wentworth is distant and correct with Anne. When Wentworth proposes a visit to the seaside village of Lyme Regis, Anne is included in the group. While there, Wentworth appears to settle on Louisa Musgrave, only to have Louisa be seriously injured in an accident. The practical Anne takes charge in the crisis, causing Wentworth to take renewed notice of her.Anne ends up in Bath, where her family pursues a meaningless round of social calls. A handsome and long-missing cousin materializes to reconcile with the Elliots and to pay court to Anne. The long-suffering Anne must balance his suspicious attentions with the unclear intentions of Wentworth, who follows Anne to Bath.Anne still loves Wentworth, but hardly dares to hope that he will pass up younger and more attractive women to renew his relationship with her. The inarticulate Wentworth finally finds his voice in a note to Anne, giving her another chance to make the right choice.In this final novel, Anne wrestles with a dilemma common to Austen heroines, whether to marry for love or money and security. The younger Anne was persuaded not to marry for love because Wentworth lacked the money and prospects to give her the security of her station in life. In revisiting that choice, Anne concludes that the advice was correct under the circumstances but proven wrong by subsequent events. Anne believes in marrying for love; the further implication of her internal argument is that she and Wentworth should have waited for each other while he acquired the financial security necessary for their successful life together.\\"Persuasion\\" is a well-written and moving story, filled with the usual well-developed characters and often biting social commentary of a Jane Austen novel. It is very highly recommended to her fans and to those readers looking for an excellent period romance."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I would recommend reading the book before or after seeing any adaptation of Persuasion. It helps to get to know the main characters a little better. Buying this book is well worth the money, because you will get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Austen's wit and character analysis is brilliant."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Persuasion, Austen's final completed novel, is set in 1814, an interlude in the long Napoleonic wars. The men are home from the campaigns, with fortunes made and loves lost. It is a time for healing and renewal, while time allows. Austen herself was in deteriorating health and did not have long to live. For her characters too, there is a sense of time running out.In fact, although it is completed, there are signs that Austen would have reworked or further developed some of it, had she lived. A major character (the one who did the initial persuading) is never fully realized, other characters are similarly neglected toward the end, and the novel is relatively short.Persuasion does not have the depth of characterization of Pride and Prejudice, or quite the passion. It also lacks the cynical edge that is found in much of her work. The prose never reaches the sublime heights that she achieves elsewhere, but it is always very fine nonetheless. This makes for a slighter, more comfortable read, and a promise that, only love faithfully, and autumn must somehow pass into summer.There are references in the novel which will be obscure to most of today's readers (for example, \\"the inimitable Miss Larolles\\") and an edition with notes would be a good idea, if you can find one. The Signet Classic edition has no notes, but has quite a good introduction by Margaret Drabble, although it summarizes the plot, so read it after the novel, not before."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This came in a timely faschion. It was sent for next day though we had a big storm it was not anyones fault! Came quickly and was in excellent condition!!! Would order from here again and again!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Jane Austen's last completed novel, which was published posthumously was Persuasion and the story starts with Anne Elliot, an upper-class girl at the age of 19, falling in love with Captain Frederick Wentworth. They get engaged but her mother's great friend and her own trusted friend, the widow Lady Russell, persuased Anne to break the engagement with him. The reason for this is, that the young officer possesses no connections to the upper-class and is therefor not worth to be with Anne according to Lady Russel.But after eight years, Anne, who truly loved Frederick Wentworth, is still unmarried and destined for spinsterhood. Until her mother has lived there was no problem with the income at the Elliot family, but according to the fact that her father wasn't careful with the money, they are now facing the situation that the family estate is gone to Admiral Croft, Wentworth's brother-in-law and the Elliots (Anne's father Sir Walter Elliot, her elder sister Elizabeth) need to move from Kellynch hall to Bath.Before Anne moves to Bath she spends some time with her younger sister Mary and her husband Charles Musgrove, as well as his sisters Louisa and Henrietta at Uppercross. Captain Wenthworth so far had success in the wars, which brought him a considerable fortune and now he is looking for a wife to get settled ashore. He and Anne meet again at Mary's and Charles house, but though Anne still has feelings for him she tries not to show them clearly. And furthermore Louisa\`s and Henrietta\`s trials to flirt with Frederick Wentworth and get him attracted, makes it more difficult for Anne to be in the focus.But on a day-walk at Lyme Regis it came to an accident when Louisa falls from a cliff thinking that Captain Wentworth catches her, which he didn't. The only person being calm and starting to organize the necessary steps to be taken after this accident was Anne. This inititates that Captain Wentworth's feelings for Anne came back. But when they slowly start their relationship again, there is another admirer of Anne, her cousin William Elliot, who seperates them again by spreading rumours that he and Anne are going to marry soon...This is a wonderful heart-moving novel and the letter at the end written by Frederick Wentworth to Anne is absolutely romantic. But this novel is also full of irony, for example when Mary wants to follow her husband for a dinner while here son is ill and she makes recommends about men and women, or when it is spoken about Bath (a place Jane Austen hated herself much): But still, there certainly were a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men! They were infinitely worse. Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!\\""},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is my favorite Jane Austen's book (and Pride and Predjudice). Is so beautiful, and charming, and I love the characters,the way of writing and everything. If someone say to you that its boring, forgive him/her: it's because he/she's not a good reader."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Don't pay attention to all those stretched-minded who say that it is Chinese torture, or something else, read it. If you're intelligent enough, you will find it very interesting and realistic. However, if you don't like it, remember that Jane Austen only wrote to herself, not to all the little minded who found it boring."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Right before this book was &quot;assigned&quot; to our book club, I had read another &quot;classic&quot; so was a little disappointed because I was hoping to read a more modern book.I was in for a surprise. This book was incredibly modern and Jane Austen tackles so many issues that are present today. It's amazing how the heroine of this novel is disappointed with her friends, relatives and acquaintences for things that were completely acceptable (and normal) when the book was written but wouldn't be so today.Despite its date of publication, this is truly a contemporary novel!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I know a lot of teens who, when I tell them I am reading Jane Austen, say, &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; because they have read Sense and Sensibility first, before trying any of her easier works. Persuasion is the easiest book of Austen's to get into, to follow, and to love. She makes the characters real by explaining them in many situations. When I read this book, I instantly became friends with Anne Elliot, the family outcast, because she was an outcast. Then she became even more my friend when she became the beloved and desired friend and love of Captain Wentworth. I loved seeing Anne go through the difficulties of dealing with her past actions, and instead of wanting to go back and change the past, she wanted to go forward and decide the future. Austen masterfully portrays all of her characters, and I would love to go to Lyme and see where Anne met her cousin, and to Bath to see where she and Captain Wentworth decided their future together. Persuasion is my favorite book of Austen's, and if you read it, it will be yours, too."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Just what I was looking for! I can always count on Amazon and its vendors to supply me with the perfect product. Not exactly the type of book I ususally read, but exactly what I was looking for. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"there have been movies,series and spin/offs of this novel.the original book is absolutely the best. ms. austen's dry humor makes it so much fun to read.i love her booksall of them. persuasionis the top of the line."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I am a avid Jane Austin fan, so I was really looking forward to reading Persuasion.....but I must say that my favorite work of this author is definetely Emma. I loved Persuasion very much, but it lacked the wit and humor of other Austin reads. The storyline was a bit boring...and lacked the romantic sparkle of that Emma posessed. :) It was definetely a more mature work of this author. I would definetely read it though.....just don't be prepared to be overly impressed."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I, too, found Persuasion unimpressive when I first read it. However, it grows on you. And most true Austen aficionados prefer this to her other, better-known works. Persuasion demands a bit more from the reader. This is not the book to use as an introduction to dearest Jane; for that you must seek out Emma or Northanger Abbey. But do not allow yourself to be misguided by the reviews of people who, by their own admission, are neither experts nor passionate about the works of this brilliant writer, who was, without a doubt, the finest female writer the English language has ever produced."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This was the slowest I've ever read a good book in my life! I am a fast reader and enjoy reading very much. It took me a couple of chapters to get used to the language and even after that I still had to read slowly to absorb the content. I very much enjoyed the story and the writing but it was work to read...enjoyable but work. No one else in my book club made it through..."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I absolutely love Jane Austen, so I'm utterly biased but even for anyone not interested in her work the notations and explanations make it easier for the story and terms to be understood. Really is a great book."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I would always rent this book at the library and always wanted to buy it. My old professor told me that if I ever got it to get the Norton Critical Edition and I was not let down. You won't be let down"},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"I think that it is my least favorite of the Austen I have read. The story felt unpolished, simplistic and rushed. However, since she was sick and dying when she wrote it, I will be happy that she wrote it at all and shared her wonderful prose with us one last time."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"This is one of my favorite books, but what makes it a great \\"listen\\" is Stevenson's reading, which is just outstanding. I wish she would complete the entire Austen novel set."},{"Title":"Persuasion","review":"Amanda Root played the heroine, Anne Elliot, in a great film version, and she is the reader of this audiobook. Her diction is very fine, she is a joy to listen to, and the sensitivity and perceptiveness of a Jane Austen heroine comes across in the narration.This version is abridged. About 40% of the words are retained and 60% discarded. The plot comes across intact, but much of what makes the novel great (the asides, reflections, commentary) is discarded. If you don't mind sitting for a 9-hour version instead of this 4-hour version, check out the unabridged \\"Persuasion\\" audiobook read by Juliet Stevenson. Ms. Stevenson comes across as more of a neutral observer, but she changes her voice more for the various characters.That's not to take away from Amanda Root's uniquely fine reading. If you're big on \\"Persuasion\\", get both. That's what I did."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],W={key:0},H={key:1};function B(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",W,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const j=u(M,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-a5e31dc4"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/65.md","filePath":"people/65.md"}'),q={name:"people/65.md"},N=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{F as __pageData,N as default};
