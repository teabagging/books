The book is ok, just a little bit old."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden, was just excellent. Even better than I thought it would be. Looks new. Very pleased.Thank you for sending it off so fast..."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I found myself, overall, agreeing with one of the reviewers when he stated specifically that &quot;Walden&quot; is not a book to be read purely for enjoyment, it is not a thrilling read or even a very deep one in general but then one must remember in which time we live and the style used by Thoreau is one of the mid 19th Century which was prone to the type of writing he uses. Anyone who has read other novels of the time or rather written in that period will find similar styles eg James Fenimoore Cooper, Charles Dickens etc. In addition this is not a novel but rather a retelling of experiences of one man in his own adventure as he would put it.That is not to say that Thoreau does not illuminate or at times give remarkable insights especially when it came to some of the people he met who had fascinating ways of life eg the woodcutter. The book varies from downright mundane and tedious to being very insightful and beautiful. Its amazing how someone can do this as he writes, verging from one extreme to the other. But then it was written from journal notes as he lived his life in the woods over two years experience and during that time a person changes as he adapts to his new way of life. At first its very exciting and new, any new experience is always full of a kind of life shock whether it be painful or joyful, the thinking mind, the mind absorbed in everyday &quot;safe&quot; tasks which define the &quot;normal&quot; life are absent in this new environment which requires new creative energies to survive, after a while this way of life becomes the accepted one and starts to be drained of the vitality it possessed at the beginning as one is fully acclimatised to it and it becomes the norm, after this stage comes the usual safety associated with the walls created to keep life ordinary rather than really being alive. This is hard to do when living in the woods by yourself where you need constant awareness to survive unless its a little too close to civilisation which provides the safety net which Thoreau always had available to him. But still during the period where he was very much alive and aware, life is lived without need for too much unnecessary thought, and this is the place from where insights and great creativity burst forth.If one wants to know what it is like to be really truly alive in the moment and you are afraid to try it yourself and would rather read about it then try the books &quot;Abstract Wild&quot; by Jack Turner or &quot;Grizzly Years&quot; by Peacock. Am I wrong to criticise Thoreau so much ? Yes and no, eg Yes:see the comments by John Ralston Saul on exactly this aspect of Thoreau's writing, No: look at your own life or mine for example, in each case we do not escape this ordinary life we ourselves create. For the purely lived life expressed in poetry look at the poems by Basho, no clearer or more beautiful expression of life has yet been written. I say written not lived, lived can't be written down in full only a brief glimpse or shadow of it is possible even with Basho.As regards what is said it often betrays Thoreau's astonishingly well read mind, quotes from the Baghvad Gita or other Hindu texts surprise because in Throeau's day very few people would ever have bothered to read the Indian works, the average American thought his own life and European works to be far superior. Thoreau often quotes Latin, often without reference, and the notes at the end of the book are very helpful. Thoreau's experience becomes the one Americans want to live at least without being in too much danger as he would have been in the true wild still available at that time in the lives of say the trappers or mountain men of the Rockies or any native American. As such it is an in between way of living wild.So Thoreau's work is definitely worth reading even for only the historical value or the literature it represents. It stands by itself."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"If anyone can describe what life is really about it is Thoreau. Even in the 1830's he gave relevant advice that can tie into everything in today's world. Every sitting a new and exciting idea to ponder over. Thoreau reminds us all of the confusing yet wonderful world we live in. Most of all Thoreau in Walden makes a tribute to the indivdual and tells us to follow our dreams, because they are just that ours. The best book I've read by far!"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I would have quit reading this book if I weren't so stubborn about finishing books that I started.Here's an example of some of the writing that makes me dislike the book: \\"If you look closely you observe that first there pushes forward from the thawing mass a stream of softened sand with a drop-like point, like the ball of the finger, feeling its way slowly and blindly downward, until at last with more heat and moisture, as the sun gets higher, the most fluid portion, in its effort to obey the law to which the most inert also yields, separates from the latter and forms for itself a meandering channel or artery within that, in which is seen a little silvery stream glancing like lightning from one stage of pulpy leaves or branches to another, and ever and anon swallowed up in the sand.\\"First: that's one sentence! Second: this type of writing is really difficult for me to get through, and I don't enjoy it.There was some information that I found interesting, however, particularly in terms of the cost of things, and the day-to-day information about how Thoreau lived basically \\"off the grid\\" during his time at Walden Pond. I think that I would have really enjoyed a ten-page summary."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"When I first heard about this author in one of my classes, I felt that it was the most boring pices of information that I haveever heard. But, when I started to actually lusten to what he was actually saying it really got me thinking. I was the only onbe in my class that actually understood what he was saying in his stories. His writing has got me thinking different ways on everyday situation. I had never thought that I would start to think like this. His writing has got me to see things different than I ever thought that I would. What he did in his life is cool, going to live at a pond all by himself for about 2 years and find the essintials of life, is brilient. In resistance to civil government, I had never read better writing in my life. When he had to spend a night in jail and realized that it was not even a hard punishnment, for not paying his taxes. There are really no words that I can use that can explain my love for his writing, because it has just moved me to no end. I really wish that I could have been alive when he was so I could have gotten to know him better."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"As Omar said of the Koran, I say of Walden. This is the single greatest book I've ever read, hands down. Words really can't describe how amazing it is, though I doubt that it will affect many people the same way it has me. That said, this edition (the Konemann) is one of the best I've seen. The book itself is helpfully supplied with footnotes (which are something of a necessity for a born quoter like Thoreau), unobtrusively marked by a leaf in the margins of the pages, which refer you to the notes in the back: this is an excellent way to supply these notes without interrupting the flow of the text. There are no elaborate essays on the meaning of Walden, however, so the reader is left to judge the book on its own terms. The book itself is svelte and compact; a perfect backpack-sized vade mecum.This book, with shipping, is less than 10 dollars. It was one of the best purchases I've ever made."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"To really get everything that is in the book out, it must be read slowly. It is an interesting look at one man's attempt to view the world in a different way than his contemporaries. It has changed my life in that Walden made me see the error of spending my life working for no other reason than to acquire more possessions. It can also give you a greater appreciation of nature. This should be required reading."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Great ideas in a mixed format, some great observations presented in poeticverse and some rant with confused presentation.

When I was in high school I had the opportunity to be in the New England area and wanted to learn about Thoreau.Unfortunately being English my second language, it was almost impossible for me to fully understand what Thoreau really meant.I finally I had the chance to read it and fully understand it. Believe me all these years have been worth to wait."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This is really a great work, by a great thinker and a great man. I would like to focus on three concrete topics Henry Thoreau writes about that are still not solved.He already understood the futility of mass communications before they actually happened. \\"We are eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the Old World some weeks nearer to the New; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad, flapping American ear will be that Princess Adelaide has the whooping cough.\\" This was written in 1854 ! Now, 150 years later, this could not be closer to the truth. Only the names have changed. I don't have the slightest idea who Princess Adelaide is, nor am I interested in her, but I can't ignore that much of the \\"news\\" is now dominated by Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, and other starlets, whose names will also be forgotten within 20 years. What a waste of time...On politics, Thoreau disliked profoundly the way our \\"democracy\\" is organized, where we have to elect a \\"representative\\" who then is supposed to \\"think in our place\\". \\"Where is this division of labor to end ? and what object does it finally serve ? No doubt another may also think for me; but it is not therefore desirable that he should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself.\\"A third thought concerns the way the economy should be handled : \\"... a man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.\\""},{"Title":"Walden","review":"My first copy of this book was indubitably from some other publisher. So I'm not commenting on this particular volume but the content of the work itself.I have always loved this book but it wasn't until recent years that I realized what a controversial book this was. Thoreau published this book at his own expense and he sold very few copies. Later on he stored most of his unsold copies in an attic. He once claimed to have the largest collection of book published by Henry David Thoreau than anyone alive - and I'm sure he did.But why didn't people buy this book? Well, for one thing it was critical of \\"the neighborhood\\". For another thing it was critical of \\"the values of his neighbors\\". For another thing it was critical of the values of his countrymen; it was critical of Capitalism; it was critical of modern life; it was critical of the \\"consumer mentality\\"; it was critical of the work ethic; it was critical of buying things; it was critical of \\"getting ahead\\" and \\"accumulating; it was critical of working for a living; it was critical of achieving; it was a critique on the civilization of the day - and it was not positive.So why did it make me feel good to read it then and why does it have the same effect on me today?I don't know but whenever I get lonely to go have a talk with an old friend I go to the book shelf and pick up Walden by Henry David Thoreau.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher:\\"A Little Something: Poetry and Prose\\""},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Most men live lives of quiet desperation, says Thoreau, because they are living for the things of this world. He doesn't want that to be true of himself. So he decides to live simply for two years, building a small shelter near Walden pond. He plants his own garden and discovers that if he works hard for four or five months out of the year, there is plenty of time left over in the year for reading, contemplation, and observation.He records his observations of farmers working, bluejays and squirrels eating chestnuts, men ice fishing on the pond, the snow falling, and many other things.I must say that the book is not always easy to read, but rewards close reading. You'll come away from the book with a greater appreciation for what has been given us in the natural world. Not everyone will agree with Thoreau that you are not a complete man unless you learn to cook your own food and plant your own potatoes, but I found his logic and reasoning compelling. A classic work with timeless relevance."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I've always gotten satisfaction from the outdoors and it's complexities. I'm glad that someone shares the same sentiments. This book should be required reading for any person whether in their teens or reaching the end of their life. While Thoreau can be a bit drawn out in this book on some of his spiels, most of what he says is right on the money, even if it was 150 years ago. Too many people have given up on the outdoors and prefer to stay inside and spend their life in front of the television. This is definitely on my must read list."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Was researching, indepth, the subject of why Walden was such an important influence on earlier American writing, and bought a few books to add to my personal research. This one came away as a winner!"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I've kept Thoreau at arm's length over the years. I sensed his brilliance yet secretly accused him of purposely unconnecting from the world. I was recently lead to him while looking for some essays on gardening. The first subject he covers in Walden is ecomomy. Economy rates low on my reading list. I was further warned by the difficulty of his text in general. Still, I was close to discovering his writings. In the beginning pages he takes me on a tour of opinions needing to be voiced in my life. My fear of crankiness is dispelled with freshness on every page."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden is so beautifully written, and the issues are still relevant today. To me it is a guide for how to live in harmony with nature. I think if you are a naturalist or an aspiring naturalist this book is a must have. This book touches more on spiritual aspects than any religeous scripture I have ever read. Even 150 years ago Thoreau looked at the trends and knew what was coming. Today I don't think that anyone with any sense would argue that in an era of 200 different shampoos that all do the same thing,we cannot sustain this pace and will deplete all of the resources and pollute all our lands,if we continue. Live small and ecologically sound was the message and a great one it was."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Borrowing a corner of friend Ralph Waldo Emerson's farm, Thoreau sets out to conduct an experiment in living more simply for the sake of living more fully spiritually and intellectually. He builds a small cabin and begins to live self-sufficiently with his own hand, farming, hunting and building as he needs. By keeping his wants simple he keeps his horizons broad and finds that he may devote himself to higher callings than he might with the encumbrances of modern life.Walden is the journal of this experiment, providing an account of both the mode of living he has chosen and the far-reaching contemplations he is able to afford himself by that mode of living. It is page after page of beautiful prose and imagery considering his place in nature and society both--or simply appreciating the length and breadth of the day from his doorstep, having given himself the freedom to forego his work if he pleases by keeping his wants simple and true to what the human spirit needs rather than what vanity or social convention say he must need. While his thoughts wander far afield at times his observations are invariably insightful and often profound. (It is startling the number of well-known quotes and observations that find their first expression in Walden.)And this is his theme, not to live as a recluse, but to suggest that we all live more simply so that we may live more fully, that our villages be spread out and we allow ourselves space for thought and freedom to follow a muse, and that we further make our villages and indeed the whole of nature our living universities and schools, making the student learn by living and the community itself perpetual teacher and student.While his own experiment called for living apart for the sake of testing the limits of self-reliance, Thoreau does not advocate a world of hermits. He remains very much engaged in the society around himself, only asking that we consider what it means to provide for ourselves and if we haven't found that most of our effort is devoted to superfluity and nearly none to the mind and spirit. He argues that the essentials of maintaining one's self are much simpler than society has deemed and that what passes for the norm has become a hindrance to living rather than an improvement."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Henry David Thoreau gives up his life and most of his posessions and decides to live in a bare necessities cabin in the woods for two years to examine his life. Lucky for us - he brought a pen and paper with him to write it all down! His main focus in this book is to remind you over and over again that the things that you own and the money that you make are not the things in life that define you. He tries to teach us how to seperate ourselves from the hustle and bustle of every day life, stating that the less that we own and the simpler we make our lives, the happier we will be. &quot;Simplify, Simplify, Simplify!&quot;Everyone I know who has read this book has walked away having learned something. It is a classic. A must have for any book collector - and a must read for EVERYONE!This edition of the book is simply beautiful, too. Well crafted and binded, it adds the perfect complement to such literary perfection."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I didn't have the problem reported by the previous reviewer, in that the margin size is not a problem on my Kindle. The right margin is about 1/4\\", and the left margin is larger, perhaps 1/2\\". Nothing runs over the edge. It isn't annoying to me at all.I didn't give it five stars because you can't go from one chapter to the next by pushing the 5-way controller to the right or left. That is my only objection.The price is right. :)"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"To a citydweller who enjoys the modern conveniences, the idea of building a primitive shed in the woods and observing Nature for days on end was entirely unappealing. I felt I would have no sympathy with the Thoreauvian worldview.I was pleasantly surprised. Thoreau has a distinct sense of humor. While a lot of the book is descriptions of Nature, the writing was lovely enough to make up for my disinterest in the subject. In fact, Thoreau's enthusiasm communicated itself to me, and I found myself becoming more interested as I read on.Thoreau has a reputation for being unworldly, but interestingly the longest chapter in the book, \\"Economy,\\" lays out in great detail the cost-effectiveness of his experiment in simple living. Although living in an isolated shed, he is no misanthrope but displays much affection and compassion for his fellow man. He is a keen observer of human nature and his descriptions of his friends and visitors were some of the best parts of the book. He is a man of sensibility, sincerely concerned about the direction he sees society taking.The annotations were useful, as was the map of Concord."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Even though I live in Australia in 2005, I found this 19th century book superb.I cannot reccomend it highly enough: witty, intelligent, honest, articulate and timeless.I was particularly touched by Thoreau's appreciation of the value of solitude and of living a simple life. Such observations are highly relevant in our modern world based upon our frenzied capitalistic obsessions with long working hours, mass materialism and the media-driven madness to be surrounded by friends and family every moment of the day and night.In my view, Thoreau is the wittiest and wisest writer America has produced and will be just as well read and loved in 500 years as he is today."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I did not particularly enjoy this book, but it is one of those books that anyone who wants to study American Literature must read. Some parts are fascinating, and some of his arguments are strikingly acute, subtle, and persuasive. However, his experiment in natural living and in a more honest human economy just does not ring true to me. While his minor points are often inspiring, the overall argument simply strikes me as a little too self-righteous and overbearing. His indictment of society aside, I just don't find his alternative views as an improvement. I'm not interested in breaking down said arguments for the sake of this review, but I find its strengths to lie in the quality of the writing, the completeness of the philosophy, and the conviction in which it is written. Its weaknesses are debatable. I can see where one could argue there are none if one were to agree with his points and enjoys the narrative style. Others may say it is rather long-winded and/or cynical. I fall somewhere in the middle, as I actually suspect few readers will. I think most people will love or hate Walden, but, like I said, every serious student must give it a chance."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"The book is new but there was no publishing information, which led me to think that this book was published illegally in another country. My personality is an INTJ, so I can relate to the author in many ways. He is a cold and calculating man like myself, and talks about areas of similar interest of mine, including real estate and living away from civilization."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"the book came quickly, well packed with no damage. It was in excellent condition as described online by seller. Was priced well annd I would buy from seller again. Enjoyed my experience with Amazon."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"After reading this I wondered did the Unabomber have the book &quot;Walden&quot; in mind when he decided to retreat from society into a Montana Cabin? His disobedience wasn't too civil was it? Unfortunately I think Ted Kacinsky is our Postmodern version of Thoreau taking extreme measures. But I rate this book much higher than his Anti-technology Manifesto. This book gives the disenfranschised, the outcast or someone whose just had enough of society and work a different alternative rather than &quot;Going Postal&quot; and making the 6 o'clock news. If anything, this book gave me compassion for people caught up in the materialism and clutter in their lives."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I truly admire Thoreau's courage to be a pioneer in his time.

Never before I took a break to hear the sounds of my soul and to look at me like i did after i read the words and the phrases that like poems Thoreau give us.

It's a classic of American literature, and as thought-provoking as just about any work of philosophy. It's a bit of a dry read at times, but we must remember it's not a work of fiction. Forget about characters, and forget about the rest of Thoreau's life, and focus on what he's trying to say.That being said, this book is a beautiful edition of a classic work.

He writes about rejecting society however when he lived at Walden he went into town every day to socialize and buy things. He wrote about seclusion but was in contact with other people almost every day. His writings are wonderful works but I think its ironic that he doesn't practices what he preaches.Thoreau, in Walden, wrote a lot about human and animals. He compares the instincts of animals to the barbaric qualities of humans. In Chapter 11, \\"Higher Laws,\\" he sees a ground squirrel and feels an urge to kill it and eat it raw. In Chapter 12, \\"Brute Neighbors,\\" he watches a battle of ants and feels his animalistic instincts compel him to watch it to the end. He studies life in the woods and is always around it therefore his statement of total seclusion is proven false.Thoreau is one of my favorite writers and his style intrigues me greatly. However, he carefully alters his writings for himself to sound non-conformist and anti-society. Not that this should be held against him. He is a wonderful writer with a distinct style, but he isn't really a non-conformist. He conformed to the non-conformist style but couldn't give up his social life."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"After I crashed and burned in a college intro to philosophy course, I wanted to see if I could find a work by someone who was both a thinker and a writer.Thoreau, in his book Walden, proves himself to be it.Walden is the narrative of the author's two year stay at the aforementioned pond. He has decided to live life simply, and in a collection of loosely connected essays, he describes the people, animals, and the pond that make up his new home. If you haven't spent real time out in nature, you might think this book is ridiculous. But go into the woods, and stay there until boredom and longing for the city stops. Just then you'll realize the awe he felt when examining the ice bubbles and listening to vagabond squirells. Thoreau has rediscovered the patches of Eden that still exist in the world. And if we are open-minded enough to listen to his instructions, we can find our way back to them.Even if his insights into the idyllic perfection in nature fail to sway you to live more lightly in the world, Thoreau will open your eyes to the benefits of philosophy. He understands the man who marches to the beat of a different drummer, and shows through his clear, crisp text the results that thought and contemplation can hold for anyone."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book was a true inspiration to me and was part of the reason I fell in love with Nature. Even if you don't WANT to fall in love with Nature you will find this book to be a veritable Bartlett's full of quotable quotes.I've read Walden through twice and read my favorite sections inumerable times. When I lived in Massachusetts, I loved to read the book AT Walden pond. I've traveled to that little pond via bycycle, motorcycle and car and have seen the pond in every season and every state of weather. I have walked and run around the pond . I have swam across it many times, once at the price of mild hypothermia. I have skiid around and across it. I think the only part of that danged pond I have not seen is the bottom. The book is much like the pond -- you can read it over and over and it will always be fresh and you will never have plumbed its depths fully.The only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 is because the detailed nature observations may be tedious for readers not fortunate enough to be able to visit the pond. Still, everyone should read this book. It is your best reminder that &quot;Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.&quot;"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book is very hard to read as publisher has put in very small fonts and squeezed way too much text into pages.

Thoreau was always learning and teaching us about things like how to live life, the joys of life, and that the best government is the government that governs the least. Thoreau's ideas, especially the idea about politics, have much relavence today, since we have a very terrible president sending poor boys to their deaths just to 1 up old Pappy. I once thought that Poe was my favorite author, then, I read Thoreau and my views were changed. Thoreau was such a wise poet and a modern day hippie, if you will. When the Mexican War, also known as the Northern American Invasion(by the Mexicans whose land was stolen by us in that war) started in 1846, Thoreau, who was already pissed off at the government refused to pay his taxes and then was thrown in jail. He wrote later of his account in a poem. Sadly, Thoreau would die of Tuberculosis around the beginning of the Civil War(which he rejected) in 1862. One witness recalled that Thoreau, dying was at peace and seemed to be happy so, like Jerry Garcia the great, Henry David Thoreau passed into Heavan with a smile on his face. Thoreau has passed, but has left a great legacy with this masterpiece which I think should be read by all, especially Americans."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"When Thoreau made his great experiment of withdrawal from the social world he went into the woods in order to confront himself and real life. This action , the action of withdrawal and the ensuing revelation have served as inspiration and example for many others overwhelmed by the burdens and business of life. Thoreau however was not an ordinary person in withdrawal. He was a very deep student of Nature and of the philosophical literature of his Time, of Emerson. And he was in tune with the Transcendental spirit of that time that reaching out and beyond to a spiritual reality which in some way would unite all worlds and bring the universal unity of Mankind. The combination of his deep perception of the local physical world and the vast stretch of his richly metaphoric mind help make one of the great American classics.This work is so aphoristically rich that it is difficult to read it as simple consecutive prose. As with Emerson one must pause and rethink the various aphorisms given us. But one thing, the spirit, the spirit of hope of intellectual adventure of faith in a greatness and goodness in Nature carry us forward. As Thoreau said \\" There is new day to dawn , the sun is but a morning star\\""},{"Title":"Walden","review":"On Easter of 2000 I visited Concord, Massachusetts, and purchased this volume in a gift shop just across Rt. 62 from the site of Henry's cabin. It had been raining the entire trip, but armed with my coat of many pockets, my backpack, and my umbrella, I entered and \\"sauntered\\" about the gift shop, glad to get out of the cold dampness if only for a moment. I picked up a couple of the customary t-shirts one needs as souvenirs when traveling and then found myself in the book section, drawn to the items which enthrall me wherever I go. One book stood out-not because I needed it, for I had a copy at home that was given to me by a friend for my birthday one year, but because of the photo on the cover. Whoever had designed the cover had actually BEEN to Walden, and the proof was the wet leaf among the terra firma known as the Pond. With an accompanying introduction by Joyce Carol Oates, I couldn't refuse. The cover still touches me, but I have taken to reading books and giving them away afterward, a habit that I am almost sure that Henry would love. I instead remember Walden in other ways, as rain falling on cedars. Walden to me is always Easter, always Earth Day, always truth, and most of all, always a reminder that my life is not mean or poor but rich and ready for picking. The chapters relying on Spring, Economy, Reading, and most of all the swelling Conclusion, like a gentle coda after the soaring symphony, remind me of what still waits, regardless of how old I am, and how old I will get."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I found this book to be very difficult to read and also very dull.

I decided to read this because a) I usually read such random \\"fluff\\", that I thought I should try to better myself, and b) I've gone to Walden quite a few times now, and was interested to hear what Mr Thoreau had to say about his experience (though admittedly I'm sure much has changed between his visits and mine). My conclusion? I'll stick with my \\"fluff\\".I get it, it's a \\"classic\\", but that doesn't mean it makes for good reading. As others have said, I went into it expecting some deep thoughts, grand ideas he came up with while spending some quality time with nature, whether I agreed with them or not. What I got were a few quotable lines here and there, mixed into a book that details how he grew beans, how much he spent to build stuff, and what I feel are some rather unfair judgments on other peoples' lives (almost like the 17th century equivalent of \\"I'm a *fill in the blank* and I'm so much better than these other misguided soles who aren't\\").Personally, bored to tears with the book. If you're looking for a good story, this isn't it.

Meticulously written, Thoreau omitted no detail while writing this book (exact measurements and precise calculations litter his accounts), and after nearly 300 pages of painstaking precision, it can leave one physically drained. Don't get me wrong though, throughout a lot of the book, Thoreau had some genuinely interesting things to say about life, such as living without material possessions and superfluous and excessive items such as clothing, housing and belongings, and I also found Thoreau's experiment of living in almost complete isolation truly inspiring and at times exciting. In &quot;Walden,&quot; Thoreau writes about many things that are still done today, such as the observation of insects and the construction of a house. In conclusion, I found &quot;Walden&quot; an interesting read, that everyone should at least just look through, since it is a classic, but I found it at times to be very dull."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This was a well written essay of life in the wilderness.

Sounds is one of my favorite chapters. He tells of the sounds he can hear as he sits silently listening. He sets his furniture out of doors and watches the sun beam down.

So good, in fact, that I waited years to finish this book, savoring it. No writer that I can think of matches Thoreau for perception, insight, and clarity. While perhaps not as original a thinker as Emerson (and not as good a poet, in my opinion), Thoreau tops his master in the practical, while being funnier (okay--a dry Yankee funny, but funny nevertheless). This book advocates the philosophy of simplicity by respecting nature. It is critical of the hurly-burly waste of the modern industrial world, but it is not cynical. It is beautiful.

Is it a book on nature, a book on ecology, a book on human nature, a prescient description of the struggle between modern civilization and the land that nurtured it, a critique of mankind, a string of quotable gems, an account of a mind, or, like Star Wars, a way of slipping a deep and human spirituality into someone else's mind without their recognizing it? It depends on who is doing the reading and when. Read it for any of these purposes, and it will not disappoint. If you've never read it, read it. If you read it for class years ago and hated it, read it again. This may be the most subtle, multi-layered and carefully worked piece of literature you'll ever find. By keeping the down-to-earth tone (no doubt in reaction to the high-flying prose of his friend, R.W. Emerson) Thoreau pulls a Columbo, and fools us into thinking he's writing simply about observing nature, living in a cabin, or sounding a pond. Somehow by the end of Walden, however, you may find it is your self he has sounded. People have accused Thoreau of despising mankind, but read deeper and you will discover he loved people well enough to chide us, show us our faults (admitting he's as bad as the worst of us), and give to all of us this wonderful gift, a book you could base your life on. There is more day to dawn, he reminds us at the end: the sun is but a morning star."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"WALDEN has rarely been out-of-print since its first publication in 1854. Copies come in all sizes, shapes and price ranges. Today's Thoreauvians have three ANNOTATED versions of WALDEN to choose from. Each one provides same-page explanatory notes that help the reader interpret the sometimes esoteric references in Henry David Thoreau's original text. The three books are \\"The Annotated Walden\\" (edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, 1970), \\"Walden: An Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Walter Harding, 1995), and \\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" (edited by Jeffrey S. Cramer, 2004). Each one has at least one map of Concord and/or Walden Pond. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses. Each one has appeal for a devoted audience.\\"Walden: A Fully Annotated Edition\\" by Jeffrey S. Cramer was released in August 2004, coinciding with the 150th anniversary of the original publication date. Cramer is the curator of collections for The Thoreau Institute and therefore has access to some of the best primary and secondary source material available -- including Walter Harding's notes. In addition to the text of WALDEN, this volume includes a few \\"extras\\": an introduction to Thoreau's life but only as it applies to his cabin stay and WALDEN writing; a bibliography; notes on the text; and a detailed index. The explanatory notes -- the essence of an annotated edition -- are quite extensive. They are set off from the WALDEN text with page-within-a-page graphic detailing and are easy to read. Cramer did not merely merge Van Doren Stern's and Harding's previous notes with those from David Gorman Rohman's dissertation. His analysis at times echoes that of Harding, but when it does, Cramer often goes one step further with a definition or citation. He has thoughtfully used a \\"Notes on the Text\\" appendix to outline HDT's wording differences in the various drafts of the work. Thus his annotations are not bogged down by minor editorial alterations that the casual reader may not care about. Unlike Harding, Cramer refrains from expressing personal opinions and lets the research speak for itself. An added bonus is a reproduction of Edward Emerson's map of Walden Pond which shows the location of Thoreau's bean-field as Waldo's son remembered it. The only cumbersome quality in this publication is the placement of WALDEN chapter titles at the bottom of the pages instead of the top. This otherwise stellar volume is beautifully presented with a cover photo of the cabin reproduction as it currently stands in Walden Pond State Recreation Area. A classy edition by all accounts.Lining up the three versions side by side is an interesting experiment, best conducted on a rainy summer day when no other work has appeal. Let's use two well-known and oft-debated passages for an initial sample interpretive comparison.\\"I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their trail.\\" (\\"Economy\\") Do those three animals stand for actual individuals in Thoreau's life? Or does this passage simply refer to Life's losses? Philip Van Doren Stern devotes a page-length note to this paragraph. He mentions a few of the major interpretations and refers readers to the bibliography for more. His conclusion is: \\"Since there is no clear explanation, each reader will have to supply his own.\\" Walter Harding offers three pages in a special appendix that covers all the major theories. At the end, he too suggests that \\"each reader is free to interpret them as he wishes.\\" Jeffrey Cramer's paragraph cites two similiar excerpts found in other Thoreau pieces, and his explanation states that \\"no analysis has been generally accepted as valid.\\" So the three men agree: we have to decide for ourselves what we think of the story.\\"There was an artist in the city of Kouroo who was disposed to strive after perfection.\\" (\\"Conclusion\\") Is the parable that follows that opening sentence based on some of the Eastern texts that Thoreau was fond of reading at the time? Or is it a thinly-disguised depiction of his own struggle to perfect the final WALDEN manuscript? Philip Van Doren Stern simply says that \\"no one has been able to find a source for the legend\\" and agrees with Arthur Christy that it is an allegory about Thoreau's own life. Walter Harding offers several possible origins of the legend but eventually cites and agrees with Christy's allegory statement. Jeffrey Cramer devotes just a two-sentence annotation, concluding with \\"It is generally agreed that the following fable is by Thoreau.\\" In this instance, Cramer has the benefit of time over his colleagues. Most Thoreauvians have come to the same realization during the past decade after much gnashing of teeth.Explanatory differences are more pronounced at other various junctures in the text. Each man obviously was intrigued by certain references more than others. I can say that overall, I found Jeffrey Cramer's annotations to be the most helpful of the three. Maybe someday someone will have the courage to tell all the makers of posters, bumper stickers, and t-shirts that \\"Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in\\" is NOT about fishing at all.Every school and public library should own at least one of these annotated editions. Academic libraries will want at least two of the three versions. If you want a book that has a lot more HDT than just WALDEN, find a used copy of the Philip Van Doren Stern book. If you want to hear from expert Walter Harding, choose his. Individuals who want the most comprehensive interpretation should go with the newest volume by Jeffrey Cramer.

He did not live like a recluse (he went in to Concord almost every day) so its not a book about living alone per se. Its more about reflecting on life, considering why one &quot;is&quot; and recognizing the beauty and mystery of nature around us every day, everywhere. Thoreau talks of regular daily things too like what it costs him to farm, or having cider, or building a chimney. The writing style is conversational, open, honest. He doesn't try to get tricky with words, he just tells it like he sees it. It's so beautiful.

It encouraged me to take a second look at my own life, and simply discard of the things which were causing complications or confusion.

Harding didn't copy anything from Van Doren Stern's previous work, and he also didn't include as many stylistic comments as his predecessor. He offered more frequent explanations and backed them up with a variety of source materials. He also throws in his own opinion every once in a while.

Is that a profound comment on our times, or just the last straw that persuaded me to write this review?I have read Walden from cover to cover many times. I have read excerpts from it many more times. I have never found it boring or tedious, as some reviewers have. In fact, I have found it to be one of the few books worth re-reading on a frequent basis. Why?Our times do not differ significantly from Thoreau's. He saw a society enthralled with &quot;progress,&quot; such as the ability to travel from place to place via railroad at the astonishing speed of 35 miles per hour, without any idea of what to do when they arrived. He travelled by foot, and saw the life that others hurried by.Has it ever seemed to you that the acquisition of ever-more-expensive habits and tastes, and the need to work longer and harder to satisfy them, is ultimately a waste of the precious gift of time and life that each of us is blessed with? Do you wonder how (or if) people who live without televison, video games, and automobiles can be happy or fulfilled? How would you fare if you were stripped of your possessions but still retained the ability to obtain the necessaries of life? Could you treat that as an opportunity to discover more about what it means to live?If any of these are questions that have nibbled at your psyche, read Walden. If you love nature and its intricacies, read Walden. If you've ever thought about through-hiking the Appalachian Trail, read Walden. If you think modern-day life can't be improved on, or you want a quick read that will entertain you for a few hours, read something else. And if you read Walden and don't find it meaningful or profound, perhaps you will find another book that will remain as significant an influence in your life as Walden has been in mine."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"And \`Tis a shame that I cannot claim this is a re-read after 40 years or so. I can only cite the very well-worn clich&eacute;: Better late than never.Walden is a pond, just outside Concord, Massachusetts, and for two years in the mid-1840's Henry David Thoreau lived a largely solitary existence there, in a simple wooden cabin which he constructed. This book is a collection of his mediations on the natural world, and a person's place in it. Thoreau also ruminates on an individual's place in society and certainly demurs about the hurly-burly existence led by so many, or, in an expression that I had always attributed to T. S. Eliot, but was first coined by him: \\"the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.\\"The first third of the book is on \\"economy,\\" and the house that he built near Walden. He describes his labor, and provides a table indicating the total cost, and compares that with the annual rental cost of housing. Similarly, he covers his food, clothing and fuel expenses (the \\"essentials\\"), and the underlying theme remains the subject verse, taken from a Shaker song, \\"Simple Gifts,\\" written about the same time: if you simplify your life, and rid yourself of the bondage of so much self-imposed clutter, you really are much freer, and that includes having the opportunity to take a ramble in the woods, which was a major aspect of his two years at Walden. As Thoreau phrased it: \\"Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.\\" Or in another passage: \\"I also have in my mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.\\" Contrast that with the constant exhortations of our consumer society to \\"buy, buy, buy\\" and if we can only get the American consumer spending again, our \\"economy\\" will be OK. The beauty of Thoreau is an independent mind writing against the grain of conventional thought.Much of the latter portion of the book features his observation and outlook on the natural world around him. These observations range from the scientific to the poetic, with an emphasis on the latter, but he does not hesitate to make controlled measurements, like determining the true depth of the pond, which had previously been the subject of speculation. He describes how ice is harvested from the pond, and shipped to Boston for summer use, and is continually intrigued by the color of both the ice and the water in the pond. For those who are overwhelmed with \\"light pollution\\" and do not know what the phase of the moon is, Thoreau provides a suitable admonition: \\"It would be well, perhaps, if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any obstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak so much from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in caves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.\\"There is much else as well. He describes the life of poverty of his nearest neighbor, an Irish family who are recent immigrants. He also observes a battle between red and black ants, and plays \\"hide and go seek\\" with a loon on the lake. He leans towards vegetarianism, but praises hunting, and considers it a vital rite of passage for any boy (and yes, it was so long ago, the other half were not even considered).Walden is not an easy read. In part it is due to the turgidity of Thoreau's prose style. There is also the aspect that portions of the book resemble the Desiderata poem that was plastered to so many bedroom walls in the 60's: a string of exhortation on the proper way to conduct one's life. The meaning of some of these aphorisms are quite understandable, for example: \\"While England endeavors to cure the potato-rot, will not any endeavor to cure the brain-rot, which prevails so much more widely and fatally\\"? But it would take some true assumptions and extrapolations, and they could be quite divergent, to squeeze the meaning from: \\"The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly translated; its literal monument alone remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures.\\" I'd welcome reader comments as to what that really means.Walden was hardly a \\"commercial success\\" in Thoreau's lifetime, but its impact on numerous historical figures was significant. He was admired by the naturalists John Muir, Joseph Wood Krutch, Loren Eiseley, and David Brower. His companion volume, (On Civil Disobedience) influenced Tolstoy, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, as well as many others.It is a book to be read slowly, with some tolerance for his style, and the occasional still quirky observations. Walden remains a 5-star read, and is an essential book for everyone to read, at least once in their life, even if it is in the latter phases.Finally, proving that once again there are those unlikely connections that add the zest to life: each day I look 70 miles to the west, and enjoy the view of the mountain most commonly called Mt. Taylor, named after Zachary Taylor, the President of the United States who started the Mexican-American War, and is the reason this piece of earth that I inhabit is part of the USA. Henry David Thoreau practiced civil disobedience, and was briefly jailed for his failure to pay his taxes as a protest against that war."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This timeless classic from one of the great thinkers of the 19th century American transcedentalist school appeals to all idealists. This would include idealists from both the left and the right. Envronmentalists are attracted by the themes of living in harmony with nature. For example, Thoreau observes all around him in his two year two month stay in his simple house in the woods. He describes in great detail watching certain insects glide along the pond and the ripples made when they do so. He provides an engrossing description of two ant colonies, one black, the other red, at war with each other and gives a lurid, blow by blow account of the battle. Envrionmentalist also will be drawn toward his declarations against waste and using more than is necassary.Leftists from an earlier generation, &quot;hippies&quot; for want of a better characterization, are drawn towards Thoreau's rejection of the material. At Walden Pond, Thoreau eschewed unnecessary comforts and lived for what may be more truly important; a life in which we get to know the world around us. He was able to sit for hours, but this was not a waste of time because he was thinking and observing. He sought higher values.Idealists from the right are also attracted by Thoreau's observations since he was self reliant and lived off of his own labors without thinking that anyone else owed him a living. He may have rejected the material but, in so doing, he fended for himself and lived off of his hard work and ingenuity. Unfortunately, there are many today who cannot possibly appreciate this great book because they are more concerned with materialism, an easy life and pop culture. I hope that these young people will ultimately experience what Thoreau early in the first chapter calls the greatest miracle: &quot;to look through each other's eyes for an instant.&quot; I hope that these young readers will look through this great thinker's eyes and truly try to understand what he has seen and experienced."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This edition of Walden is a joy to read, with lovely typeface and layout. I am not a Thoreau scholar, but found the annotations accessible and absorbing. The layout allows you to read Walden straight through or wander off into the annotated notes, depending on your mood.A book that serves as a miniature vacation every time you open it."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"incomplete. missing quotes and other passages that were formatted differently in the original work. spend a dollar and get a readable version."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"As a previous reviewer mentioned, passages are missing. This is one of the best books ever written and it is a shame someone messed it up so much."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"For two years and two months, Thoreau decided to live in the Concord Wilderness near Walden Pond, as an experiment. He wanted to see if complete self-reliance was possible, and perhaps get a little closer to Mother Nature. As an experiment in pure solitary living, unaided by the trapping and encumberances of society, Thoreau failed miserably. But as a book of profound insight and beauty, Waldon ranks supreme in the history of American literature, and the bulk of his insights and observations stand even today. I say failed, because Thoreau often spent evenings at the town pub, drinking and talking until late at night, wherefrom he would stumble home drunk without the aid of lamp light. Moreover, aside from a doting mother who would often bring him homemade victuals as a break from mountain berries and unlevened homemade bread, he often stayed over with the Emersons when the pangs of loneliness were particularly biting. Not of word of this will you find mentioned in Waldon, though, for it would go against what Thoreau has to say about charity: namely, that no deserves it. So clearly Thoreau was never as detached from society as he would have us believe, and yet that is neither here nor there. An amazing writer, an observant naturalist, a brilliant social critic, and perhaps the most singular individual America has ever known - Thoreau cannot be beat. And this edition of Waldon is particularly good, in that Hardin has done exactly what all editors should do: In keeping with the Thoreauvian motto, he has made the text \\"simple, simple, simple\\" and accessable, clarifying points when necessary with annotated footnotes. After reading Waldon, you might also want to check Harding's biography of Thoreau, which I highly recommend. Among other things, you will learn about his trouble with women. (Interestingly, like many philospohers, Thoreau died a virgin.)"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Just as Alexander carried a copy of the Iliad in a precious cask, I have cherished a dog-eared and well marked copy of Walden for a quarter of a century. Now at last we have a binding worthy of one of the greatest books of all time. The embossed cover, the lavishly illustrated endpapers and page footers, the vast number of drawings from Thoreau's pen, and the detailed Masorah-like marginalia elucidate the familiar text and enrich the reading experience. The many references in the notes to Thoreau's Journal have lead me far afield into the various editions of the Journal (at least those I can afford). This is a first rate edition which I hope to carry with me the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Henry David Thoreau's _Walden_ is an account of a young man's sojourn in the New England woods, a critique of modern society (in the 1840s), and a call to action to vegetarians, libertarians, and other free thinkers. Thoreau's account is highly idiosyncratic and obscure. To be honest, it is a chore to read it through to the end. But Thoreau is wise on some subjects and, even better, he is funny. He is also very quotable, as this review demonstrates excessively.Thoreau begins _Walden_ with a scathing depiction of the senseless, directionless activity of modern life:\\"Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them.\\"And:\\"Men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool's life, as they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before.\\"Instead of working harder to produce more, Thoreau decides to want less, and leaves corrupt society behind to live at Walden Pond. There, he takes refuge in naturalism. He plants a crop of beans, he takes long walks, he observes the animals that share his woods, and he engages in some amateurish scientific speculation. Thoreau is not a hermit: he often visits the village of Concord, Massachusetts, and enjoys visiting with infrequent visitors at Walden Pond. But he finds that a little bit of society can go a long way:\\"We meet at very short intervals, not having had time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness, to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war. ... We live thick and are in each other's way, and stumble over one another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another. Certainly less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications. ... It would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where I live.\\"One of my favorite passages in the book describes the author as he leaves behind the brightly lit village and walks home through the woods alone to his cabin:\\"It was very pleasant, when I stayed late in town, to launch myself into the night, especially if it was dark and tempestuous, and set sail from some bright village parlor or lecture room, with a bag of rye or Indian meal upon my shoulder, for my snug harbor in the woods, having made all tight without and withdrawn under hatches with a merry crew of thoughts, leaving only my outer man at the helm, or even tying up the helm when it was plain sailing. I had many a genial thought by the cabin fire \\"as I sailed.\\" I was never cast away nor distressed in any weather, though I encountered some severe storms. It is darker in the woods, even in common nights, than most suppose. I frequently had to look up at the opening between the trees above the path in order to learn my route, and, where there was no cart-path, to feel with my feet the faint track which I had worn, or steer by the known relation of particular trees which I felt with my hands, passing between two pines for instance, not more than eighteen inches apart, in the midst of the woods, invariably, in the darkest night.\\"After a minute description of his life at Walden, extending over the bulk of the book, Thoreau suddenly tires of that part of the narrative and decides to fast forward a bit in what I think is the funniest paragraph in the book:\\"Thus was my first year's life in the woods completed; and the second year was similar to it. I finally left Walden September 6th, 1847.\\"In the last part of the book, \\"On the Duty of Civil Disobedience,\\" Thoreau expresses a radical libertarianism:\\"I heartily accept the motto, -- 'That government is best which governs least'; and I should like to see it acted up to more rapidly and systematically. Carried out, it finally amounts to this, which also I believe, -- 'That government is best which governs not at all'; and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have.\\"An opponent of the war with Mexico and the institution of slavery, Thoreau decides to do something about it, and lands in jail for refusing to pay a poll tax. In life as in politics, Thoreau advocates a life of deliberation followed by action:\\"There are nowadays professors of philosophy, but not philosophers. ... To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.\\""},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden, since the age of fourteen, has always been a special place for me. Ironically, I did not disturb the leaf laden path through Thoreau's wood until seven years after, but at a young age I enjoyed the utopia this book offers. Interestingly enough the surface was read, and with little understanding of history, of which I know have a Masters degree, I did not know the context. With this Annotated version you are thrusted further into Thoreau's world than ever before. I suggest strongly to read the text, then start over with just the annotations. It takes you into the historical/political context of the book's purpose, and from that, into a world leading to civil war, that would traverse those growing pains into a time of reform. Truly a book before its time, yet speaks to the reform movement of the latter 19th c., and perhaps today."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This is an incredible collection of writing yes but contrary to the seeming popular view it was not meant to be a good read. i do not imagine thoreau wrote this as an attempt to achieve the status of a clean writer.

Read this book but do it not as an attempt to seek entertainment."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden is a wonderful book from which I obtained many hours of enjoyable reading. Though its tone is generally serious, it can at times be light. When he does slip in some humor it comes at an unexpected time and caught me off guard giving me a good laugh. I found many of his ideas very thought provoking. His account of how he built his cabin and his remarks about food and shelter were for me fascinating. I found it a very warm and friendly book with much to think about and obtained from it many referrals to complement my reading list. I Thoreau-ly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden is really an exposition of Thoreau's way of viewing life. Thoreau says there is more to life than posessions and money, that, as difficult as it is to accumulate posessions and to earn wealth, it is much much more difficult to rid one's self of them! A statement/concept that is worthy of contemplation.Walden will take you away in to your own &quot;walden&quot;, if that is where you would like to be, and, if so, then you, as I, will enjoy the book very much. I rated it as a four star (out of five), only, because I could not choose 4.5 stars. On my personal scale, in order to receive a 5 star rating, a book has to move me with the intensity of a paradigm shift. It has to offer up concepts that, following a thorough consideration, change my present view of life, world. etc.... Thoreau's Walden comes close on this measure, but falls just a little short.His On civil disobedience, is another work that I reccomend with high regard, slightly more so, even. than Walden."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden is the most important book that I have ever read. It is instructive, but not to be taken literally. It is not dictating that everyone should go to the woods, but find their own God. For Thoreau that was Nature in the woods, for Thomas Carlyle, Great Leaders. What is it for you?"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Anyone who prefers Emerson above Thoreau surely does so with a view to increasing his own popularity. Thoreau is too outspoken to be liked by everyone--indeed, to identify more with him is a kind of social suicide. But then, Thoreau was ever convinced that he was not here to please anybody, but rather to be authentically what he was.To find a modern man who so thoroughly embodies the wisdom of antiquity is as rare as &quot;the tooth of a dragon, or the hair of a phoenix.&quot; Henry David Thoreau is such a man. More than a mere combination of past, present and future, he brings together the most mundane, prosaic and ordinary considerations of daily life with the loftiest and noble thoughts of mankind. Furthermore, he perceives the spiritual aspirations and practices of east and west as one coherent whole. He was well acquainted with the classics of both hemispheres--The Tao de Ching, The Bhagavad-gita, Vedic writings, The Iliad and more--and here, distilled for us common folk, is that wisdom as seen from the viewpoint of a modern man. Bertrand Russell has given what would seem the crown laurel to Thoreau calling him &quot;a pure romantic&quot;--in contrast to the weak romanticism of Victor Hugo, or the rather soft variety found in Emerson.During his lifetime, 700 or so of the 1,000 copies he had printed of his first book,&quot;A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers&quot; wound up in his parents' attic, ostensibly making him a failure as a writer. Walden was also not a big seller during his lifetime. Since then he has become a literary god, and without doubt one of the most influential writers of the past 200 years. It was Thoreau's tract entitled Civil Disobedience, written because of his objection to paying tax to the American government--a so-called democracy involved in slave trade, westward expansion, displacement of indigenous population and imperialistic annexation of Mexico--that gave fuel to human rights movements in the 20th Century. Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr. based their efforts on this small but amazingly powerful essay, which only goes to show that Confucius--one of Thoreau's favorite sage authors--was right; the thought of an intelligent man sitting in his room can kill a king and destroy his country. And so it was that slavery was abolished in the United States, India attained home rule and racial integration in the U.S. progressed.Since the industrial revolution in the 18th Century, the central goal of western technological society has been economic growth. And to achieve an economic growth that is endless, corporations in the latter half of the 20th century have encouraged consumption that is mindless. But by the dawn of the 21st century, this central project has proven to be obsolete, for nature cannot sustain endless economic growth, and neither can the people in general. Nature has rebelled by refusing to absorb the transgressions against her dignity (pollution), and humanity has expressed insurgence through psychological and physical disease. Dr. Willis Harman has discussed the matter in detail in his book, &quot;Global Mind Change&quot; but, though more than a decade has passed since its publication, the important and timely points that it makes have yet to be assimilated by the public. Thoreau, however, was already tuned in to this problem way back in the 1840's. Astrologers attribute an overlap of a little more than 200 years between astrological ages, and this puts Thoreau in with the new Aquarians.His observations--on economy, simplicity, learning, human nature, participation mystique when close to nature and the close proximity of God--are unpresuming, candid and at times downright hilarious. I say Henry David Thoreau is a philosopher sage amongst the American transcendentalists, and a man who was not unconcerned about his less educated or enlightened fellows. He took tremendous pains to share himself, through his writings, with us, and there are many innovations of his that are already being practiced by posterity. Not the least of these is the growing awareness that ADULT EDUCATION for men and women can be a lifelong pursuit. I agree with Dr. Harman that this is on its way to becoming the new central project of western society, known as it is presently by the name, The Personal Growth Movement.In Walden the mature seeker will find lucid clues as to what the Aquarian Age is all about, its characteristics and even the means of cultivating the new consciousness. But this is not a book for people who like easy reading. Henry would demand of you that you read it with the same diligence and deliberation as it was written. It took him five years of refinement before he was satisfied with the manuscript. Walden will provide you and your descendants with many more years of pleasure and enlightenment than that."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I had to stop reading this kindle edition of the book because large portions of text were missing.

I recently attended a public lecture featuring Mr. Cramer and had the privilege of a one-on-one meeting with him.

His thoughts on life's essentials and how needless they can be gives such a different view than other pieces of literature. I was especially taken by how he views the importance of education.

Life is more than just being part of the &quot;rat race,&quot; trying to &quot;get ahead&quot; or having a higher &quot;standard of living&quot; than our parents did. The fact is, marketers play us for fools, and we let them. Life is about searching, finding, exploring, loving, winning, losing, living, dying.

I truly loved this book including the section on civil disobedience.I think your love or hate of this book will be determined by the type of person you are, no judgement on either type (diversity makes life interesting) from me, just an observation.

It's a 35-cent paperback edition that, if I recall correctly, my dad picked up while he was teaching in East Africa in the early 60's.Somehow the book survived his motorcycle ride from Africa to the Middle East and Europe, an ocean voyage, and the subsequent pilfering of the motorcycle's saddlebags on the docks of New York City. It has spent another 40+ years on our family's bookshelves, in at least 6 states and the District of Columbia. It's now a loose collection of pages held together by a rubber band.This book has seen a lot of the world, but it's not for that cachet of adventure that I love it. It's for the sense of adventure found inside its pages -- the sense of adventure Henry David Thoreau found in staying in one place.\\"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived...I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life.\\"What follows is part nature observation, part simple living, part transcendental philosophy, all recorded during two years in which Thoreau didn't venture farther than he could walk in a day. The ultimate message of Walden is one of introspection: explore thyself. But in the process of exploring himself, Thoreau explores the world around him. He watches the birds, the mice, the ants, the weather. And, ultimately, it becomes one process.\\"In the midst of a gentle rain...I was suddenly sensible of such sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and in every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me...Every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and befriended me...There can be no very black melancholy to him who lives in the midst of nature and has his senses still.\\"That's the spirit that keeps me coming back to this book again and again.Originally posted at thenaturalcapital.com."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"When I presented Walden to my students in my 11th and 12th grade philosophy course, many of their initial responses was something along the lines of, \\"This guy is jerk... a whiner...and poser.\\" I said, \\"Well you know he was put in jail for his ideas right?\\" They were shocked that such simple ideas could be condemned. As we progressed through this immortal masterpiece, they began to see the simple beauty and obvious application of Walden and the discourse of Thoreau in general.Walden is suitable for anyone looking to scale back their hectic life and appreciate the emotionally and intellectually tactile world that is so often muted by the chaos that is modern life. Walden is also useful for outdoor enthusiasts seeking a method of meditation without any major religious or spiritual attachments. Thoreau guides the reader to a life of appreciation and proves that less is better."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Sitting at the junction of religion, philosophy and naturalism, Walden is certainly a masterpiece of quiet reflection and precise, beautiful images. There was quite a bit of moralizing, but it somehow felt okay, coming from where and who it did. This book will definitely drive me closer to the practice of writing and will certainly haunt me each time I walk in the woods, or by a pond.I am surprised it took me so long to read this one but however one feels about the call to live simply, the book itself is full of good writing and, I would say, the fruits of good journaling and a careful eye.Highlight: The last chapter is, possibly, the best call to cultivate the inner and intellectual man, that I have read anywhere.On a side note: I was shocked at how clearly Thoreau's writing shows the signs of a man with autism or asperger's syndrome. I looked it up and was not surprised to find there is a credible theory on the author."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and it is definitely one that has influenced me in many different ways. Thoreau was keenly and honestly observant of everything: from the tiniest leaf to social institutions. He saw through hypocrisy and into the lives of \\"quiet desperation\\" that most people lead because, unlike Thoreau, they do not take the time to \\"live deliberately,\\" to examine and question. They are always at the mercy of others, seeking to accumulate wealth and standing but, in Thoreau's time as in ours, unable to do so because the economic odds are against them. Yet this is an optimistic book, based on the belief that if we act, we can change our lives.The writing is simple, elegant, captivating: almost every sentence in every paragraph deserves to be quoted. And probably has been! Opening the book at random, I find an oft-quoted sentence: \\"Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life, are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.\\" Opening the book again, at random, I find: \\"Walden is blue at one end and green at another, even from the same point of view. Lying between the earth and the heavens, it partakes of the color of both.\\"Thoreau's character and outlook is American to the core: he is the product of his place and his time.

I was a bit apprehensive about opening this book, but as soon as I began, I was engrossed. Thoreau's stream of consciousnes style of writing holds the reader captive and begs interpretation.

The book came in excellent condition and was something I have always wanted to have a copy of my own."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This one is long and boring. It was hard to get through, and it is largely repetative. Thoreau, considered the first enviromentalist, writes about his 2 year experiences in Walden Woods, on the pond. Thoreau stresses simplicity and individualism, as most transcendentalist,the latest philisophical literary movement,did. The well read reader should read this one to say that they have read Walden."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"There was plenty of good, profound philosophy in this book. Thoreau made many wise observations and commentaries throughout the book. Unfortunately, these were all buried under heaps of gibberish. &quot;Blah blah I used X many nails to build my house blah blah the ground here is soft blah blah....&quot; and so on. I couldn't care less about the wildlife, or the ecological systems of Walden pond; if I had wanted that I would have read a science book. I wonder if Thoreau liked the sound of his own voice. But one thing's certain: he liked the look of his own writing. This book was 3 parts filler for every part philosophy, and that's being generous to Henry David."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"As far as classics go, this is merely mediocre. Still, it is one that many people should read. At least read &quot;Economy&quot; and &quot;Conclusion&quot; (which is not really a conclusion, but more of a continuation).Some have criticized Thoreau of being hypocritical. It is easy to see why. He chastises gossip, but then produces gossip on the printed page so that many will read it well after the fact. To be true to himself, it should have stayed within himself. He could have provided examples for our benefit without being quite so particular.Another example is condemning the &quot;corporate&quot; life, but then he proceeds to closely detail his manner of how he could make a living off the land -- not merely eating what he sowed, but that he sowed enough to make money doing it. Although he disliked local farmers giving him advice, he still disperses equivalent advice to his readers -- not taking a look in the mirror.I had expected more and it started out on a good note. This was written when he was 30. Although that would not be considered mid-life now, it probably was then. It certainly was in his case (he died of TB at 45). He starts with many things that one may learn during mid-life, which was encouraging, but then slowly turned it mostly into gripe sessions and simple anti-establishment diatribes. Although I agree with many of his points, too much bitterness was showing through.However, the baby should not be thrown out with the bath. There is much good and it has a generally positive outlook for one's life. He did this as an experiment and because he did not continue it, one must ask if the experiment was a failure. I think therein lies the greatest thought provoked by this book."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I don't know how people can call this book a brilliant &quot;American classic.&quot; I rarely enjoyed reading this book, and it took me quite a while to finish because I could never bring myself to sit down and read it. Once in a while, Thoreau offers some nice insight, but the majority of this book just describes his mundane daily activities, and then he goes off on a tangent seemingly trying to find something &quot;deep&quot; in it. Thoreau shows his writing ability to be very established, as he can go off for pages about the most petty things, but often it seemed he was just trying to show off his Latin or his knowledge of the Vedas. He found the need to write every Latin quote in both Latin AND English. I did read the English version for a reason. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, unless they are reallly bored."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"For those of you have never read Walden, I suggest that you abstain entirely from the book, for the rest of your life, if possible. I have always had my doubts about works by the Transcendentalists, and they were confirmed, upon reading this &quot;American classic.&quot; This was just a plain piece of literary failure, and it was evident, as seen through Thoreau's own words. The man was full of contradictions, and in Walden, he was very successful in refuting what he just said a few pages before. He also seemed rather fascinated by Eastern traditions and spiritual writings, which, by the way, he often misquoted. Not only that, he exhibited, throughout his work, a subtle arrogance, in the sense that his words often suggested his supposed superiority, as though the readers should do nothing else other than heed his wise counsel. This proved to be quite unnecessary, after seeing it over and over again ad nauseum. In short, Walden does not merit the honorary title of an &quot;American classic,&quot; as there are other works by other authors that should deserve more praise than the ones lauded on Walden."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's \\"Civil Disobedience\\". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.The phrase that most ran through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was \\"o'erweening arrogance\\". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way. I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my \\"critique\\" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"As a social studies teacher and a student of history one can not deny the importance of Thoreau's views on civil disobedience. The impact of his teachings on the world are amazing. Thoreau's views on civil disobedience and their affect on Martin Luther King and Ghandi helped make this world a better place. So again, I understand why Thoreau is important.Now onto Walden Pond. Do people actually read this and enjoy it? I was required to read this for a masters course in early American Intellectual Thought and man I will never read this again.Pages and pages of boring unimportant information about his daily life....zzzzz. How does anyone enjoy reading about how he built his hut or what clothes he wears. Can he bore us some more with his agricultural failures? This book was torture.

The lowest price I could find on Amazon was $4. I guess that's why people don't have to pay for shipping when they purchase items that exceed $25!

When I started to read Walden, I told a friend that it will probably take me my whole life time to finish the book, and I do intend to finish the book at some point. I'm not a slow reader, but there is so much to ponder and think over what I've just read. I find myself underlining things, and some ideas are so profound I want to stop and think about what I have just read, or feel I must discuss what I've just read with someone. I've only read about 100 pages, and have read only a few pages at a time. Sometimes you have to be in the mood to read Walden. I highly recommend at least starting on reading this book. It will affect you in so many ways."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Thoreau is great. Even if you don't agree with him, even if you see his contradictory nature towards his teachings, even if you can't understand him, you can't deny that he is an amazing thinker and an influential character of American history. Thoreau's quiet voice of solitude and non conformity provides refreshing alternatives of perception and observation which strengthens inner freedom and personal growth. I have read numerous essays by Thoreau and I have to say this could be the most enlightening. His ideas of progressing back to nature is beautiful inspiration to reevaluate our contemporary life.I recommend everyone read this book...Actually I take that back...I recommend everyone Henry David Thoreau and all of his beautiful work."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"In an age containing cartoons like South Park, movies like Pulp Fiction and popular music that lacks originality, books like Walden are so wonderful to read. We are very much in the dark ages culturally where profit and quantity are more important than quality."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I wonder if Thoreau wrote the way he did as a way of imparting to his readers how much hard work he put in to living in the woods. If so, he was successful.This book contains many, many little gems of clever witticism and solid advice, but it's quite difficult to sift through all of the pointless and trivial paragraphs in order to separate Thoreau's genius from his madness. It is almost not worth it. I've lived twenty-two years having not read Walden and I did not live them as a hillbilly. Therefore, I probably would have been perfectly able to function in society without reading this monster.Again, though, the gems in this book cannot be denied. They are a mirror, in front of which is standing American society.Some have called Thoreau arrogant. I disagree. Although Americans might not want to see what Walden has to show them, they should not take this disgust out on the messenger. Thoreau did not imagine what he had to say about American society, but rather he observed it. That is not arrogance, it is realism and bravery.I do, however, truly wish I'd not read this book. Someone should sort out the passages of value and publish them in a small volume that most people might actually be able to get through. American society would be the beneficiaries of valuable knowledge and information without the drag of the rest of Thoreau's book."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I purchased this book after reading another version and Walden as a piece of literature is an amazing work. I got the Annotated one because I wanted to learn more about Thoreau's world but found the annotations distracted from the actual writing. What was contained in the annotations was very interesting but I'm not sure how much they added for me."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"There aren't too mny men brave enough to do what H.D. Thoreau did. To just drop it all to live in the woods and live off the land. I admire him and think that what he has to say is really important in both Walden and Civil Obedience. They are great pieces of work and deserve some looking into."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden invites us to re-examine and weigh our priorities in life. It maximizes the value of our present experience, emphasizes the richness of nature, and diminishes the value and rationality of our struggle for material success. The book is filled with quotes and ideas that inspire a renewed energy and fresh approach to life. It awakens a sense of appreciation for simple pleasures. It promotes a perspective that reflects a more innocent set of values -- that challenge the world's judgement of a man by the money he earns, the car he drives and the possessions he amasses.In an era where excess spells success, it is calming and thought provoking to read about the Thorough's two years in the woods. It strikes a chord of things that we have known all along but have perhaps forgotten. The sights, sounds, and experiences of nature and the scenery provides us with a sensory scale to weigh our priorities and pursue new directions in our lives.Can we attain personal satisfaction and hapiness by simplifying our lives? This book inspires us to try."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I get why Walden is beloved by so many of us: it is the antithesis of American capitalist society. It confronts, with remarkable courage and aggression, head on, the very \\"progresses\\" and prosperity that so many Americans consider to be the foundation of this country and even of the American Dream. And it is an ode to nature at the dawn of the beginning of a shameful era of nature's accelerated destruction.But it was hard to swallow; in fact, too hard. I was not able to get past Chapter 3. If Thoreau could have passed himself off as a man of the world with wisdom and credibility this book would be radically more appealing. However I fear Walden to be the writing of a bitter, angry, social pariah-come-misanthrope. So, to employ an analogy of our own times, it is difficult for me to accept one man's statement of the meaninglessness of mainstream society when the man is about as socially attuned as Noam Chomsky or Glenn Beck.I'll stick to Emerson."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"A poignant peek into one man's view of what is and should be the true importance of every man's existence. Thoreau in the 1800s already felt, in my opinion, strangled by too much, unnecessary stimuli. Once out in the woods, on his own, with just the basic necessities, he was able to reconnect with his true self. I can only imagine what he would think of today's world. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Reading through the pages of this book makes you wonder if the author was a hermit and a heretic or a social reformer, or a mystical philosopher. \\"On Walden Pond\\" sounds similar to the classic movie \\"On Golden Pond,\\" starring Henry Fonda and Katherine Hepburn. There are some similarities; in both stories the lead characters go and live near a secluded lake (pond) to spend their lives, but Thoreau goes a step forward to find himself and his soul when he can't accept the status quo of life. His journey is to find the truth that is beyond the apparent reality: A search for transcendental truth of Bhagavadgita and Upanishads. His search for the nature of soul is found in the tranquility of Walden Pond when he states that, \\"In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagvat Geeta, since whose composition years of the gods have elapsed, and in comparison with which our modem world and its literature seem puny and trivial; and I doubt if that philosophy is not to be referred to a previous state of existence, so remote is its sublimity from our conceptions. I lay down the book and go to my well for water, and lo! There I meet the servant of the Brahmin, priest of Brahma and Vishnu and Indra, who still sits in his temple on the Ganges reading the Vedas, or dwells at the root of a tree with his crust and water jug. I meet his servant come to draw water for his master, and our buckets as it were grate together in the same well. The pure Walden water is mingled with the sacred water of the Ganges. With favoring winds it is wafted past the site of the fabulous islands of Atlantis and the Hesperides, makes the periplus of Hanno, and, floating by Temate and Tidore and the mouth of the Persian Gulf, melts in the tropic gales of the Indian seas, and is landed in ports of which Alexander (the Great) only heard the names.\\" Through these passages he compares himself to the great Vedic sages and rishis who meditated deep in the woods for prolonged period of time in total tranquility to realize spiritual awakening. Thoreau was a prophet who had the same identity crisis as his better known contemporaries like; Emerson, Whitman, Channing, Hawthorne, Melville, and Dickinson. But among these men, Thoreau was forerunner as practitioner. He insisted that knowledge without experience or action is a false knowledge.Thoreau's passion to seek inner meaning of life is illustrated by his disappointment in the traditional Christian culture; \\"We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of agriculture. We have built for this world a family mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten.\\" In another paragraph he observes; \\"For most men, it appears to me, are in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and have somewhat hastily concluded that it is the chief end of man here to glorify God and enjoy him forever.\\" In another section of the book, Thoreau writes, \\"We perceive that only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute existence that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm their daily life of routine and habit every where, which still is built on purely illusory foundations.\\" He continues in the later part of the paragraph, \\"I have read in a Hindoo book, that there was a king's son, who, being expelled in infancy from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he lived. One of his father's ministers having discovered him, revealed to him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he knew himself to be a prince. So soul,\\" continues the Hindoo philosopher, \\"from the circumstances, in which it is placed, mistakes its own character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it knows itself to be Brahme. I perceive that we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things.\\"Thoreau was also keenly interested in the work Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution. In many ways he resembled Darwin in his patient observations and Benjamin Franklin in his inventive practicality. Unlike most transcendentalists, he could do things, tend to garden and make home repairs for Emerson, or actualize the real carpentry Branson Alcott's fanciful vision of a summer house.Thoreau expresses strong belief in social reforms when he refuses to pay taxes in protest against practice of slavery in Southern States. He championed abolitionist John Brown whom he met briefly in Concord, Massachusetts. In one paragraph he laments; \\"I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous,..\\" \\"There are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south. It is hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to have a northern one; but worst of all when you are the slave driver of your soul.\\"1.Civil Disobedience2.The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson & Henry David Thoreau3.Henry David Thoreau : A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers / Walden; Or, Life in the Woods / The Maine Woods / Cape Cod (Library of America)"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This is an annotated edition of Thoreau's classic Walden. Harding is a well-known Thoreau scholar. In this edition, Harding provides marginal notes to explain various references in the text, such as people and places that Thoreau mentions, Biblical allusions, or unfamiliar terminology. The text also includes small marginal illustrations drawn from relevant pages of Thoreau's journals. End material includes some theories on possible meanings of the famous \\"hound, bay horse, and turtle-dove\\" passage, Thoreau's map of Walden Pond, and a list of works cited.Harding provides much useful information in the marginal notations, clarifying references to Greek texts that modern readers may not be familiar with, or pointing readers to scholarly interpretations of specific passages. The notations can improve one's understanding of Thoreau's text, but they can be a bit distracting at times. While many are informative, some seem a bit over-the-top, such as definitions for relatively common words like \\"scimitar\\" or \\"Algonquins\\".

That, pretty much, sums up my thoughts about this wonderful book. I keep coming back to it; don't know if it's the gentle admonitions, the fundamental questions that it raises or the rustic imagery that it creates in my mind. The relevancy of the message is found in the fact that a book that had New Englanders of the mid 1800s as it's target audience finds such an universal appeal (don't know what exactly they do, but there is a Thoreau society in Bangalore). At the same time, when one see the videos in YouTube where tourists are lined up to see a makeshift cabin, you can't help wondering whether the interest is for the wrong reason.Philosophical musings aside, Walden merits greatness on literary basis alone. Given that it was written in a period that is spatially and temporally far off, I had to constantly look up online to understand many of the references Thoreau makes in the book. If you can get hold of an annotated version it might be helpful.Walden, perhaps, will set you thinking in a new direction. As Thoreau says, \\"Man come tamely home at night only from the next field or street, where their household echoes haunt, and their life pines because it breathes it own breath again; their shadows, morning and evening, reach farther than their daily steps.

It possesses that inexplicable charm which walks gracefully hand-in-hand with Transcendentalism, and marks the height of that era's thought. But Thoreau is quite different from the likes of Emerson; as another reviewer poignantly commented, while primarily a master of the word Thoreau was equally capable as a thinker, and Walden is, quite simply, the perfect demonstration of that fact. It is brimming with careful observation, a certain care and compassion for life, and Transcendentalist thought which may not be so casually dismissed. Walden is a masterpiece, perhaps because Thoreau removed himself from the modern whimsy which pervaded society in his times, but most certainly because Thoreau himself was the epitome of the joyous, nature-loving spirit which is embodied by the entire movement of Transcendentalism."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"A wonderful book on self reliance and the value of a simpler life.

Since I live close to Concord I have visited the site many timesbut never got to read his books."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Henry David Thoreau is perhaps one of the greatest literary figures of the nineteenth century. He was a friend of Emerson's and a Transcendentalist. He saw the beauty of life and how we mortals squander it with too much getting and spending. He was a man who not only stopped to smell the sacred scents of nature, he went on to become imbued with the great truths that permeated the wood and the pond that he loved so dearly. In an idyllic sense, he was a man for all seasons, a man who took on authority and questioned its right to dictate over the life of the individual.This was indeed his great theme, for he said: &quot;I am too high born to be the property of any government.&quot; And he also said, &quot;That government which governs best governs least.&quot; But I doubt the conservatives can claim him as one of their own. For he was among other things a staunch abolitionist, and he was also against America's involvement in the war with Mexico, (the Viet Nam of its day). So what has changed? Not much. Life is still a battle between the individual's rights and needs against societie's injustices and a life of conformity.But even if you never read Walden please think about this quote: &quot;Why should we be in such desperate haste to succeed and in such desperate enterprises? If a man can not keep pace with his companions, perhaps it is because he hears the beat of a different drummer. Let each man step to the music which he hears, however measured or far away.&quot; Now that's something I can sink my teeth into!"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"if I could give this 10 stars I would. can't even say enough about it, so I will leave it at that.

After perusing the first few pages I was certain the accolade was a hoax yet continued out of sheer folly.Being an outdoor enthusiast, I was astonished how Thoreau carefully developed a method of sustaining oneself without the need for civilization. He covers everything from living frugally to divesting oneself of the need of Adam Smith's division of labour. Great for the outdoor survivalist!The simplicity of such a life is matched only by the peace and inner reflection which arises by stripping away the unnecessary concerns which bombard us daily. The fact that his advice is still as applicable today as it was then is a testament to the author's insight.I particularly enjoyed his robust description of nature and her changing seasons. One gets a sense that Thoreau's hermetic life is only superficial and that a deeper intimate relationship exists with nature. He becomes iconoclastic in his musings with nature questioning every aspect of the social norm. Man made laws vs natural laws are repeatedly contrasted hinting at the content of \\"civil disobedience\\".The single greatest lesson learned is the need to follow one's own thoughts and \\"conscience\\"."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Writings of his prose and observations of a simplified life in the woods near Walden pond New England.

He espouses the benefits of nature as well as the healing properties of simple toil and the benefits of rugged independence.

I was disappointed to see the negative reviews, but I was not at all surprised. Thoreau is for the rare individual, as he was a rare individual himself. Few will be able to appreciate his keenness of thought, his breadth of perspective, his striving for some measures of worthy improvement while remaining content. Thoreau has been unserviceably miscategorized by subsequent generations. For example, he is really neither a transcendentalist nor the progenitor of the modern &quot;civil disobedience&quot; tactic (read his essay by the same name, and note that Thoreau himself was jailed and accepted that consequence). Thoreau was first a naturalist and observer and second a philosopher and writer. This should aid you in gauging whether Walden will be an interesting read to you. Thoreau is challenging for idealists, because he strove to experience and practice his ideals and was at liberty to do this (he had no dependents). Finally, Thoreau is an adept writer, and his natural flow of literary devices are satisfying for even the subtlest reader. Walden is one of the crowning works of America's finest literary, intellectual, and philosophical offerings."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"An excellent book that should be read by all.

Without Mr. Van Doren Stern's introduction, side bars, pictures and comments, I think I would have been thoroughly lost.I have to agree with a few of the reviewers who stated how pompous Thoreau sounds; he does. He tries to act superior,only to have the side bar notations state something different; something that a friend mentioned. For example, he says he \\"could easily do without the post-office,\\" yet a contemporary, Sanborne, is quoted off to the side of the annotated version as having said about this quote: \\"Few residents of Concord frequented the Post Office more punctually or read the newspapers more eagerly than Thoreau.\\"He contradicts himself constantly. He mocks people who don't read, and then says he barely read a few pages of one book in the two years he was at Walden pond. He could be vindictive; lashing out at Flint's Pond (and Mr. Flint) because Flint would not let him build a cabin on his pond. He comes off as a snob, saying most men learn to read only as a necessity; for work, to add up their profits. But *true* readers are hard to come by. \\"I aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this Concord soil has produced..\\"Yet, he also has some really great words of wisdom. He questions the wisdom in working so hard during the best part of your life (youth) only to spend the fruits of your labor \\"during the least valuable part of it.\\" Enjoy life while you are young. Why work so hard when the endgame is death? He comments on things that are still true to this day; fashion and our obsession with appearance. Work to provide for yourself, not to overburden yourself and keep yourself in debt.Someone reviewing this book on Amazon wrote that it was a failed experiment; that he meant to live in the woods as a hermit of sorts and failed miserably to do so. That was never the extent of his experiment. He never says he's going to lead a solitary life. He states he visited the village every day or two. \\"As I walked in the woods to see birds and squirrels, so I walked in the village to see men and boys.\\"I find myself having mixed feelings regarding this book. He is so contradictory, but then, so am I. He can be judgemental and then he can be spot-on. It was a difficult book to get through, Again, had I not had the annotated version, I would have been truly lost. He frustrated me at times. I was not reading literature. I was reading someone's diary that often went off-tangent (like this review). Is it Top 100 book worthy? My opinion: no. It was good at times, painful at others. I took 2 months to trudge through it, all the while reading 5 other books just to keep me going. I am glad I read it. I won't do it again though. Sorry, Mr. Thoroeau"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"...not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.\\"Paragraph one sets the scene: Thoreau says that when he wrote \\"the bulk\\" of the book, he \\"lived alone, in the woods, a mile from any neighbor...on the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusettes...\\" for a period of \\"two years and two months.\\" In this first chapter, entitled Economy, he talks a lot about how much stuff cost to build and grow, and describes his living conditions. Early on, he shares his philosophy on what it is (p 12) \\"[t]o be a philosopher.\\" It is \\"...to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust.\\"Although I'm glad that I can now check the \\"I read Walden,\\" box, doing so involved more drudgery than delight. For one thing, Thoreau seems to ramble a lot. For another, he's a paradoxical guy. He disdainfully emphasizes a lack of intelligence in others, as when he refers to some of his visitors as (p 142) \\"half-witted men,\\" and one specifically as \\"an inoffensive, simple-minded pauper;\\" seemingly rudely directs those stopping by his place for a cup of water to the pond, \\"I told them that I drank at the pond, and pointed thither, offering to lend them a dipper;\\" claims of certain unfortunates he offered assistance that they (p 67) \\"preferred to remain poor;\\" and admits that charity isn't his thing, (p 67) \\"As for Doing-good...I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution;\\" but later philosophizes, (p 205) \\"Goodness is the only investment that never fails.\\" He repeatedly uses the racist term (p 27, etc.) \\"savages\\" to refer to Native Americans, yet states that he aided a runaway slave (p 144) \\"I helped to forward toward the north star.\\" He seems sort of straight-laced, but also funny, as when he mocks the men that built the Pyramids (p 53) \\"there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs.\\" And even his logic can be illogical, as in his support of the statement (p 48) \\"the swiftest traveler is he that goes afoot.\\" The example is that traveling 30 miles is better done on foot due to the hassle and cost (\\"almost a day's wages\\") of taking the train. By my calculation, at three miles an hour, a 30-mile journey would take 10 hours, more for a man like Thoreau who was afflicted with tuberculosis.Although Thoreau's story contains noteworthy quotes throughout, the last chapter is filled with pearls, like this inspiring (and quite famous) one, (p 303) \\"...if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours,\\" which proves to be an enjoyable end to an uneasy read. It was only afterwards, during my book club's discussion session, that I first heard Thoreau's self-proclaimed life of solitude was not as solitary as one might think. This led me to pick up (but only skim) The Thoreau You Don't Know by Robert Sullivan, a good choice for those that feel compelled to learn more about the supposed recluse. Worst of the book was annotator Bill McKibben's occasional opinion-laced footnote, including the one on page 252, in which he feels compelled to share that Louisa May Alcott's father was a \\"fruitcake.\\" My advice, skip this version in favor of any other. Those that enjoyed Walden may also like: The Thoreau You Don't Know by Robert Sullivan, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard, and Gilead by Marilynne Robinson."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Thoreau was a reflective man.

There is literally no plot at all. Any good writer of fiction knows that you need rising action, and then a climax. I kept waiting for the plot to show up, but there was none. If Thoreau had taken my advice he would have gone bear hunting, and chased some Indians with a gun, then maybe find a good woman to settle down with. That would have made for a good read. Or maybe if Thoreau had slimmed this little number down to 35 pages on how to build a house it would have been more useful. Some of these sentences just make no sense. Check out this: &quot;It is only the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it, which restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people.&quot; Yeah, whatever you say Thoreau. I gave it three stars though because, to his credit, this book is kind of long and it takes a lot of patience to write a book this boring. I give him mad props for that.

So yesterday I decided to start reading it.Well that was a big mistake. I thought it was going to be strictly an autobiography of Thoreau's two years of living on Walden Pond. Right away, it was obvious I had bitten off more than I could chew. The first chapter is called &quot;Economy&quot;. The second chapter, which begins on page 79, appears to be where the autobiography actually starts. I reached page 9 of the book and couldn't take it anymore.I couldn't tell you what I read in those 9 pages. I would read a paragraph and not know what the heck I just read. His language is so confusing, his word choices so peculiar that I literally did not understand what he was saying. I did comprehend it enough to know that he is just babbling about the state of the world and how much he hates this and that. Is this an autobiography or a philosophical and political treatise? I don't know for sure, because I wasn't prepared to wade through all his ranting just to get to the story of living on Walden Pond.American classic? How was that possible?"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Why would any one want to read this book on their own accord? I found it to be the worst book in history.

Is this supposed to show us how we are to live our lives, because if it is, shoot me now. He seemed to hate everyone and live with the animals and the pond. No one really cares what he ate or what he did for fun (if he can call it that), or how he failed in everything. If he wanted to find out who he was, he should've become a buddhist monk or something. I've seen someone else who left society and moved to the woods, and he is locked away for a long time for sending people bombs in the mail."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Do not read this book.

The temperature of the Boiling Spring the same day was 45x, or the warmest of any water tried, though it is the coldest that I know of in summer, when, beside, shallow and stagnant surface water is not mingled with it.\\"'Nuff said.

This myth, however, is far from accurate. For one thing, Thoreau never intended to become a recluse, but he did desire to put into action--to literally prove--how living in nature could bring us closer to our higher selves.Philosopher Erick Erickson, in saying that \\"Every person should have a Walden,\\" testifies to the metaphorical nature of Thoreau's experiment. For Thoreau, the two years spent living at Walden Pond represented an inner journey in which he spiritually connected with nature and created a place--a personal Walden--inside of his soul.Thoreau's metaphysical journey began with his recognition of the interrelatedness of all life. It was not enough that he engross himself in nature; he had to see himself as a vital part of it. Thus, in \\"Walden\\" he writes, \\"Shall I not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and vegetable mold myself?\\"Even more importantly, internalizing a place like Walden Pond meant seeing the connectedness of even the \\"negative\\" aspects of nature. For example, when he imagines the seeds he planted in the ground rotting because of too much rain he says, \\"it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for the grass, it would be good for me.\\" In this way, Thoreau is able to recreate any negativity he finds at Walden and turn it into something positive by focusing on the unity of all nature and seeing everything as a symbol of the self.This is easier said then done and Thoreau willingly recognizes the difficulty of finding connections in the natural world, even at a site of pastoral beauty such as Walden Pond. But in spite of the difficulties, he stresses solitude and self-discovery because he believes that only by actively exploring our inner lives can we become aware enough to see the bonds which link all things.In his conclusion to \\"Walden\\" he asks us, \\"What does Africa--what does the West stand for? Is not our own interior white on the chart?\\" How, he implores us, can we ever hope to see the connections between things if we have yet to investigate our own souls?\\"Nay,\\" he commands, \\"be a Columbus to whole new worlds within you, opening new channels, not of trade, but of thought.\\" Thus, Thoreau urges us to embark on a voyage of self-discovery that will help us truly participate in nature by seeing ourselves as \\"part and parcel\\" of it. \\"Explore [yourselves]\\" he urges us, and uncover \\"the perennial source of life\\" through nature.It is not an easy path to follow, but luckily Thoreau does not recommend that we follow his path exactly. We don't need to purchase a secluded cabin and turn our backs on civilization (although that sounds nice at times!); we just need to get off the \\"beaten track\\" and to immerse ourselves in our own special, wild places.Re-reading \\"Walden\\" this last week I was reminded of the need to do so every couple of years. I'm looking forward to having this forest green volume around for a long time."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book, edited by Philip Van Doren Stern, is a dream come true for diehard Thoreauvians (like myself). If you think you know everything about Thoreau's Walden, think again. This book is full of fascinating footnotes that shed light on particular turns of phrase and allusions that one thought one had grasped. The footnotes are particularly illuminating in re turns of phrases that have gone out of style. To learn, for instance, that train wrecks and such were commonly referred to as &quot;melancholy accidents&quot; in the papers of the time, lends an otherwise missing mordant wit to Thoreau's criticism of the railroad when he says that &quot;it will be perceived that a few are riding while the rest are run over-and it will be called, and will be, 'A Melancholy Accident'.&quot;-Absolutely delightful!

Thoreau taught me how to use my mind to see beyond the surface of nature into its glorious inner workings, and few gifts have ever been so precious in my life.There is so much wisdom here it's impossible to digest it all even in a dozen readings. Lines from this book come to me over and over as life rolls along. One of my favorites states that HDT would be happy to live in a pine box, three feet by six feet, as long as he could wake up every morning in the middle of nature. I know exactly what he means, and I have patterned my life along that vein of simplicity and sustainability.For that and so many other thoughts here, I love Thoreau like a real brother. He's always there when I need him. It's okay that Walden was closer to town than most think; the real point here is letting wild nature enter into you until you become part of it and no longer part of the illusory world of homo sap. That can be done even in a city park if one learns how.This book, along with the best of HDT's journals, constitute some of the most useful of all American literature to my mind, and to millions of others over the last century-plus.Thanks to Hank for understanding what really matters, and for waking up an entire nation to how precious our natural heritage is."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Jeffrey Cramer's annotated \\"Walden\\" weaves together the \\"woof\\" of Thoreau's philosophy and observances with the \\"warp\\" of all the influences upon him in his life, current and remembered.

I was so disappointed to open the package and find this version."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Henry David Thoreau's Walden is one of the great classics of American letters. Although its reputation has been somewhat unfortunately tainted in our modern day times by its reputation as the &quot;treehugger's Bible&quot;, this, indeed, misses the point of the book entirely. Although Thoreau obviously loved nature, and was one of the nation's first enviromentalists - indeed, the modern day enviromentalist awareness outlook can be traced directly back to Thoreau - the core of this book is not a simple stating of the virtues of nature. No, indeed: Thoreau, in this book, lays down nothing less than a life philosophy. Both his essay &quot;On Civil Disobediance&quot; and this book, which preach the virtues of individual liberty and the importance of Man over State have been enormously influential on my own personal philosophy and views. Thoreau raises some staggeringly deep existential questions: If a man lives entirely outside of the State, doesn't depend on them at all, but still resides inside the boundaries of said country, need he pledge them any allegiance? Need he pay their taxes if he does not depend on their support for his welfare? Thoreau, here, tells us how to get the most out of life by living simply: using only what we need in life and doing without luxuries - cutting off the fat, so to speak. Indeed, much like the philosophy of Rosseau, Thoreau seemed to basically believe that the true essence and spirit of man resides in the state of nature: he assures us that, if all men lived as simply as he did at Walden, there would be very little theft, crime, violence, envy, or jealousy. He urges us all to live our own lives as we see fit, neither depending on or heeding others, and not merely become another mindless drone in the conformist society. For all of this greatness, the book, I must say, however, is not faultless. The book does tend to ramble at times - Thoreau might, indeed, have benifited from some editing. And, on a more personal note, I am far more interested in Thoreau's philosophical outlook on life than his observations on nature, and found many parts of the book focusing on the latter aspect to be a bit slow and trying. Still, if you belong to that camp, then I can only give this book an even higher reccommendation for you. An essential read for those who would have us return to a simpler state of things, as well as those in favor of preserving the natural beauty that is still left to us."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"At the age of 50, I, like many adults struggled with the meaning of what I had been doing for the past 50 years. Most of it spent in pursuit of my generation thought of as the \\"American\\" dream. Thoreau, in the classic work, answers many of those questions. Less is actually more. No review can do justice to this work; it must be read, and preferably in some wilderness location, away from the bustle of \\"city life\\". ENJOY!!"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"When some people think of WALDEN, they think of a man living deep in a primeval forest, far away from civilization, learning how to become one with nature. Rather, WALDEN is about a man living only a few miles from a well-established village (Concord) attempting to learn about himself, especially in relation to the nature around him. He believes men live lives of \\"quiet desperation,\\" always in a hurry, missing the best that life has to offer. To discover life's greatest offerings, which for Thoreau can only be found inside a person, never \\"out there,\\" he builds a hut on the shore of Walden Pond and lives there for two years.\\"I went to the wood because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,\\" he writes. It is an \\"experiment\\" in living (as republican democracy is the \\"experiment\\" upon which the country was founded), an empirical one based on observation. He describes in loving detail the woods, the fields, the birds he hears, the pond itself (\\"the landscape's most beautiful and expressive feature\\"), even village life (he goes to Concord every few days to pick up on the latest gossip). He describes the seasons as they progress and how they touch upon his inner search for meaning. Zen-like he finds inner purity and the necessity to free himself from the social and political ties that restrict his \\"freedom.\\" He feels \\"the divine being established\\" inside of him every day. Finally it's time to leave (he is a man of the world after all). But he's learned that \\"if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with success.\\" One must be true to one's own nature - that is the key message of WALDEN.WALDEN is an American classic that combines the mystical with the practical. For those who have ever felt that \\"life\\" is some force outside of us, controlling us always, tearing apart our true natures (and who hasn't felt that at one point or another?), WALDEN is just the book to remind us that we don't have to be \\"a slave to material desires.\\" Excellent in every way."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I am one of those people who has read Walden over and over again over a period of decades, and have owned several editions.

I am glad to have known him through his books. Taken with a grain of salt, his perspectives are refreshing and often illuminating. He helps his readers see there are indeed different ways to look at the world."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"&quot;I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.&quot; I grew up in New England near Walden Pond and first read Thoreau's Walden in college. It has had a profound influence upon my life over the thirty years since then. One of the great tragedies of life in our time is that many people spend their lives working like slaves to accumulate wealth which is spent on things they don't need. And in the course of this pursuit of wealth, vast tracts of time are lost at great expense. Why? Some people may never have the epiphany that the pursuit of material wealth and the search for meaning are entirely separate and wealth doesn't guarantee that you live your life well or nobly or meaningfully. Thoreau knew this. He considered the townspeople of Concord to be slaves to their farms and herds and fields and houses. In the woods Thoreau became totally immersed in the process of living each day: he watched red and black ants fight an epic battle, which he described as having great depths of Homeric valor. He observed the color of the pickerel in Walden and the color of the ice in winter. And listened with disdain to the sound of the Fitchburg railroad as it whistled in the distance. He was a purely self-reliant human being having built his own cabin by hand and planting his own fields. This great American naturalist could look at a stand of trees and tell by observation the forces of nature it had experienced. Thoreau is profoundly wise and if you read Walden earnestly, it will change your life. I know that after I had read it, I was never the same person. Give it a chance to do the same for you. You may become transcendental, if you read it sincerely. And understand the importance of marching to the tune of a different drummer."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I had hopes for this book and here's why, I was never much of a reader. Music was my passion, But a few years after high school I met my now wife who made me feel like I missed out on a lot of great literature. This feeling was made even more aware to me upon the meeting of my brother-in-law who is an english teacher, And a shakespear specialist. So as the music of my generation died off for the most part I started reading avidly, Recently I decided that I was gonna start reading all the literary classics I could and started with this. Now I can very much see the appeal of this book, Thoreau has an unbelievable ability to detail his surrounding so vividly that one can picture himself there on the shores of walden pond. His dialogues on man living with only what he needs are so elegantly put that theres no wonder so many people think that hey I can go into the middle of nowhere and live so minimaly. The down side of this book to me was that he's very aware of how well spoken he is and tends to drone on about the same things multiple times at great lengths through out the book. Now he never repeats the same metaphor when redescribing something even for the fourth time which don't get me wrong is very impressive but makes the book about 100 pages longer than it really needs to be. Thoreau comes of a little to pompus for me in the fact that he likes to mention just how smart and witty he is over and over again, And to the people the get enamored with this breaking away from society and surviving on the land its self. Please pay attention closely before you decide to go all into the wild with yourself, why because one he's not very far from the village that he's breaking away from not to mention he makes multiple comments about getting things from town or from neighbors. So he's not that secluded from man, He's sounds like the kid that say's he's going to run away from home then proceeds to go to a friends house down the block thinking he's traversed the globe to get away. Now despite my critiques of Thoreau he is quite an astounding writer this book really is worth a read, But pay attention to whats really happening and try not to get caught up in all his exagerations of his situation. By the the way his book civil disobedience is way more pointent than walden."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book is fantastic. It's one of my favorite books along with Desert Solitaire by Edward Abbey. The Transcendentalists really knew what was going on. In our consumeristic times, it is necessary to learn how to simplify.

To make his point, he likens the burden of property ownership with the burden an ant endures while carrying a morsel. Like the ant we are blinded to the unnecessary weight of our possession.Unlike the Buddha, Thoreau shows by example that existence is suffering even when caused by the fulfillment of desire.In the second example, Thoreau gives us vision and asks that the word go out to every John or Johnathan that \\"there is more light to day than dawn. The sun is but a morningstar!\\"How could I -- a mere reviewer -- follow this up? I can't. Thoreau preached self reliance so I would offer the same: read Walden for yourself that you may better appreciate its wonders."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I needed an encyclopedia, a dictionary, and a reader's guide to get through this book. It's by no means light reading, Thoreau uses a lot of big words, metaphors, and references a lot of obscure people and places. Though arduous to read, this helped to expand my vocabulary and knowledge as well while reading. Even though it is so difficult to read, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. He had an amazing perspective on life and some of his writing just made me gasp in amazement. It's worth reading, my advice would be to not get discouraged if you don't understand everything he writes and says."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Anyone who has ever been stirred by discontent or haunted by life's unanswered questions or just intrigued by possibility, hear Walden's message. \\"No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted without proof.\\" Thoreau offers no proof, but merely sought himself, and challenges us rethink every assumption, habit, and doctrine. This concept, along with so much about Thoreau, resounds within me. As with no other writer, I can relate with him on a personal level. I, too, have had revelations in amidst simplicity and nature. Time and time again, I emerge from a time in the woods-be it two weeks backpacking in the smoky mountains or an afternoon jog beside four mile creek-only to find myself irrevocably changed. The seemingly impervious logic that formerly laid behind affections preferences, habits, hobbies, choices, even my lifestyle, had vaporized. The sun shines more brightly-and every aspect of life is illuminated differently. It can be an alarming but incredibly valuable experience, a free one as long as nature is preserved, and one that I would not trade for anything. All men would view and their time differently if only they became acquainted with nature, where time does not exist. \\"At present I am a sojourner in civilized life again.\\" The choice, in so many ways, is yours."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I have at least six or seven different editions of Thoreau's greatest classic, and this one is my prized possession. Of course, if I took his ideas more seriously I would simplify things and give away the other copies, but they have my notes in them and I find it hard to let go of them. Part of the problem of this edition being so beautiful, on excellent paper, with very useful notes and images, is that I would hate to mark it up with the lines and notes that I have included in some of the other editions. Still, that's a good problem. The notes in this book are useful notes -- not just a haphazard list of some scholars' remarks (not always authoritative) on favorite passages, and not speculation, but clear sources for some of the obscure references in the text.On the book as a whole, it is worth noting that Walden is rich in ideas and is one of the most profound American philosophical classics, and no reading could exhaust its wealth. It is much more than a journal of Thoreau's time alone in the woods (as it were) on the banks of Walden Pond (as it is often thought to be by those who haven't read it - I know because I often ask my students what they know about the book before they read it).A quick introduction to the project of Walden, that will help organize and make sense of some of the variety of Thoreau's remarks here, is to think of his remarks as falling under three rough stages:(1) an account of the problem we face, that we waste away our lives trying to make a living, that we seek to acquire property for the sake of freedom but find ourselves encumbered, that we associate the rise of modern technology with enlightenment but find that our technologies and advances increasingly take us away from ourselves and our self-sufficiency, and make us dependent on what we do not individually understand.(2) an account of an experiment undertaken to discover what is truly essential for a life of fulfillment, and the discovery that a complete and worthwhile life can be achieved through a deliberate simplification of desires.(3) an account of the many remarkable discoveries that can be made about ourselves and about the natural world and the relation between these when we voluntarily simplify our lives.This is a book to read and return to throughout one's life, and there aren't many books that really merit such attention. Given its importance, having a copy in what is probably the best edition available now makes a lot of sense."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Thoreau wrote a scathing and humerous critique of his neighbors. His comments about living in the moment, jumping off the rat race of working ever harder to accumulate more toys, about just plain walking about with open eyes, applies equally in our day. He bi-sected human frailty with a very sharp knife. Some of his writing uses terms and analogy unfamiliar in our daily use. But persevere and you will surely gain a new perspective on life."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I first read this book twenty years ago and found it a refreshing insight into the modern world. Every couple of years I refer to it and everytime I read it I am astonished at the insight in such a simple read. This book has become a friend, which good books do. As meaningful today as when it was written and to me a relief from the modern age. Beautiful quotes all the way through which I still use. One of my favourites is that \\"I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a velvet cushion\\"."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"In 1845 Henry David Thoreau built a 10 x 15 foot cabin in the woods on the shore of Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts, and lived there for two years, two months, and two days. Out of this experience came the book Walden, first published in 1854. Embarking on this sojourn of solitude was an attempt to escape the distractions, conventions, and frivolous fashions of urban society, to reconnect with the essentials of existence, and to get at the very root of life. By practicing a simpler way of living, engaging in a more direct relationship with nature, and replacing the hubbub of civilization with quiet contemplation, Thoreau hoped to experience life more fully and richly. The result of this experiment is this classic of American literature, an inspirational combination of philosophy, poetry, and natural history.Walden is a manifesto of nonconformity and individualism. Thoreau urges readers to forget how society says you should live and to live by your own compass, by what you feel is right. Disregard public opinion and take command of your own fate. The materialistic culture of modern, civilized society distracts us from finding our true direction in life. Solitude and introspection are the means by which to recover one's bearings. Through a simplified, more natural way of life, Thoreau was able to strip away the unnecessary psychic baggage of society's traditions and expectations, allowing him to examine his life objectively. By Thoreau's account, even in the mid-19th century Americans were slaves to the rat race, working themselves like beasts of burden, ever accumulating debt, all for the sake of luxuries that were supposed to bring pleasure to their lives but only compounded their misery. He begins the book by laying bare all the absurdities of this unhealthy cycle, insightfully picking apart the ills of his contemporary society with a biting, sarcastic wit. It is remarkable how well his critique of \\"modern life\\" has held up over the past 150 years. His opinion of the railroad, for example, can be just as accurately applied to today's internet when he questions the benefit of all this high-speed communication if people have nothing meaningful to say to one another. \\"Most of the luxuries, and many of the so-called comforts of life,\\" he writes, \\"are not only not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind.\\" To experience the true joy of life, quit living for your possessions and get your mind and spirit in order. Though the language of Thoreau often sounds antiquated to the 21st century reader, the message of Walden is still as vital as the day it was written.In describing his two years in the woods, Thoreau provides poetically beautiful and scientifically accurate depictions of the scenery, inhabitants, and processes of the natural world. Yet for Thoreau these empirical observations are only a means to an end. As a member of the Transcendentalist movement, Thoreau saw nature as a medium through which the higher philosophical truths of the universe are revealed. It is to nature that we should turn to seek guidance in living our lives, not to the traditions, mores, and manners agreed upon by civilized society. One need not retreat to the wilderness to lead a natural life. In fact, Walden Pond was only a few miles out of town, and Thoreau had visitors almost daily. Isolation was not the point of his experiment, but rather self-reliance, in thought as well as deed. To find direction in life one must seek inwardly. Nature is free to all, and all are free to learn its lessons and live by them. Let Walden be your guide. There is profound wisdom to be gleaned from each paragraph for those willing to seek it."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Not only is this an excellent read, it is a way of life. If you truly read this book more than once you will learn things about life and your place on this planet will be enriched. You will undergo changes, you must understand. Thoreau was a master at creating an alternative to living life in the fast lane. \\"Living Deliberatly\\" simply and with a purpose is so important, in this book you will learn how to do all of it. Your life will be better if you really try to understand. Even the slow parts have messages so be sure to pay attention. You will become awakened."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Whatever one may think about Thoreau's political opinions and courage - or lack of - in following them in his own life, this account of his lakeside solitary retreat is thought provoking and contains many brilliant descriptions of the simple beauty of his surroundings and the wild nature he embraced and contemplated."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Been reading some classics because I feel I should.

And though I don't think his was is the best way for everyone, I believe Thoreau gives up pause to think about what's actually important in life and how much of the rest is just window dressing."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Very disappointed! The abstract does not tell me the actual important content.

It's one of the most honest and inspiring books I've ever read, and I've finished a dozen books just the past few months. It could have been called \\"How man should live\\". If you are in touch with nature in any way, this book is for you.You'd not expect a person to talk of woods and animals for 200+ pages, but he easily does. Deep in the woods. But it's not just a camping manual. This is a philosophy and perspective on life, of living simply, and letting others live. It's about taking twenty minutes to watch a chipmunk gather nuts, or a bird retrieve the makings of a nest. It's slowing life down, and appreciating the many miracles that happen around us outdoors many times a day.This book has been published countless times through the years, and it will continue to connect with people for generations. It makes you realize that minus technology, little has changed in 150 years. Many books are called a classic, this one is."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I did not purchase this classic for myself.

I highly recommend multiple readings of this book as it can be hard to follow at times, slow at times but at the same time, even the slow areas are so important. Read it with an open mind and an open heart. I don't agree with many critics of Thoreau, I feel he was the Best American Author ever and he lived his life according to what he wrote about. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"To be fair: I've only read the first twenty pages as of now. While the English was a bit difficult to grasp (English is not my mother tongue) you get used to it very quickly.This book is fantastic, I'm completely blown away. I don't read books much, but this one is indeed special. The ideas presented are timeless, yet you can reach them with examples from your own life. The book itself is not about money or about housing, its about a lifestyle."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Thoreau had a very original mind and carved out a peaceful life for himself that was much different than how most lived at the time.

These things led him to a less hindered lifestyle, free of society's conventions."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I have loved Thoreau since I first read him in middle school and who doesn't love Thoreau. WALDEN is a great book to either revist Thoreau or read him for the first time.

Haven't been able to compare it with a newer translation yet. It is as if he were writing it as an answer to every mans plea. Timeless writing indeed.

He must have been a communist for the academic community to make such a fuss about this book."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This is the most horrible book I've ever read. If you think you can &quot;discover yourself&quot; or &quot;discover the meaning of life&quot; by going out into the woods by yourself well then you have a social problem. I don't believe a pond can tell you anything about people or about anything for that matter. What can happen to you if you go live in solitary for a long period of time is that you can develop a mental problem, and that's about it. Sure, lets get rid of everything in life that makes us happy, simplicity, simplicity, simplicity. Ha! This only sounds like a very depraved soul crying out for help. I think the only thing we can learn from this book is that it is not a good idea to go live in the woods by yourself, because it's hard. I say this book is a complete waste of time. It is perhaps the most boring piece of literature I've ever laid eyes. I say save your time and money and don't read this book."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I first read Solitude in high school(over 10 years ago), not as part of the regular curriculum but for US Academic Decathlon. To think about it even now still bores me. Reading Solitude may have been the most boring part of USAD, &amp; that ain't a little bit of boredom. Thoreau, Emerson, those other guys I can barely differentiate, especially the 'fire &amp; brimstone' types were some of the reasons I took British lit instead of American lit in college. I also took British lit rather than American because it is 800+ years vs. 200+. (Thanks Mr. M, my h.s. English lit teacher). But back to Walden.Think of it. You decide to live in solitude for a couple of years, in the 19th century! The very idea is boring. Let's not get into no t.v., et.c. But not even the daily news? Didn't they have newspapers back then? Before some make the mistake of thinking I don't understand, I (yawn) say I can appreciate one's desire to engage himself by the near total exclusion of others. I just don't believe its something you need to read about some guy doing over 150 years ago. On the other hand, if you wanted to avoid those very interesting times, you'd do what Thoreau did if you could so afford. If not you'd read about it, to quiet the debate going on outside one person's journey of self-discovery. Specifically, if I wanted to learn more about those times I'd check up on abolitionist writings, women's suffrage, and other things from the period that were more topical.Nevertheless, I could use a copy though, for those troublesome nights when I can't get to sleep.P.S. Thoreau is one of those authors you list that maintains your &quot;with it-ism&quot; in our increasingly 'my country, right or wrong' times."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"On my short list of all time favorite books, this one is up there at the top. It doesn't attain the #1 spot, but it's up there, definitely top five.I think it is very interesting to read the reviews and notice that the vast majority of the bad reviews are coming from the young, mainly teenagers who were made to read this in school. The vast majority of the good reviews are coming from the older and the more wizened.I think the youth of today are just so totally enamored with technology and what's cool and popular. I know I was when I was 17. But then you grow older and hopefully more wise, you live life a little and you no longer care about what's cool or what's popular, you are no longer so enamored with technology and you begin to see how technology is actually killing us. You have some perspective to temper the youthful idealism.I just loved everything about this book, but I never read it until my 30's. If I had read it in my teens, I probably would have thought it pretty stupid.I think Thoreau was a genius, both with words and how he lived his life. He did not live on Walden Pond his entire life, by the way. Walden pond was an experiment, not so much a way of life. His time there was meant to show people how superfluous most of our lives are, that it can be simplified, to our soul's benefit, not to mention the benefit of our fellow human beings and the world at large.He was not a stupid man, he was educated at Harvard. He knew that his way was not the way everyone could or would live. He was not advocating a new social order. He was merely trying to prove a point, that people's lives are way too complicated.It has been said that Thoreau was the anti-Benjamin Franklin. Realize that even in his day, Thoreau was ridiculed. It is no surprise that he would be ridiculed today, mainly by those who just simply could not live without their iPods.I read Walden as an ideal and it made me sad. I would love to live my life in the way he did on Walden Pond, but I'm just not so sure how possible it is to live that way in today's world or even how desirable. There has to be a happy medium. You don't have to run out and live as a hermit in order to be able to appreciate Thoreau. There is beauty in the middle way, one can learn to make small changes in their lives, to try and live more simply, as many today are trying to do, to lighten our footprint on this earth, for the betterment of all.I do believe that people's lives are too complicated, that they can't see the forest for the trees,that their lives are only about making more money so they can buy more things. They have lost their way in the world, they have forgotten, if they even even knew, what life is about.But running out to live by yourself is not the solution either. I am reminded of the story of Christopher McCandless, whose story was made into the movie Into the Wild. He learned too late that true happiness is not real unless shared. That without love, life is meaningless. And THAT is the reason that living on Walden Pond by yourself is not the answer. We are here on this earth for each other, to love. Without love, life is meaningless.To live on Walden Pond by yourself for a period of time, to find yourself, or to prove a point, is all well and good, but as a permanent way of life, it's not utopia.And Thoreau knew this, after his time in the woods, he went back to civilization, but he never lost his soul and he knew how the soul was refreshed... with love, with learning, and with nature."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Walden is a plea for self reliance and political understanding by a writer eager to get his reader to see that political and personal freedom in a democracy is gained through self knowledge and a recognition of what the individual owes to himself and the political state he finds himself in. Threau warns against the powers of media, money and government to run over the individual. He counsels self-knowledge and civil disobedience. He also writes with clarity and humour and the book is one that re-pays an alert reader with much to think about. This is not an autobiography or a nature essay but a meditation on how to be your own person in a mechanized world"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book hit me in high school like a shimmering beam of light. It made me start questing my motives for what activities I was spending my time doing, what kind of clothes I was wearing, and what things I was saying. I think like many teens a lot of my actions had to do with wanting to impress my classmates or to put up an image that I thought would make me popular. Once I read this book I couldn't go through through life without asking \\"why am I doing this?\\" over all of my important decisions. It's liberating to choose what'll make you happy, not what you think will make others like or respect you."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"While plenty has been said about this book, this review is about the benefits of the Mobi edition of this book for Kindle. There are numerous versions of this book published for Kindle and it might be difficult to decide between them. I tried using the free version of Walden, but without a linked table of contents, referring to specific chapters and sections of the book was nearly impossible. The Mobi version has fantastic formatting and, best of all, a linked table of contents. It is more than worth the dollar for the table of contents alone."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Just a few pages in, Thoreau puts in a few quotes from other authors, all of which are missing!

The seeds of what make WALDEN great are to be found there."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Often times a book you *should* read is one that isn't that enjoyable to read. At best, you have to work at it. The writing although informative, educational, and thought provoking is often complex, unapproachable, and drowned in archaic syntax. While not as easy reading as adult teen fiction, I'm about 1/3 of the way through and so far have been able to follow about 80% of it without needing to go back over anything or bust out my dictionary.The Kindle format itself is great and well adapted. No strange formats, no font oddities.As for the text, it should be pointed out that there is more to Thoreau than \\"simplify, simplify\\". His observations on the motivations and trappings of society are accurate and telling, proven even more by the fact that one hundred and fifty years have passed since its creation and little has changed.An outstanding text for anyone wishing to get more out of life and to distill out the things that are most excellent."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"As other reviewers have noted this version is incomplete and sentences stop in the middle.

Today, his thoughts, opinions, and experiences inform and educate us, enlightening us to a world of possibilities. Henry David Thoreau wrote Walden, and now all of us have a chance to spend time there in this richly illustrated edition.Jeffrey Cramer, Thoreau scholar, has meticulously put together this labor of love for the book, as is shown on each and every page. Writing a short, insightful introduction to this book, and carefully research notes in the margins of the book, add layers of understanding to an already powerful book.I hadn't ever visited Walden prior to this book. As a Walden novice, it served as an excellent introduction to an amazing man and an amazing work. I'm sure that both novices and scholars will benefit from this wonderful literary escape from the world. Yet the escape teaches us more about the world than we might ever know. Thanks to Cramer, and thanks to Henry for crafting this word feast."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I have to disagree with the positive reviews above, but I'll admit I don't generally enjoy audio books and I couldn't get through much of this one.The first problem for me is that it is Walden Lite. In the parts I listened to while following along in the text, all Thoreau's references and comments on mythology, history, etc. were eliminated. No doubt that makes it simpler to read and listen to, but it's not Walden. If you're not up to dealing with the whole book, just get a book of Thoreau quotes...don't listen to this and think you've heard Walden.The biggest issue I had was that I simply didn't like the voice of the actor reading. It's hard to say why exactly, but I think I found it too high-pitched and affected. Never had the pleasure of hearing HDT's own voice of course, but I like to imagine it a lot more down to earth than this one."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Henry David Thoreau is more to me than a neighbor.

In his book, Thoreau describes his break from 19th century &quot;civilization&quot;, and his experiment at surviving alone in the woods near Walden Pond.Thoreau survives on a bare minimum of money, food and &quot;necessities&quot;. Along the way, he discovers how fragile our environment really is (even in the 19th century) and becomes one of the nation's first environmentalists.Walden is an absolute classic. It may have been written over 100 years ago, but its content seems more pertinent today than ever before. It is perhaps even more pertinent today than at the time it was originally written. If you are looking for a book to help you understand the fragile balance of both nature and humanity, this one is a must. It certainly puts one's life into perspecive."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I want to know if anyone who has read this book actually liked it. I've talked to a lot of people who like Thoreau. And, after conversing with them further, I discovered that all of them (except for one) were lying. At least a little. They had read excerpts of Walden or individual quotations and thought them to be insightful and thought-provoking. I agree. When taken one sentence at a time, after, of course, carefully screening for only those which inspire deep thought and meditation, Thoreau is just fine.I read most of Civil Disobedience in HS as well as excerpts from Walden and I spent a few years thinking Thoreau was pretty hot stuff (literarily speaking of course...). So, when I found a pretty faux-leather bound copy of Walden and Other Writings at a used bookstore, I grabbed it, and went home so excited to read it, thinking I was going to be so edified. And then, after I started reading it, I realized I was so bored. Thoreau takes 300+ pages to talk about spending 2ish years in the woods, and with the amount he rambled, I'm thinking 100 to 150 pages would have been better. He told stories that related to nothing. In the middle of a chapter about walking around, he's suddenly start spouting off about this dove/dog/man who were all searching for each other and then... and then... and then... nothing. No resolution. He even itemized how much it cost him to build his little home in the woods. (Or rather, how much it should have cost him, because I swear, everything he took with him was donated by someone else...)Anyway, I could have gotten past the fact that Thoreau's life was a little dull, because really- he's spending 2 years in the woods with very little human contact, and no amenities. Don't get me wrong- I love the woods. I'm not gonna lie- I'd totally go live in the middle of the woods if I had the chance, although I'd make sure I took electricity and a flushing toilet with me... So, I could have forgiven that, and probably enjoyed this book a lot more if Thoreau didn't come off as so darn pompous and self-righteous. I'm kind of glad I never had to meet this man, because his writing makes him sound like one of the most condescending men I've ever come across. And, living in the woods for 2 years without the luxury of a doormat and then moving back to your original home does not make you qualified to tell me that my luxuries are the beginnings of my downfall into evil. He doesn't exactly say this, but it's pretty close and I definitely felt like Thoreau was talking/looking down on the rest of us. I might take Thoreau and his preachings about the benefits of an entirely simple life if he had always lived by Walden. But he didn't. He went home after a few years. But, he's still better than all the rest of us who invite evil into our lives. Bully for you Thoreau.I understand that this opinion very possibly makes me sound like an uncultured, uneducated philistine. I mean really, Thoreau is one of the Transcendentalists, right up there with Hawthorne, Whitman, and Emerson. I get that... But, I don't care. I didn't enjoy Walden. It's entirely possible that I was simply in the wrong mood to read this type of literature/philosophy when I gave it a shot, but I don't think so. Because I own the book and doubt I'll be getting rid of it (it's pretty and looks great on my bookshelf) I'll probably give this a try again in a few years, when I'm older and hopefully wiser and all that great stuff. And, if I'm still blogging, I'll be sure and let all of you know about my new opinion, if it changes at all.But I'm confused by all the 5 star ratings on Goodreads. Many more than I would have expected. The 4 and 5 star reviews strongly outweigh the negative reviews. So I wonder... Is there something that I'm missing? Or has the general population bought into the idea that they have to give the book a higher star rating to prove that they did, in fact, get it, as so many of us lesser people seem to not. Perhaps this paragraph doesn't make as much sense as it should... Although I was quite put off by Thoreau himself and his writing, I can see where the basic ideas of economy and simplicity could really resonate with someone. Perhaps, because I was raised to understand that living within my means and avoiding debt and extravagant lifestyles made this book superfluous to me, so I didn't feel it connect with me, but regardless. Whatever the reason I or you come up with, Walden was not for me.So, I'll ask you again. Am I in the majority, or the minority on this one? How did YOU feel about Walden and Thoreau's writing in general?"},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Thoreau went into the Concord woods \\"to live deliberately\\" and to try to approach in practice his excellent motto--multum in parvo--much in little. Setting off to transact some business as simply as possible, Thoreau began his famous experiment a happy man. Importantly, he concluded it 26 months later in the same convivial state. After proving to himself it could be done, he saw no point in continuing his experiment in such extreme fashion, becoming once again \\"a sojourner in civilized life.\\"Thoreau was certainly not alone in the woods. Apart from the many visitors he welcomed, he took frequent trips \\"into town,\\" or met woodchoppers and ice cutters during his marathon sojourns through the fields and forests surrounding his wooden castle. While most men, as he famously said, \\"led lives of quiet desperation,\\" Thoreau seemed to soak up the life and energy of every waking hour, giving him an inexhaustible supply of earthly happiness. There was nothing quiet or desperate about Thoreau.Classically-educated Thoreau was patently devoted to the writings of ancient authors, but to him the words and pages written by Nature were far more interesting and pleasing than histories in Latin or 2500 year-old Greek sagacity. In fact, Thoreau read very little during a good portion of his Walden experiment. He preferred sometimes just to sit on his doorstep from morning to noon, steeped in the sights and sounds of the abundant nature surrounding him. Of course he also wrote. But the Walden we read today is not simply a collection of his raw, day-to-day diary reflections. In fact, it wasnft until a few years later that he expanded and painstakingly polished the rough journal entries he made during his stay in the woods. Whatever the case, the writing in Walden is brilliant throughout. Foremost, Thoreau was a writerca profoundly masterful one at that.People read his Walden for a variety of reasons. I read it because it speaks with an immortal voice...and every word, phrase and sentence resounds with transcendent clarity. This simple little book is so full of hope, wisdom and inspiration that one can read it a thousand times and each time discover a new kernel of brilliance or vision.During his lifetime, traditional success would never be his. But you would have had to argue with him over the definition of success. \\"The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind,\\" the author so wisely said. It is precisely because of such profundity that his \\"success\\" is guaranteed for as long as people still read good books.\\"Follow your genius closely enough and it will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour.\\" --H.D.T."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I read this book when I was 16. I found myself fascinated with Thoreau's simplistic living, and overall, his philosophical awareness. He was sure of his purpose in life and meant to live by the expectations only he held dear. I believe he wanted us, the readers, to realize that a man with so much potential and ability doesn't always have the desire to use it. Life is too short to waste on anything less than what makes us pleased with ourselves. We all know deep down what's right from wrong, how we really feel towards life and everyone who lives in it. A good life is the ability to live with total assurance that what we do is worth our struggle maintaining it.It changed the way I think, whether it be his intention to do so or not. It was the reminder for me that I am human, and in no way insignificant."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"A book I had always meant to get around to reading, but somehow never managed to make a priority. Glad I had the bright idea to order the audio version!This is a wonderful disc to accompany a hike in the country, a walk in the woods, or anywhere one is alone in nature. With his embracing of the simple, unencumbered style of life, and rejection of all material non-essentials, it is easy to see how Thoreau became godfather to the hippie and counter-culture movements of the 1960's.The reader's near monotone delivery does not exactly make Thoreau's inspired musings spring vividly to life, but his controlled placidity is not unsuited to the serene nature of the narrative either. It was extremely handy to have all of the unabridged, over eleven hours on one disc; I found myself frequently rewinding to allow a second or third shot at unravelling the complex, but elegant and profound prose passages.Listening to this audio CD was an excellent way to finally get to know this venerable work; an inspiring classic that most readers are aware of but fewer have actually read."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Imagine a man, living in the present time, who is fed up with life in our ever-changing electronic world. So, he goes to live in a hut he's re-built out by a gentle pond, reasonably away from civilization. He throws away his cell phone, computer, TV, radio, etc. and lives simply and quietly, observing naature with his eyes and a microscope. He's not a hermit, because he visits and is visited by, friends and neighbors. He examines his life in solitude and writes about the sights and sounds of the woods and the pond.For two years living alone this way, he comes to know nature and himself intimately and when he returns to civilization, he is refreshed, spiritually, emotionally and mentally.Now, imagine all this as done 160 years ago when technology consisted of things like the newly invented telegraph (which he disdained), railway system, and others. Thoreau, like many of us today, longed to live simply and in harmony with Nature. The inspiration for hundreds of hippies, eco-freaks, Luddites and anti-technologists, he showed us that we sometimes need to get back to simple and clean living with no one and nothing to intrude on our thoughts.And by the time you've finished this little gem of a book, the weekend will be over, and it will be time to go back to the ugly, long commute to a place where technology and stress seemingly go hand in hand."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"This book has some great quotes about life. In one sense it seems like a postive thinking book. It suggests we reawaken ourselves. It tells us to live deliberately. He points out that life is frittered away by detail. He tells us to be philosophers rather than professors of philosophy. He points out that most men lead lives of quite desperation.Those are some of the things that I underlined and like to re read. The backdrop to all these great ideas is his time spent in the woods. He did retire from society for a while. He did make a lot of very detailed observations about nature. It felt like being in the woods. The experiences, in some ways, reminded me of my own time in the woods but in many ways they seemed like very different and new experiences.In the end he says he that he left the woods for as good a reason as for which he went there. I was not conviced of that claim. To assume that he he just went to the woods to record the experience and use the time to to offer his complaints about society is just not enough to explain this book. Somehow both approaches complimented each other.The book is well worth reading. After reading the book brings you back to find a quote your thinking about and to better understand the quote."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"The physicality of this edition feels as though Thoreau himself has put it together by hand - from the unusual scrap-book inspired approach to the cover to the reproductions of drawings and notations Thoreau had made in his own copy, it is a complete experience."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"From The Pond in Winter, I discovered Thoreau's symbol of Walden and his inner eye which dominate this entire chapter. Thoreau, as a surveyor, measures Walden Pond with tools, with his literary genius and muses on the enterprise that comes from the industry of ice-cutting in the Winter.Thoreau stresses Nature and how wonderful he awakes to Nature and daylight; he had a question during the night and felt that Nature answered it with the dawn and the glorious world of creation. In one of his most memorable descriptions, Thoreau says about the Pond, Heaven is under our feet as well as over our heads.Thoreau talks about his successful strategy in surveying the Pond and tells us that he was thankful that the Pond was made deep and pure for a symbol. While men believe in the infinite some ponds will be thought to be bottomless. He talks about the formation of puddles on the Pond and how he could see a double shadow of himself, one standing on the head of the other, one on the ice, and the other on the trees or hillside. He creates a metaphor with this description, one of Thoreau on the Earth and another of his transcendence into the ice of Walden Pond.Joyce Carol Oates prefaces this book with an introduction that ends with her saying that the universe is wider than our views of it. In Walden Pond, we can broaden our view and transcend into the earth's beauty with Thoreau."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I read an abridged version of this for a Great Books course many years ago and I enjoyed it.

What do you expect, I was 12. Oddly though, since then it sort of pops up in my mind periodically, like the smell of comfort food or a fond memory, so I've reread the book (in its entirety) every few years. It's like the best kind of friend--you can kind of wander off and do your own life but then return and find the connection is as strong as ever, you still find warmth and something for your soul there. I'm about to buy the Kindle format because it's summer and I need some good summer reading material, and Thoreau stepped in to fill that void. All the nice, wild, nature places are slowly going away and all that we'll have someday is Thoreau to remind us of how foolish we've been building condos and golf courses on all the ponds and woods and open meadows."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"Well, this is WALDEN by HENRY DAVID THOREAU . . . seems almost sacrilegious to \\"review\\" it.

I loved the fact that there are subtle literary and other references - need to reread because I'm sure I didn't catch them all. Yes!!

As we progressed through this immortal masterpiece, they began to see the simple beauty and obvious application of Walden and the discourse of Thoreau in general.Walden is suitable for anyone looking to scale back their hectic life and appreciate the emotionally and intellectually tactile world that is so often muted by the chaos that is modern life. Walden is also useful for outdoor enthusiasts seeking a method of meditation without any major religious or spiritual attachments. Thoreau guides the reader to a life of appreciation and proves that less is better."},{"Title":"Walden","review":"I'm reluctant to be harsh. But the narration ruins the audio book.

What is called resignation is confirmed desperation\\" There's more from Thoreau's book Walden:\\". . . . everywhere, in shops and offices and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a thousand remarkable ways.\\" And Thoreau goes on.\\" I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms, houses, barns, cattle and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled by a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were called to labor in.

And her best friend, Birdy, is too busy getting chummy with a popular girl named Roxy to help. So when Mitzi tells miake a huge lie about her mother's condtition just to get his attention, she has no one to blame but herself for the trouble that follows.I really enjoyed this story, even though I have never had any similar problems.

The story is about a normal girl Mitzi and she has troubles with her life. The first trouble she has in her life is that her mom smokes a lot. Her mom keeps on trying to quit but can't handle herself and keeps smoking. Her second problem is that her best friend has a new girl to hang out with named Roxy and Mitzi feels forlorn. She is also concerned for her best friend because Roxy and Birdy (the best friend) were caught smoking a cigarette. The third problem is that a boy named Mike Humphrey does not notice her. The last problem is a result of Mitzi trying to get Mike to like her. Mitzi tells Mike that her mother is DEATHLY ill and is in the hospital. Mitzi thinks that by telling Mike this, he will feel pity on her and start liking her. But her plan backfires because Mitzi's mother is first off, not ill at all. Second off, Mitzi keeps worrying about her mother running into Mike's mother. And lastly Mitzi feels pretty bad about telling such a bad lie like that just to get some guy to notice her. All of these problems are resolved though. The smoking problem with the mother is resolved when the mother realizes the lie Mitzi told was based on her smoking. The problem with Birdy hanging out with Roxy more was resolved because Birdy realized that she honestly didn't like Roxy and Roxy just got Birdy into trouble. The problem with Mike Humphrey was resolved when Mitzi found out that Mike was just another comic-book dork.

Even more casual readers, however, will find much to enjoy in the pages of this lavishly produced book. (Whitfield truly deserves a much wider reading than he has hitherto received). The \\"mean streets\\" pounded by Gar are the humid, typhoon buffeted \\"calles\\" of pre-WWII Manila ... that's right, Manila ... you know, the Philippines! A more exotic and dangerous setting has perhaps never been devised for a hardboiled series. Gar himself is part Spanish and part Filipino. As such he fits right into the multi-ethnic mix of this teeming Pacific metropolis. The ambience in these stories is classic noir - from the seedy bars along the inky waters of the Pasig River to the smoke-filled multi-lingual babble of the ubiquitous cockfight arenas. And everywhere he goes Senor Gar, who has a reputation among the criminal element for always getting \\"his man\\" (\\"West of Guam\\"), must be ever on the lookout for a knife-blade or bullet aimed in his general direction.De rigueur also in a series of this type is conflict with the local police, and one finds that here in abundance as well. A former officer in the Manila Police, Jo Gar has little patience for the blundering and pompous posturing of, first, his former partner Juan Arragon and later, of the supercilious and arrogant Lieutenant Sadi Ratan. At the end of \\"The Amber Fan,\\" and after being outwitted yet again by the wily Gar, Ratan admits under some duress that the private detective is \\"very clever.\\" The policeman then suggests (uncharacteristically) that the two men should work even more closely together. \\"I might even consider,\\" Ratan remarks off-handedly, \\"resigning in order to enter and strengthen your private agency.\\" Ever polite, Gar nonetheless rebuffs his adversary with grace and style. \\"I fear,\\" the detective replies, \\"that the loss to the Force would be too great, Lieutenant.\\"At a time when Asians were being portrayed in the West as soulless villains (Fu Manchu) or as stereotyped ethnic caricatures (Charlie Chan), Whitfield broke new ground with his sensitive and nuanced characterization of Jo Gar. Also noteworthy in these stories is the fact that, although they stand smack dab in the middle of the hardboiled tradition and are played out against a noir background, each of Gar's cases presents the reader with a puzzle-plot to be solved. In that regard, at least, Whitfield was not afraid to borrow from the \\"cozy\\" tradition of the classic Victorian consulting detective. What results is an interesting and engaging amalgam that is a unique and hugely entertaining contribution to the genre. Pick up a copy of JOE GAR'S CASEBOOK and savor a singular reading experience.

McDonald has written an extremely well researched book about Alexander Hamilton, the man who arguably did more to set the American government in motion than any of the other founders. Not only thorougly written, but the author weaves the events of Hamilton's most interesting and significant life into a very readible book. The author is a first class biographer and writer.Although George Washington has been described as the &quot;indispensible man&quot; of the Revolution, the title &quot;indispensible man of the first administration&quot; rightly belongs to Hamilton. He faced major issues that would define how the government operated and whether or not our fledgling nation would rest upon a sound financial system.Hamilton succeeded brilliantly. Against long odds, he dealt with the assumption issue (state debts incurred during the revolution), coinage, taxation and the establishment of the nation's credit. This was after effective adminstrative service during the Revolution as Washington's aid (as well as other important posts such as leading the storming of Redoubt No. 10 at Yorktown), writing the Federalist Papers with Madison and Jay, and pushing the ratification of the Constitution through a reluctant New York General Assembly.The book also provides fascinating glimpses of political manuvering among the founders. Although brilliant when establishing our plan of government and enshrining ideals into our framework of governance, they plotted and schemed like the best Tammany Hall politicos. Jefferson is shown to be an idealist even in dealing with current issues. Monroe arguably commits treason when revealing confidential information of President Washington to sympathizers of the French Directorate in order to gain them advantage over the Administration. Madison, so noble in structuring the Constitution, is shown as one of the ablist congressional gamesmen ever to have played.These are not necessarily criticisms of the founders. While they rightly hold their reputations for having created our Constitutional govenrment, the portrait of their workings within the system -- buffetted by parochial interests, vanity, ambition and all of the other factors at play on public officials, makes them more human and accessible.Throughout all, Hamilton is a steadying influence on events. Guided by the principals of establishing a system of administration and government that will constrain the bad habits of public men and force their ambitions to work toward the public good, as well his overriding drive to put the nation on sound financial footing, Hamilton is revealed as the keystone of the early Federalist period. Without his steadfastness and talents, it is possible that our ideals may have only been words on a paper labled &quot;Constitution&quot; as a backward nation wallowed in debt and succumbed to the machinations of forces from within and without who would use the United States for their own purposes.Great book about a Great man."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"This book drastically changed my opinion about Alexander Hamilton. Up to the time I opened it (after four idle years on my book shelf), James Madison and Thomas Jefferson had been considered the primary gilt-edged heroes of the Revolution and main pillars upon which the Constitution was formed. Mr. Hamilton? Well, he was relegated to the less-than-heroic rank as a self-promoting, money-centered, cold and heartless calculator, notable only for his unpopular battle to establish a federal bank and his life-ending duel with Aaron Burr.But Mr. McDonald's fascinating review of Alexander Hamilton's life added texture to the stereotype and a sympathetic understanding of Hamilton's character and intellectual brilliance.Perhaps it was because he had few intellectual peers that Hamilton was feared and disliked by the likes of Madison and Jefferson. Perhaps it was precisely for that reason Hamilton became a favorite of George Washington and served as his aid and advisor. As General and as President, Washington maintained an Olympus view of the men of his times. He appreciated Jefferson and Madison for what they offered to our young nation. But he seems to have valued Hamilton more.Hamilton's view of government, money and banking, his integrity and his admirable regard for honor have never really been accurately nor fully told in school room history.But thanks to Mr. McDonald, they are easily discovered in this well-written effort, a book which is highly recommended."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Forrest McDonald wrote this book out of a profound knowledge of the legal, financial, and economic environment of the world of late-colonial America that Alexander Hamilton came into, and of the early Republic, that he transformed.

These characteristics were enough to vault him to the upper reaches of early American society. But his financial and economic program -- that rescued this new and foundering nation -- is the true basis of his greatness.Hamilton was a man of parts, not least of which was his technical mastery of the financial means to establish and maintain a sound currency and national credit. Apprenticed to a merchant at an early age, he quickly came to appreciate the mentally invigorating effects of the commercial life. He was naturally quick and, as in repudiation of his socially marginal origins, a rigorous adherent to morality and \\"gentlemanly\\" honor. His talents, hard work and charm bouyed him up, and he seized each new opportunity with both hands, for his ambition would not let him rest. McDonald tells the story of Hamilton's early years with vigor and interest, but it is clear that the thrust of this book is to elucidate his real accomplishment as Secretary of the Treasury. This was the funding and assumption of the debts that the just-formed United States had inherited, the taxes and tariffs to pay for these, and the financial mechanisms -- including the Bank and the sinking fund -- to create, as out of nothing (or less than nothing) a universal and sound currency, as well as a store of capital to fund businesses, which he felt must be the drivers of the economy.This book is fairly compact, but gives a good feel for Hamilton the man. If you want more in that line, then the current biography by Ron Chernow is where to look. But here you will learn what Hamilton did that no one else could have done, and that needed doing. Even his enemies -- Jefferson especially -- found, though they repudiated the man and his politics, that in the end they couldn't do without his works."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"I wanted to learn more about Hamilton as the founder of the US financial system, and to understand more of his background in relation to the other founding fathers. This book did a great job of both, the author being a well published historian who has focused on the early American economy.Mr. McDonald does a very good job of developing Hamilton's life, and the various philosophical influences that influenced him most significantly. Starting with his early life on St. Croix, his early abandonment and subsequent David Copperfield-esque determination to achieve fame in life, we are able to watch as Hamilton starts first by pursuing glory in the Revolutionary War, his close service with Washington, and how he then went to work as an attorney, and following Washington's election returned to serve his country as the first Secretary of the Treasury.Hamilton's ambitions for the fledgling financial system are solidly shaped by his own background and hard work. It is quickly apparent how different his own background was from other founding fathers, most notably those of the South, and most poignantly Thomas Jefferson. Hamilton held himself to very high standards, his own need to be honest about an extra-marital affair is a lesson to our current politicians, and he frequently ran afoul of others because of his strong will and confidence that he was morally in the right. Hamilton was above repute with his financial dealings, preventing himself from benefitting from his own legislation and actions in an age when such was the norm. His ability to clearly divine a situation and act decisively led him to be not only an excellent litigator and legislator, but also an indispensable agent for the Government, his importance being most noted during Washington's second term in office.All in all the author does a very good job of putting Hamilton into both the proper historical context, and helping the reader understand how he was viewed in his own time.Favorite Excerpts:&quot;I would willingly risk my life tho' not my Character to exalt my Station... I wish there was a War.&quot; - Hamilton (page 5)&quot;He never ceased to dream of grand and heroic accomplishments, but he tempered his dreams with regular habits, reliable behavior, systematic and persistent application, and constant attention to self-improvement. He despised laziness, disorderliness, unpredictability, impropriety, procrastination, drunkennes, sloght - the ways of the islands and, as he would come to believe by 1779, the ways of most Americans as well.&quot; - McDonald on Hamilton (page 10)&quot;As a general marches at the head of his troops, so ought wise politicians... insomuch that they ought not to wait the event, to know what measures to take; but the measures which they have taken, ought to produce the event.&quot; - Demosthenes (page 35)&quot;Nothing is more common than for men to pass from the abuse of a good thing to the disuse of it.&quot; - Hamilton (page 42)&quot;As Hamilton learned in doing his research for the report [to congress], few American farmers knew whether farming was more or less profitable than other enterprises, for almost none kept any records. The lack of information did not, however, prevent them from having opinions.&quot; McDonald (page 233)Jefferson had, &quot;a womanish attachment to France and a womanish resentment of Great Britain.&quot; - Hamilton on Jefferson (page 265)&quot;Having contributed to place those of the Nation on a good footing, I go to take a little care of my own; which need my care not a little.&quot; - Hamilton on his resignation (page 303)&quot;Real firmness is good for everything - Strut is good for nothing.&quot; - Hamilton (page 334)"},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"This is the 15th book on the Founding Fathers I have read in the last three months. Hands down it is the best. I have always admired Hamilton for his abilities. But McDonald makes clear he was a deep thinker not just a man of tremendous energy. He set out with a grand vision beyond any other founder - to effect a social revolution. I have read Novus Ordo Seclorum by the same author, but this book is a swift running current. Once you jump into the first chapter you will just keep going. I would put this book on the list of 10 nonfiction books every American should read. Now, I just wish someone could write on the other Founders with the same panache, style, and love for America."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"This is a well-written and thought-provoking book, but at the same time one that I found unsatisfactory on certain levels. For one thing, as a biography, it's limited in scope, providing little information about Hamilton's life beyond his administrative and political affairs. His childhood and youth are dispensed with in about 15 pages, and the American Revolution - in which Hamilton participated as an senior aid to Washington and as combat officer - is already over by page 25, bypassing what one assumes should have been a wealth of fascinating material. His wife is mentioned no more that the few times, his children hardly at all, and we learn very little about his personal relationships with the other leading figures of his era. A life-and-times style biography was obviously not part of the author's design in the first place, and this criticism may thus be irrelevant, but a more substantive problem is the bias that pervades his book. While it's common enough for biographers to fall in love with their protagonists, Professor McDonald to carries his enthusiasm to an extreme. I'm not a historian by any means, but I've read enough to know that the men surrounding Alexander Hamilton were a prodigiously gifted array of politicians. Yet a reader who knew nothing of the period beyond the contents of this book would have the impression that they were a collection of relative mediocrities who paled in the light of Hamilton's genius. Even Washington, who comes off better than most, seems to have achieved success only through his willingness to acquiesce, most of the time, to Hamilton's unerring behind-the-scenes guidance. Hamilton's enemies are portrayed as conniving villains, and the arch-villain, Thomas Jefferson, appears to have had no purpose to his life other than to foil Hamilton's otherwise infallible blueprint for a happy and prosperous nation. The fact that Hamilton himself probably more-or-less saw his world in this light is more understandable than how a historian two centuries later could succumb the this same lack of objectivity. Despite these failings, Professor McDonald has nonetheless produced a remarkable study here, and I learned a great deal from it. What emerges is the portrait of a man who, even allowing for the author's partiality, was indeed probably the most forward-looking of his peers in his understanding of what the United States was to become. Modern Americans take for granted their colossal economic might and geopolitical dominance. Yet post-revolutionary America was a weak, divided country run by agrarians generally hostile to the formation of the finance capital and industrial enterprise. The essence of the Federalist vision for America was that establishment of a strong central government was necessary to facilitate economic development. And Hamilton's unique contribution to this vision was his understanding of the critical importance that a dynamic system of national credit and currency would play in bringing about prosperity. Hamilton was a supremely ambitious man, yet his aspirations propelled him not to be a king or a president or a conquering general. When the new American government formed following the revolution, the only post he desired - easily granted to him by Washington - was Treasury Secretary. It was from this position that he believed he could establish the monetary foundations critical to the fledging economic powerhouse he sought to nurture. His political opponents, led by Jefferson, understood this vision only too well as one that would result in a tumultuous transfer of wealth and power to industrialists and bankers, at the expense of the agrarian order they hoped to perpetuate. One insight implicit in this story, even though the author doesn't draw it for us, is the obvious nature of the link between this post-revolutionary conflict and the great civil war what was to ignite half a century later. It couldn't be clearer that it was the Federalist dream for America, well-rooted by the mid-nineteenth century, that drove the Southern Confederacy to revolt. That same dream finally emerged in full flower in the following century as Yankee industrialism triumphed and Hamilton's Dollar achieved preeminence. Hamilton's death in 1805 following a duel with Aaron Burr has to have been one of the weirdest and most dramatic incidents in American history. Yet it is characteristic of this biography that the event is described only briefly and dryly in the epilogue. Hamilton was a brilliant man, but one whose personal arrogance probably contributed unnecessarily to the partisan hatred of the post-war years and no doubt as well to his own premature demise. For me it was interesting to learn that Hamilton's son also died in a dual, three years before his father, at a time when this violent custom had become rare. This remarkable co-incidence suggests a fiery dynamic in the Hamilton family which this book leaves us totally in the dark about, as it does about many other dimensions of his life and character. To the extent Professor McDonald sought to trace Hamilton's development as a political thinker and the practical impact of his work on the nation's founding, this well-written biography succeeds admirably. However, readers seeking a balanced and full account of the man's life will have to look to other sources."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"I started this book thinking that Aaron Burr did us a favor. Even though I am on the other side of the political spectrum of the author, Forrest McDonald, he was able to change my mind about the role of Alexander Hamilton in our history. I now believe that Hamilton was the sharpest of our Founding Fathers. I am still Jeffersonian at heart (though as an engineer in an air-conditioned cubicle I would never want to be a yeoman farmer), but I have a lot more respect for the man who adorns the $10 bill. The strengths and weaknesses of Hamilton rival those of the current President (June 2000). The Maria scandal is even better than the Monica scandal, and the Hamilton economy is even more solid than the Clinton economy. The writing of McDonald is inspiring. While reading this book I felt compelled to jump up and do something as important as Hamilton did. Alas, I could not, but the experience of reading this book is something I will remember for a long time."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Forrest McDonald is the only biographer of Hamilton who has what it takes to discuss his subject. As a Professor of Economics and Law, he understands not only the fields in which Hamilton worked, but the historical importance of this brilliant Founding Father.Hamilton has been subjected to a massive deconstruction by the Jeffersonian Party--and it still goes on. Perhaps TJ made the grand speeches and declarations which define our Republic--but Alexander Hamilton lived the life and took the political risks which have made America the greatest nation on earth. This Founder was no mere politician, no businessman with his eye on the main chance, but a profound economic philosopher.If you want to read a book which will tell you the truth about Alexander Hamilton, make this the one!"},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Hamilton is one of the most misunderstood figures is American history. Even if you consider Hamilton a 'dastardly figure,' after reading this book one can't help but see him a true revolutionary who succeeded in developing a system that helped to transform American society into the industrial and economic power it is today."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Being primarily interested in U.S. constitutional history I picked up this book to better understand Hamilton's contribution to the Constitution and the development of the American government. McDonald more than delivered what I was looking for. This biography lays out Hamilton's public life and places his actions into the context of the political events of the time. I also learned some things I had never read before. Particularly, that Hamilton was one of a handful of founders who strongly denouced slavery. I highly recomend this book to anyone interested in early american politics.One should note that the detractors of this work are those who are obvious believers in the cult of Jefferson. Modern America has so deified Jefferson, that when a historian suggests he acted with impure motives or used dirty tactics, he is attacked as a &quot;partisan.&quot; For example, McDonald details the controversy surronding the Bank. He demonstrates that the constitutional objections raised by Madison and Jefferson were a result of a fear that the Bank would be used to keep the capital in Philadelphia rather than move it to the Potomac. Madison, Jefferson, and Washington all were engaged in land deals in the area that would be harmed if the move didn't occur. What does this prove: Only that they weren't angels. Simply pointing this out shouldn't warrant McDonald being attacked as &quot;partisan&quot; or this book as &quot;Hagiography.&quot;"},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Though this biography is about 25 years old now, it's one on Hamilton that I will not part with. Forrest McDonald has written many books on early colonial American history, on the Constitution and on the presidency of Washington and Jefferson. He is now a Distinguished University Professor at the University of Alabama. This biography is more substantive than Brookhiser's and Brookhiser, I believe, actually consulted with Forrest McDonald when he wrote his book on Hamilton. Our government sometimes consults McDonald on Constitutional issues. As to political affiliations, McDonald describes himself as \\"an unreconstructed Hamiltonian Federalist\\". (The federalist party doesn't exist anymore; the present day republican and democratic parties are both offshoots from the previously named democratic-republican party).I've written this review so many times, mainly because I think that this Hamilton's life deserves a careful study, particularly with regard to his work on getting the Constitution ratified and his work in the treasury department. I highly recommend Frederick Scott Oliver's Alexander Hamilton:an Essay on Union which I've reviewed previously and Knott's Alexander Hamilton and the persistence of myth. Oliver's book is really dated, going back to 1928, and is written from a British viewpoint. He was a Scottish lawyer, read by Lord Tweedsmuir/John Buchan, who unfortunately only wrote several other books; his biography on Hamilton, in my opinion, is beautiful. This biography is good too. I love the quotes from Pope that McDonald heads every chapter with. (Hamilton's favorite authors were Pope and Plutarch). Chapter 8 is entitled Funding and Assumption which deals primarily with Hamilton's solution to the huge debts the colonies owed other nations following the Revolution. Stephen Knott's suggests in his book that Hamilton's solution of setting up a sinking fund would have been a good solution to another huge debt that our Treasury Department had to deal with soon after, (I believe), Bush Sr.'s four years, yet Congress gave this suggestion little notice. What makes McDonald's bio a standout, I think, is the depth of material he provides in explaining what he did as Treasurer. He's also biased toward Hamilton which I think actually is a good thing and paints not so rosy a picture about Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, or Burr.I think this biography will stand the test of time because of its solid research from Hamilton's birth to his death; McDonald's biography is the most comprehensive and complete. (I haven't read the newer biographies yet; I do believe this one will remain the standard). I was particularly impressed with his treatment of Hamilton's youth and parentage. I'd like to give this book 5 stars, yet American politics and writers to some extent alarm me. If I could, I would give this book 4.5 stars, the 0.5 subtracted for my cautious misgivings stated previously, and, compared to Oliver's biography, Oliver really understands the characters of Hamilton, Jefferson and others, most accurately portrays them, which is what a biography should be. To McDonald's credit, his and Oliver's agree on many points. Highly recommended for serious students of American history and of this most notable, yet rarely noted founding father."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"This is my most favorite biography.

Read this book. Alexander Hamilton is fascinating -- his life has shaped our lives. I am very impressed with this book"},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"THE SHORT REVIEW: According to McDonald: \\"In sum, Hamilton was right on all counts.\\" The quote was extracted from the chapter on the Adams years, but is reflective of just about any chapter, any period, any event, any dispute, and the book as a whole.\\"He shared the world stage with George III, Louis XVI, Napoleon, Talleyrand, Pitt, Fox; in America his co-actors were Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Burr. But these were merely contemporaries.\\"For a reverential account look no further (but do seek further insights on the other Founding Fathers), for scholarly balance look elsewhere.THE LONG VERSION (Very long, read as much as you can tolerate).I was induced into reading this book by a review that suggested it provides intellectual and scholarly insights into Hamilton's thinking, and how it interlaced or contrasted with that of other principal players in an exceptional era in not only American history, but in the course of human governance and development. I was sorely disappointed. That one man can be right and righteous at all times (bar one personal affair, heroically acknowledged by himself) strains credibility past my breaking point. Having come to this book after the biographies of Franklin, Washington, Adams, Jefferson, and Madison, and other books regarding our founding fathers, and having taken note of the amazing array of alert minds that came to bear on our nation's founding, Mr. McDonald's tendency (mission?) to lionize Hamilton as above all others became unconvincing and ultimately disaffecting.\\"...for Hamilton was almost alone in having no petty personal interests at stake. Driven by lust for Fame [taken as honor and glory at their purest], he failed to anticipate that most others, not only speculators and demagogues, but the likes of Washington, Madison, and Jefferson, had special axes to grind, fortunes to make, or power to win...\\" [Bracketed wording added.]Washington was \\"...exasperatingly inert...\\" when he took time to deliberate on Hamilton's recommendations and consider other views. \\"...only Washington's dignity and integrity sustained him, and monumental as those qualities were, they were no substitute for leadership [as provided by Hamilton].\\"Adams, \\"...the pompous and porcine vice-president...\\" and \\"...pompous bore...\\" was \\"...vain and eccentric personally and pedantic and dogmatic philosophically.\\" \\"...deep inside the man lay an insecure and resentful heart...\\" ruled by \\"...an unreasoning [rather than reasoned] fear... of standing armies\\", a man that would \\"...let his emotional problems impair the soundness of judgment...\\".Jefferson \\"...sought to ruin his [Hamilton's] relationship with Washington by pouring innuendos, rumors and lies into the president's ear...\\" and was \\"...scarcely able to suppress his glee over the catastrophe, added to it by spreading false accounts of the extent... another of Jefferson's actions was openly malicious...\\" all part of an \\"... ambitious agenda of destruction...\\" in part through \\"...a masterpiece of legal obfuscation...\\" and \\"...chicanery all along\\".Madison's \\"...betrayal, especially, bewildered Hamilton...\\" \\"Meanwhile, smelling death, the vultures had swooped down to pick the carcass from Hamilton's bones. On March 8, Madison and his minions...\\".At one time, Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson, Madison and Monroe worked to common purpose and in general harmony. Jefferson admired Hamilton to the point of inviting him into the American Philosophical Society. With time, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe broke away from Hamilton, becoming increasingly alarmed by what they perceived of his long term views and intentions. The book covers a number of the contrasts, but it does so disjointedly, laying much of the blame to ingrained culture, pettiness and greed on the part of the others. It never quite lays out the whole picture, never quite probes in depth why so many great minds became so troubled by and worked so vigorously against Hamilton's pursuits.But we know that these adversaries served as the second, third, fourth, and fifth presidents, and that they steered the fledgling U.S. Government, even if imperfectly, toward the strong and stable democracy and broad freedoms that are ours to enjoy two centuries later. That would seem to provide some assurance as to their intentions and confer some plausibility to their apprehensions.McDonald's disjointed approach is also applied to the relationships with England and France. The overall picture and the sweep of events over the period is never presented - only snatches, mostly in support of Hamilton's stances and wisdom. France's assistance during the revolution in the form of loans, men, and naval fleet (without which Cornwallis would not have been decisively besieged and routed at Yorktown) are barely mentioned. The US treaty with France is given little relevance. The continuing belligerence of England : confiscation of American cargo, capture of American seamen and pressing them into serving on British ships - restrictive trade impositions, the continuing goal among many Britons of bringing the renegade colonies to heel, etc. - is given scant attention. A fuller history would have shed better light on the split American attitudes and the divergent reactions to the Jay Treaty.An example pertaining to Jay's Treaty: McDonald tells us that \\"Feelings in New York were running so high that when supporters of the treaty encountered opponents, fist fights were apt to result; on one occasion, Hamilton was stoned by a mob when he attempted to speak on behalf of the treaty\\" but he does not tell us what aspects of the treaty aroused such bitter opposing sentiments, much less probe them. He consistently omits the means for the reader form a comparative view of the merits.The book is well written. It is extensively annotated and referenced (every page, and nearly every paragraph). There is no question that an exhaustive list of references has been consulted. However, that does not necessarily translate to corroboration of the main text. Personal interpretation of the reference material, presented as fact in the text, is a recurring phenomenon in the book, as many notes will attest. Among the notes I perceived a pattern of discredit or dismissal, occasionally blunt, of authors and studies unfavorable to Hamilton, and laudatory endorsement of favorable ones. From there McDonald proceeds as if his interpretation renders his choice a fact. While his work was unquestionably extensive, it is not clear what makes McDonald the overriding authority (unless it is to admit that this his book and keep it at that).One of the notes [4, Ch. XII] is a revealing example of McDonald's self-asserted authoritative stances:\\"Hamilton's superior knowledge of Europe and his superior judgment and skill [relative to Jefferson] are evident [to McDonald] from a dispassionate [that is, McDonald's] study of his correspondence with that of Jefferson during the period.\\" Though he cites others, and even an unfavorable source, this is enough evidence for McDonald to state boldly in the main text, p265:\\"... he [Treasury Secretary Hamilton] was constitutionally inacapable (sic) of remaining a passive spectator when the vital interests of his country were in jeopardy, and that he understood European affairs better than did his counterpart [Secretary Jefferson] in the State Department.\\" That a personal interpretation becomes the basis for an assertion as fact - a pattern in this book - is more troubling than the use of the supposed fact as McDonald's justification for Hamilton's role expansion in this particular instance.And so it goes..."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Be careful of this book. Hamilton was a great man -- and one much misunderstood in his own time ... and today.McDonald, unfortunately, goes too far in Hamilton's defense. He attempts to paint a picture where Hamilton was responsible for virtually everything that was done right -- and who cautioned against most of the missteps. Everyone else (not just Jefferson!) is painted as incompetent, stupid, conspiring, and selfish.Nor does McDonald at least acknowledge (except in some endnotes) where he departs from the &quot;conventional&quot; view point. And, as other reviewers note, there is little discussion of Hamiltons personal life and habits, his family, etc.If you are very familair with the personalities and issues of the time, this book provides an interesting viewpoint and a very good discussion of the banking issues involved.But don't start here."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"McDonald seems to have set out to write a book emphasizing Hamilton's political and financial/administrative contributions to the new republic and that is what he did. There is relatively little on Hamilton's personal life. For that one must look elsewhere (to Ron Chernow for example). The book is largely successful at what it is trying to do and is very good on the finance/administrative areas. One would expect no less from McDonald. As his other works on constitutional history show, he is an expert on the political philosophy and thought of the time as well as the period's economic theories.The prose is crisp, direct and clear for the most part but perhaps not the most sprightly ever committed to paper. McDonald can certainly be serious and charming simultaneously as he was in his memoir of his life as a historian (Recovering the Past), but his tone in his more formal work is quite brisk and even heavy at times.I would downgrade the book somewhat for two reasons: First, as mentioned, it scants the personal life in favor of the ideas and actions. With Hamilton, however, the personal life and conduct were utterly intertwined with his political and physical fates, especially as he grew older and (it seems) both increasingly intemperate and fearful that he had not been accorded sufficient esteem by contemporaries and might not have achieved the degree of 18th century style fame that would cement his reputation for posterity. The duel, for example, is one of the dumbest things that a smart man ever did and was to my mind in large part caused by events in his personal life.Second, the book is quite partisan and even hagiographic occasionally. Most biographers sympathsize with their subjects and give them more than the benefit of the doubt; but, judging from the book, Hamilton seems to be in McDonald's all-time personal pantheon of historical heroes and it shows. This may be because McDonald appears to share in some part the distrust of popular democracy that gave rise to Hamilton's fear of government by \\"the mob.\\" Whatever the reason, Hamilton is seldom portrayed as wrong or even in error.Overall this is a worthy book by a fine scholar of the period and is especially good at making clear Hamilton's financial systems and political ideas in the context of the times."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"I have now read a number of books on the Founding Fathers, especially Alexander Hamilton and even though this one is older and denser than more recent attempts, it is by far the best. Forrest McDonald does a wonderful job of capturing Alexander Hamilton's character and his prose is simply enchanting."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"It was a brave decision. Historian Forrest McDonald was well into writing a biography of Alexander Hamilton when he realized that a conventional telling of Hamilton's life wasn't working. What did he do? Be sensible and fix what he had? No. He burned everything and started over again. Thank goodness he did, because he has given us the definitive Hamilton bio. If you really want to understand Alexander Hamilton, this is the book to read.To get inside Hamilton's head, McDonald not only read everything Hamilton had ever written, but all the books and treatises that influenced his thinking. Who were the writers Hamilton read? Says McDonald: \\"Besides Blackstone and Hume--to whom Hamilton's debt was obvious--there were Plutarch and Pope, Shaftesbury, and Smith, Vattel and Beawes, Postlethwayt and Necker. Then, slowly, tediously, I began to reconstruct my understanding of what Hamilton did with his life, to reconcile my view of Hamilton with Hamilton's view of Hamilton.\\"McDonald gives the clearest exposition you're like to read anywhere of Hamilton's financial policies and how they actually worked (pages 117-188). What was \\"funding and assumption\\" and how it made provision for the public debt is explained in detail, as well as the linchpin of Hamilton's financial policies, the national bank.McDonald offers a unique insight into Hamilton's character as well. Quite simply, Hamilton was an unabashed romantic. Writes McDonald: \\"Like the sentimentalist, the dreamer, and the do-gooder, the romantic is ruled by his heart rather than his head. Unlike them, he is also tough-minded and realistic, and that creates within him a turbulence they never know: he drives himself to excel, requires discipline of himself far beyond that of other men, is ever concerned with honor, sometimes obsessively.\\"After reading this book, I think you will agree with me that--given the chance--Hamilton was the one Founder who could have resolved the slavery issue. A born problem solver, he could have found a way to reimburse slave-owners for their \\"property\\" and made southern plantations highly profitable with free labor. The young nation would have thus spared the lives of 600,000 as yet unborn Americans."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"This biography focuses heavilty on Hamilton's fiscal policies, particularly in his role as Secretary of the Treasury. It is well written and relies heavily on primary sources.

Some of the philosophical and economical ideas will be hard to fathom for those of us that are not experts. The author tries to explain these doctrines without dragging down the pace of the book.It would seem he succeeds fairly well.I am using this book as a guide to Hamilton, his contemporaries and times. I don't think I'll find a more comprehensive view without major bias unless I were able to talk with the actual men. However, we all know the degree of bias that would be involved there...I am getting to know Alexander Hamilton and I am awed by his life and talents. I am also relearning history I had forgotten or learning history I was never exposed to within this book. Anyone interested in Hamilton, his times or fellow founding fathers, must read this. It isn't a fast read, but anything worth reading will never be.It will allow the reader to see that despite the faults of the founding fathers and their shaky start, we wound up with a viable, stable government that was able to attain world stature. The book helps to illustrate that we would do well to learn from their mistakes as well as their good.Hamilton would expect no less of us."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"There are times when I read this book and threw up my hands, threw the book on the floor, and cursed. Some paragaphs in the book are total insansity. Not that they are factually wrong but that they defend Hamilton no matter what he does and when he does something wrong it isn't his fault. For instance he cheats on his wife - but it is because he was niave and duped. But the book is a useful piece if you want to understand Hamilton's debt and banking programs.The problems I had with the book is the authors obssesive and depressingly consistent program of praising Hamilton and putting down everyone else. Apparently just about everything good that happened in the formative and early years of our Republic Hamilton was responsbile for and anyone who opposed any of his policies was living in fantasies or was totally selfish. When people oppose Hamilton's policies they do so for financial gain - but Hamilton always has pure motives. At least that is the way this author portrays things!The only person besides Hamilton who comes off good is George Washington and that is because he listened to Hamilton over Thomas Jefferson when it came to banking and the French Revolution. If it wasn't for Hamilton poor Old George would have been lost it seems.Hamilton may have been right on many of these issues - but the authors tendency to prop him on a pedestal makes the reader miss out and the history of the time deserves better. The founders were a diverse group of people with varied economic interests and opinions on what paths the nation should take. This gets lost here. A great exposition of these themes is John Ellis's Founding Brothers - which is a great book and I'd recommend as an introduction in the founding fathers.Many of the problems in McDonald's book are common to biographies of the founding fathers. One could make similar complaints about David McCollough's recent work on John Adams.The strength of this book is that it gives you a nice detailed understanding of Hamilton's policies and how he tried to centralize the government and create a nation through laws and debt - which he thought could be used to meld the states together. It is worth reading for this. I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to the founding fathers though. If you have a hard wood floor don't read the book while others are asleep. If you are like me you'll wake them up from the noise of the book periodically hitting the ground."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Hamilton is often cast as a villain in most treatments of America's founding. Why? Well, because the authors are often so in love with Jefferson that they cannot be fair and objective. Jefferson is always painted as the savior of the nation, but that is not entirely accurate. Hamilton contributed to the nation's structure and policy debates. He helped work to ensure the national debt was paid, in addition to creating a climate favorable for business. All these worked to place the new country on the path that would lead to greatness. Only misguided policies in the modern era would derail what Hamilton has given us.

If your only interest is the politics and financial events of his day then this is the book for you. There is little or no discussion about Hamiltons personal life, his children, his habits, his wife, his education, his thoughts, his friends, even his death and the events arounding it are but a few paragraphs.

He does try to glorify Hamilton and atempts to explain away some critizimems aginst him that stem from what is considerd conventional knowlege. For example McDonald atemps to absolve Hamilton of his atempt to prevent John Adams from winning the 1796 election by trying to swing the Federalist vote in favor of Thomas Pickering. Most historians agree that this is what happend but McDoland (lamly) tries to argue otherwise.McDonald also tries in genral to suport Hamilton's policies but what i found intresting was that from the information that McDonald provides I came to despise Hamilton's ideas and was stumped how mcDonald Could write down these same facts (such as how the people &quot;seldom judge right&quot;, and his desire to have a president elected for life) and still defend the man.This I why irecomend this book, because though McDonald has an obvious bias, he nontheless presents the facts and the reader is able to come to his/her own conclusions despite McDonlds pro-hamilton stance. Anthoer positve aspect of this book is the wonderful LACK of personal details. I don't care who hamilton slept with, I don't care how many kids he had etc. I just want to know of his role in founding the courupt society we live in, and despite McDonalds statments to contray, his &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; does just that."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"The author of this book is so enamored of Hamilton that it completely blinds him to any faults Hamilton may have had. Furthermore, anyone who showed any opposition at all to anything Hamilton proposed is deemed either delusional or a traitor. His treatment of Jefferson and Adams is amazingly disrespectful. Even Washington comes accross as a feeble leader at times without the constant support and advice of his most trusted advisor Hamilton.As the book progresses, the bias gets worse and almost preachy.Shockingly, the famous duel with Aaron Burr gets only about 3 pages worth of description.....probably since it was not exactly a high point in his life.Avoid this book if you want a well-balanced biography."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"Forrest McDonald's &quot;Alexander Hamilton&quot; should not be called a biography, but a partisan harangue, and libel on liberty. In this McDonald champions Hamilton, and ambitious,self centered,anti republican Founding Father. McDonald libels Thomas Jefferson, and attempts to degrade his views in the early American Republic by inflating the character of Hamilton. Hamilton, contrary to McDonald's belief was seriously anti-republican. In the Constitutional Convention Hamilton propsed an unlimited government based on the British monarchy. He was distrustful of common people even calling them &quot;a great beast&quot;. McDonald, like all admirers of Hamilton, attempts to gloss over Hamilton's anti-liberty and repblican ideals and instead elevate him as a defender of them. Hamilton was an avid supporteer of the wealthy's domination of government, and McDonald strongly supports this view.McDonald is not objective in the least, and overall has produced a deplorable partisan biography."},{"Title":"ALEXANDER HAMILTON: A Biography","review":"This is an almost purely partisan piece. It is clear from the beginning how McDonald feels about his hero Hamilton. For the most part, the work sickened me. Hamilton is one of the most dastardly anti-liberty figures in American history. What most angered me about the work is McDonald's unabashed libeling of Thomas Jefferson throughout the work. It is sad that such a brilliant and noteworthy scholar as McDonald must reduce himself to blatant misinterpretations and smearing in order to elevate his hero into a place that he does not deserve to be. If you are looking for an honest biography of Hamilton, I strongly suggest that you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Sherlock Holmes Collection","review":"Lots of typos, and no search capability.

Watson M.D. is looking for reasonable lodgings. So too Sherlock Holmes (described as cold-blooded in outlook). A letter requests help from Holmes. Drebber was found dead in an empty house, no wound on the body, but blood in the room. Holmes & Watson go there to inspect the scene. Holmes explained his deductions. An advertisement is placed in the \\"Found\\" column of a newspaper. Detective Gregson visited Holmes to explain how he solved the murder. Lestrade arrives to tell of another murder: Stangerson, the secretary of Drebber! Gregson's suspect could not have done it. Holmes shows his brilliance by his surprise introduction of the murderer! Part 2 tells about the events that preceded these murders. Chapter 7 explains Holmes' actions in reasoning backwards. This story introduced Sherlock Holmes to an audience that never tired of these stories. Note the dialogue followed by explanatory comments. More modern stories use mostly dialogue to carry the story along and bring out the facts. The solution occurs in the last chapters. The use of an exotic American locale was a way to add interest. Background descriptions are sparse. It tells why a man can have a \\"florid face\\", a medical fact.The Sign of Four. Miss Mary Morstan visits with her problem. Her father disappeared ten years earlier. For the last six years she received a large pearl in the mail. A letter told her she was wronged and asked for a meeting. Holmes and Watson will accompany her. Their carriage arrives at a new house. They meet Thaddeus Sholto, one of the sons of Major Sholto, the best friend of Mary Morstan's father. Thaddeus tells what he knows about the story. His brother Bartholomew discovered the hidden treasure. When they arrive they find Bartholomew murdered in a locked room and the treasure missing! The police arrest Thaddeus and the servants as accomplices. Holmes borrowed a dog, they followed the scent to the water's edge and find information. Holmes located the steam launch, the police boat chased it downstream. Holmes and Watson shoot at a small man, then a new man is captured with the treasure chest. He tells about the treasure from the India Mutiny and has the last laugh (Chapter 12). The Four chose to enrich themselves during the India mutiny. A double-dealing rajah straddled the conflict and split his assets for safety; this failed because others took advantage of their position. In turn their plan failed because of an unforeseen watcher. The Four who killed for riches were swindled out of their fortune by a clever liar who took advantage of his position.

The information in this guide was gathered in 2001/2002. Buenos Aires prices have seriously changed since then and this guide has nothing about these changes. All of the hotel and restaurant rates in this book are irrelevant. Some prices have changed up to 300%! For example, in Buenos Aires, the NH City Hotel is quoted in the guide as being $97 per night. When I went there I was quoted $270 per night. A serious difference.For all of Buenos Aires the guide lists only 14 restaurant recommendations. Imagine a guide for New York City with on 14 restaurant recommendations! Then, restaurant recommendations are poor selections in comparison to other guides. The writing about restaurants (and accommodations) vacillates between being trite and meaningless. For example, one of the 14 restaurants the guide recommends is a pizzeria (go figure) which says... \\"unchanged since the days of Carlos Gardel, whose photos line the wall.\\" That's it. From that you will make a decision?Also, the maps in this guide are very difficult to use. Unlike other guides that give you separate maps for restaurants and accommodations, this guide crams everything on one map: hotels, restaurants, sights to see, etc. You spend far too much time trying to figure where something is ... folks, there are much guides than this one. In short - avoid this guide.If you are ONLY going to Buenos Aires, then, just for B.A. then take Fodor's \`Argentina' (4th edition). Fodor's has very good maps of the city and it has great recommendations for accommodations. Caveat: only use Fodor's \`Argentina' for Buenos Aires, outside of the capitol Fodor's crashes and burns.

His unexpected kiss took her by surprise, and Brenna finds offense in such aggressive behavior. Worse, when she complains to Sheriff Dylan Chandler, he does not seem to take her concern terribly seriously. In addition, Brenna finds it virtually impossible to explain her problem while being distracted by wild and dangerous sheriff she found swinging from the firehouse ceiling and wearing gear that heightens in his attractiveness.Dylan does not initially admit that the kissing bandit Pete is his uncle and has been greeting new residents similarly for forty years. Furthermore, Dylan has had his fill previously of big-city girls who wanted to change Tranquility, and he refuses to allow yet another one to wreck havoc on himself or the town he protects. But when he finds himself trapped between a battle of the sexes over the city's main thoroughfare, Dylan will have more than his extreme attraction to Brenna to cope with.From their first encounter, Dylan and Brenna dazzle readers with their chemistry in A LAWMAN IN HER STOCKING. Brenna and Dylan's story provides charming reading for the holiday season, strongly backed up with a marvelous secondary cast as Brenna's Grandma and Dylan's Uncle Pete add amusement and surprises of their own in this Christmas treat. Tuesday night poker, Christmas decorations, and a love for chocolate smoothly combine in a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"A Lawman In Her Stocking","review":"The humor in this book most definitely keeps this story moving.

Dabei bedient er sich theoretischer Fundamente und Forschungsergebnisse, die ebenso aus naturwissenschaftlichen wie aus sozial- und geisteswissenschaftlichen Disziplinen stammen. Der Grad von Interdisziplinarit&auml;t ist dabei so hoch, wie es wohl nur bei US-amerikanischen Wissenschaftlern der Fall sein kann.KEVIN KELLY\`s Buch befa&szlig;t sich mit dem Zusammenwachsen und den Widerspr&uuml;chen von organischen Systemen einerseits (the Born) und den synthetischen Systemen (the Made) andererseits. Dabei formuliert KELLY zwei wichtige Trends: Die von Menschen erdachten Maschinen werden immer lebewesenhafter und gleichzeitig wird das Lebende immer mehr technisiert. Anhand zahlreicher Beispiele wird die Verm&auml;hlung des Gemachten mit dem Geborenen belegt.So berichtet KELLY in seinem Werk von der Zusammensetzung differenzierter &Ouml;kosysteme, von sozialen Insektenst&auml;mmen (Ameisen und Bienen), Korallen-Riff Repliken, und von komplexen, geschlossenen Systemen wie dem &quot;Biosphere 2&quot; Projekt in Arizona und vielen weiteren Ph&auml;nomenen aus der Biologie.Auf der anderen Seite werden weltweite Telefonetze, Computervirus Infektionen, Roboter-Prototypen, Virtuel Reality-Welten, synthetisch animierte Charaktere sowie Computersimulationen von der Welt als Ganzes von KELLY thematisiert.Die Gemeinsamkeiten von Organismen und &Ouml;kosystemen einerseits und ihren &Auml;quivalenten auf der technischen Seite wie Robotern, Unternehmen und Wirtschaftsordnungen andererseits, f&uuml;hren Kelly zu der Einf&uuml;hrung des Begriffes &quot;Vivisystem&quot;, mit dem er gleichzeitig beide Arten von komplexen Systemen belegt.Von den Grenzen der Computer Science und den R&auml;ndern der biologischen Wissenschaften kommend, verbindet KELLY seine Erkenntnisse zu insgesamt &quot;Nine Laws of God&quot;. Diese neun Organisationsregeln sind die allgemeing&uuml;ltige Generalisierung seiner Beobachtungen auf dem Feld der Komplexit&auml;tswissenschaft, wie Kelly selbst den Gegenstand seiner Forschung umschreibt.Die wissenschaftliche Reflexion des Widerspruches zwischen Lebewesen und Maschinen ist nicht neu, wohl aber der Ansatz von Kelly: &quot;For the world of our own making has become so complicated, that we must turn to the world of the born to understand how to manage it&quot;.Out of Control ist so etwas wie die wissenschaftliche Manifestation Schule der &quot;New Economy&quot; geworden. Ein Kondensat der wirtschaftswissenschaftlich relevanten Konzepte aus &quot;Out of Control&quot; wurde unter der &Uuml;berschrift &quot;The New Rules for the new Economy&quot; im September 1997 im amerikanischen WIRED Magazin ver&ouml;ffentlicht. Ein von Arthur Anderson gesponsorter Reprint ist auf der Wired Homepage zu beziehen.Das Buch ist 1994 in der amerikanischen Orginalausgabe beim Addison Wesley Verlag erschienen.

It describes distributed computing systems and concommitant communication problems in a new light, vastly expanding the scope of otherwise mundane academic articles on the topic. Kelly defines the rules of complex system behavior that simultaneously apply to traditional distributed computing, to markets, to a flock of birds or a bee hive. This book is tedious but worth a read."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Kelly goes on a wide-ranging journey through evolutionary theory, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and market economics; he admits that, if &quot;cybernetics&quot; was still in vogue, his book would be an update on thinking in that field. He believes, with considerable evidence backing him up, that our technological future will not be a Metropolis-like scenario of industrial gray steel; Technos and Bios are converging to create a neo-biological civilization made up of both humans and &quot;living&quot; machines. This digital culture will be characterized by the swarm, with many minds directing one superorganism. These trends, Kelly believes, mean the end of centralized control; our social and economic future will be decentralized and distributed, essentially &quot;out of control.&quot;"},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This book must have been as much fun for Kevin Kelly to write as it is to read. It's a little long but very easy to understand. It'll make you think and you are sure to enjoy thinking about the ideas and examples in here.A more correct title might be &quot;Out of Centralized Control.&quot; Kelly's point is that Nature is not a command and control monolith, but instead, a network of relatives, friends, neighbors, and sometimes predators. Nature does not control the Universe so much as it encourages cooperation within the Universe. The examples Kelly gives in the first few pages set the tone of the rest of the book. One is the flock of geese, which somehow knows its migration path from hemisphere to hemisphere even though none of the geese in the flock have ever flown it before.As Kelly shows us, there are plenty of surprises in Nature. Uncertainty is built in. That's life ! Some readers might find it hard to believe that Nature is not particularly concerned about efficiency. It doesn't mind duplication, redundancy, and a little waste. It fact, it wants these things because they lead us to flexibility. Kelly's point in all this seems to be that Nature does not play by the numbers.It might be even harder for some readers to believe, at first, that Nature creates new things out of nothing every day. But, Kelly will win you over on that point and many more. His &quot;Nine Laws of God&quot; which sum up the book in the last chapter made me want to read it a second time.One nice companion to this book would be &quot;Morphic Resonance and the The Presence of the Past: The Habits of Nature&quot; by Ruppert Sheldrake. That book presents a theory that is considered radical by many, yet the critics usually concede that it's well reasoned and fills many of the gaps in our knowledge of Nature.If you'd like to think about the theological implications of Kelly's ideas, try a few books about process theology, particularly these: &quot;A Basic Introduction to Process Theology&quot; by Robert Mesle, &quot;What is Process Theology?&quot; by Robert Mellert, and &quot;Ominipotence and Other Theological Mistakes&quot; by Charles Hartshorne."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"A well though out, easy to understand overview of complexity theory. Kelly highlights several of the top researchers in the field (at the time) and gives countless real examples from the \\"natural\\" and \\"artificial\\" worlds. From prairie fields to robotics, Biosphere 2 to genetic algorithms; the ideas in \\"Out of Control\\" will make you think.The main idea: \\"natural\\" and \\"artificial\\" obey the same rules. As \\"artificial\\" systems become more complex, they behave more like \\"natural\\" systems. Decentralized, redundant and inefficient. We will lose control of our own creations. Don't be afraid, it's just the next step forward.Don't forget this book was published in 1995. Ten years is an eternity when you are talking about a relatively new scientific discipline. Some of what Kelly highlights in the book has come to pass and some has passed away. Despite being a decade old this book is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This book was published in 1994!

A great introduction to a world of ideas and concepts about evolution and technologies that are already shaping our (near) future. Horizon-expanding ideas--indeed, the chapter on Borges Library literally had my brain &quot;buzzing&quot; with activity and a restless night of wild dreams on the subject. As the author states himself, he does not write or develop anything new, rather, he creates exposure to the fascinating work of others. Though it is not difficult or dry, the entire book is concepts--not for someone looking for a light novel."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Kelly's book is certainly thought-provoking and entertaining but in the end I couldn't escape the nagging sense that I was reading a corporate brochure commissioned by Wintel. Sure, the idea that a higher intelligence can emerge from a network of lower organisms, as a hive emerges out of a swarm of bees, can be a liberating one; as if maybe millions of bored drones keystroking in their cubicles, contrary to what common sense and Dilbert will tell you, are collectively making something brilliant.What Kelly and other copywriters of the digital era (like Negroponte) forget is that good science writing has to have at least a healthy smidgen of skepticism, and here that might include looking at some of the bugs inherent in the system: such as what it's like to stare at a computer all day, or work in a chip factory in southeast asia, or how technology has put a lot of people out of work. Kelly forgets that hive-like societies, whether formed of bees or Microsoft employees, tend to de-value the individual at the expense of conformity. I have yet to see a human hive, networked by whatever brand of computer, that could create something like a work of art that could move me, not that such things matter anymore. I'll take Beethoven anyday."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"I agree with the \\"Chicago reader\\" who said this book could've used an editor, but it's one of the best poorly-written books I've read too.Kelly's cheerleading for the decentralized, \\"hive-mind\\" mentality smacks of the giddy 1940's Tomorrowland propaganda -- oblivious to market realities, people's resistance to change and the fact that simple technologies always win head-to-head competitions with more complex technologies. Yet he makes a valiant attempt to pull a Douglas Hofstadter, and write a \\"Godel Escher Bach\\" of future technologies. None of his examples or conclusions are original, but that doesn't diminish the cumulative power of his argument."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This is the best sciency book out of the two dozen or so I've read this year.

Now own 6th copy cos' ones I lend out seldom come back....speaks volumes"},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"I must admit that I'm a little ticked at spending a considerable amount of time reading a 500 page book with too many ideas and lack of focus. The editing left a lot to be desired. Throughout the book, the author asserts that if dumb, simple things (e.g. a swarm of bees) continuously communicate with each other they will eventually become capable of performing highly complex tasks not feasible by the will of intelligent beings. Yet, this point is expressed in such a complex manner that it makes one wonder why the author didn't follow his philosophy by dumbing down his arguments and letting the plentiful explain the more difficult concepts.The main premise of the book is the idea of intelligent beings, in this case humans, giving up control of their creations, which are machines, and letting them \\"adapt on their own, evolve in their own direction, and grow without human oversight.\\"There are some intriguing ideas such as: No sustaining ecosystem is in equilibrium or completely \\"in control\\". Some chaotic or \\"out of control\\" events are required for complex systems to function. For example, the earth's atmosphere is made up of 20% oxygen. This oxygen content is just enough to maintain viable ecosystems without burning up the earth from fires.\\"Out of Control\\" was written in 1994, and 14 years later global warming is a hot button. What happened to the Kelly's grand ideas of recycling (see example of Danish companies recycling each others' waste somewhere in the book)? How much closer are we to eco-friendly intelligent homes and personal belongings? Instead of moving to cheap renewable energy sources, we are experiencing the use of fossil fuels like never before with the fast growing economies of China and India. Crucial counteracting forces seemed to have been completely ignored by the author in projecting a sea of changes in how humans behave. Solar energy will never succeed as a viable energy source unless Big Oil has a monopoly over the sun. Digital cash has been a failure because its success would've destroyed the profits of Visa/Mastercard.The author is a proponent of the idea of passing down learned behavior innately to offsprings, i.e. through genes. For example, experiments cited from one scientist proved evolution with learned behavior passed down to offsprings is superior to natural evolution. In this instance the author ignored the prospect of passing down negative and undesirable learned behavior that is criminal in nature for example. It's best that all offsprings are created much like computers, and most behavior is learned much like software. It is precisely individuality that facilitates variability, the hallmark of evolution. The author himself even argues for systems thriving at the edge of chaos; systems flexible enough to adapt to the changing environment, yet not rigid enough to become unadaptable. Passing down learned behavior to offsprings would undoubtedly create a more rigid system. Besides, most people already harbor the ill effects of bad parenting. The last thing they need is to acquire this cr*p at conception.At the end of the book, Mr. Kelly mentions \\"The Nine Laws of God\\". One law in particular stood out: \\"Grow by chunking\\" which states \\"The only way to make a complex system that works is to begin with a simple system that works. Attempts to instantly install highly complex organization-such as intelligence or a market economy-without growing it, inevitably lead to failure..... Time is needed to let each part test itself against all the others....\\" The failure to observe this law has been aptly demonstrated in the U.S. effort to build democracy in Iraq, and to a lesser degree the pressure exerted on Russia by the west to quickly move to a market economy following the collapse of communism.In spite of all the criticism, I'm glad I read this book. The ideas could have been expressed in 200 pages fewer and more coherently. Pick up a copy and fasten your seat belt.

It's wrong like infectious medicine was wrong before Pasteur. It's wrong like phrenology is wrong. Every major tenet of it is wrong,' said the outspoken biologist Lynn Margulis about her latest target: the dogma of Darwinian evolution.&quot;Kelly then goes on to point out that a number of microbiologists, geneticists, theoretical biologists, mathematicians, and computer scientists are saying there is more to life than Darwinism. &quot;They do not reject Darwin's contribution; They simply want to move beyond it. I call them 'postdarwinians'.&quot;With this the author provides a very good upgrade of many of the criticisms that have always accompanied Darwinism, along with a series of tie-ins with contemporary complexity theory, including the work of Kauffman, the new work on artificial evolution, and a very interesting musing-meditation on 'rising flow' in the context of the perennial thermodynamic enigmas latent in all evolutionary thinking.The bibliography at the end is also invaluable for the literature here, including little know works, which as the author points out, is being resurrected by students in field, looking to move on to the era of postdarwinism."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Don't let the fact that it took me 10 months to finish this book impact your decision to read it; Out of Control was a well-worthy, remarkable effort, which should be given a careful and thorough read.So, why 10 months? Kevin Kelly is very wordy. Yes, Kelly provides fascinating insights and revelations about machine biology, \\"hive mind\\" theory, co-evolution, the evolution of computers, and the future of planet Earth. But he does all of this with about 200 pages more than are actually necessary to make his point. Kelly is a great writer, no doubt, but he tends to wander aimlessly, which makes these difficult topics challenging to understand. A good editor would have helped immensely.Out of control also suffers from a lack of cohesion, and would be better served as a collection of separate essays about each topic, rather than a book that strives to espouse one overarching theme. As I was reading, I kept wondering where Kelly was going with all of his ideas, as a lack of drive seemed evident.Lest you think I have nothing but ill contempt for this book, there is a payoff: Kelly is a brilliant soothsayer, of sorts. This book was written 16 years ago, so hindsight can readily be applied, and Kelly's predictions about where science would be with relation to computers, nanotechnology, pharmaceuticals, this crazy thing called the \\"Internet\\" he kept mentioning, have nearly all come to fruition.

We are already evolving software and drugs instead of engineering them.Organic life is the ultimate technology, and all technology will improve towards biology.The main thing computers are good for is creating little worlds so that we can try out the Great Questions. Online communities let us ask the question \\"what is a democracy; what do you need for it?\\" by trying to wire a democracy up, and re-wire it if it doesn't work. Virtual reality lets us ask \\"what is reality?\\" by trying to synthesize it. And computers give us room to ask \\"what is life?\\" by providing a universe in which to create computer viruses and artificial creatures of increasing complexity. Philosophers sitting in academies used to ask the Great Questions; now they are asked by experimentalists creating worlds.As we shape technology, it shapes us. We are connecting everything to everything, and so our entire culture is migrating to a \\"network culture\\" and a new network economics.In order to harvest the power of organic machines, we have to instill in them guidelines and self-governance, and relinquish some of our total control.\\"This is the kind of book I find extremely difficult to know how to read. I just do not have the proper scientific- technical background to evaluate the kinds of claims which are being made here. And this when I am naturally skeptical about books which claim to have a sure general understanding of the shape of the human future.My skepticism also relates to the meaning of this kind of 'evolution' for the lives of individual human beings, and for society as a whole. Is the suggestion that we are on the verge of some vast transcending or de- humanizing of humanity, some creation of an 'organic collective mechanical consciousness' which will somehow 'direct' or guides society as a whole.?If so , once again, what does this say about our own individual freedom and identity?"},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This is the best badly written book I have read lately. Kelly's book provides an enthusiastic reflection on the evolution of complex systems, full of vivid images and provocative metaphors, yet one can't avoid the impression he wrote it down as he thought of it. Kelly is a magazine editor (Wired) and his book comes across like a 475-page magazine article -- whenever he decides to change directions mid-chapter, he simply inserts a rosette and moves on. This book and its readers would have been well served by passing the text through the hands of a demanding book editor -- the result would have been a text about 150 pages shorter and much clearer. It also would have been helpful to have had the text proofread -- I nearly tore up the book reading over and over his confused expression &quot;hone in on&quot;, an illiterate cross between &quot;hone&quot; and &quot;home in on.&quot; I don't know Kelly's educational background. Reading his book I get the impression that his formal credentials are minimal but that he's very good at finding smart people and following them around. The result is a book that chronicles the development of this field while communicating his fascination with complex concepts he just barely understands, and his dilletante's infatuation with the jargon that describes it. The ideas in this book, and particularly the juxtapositions of ideas that Kelly assembles, are well worth reading about. But a better approach might be to skim the book, noting authors and titles, and then go straight to the source material listed at length in the back."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Why are the three most powerful forces in our world--evolution, democracy and capitalism--so controversial? Hundreds (in the case of democracy, thousands) of years after they were first understood, we still can't quite believe these three phenomena work. Socialist Europe resists capitalism, the religious right in America questions evolution and the Middle East makes a mockery of democracy. When you think about it, it's easy to understand why: all three are radically counterintuitive. \\"One person, one vote?\\" What if they vote wrong?But that's the problem--we're thinking about it. Our brains aren't wired to understand the wisdom of the crowd. Evolution, democracy and capitalism don't work at the anecdotal level of personal experience, the level at which our story-driven synapses are built to engage. Instead, they're statistical, operating in the realm of collective probability. They're not right--they're \\"righter\\". They're not predictable and controllable--they're inherently out of control. That's scary and unsettling, but also hugely important to understand in a world of increasing complexity and diminishing institutional power (mainstream media: meet blogs; military: meet insurgency).Fortunately, this book that makes sense of all of this. Out of Control was first published in 1994, well before its time, but it's one of those rare books that sells better each year it gets older. That's because Kelly recognized that the messy markets of natural selection, enlightened self-interest and invisible hands all anticipated the Internet and the delights of watching peer-to-peer cacophony create the greatest oracle the world has ever seen. Some of the examples may be a bit dated a dozen years later, but the message has only become more true: \\"There is no central keeper of knowledge in a network, only curators of particular views,\\" he writes. The emergent mob wisdom of the blogosphere and Wikipedia were unimaginable then, but somehow Kelly imagined them all the same. This may be the smartest book of the past decade."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Kevin has produced what I regard as one of the top five books of this decade.

Expendable scouts explore potential hive sites concurrently, dancing to communicate their suitability, until, abruptly, the entire swarm flocks into its new home. The locus of decision is a &quot;hive mind,&quot; a dispersed, shifting collection of instincts and tiny decisions that somehow transcends the actions of any individual, even the hive queen. Ant colonies be have similarly - and so do foreign currency fluctuations, the folding proteins that regulate the internal processes of life, and the predator prey struggles that shape global ecosystems.The hive mind is a powerful new metaphor. It's not that scientists failed to notice bee hives and ant colonies before. The difference is that novel scientific tools - chaos&quot; theory, for example, and massively parallel computers - have allowed researchers to study and perhaps harness the unpredictable worlds of highly complex, sell-organizing systems such as the hive mind.In &quot;Out of Control,&quot; Kevin Kelly examines the impact of the hive- mind model as it spreads into the scientific and technological communities. Scientists, he says, are beginning to explore more &quot;holistic&quot; problems, in which entire environments are their laboratory, with huge numbers of interacting factors. Steve Packard, fur example, hoped to re-create a prairie ecology in suburban Chicago, an experiment that succeeded over nearly a decade of false starts. He discovered that the order in which he introduced complementary species - grasses and the insects that disperse their seeds - or the timing of a clearing fire in the aftermath of a drought could radically alter the final shape of his reconstituted prairies. Although this and similar experiments, such as Biosphere 2, are competently explored by Kelly, they have already been described elsewhere numerous times). It is in the realm of technology that Kelly, executive editor of Wired magazine, has something to add. In dozens of interviews with academics and corporate researchers, tinkerer- artists in industrial lofts and even beekeepers, Kelly has uncovered a growing subculture that is systematically exploiting the complex forces of the hive mind, evolution and other self-organizing 8ystems. According to Kelly, their robots and smart computer programs will grow and evolve into useful forms, rendering obsolete all &quot;dumb&quot; manufactured goods, such as today's refrigerators, which cannot adapt themselves to ever-changing human demands. Take the smart office.&quot; an artificial superorganism&quot; envisioned by researchers in the Xerox lab in California. By embedding computer chips in every office system, from books that remember where you left off to lamps and chairs that anticipate your approach, they hope to create a sensory net that would adjust itself t~ your needs and habits. It could, Kelly reports, function as the opposite of virtual reality: Instead of bringing a viewer into a computer-generated world, the intelligence of the computer would extend into the room itself. But the user would have to surrender some control to a machine mind. If you entered the office of a hearing-impaired person, for example, the higher volume might puncture your eardrum before the room would &quot;adapt&quot; to you.These practical innovations are interesting and might revolutionize our lives. But beyond these relatively simple applications, Kelly's predictions begin to go badly overboard. These machines, he claims, would blur the distinction between man-made and living beings and give rise to a &quot;neo-biological&quot; civilization; as they take over their own reproduction and maintenance, he speculates, they will slip from our control. The task of the 21st century, he writes, is to relinquish this control &quot;with dignity.&quot; This is a frightening scenario, but the reasoning behind it appears lame to me. Despite its lofty goals, artificial intelligence has continually hit dead ends. The snag is that complex calculations take longer -the smarter you make computers, the slower they become. It is simply a copout to say that genetic algorithms or massively parallel computers will somehow allow a fundamental new forms of self-organizing intelligence to &quot;emerge&quot; in some unforeseen and unimaginable way. I do not believe, for example that the realistic computer animation in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; will eventually lead to the &quot;emergence&quot; of living cartoon characters, like &quot;real&quot; Roget Rabbits as Kelly insists. Nor do I believe, as Kelly posits, that the new wired society will inevitably become more democratic; darker scenarios are equally also possible. Unfortunately, in his highly combustible enthusiasm, Kelly spews countless similar Panglossian predictions that are rather silly.In the end, &quot;Out of Control&quot; is a mixed bag. At its best, it is a gallery of intellectual and technological pioneers striving to infuse the hive mind into our machines. They just might succeed. But at its worst, it reads like a random tour of the Internet, where solid information is punctuated by the musings of isolated nerds.REcommended only with extreme caution."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Love this book. A great introduction to a world of ideas and concepts about evolution and technologies that are already shaping our (near) future. Horizon-expanding ideas--indeed, the chapter on Borges Library literally had my brain &quot;buzzing&quot; with activity and a restless night of wild dreams on the subject. As the author states himself, he does not write or develop anything new, rather, he creates exposure to the fascinating work of others. Though it is not difficult or dry, the entire book is concepts--not for someone looking for a light novel."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This book was groundbreaking in 1994; its insights have been improved upon by more recent writing on the same subjects. If you are interested in this topic, I recommend considering Steven Johnson's EMERGENCE before you buy this book; Johnson discussions some of Kelly's ideas, but offers are more up-to-date analysis of the phenomenon of non-hierarchical/centralized models of organization. Otherwise, this book is valuable for its historical positioning--how things seemed and were seen almost a decade ago."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Good points: very readable and thought provoking. Bad points: terrible use of sources and a shallow examination of the book's premises and implications.Kelley interviewed and quoted scientists on fuzzy subjects outside their expertise, and then quoted marketing and PR folks about the scientists' work. It's as if he interviewed people until someone said what he wanted to hear, and then he used that quote regardless of the speaker's credentials.Kelley suggests that we'd really like homes filled with &quot;biological&quot; appliances, but never explores the practical implications of having to house train a &quot;biological&quot; washing machine or teach your toaster what &quot;done&quot; means. Perhaps he has never dealt with pets or children. Kelley also loses sight of the difference between the real world and cyberspace: this may be a fashionable literary trick but it's not especially practical when one is cold or hungry. I did my disseration work in robotics and I found his expectations of biological machines to be shallow and downright silly"},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This book is a fascinating roller-coaster ride through a host of emerging technologies which will no doubt have an influence on all our futures. Kevin Kelly demonstrates quite convincingly how the technological is becoming more biological. Artificial intelligence, robotics and our knowledge of ants and bees has produced insect-like robots capable of smart collective behaviour. Genetics, evolutionary theory and massively parallel connectionist machines (the fastest computers on the planet) are yielding emerging fields like evolutionary software design where the computer code is &quot;bred&quot; rather than being written. Open, closed, complex, self-organising, centrally controlled and distributed systems are all examined and contrasted, including everything from Borgian libraries to zero-sum games. Kelly tells us of his personal experience in Biosphere II, and contrasts the paradigmatic differences between the made and the born. What is made by us tends to be minimal, mechanical, predictable and maintenance intensive (even in our &quot;autonomous&quot; systems). By contrast, when we consider the different magnitudes of information in a blueprint compared with a DNA strand, we see that the born is vastly more complex, organic, unpredictable and constantly adapting to environmental changes.The book on the whole is accessible and a real technological page turner. It will be of particular interest to anyone with some background in computing, artificial intelligence, biology, information theory or cognitive science."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"The ideas in this book may be thought by some to be radical or far-fetched, but to those readers familiar with the behavior of complex dynamical systems, they seem quite natural. The book emphasizes the theoretical aspects of complex systems, but some natural examples of them are discussed. The author, in spite of his choice of title for the book, is not threatened by the consequences of artifically creating these systems. After all, we live and have evolved in a universe that is even more complex than the author describes. The fact that we humans can now speed up the process of creation of these systems should be a source of wonder instead of fear.What makes this book valuable reading is that the author emphasizes the collective behavior of dynamical systems. Too often the reductionist trend in Western science obscures how the system works together, how its many parts collectively induce an emergent behavior not at all apparent in the systems &quot;equations of motion&quot;.Since the book is written for a popular audience, the approach is qualitative and allegorical. This purely descriptive approach does however allow a more general overview of complex dynamical systems im many different areas. The author gives a fascinating discussion of swarm systems and their advantages and disadvantages. One of the disadvantages according to the author is that they are &quot;nonunderstandable&quot;; but here he is mistaken, for complex systems can be understood, although such an understanding takes some effort anc computational horsepower. Also, in his discussion of network behavior the author asserts that it is &quot;counterintuitive&quot; and quotes &quot;Braess's paradox&quot; as proof of this. Dietrich Braess discovered that adding routes to an already congested network will slow it down. There are examples of this, but it is not a hard-and-fast rule, as network engineers who employ load balancing can attest to. Adding time-dependent paths can work to reduce congestion, this time-dependence not addressed in Braess's formulation of the paradox.Some more interesting discussions in the book are allegorical, but they serve to encourage &quot;thinking out of the box&quot;:1. The effects of isolation and boredom on the human mind: the need for the physical body to temper unruly constructions of the mind. 2. The chameleon riddle: what color will a chameleon take on if put in front of a mirror? 3.The Prisoner's dilemna. This has got to be the most widely used tool for encouraging cooperation, in spite of its simplicity and impracticality. Computer simulation of the Prisoner's dilemna with 1000 players has revealed phenomena familiar in evolutionary studies, such as parasitism, spontaneously emerging symbiosis, and long-term stable coexistence between species. 4. Physical systems as computational processes; this is the most radical of the ideas in the book, but the author does not expound upon it in any great detail though. 5. The Biosphere experiment; I only read brief news reports of this while it was going on, so it was interesting to read here a detailed account of it. 6. The need for industry to adopt &quot;biological&quot; methodologies: complexity is more efficient, less wasteful, and more robust. 7. Network economics: The &quot;network company&quot; of the 21st century will be distributed (no single location), decentralized, collaborative (outsourcing to competitors!), and adaptive. This chapter is the most practical of all those in the book. 8. The role of encryption in a digital economy, particularly &quot;encryption-metering&quot; and digital cash. 9. The importance of simulation in defense and industry in the 21st century: simulate before you build, simulate before you buy, and simulate before you fight. 10. The evolution machine and its resultant creation of sex; the consequent discussion of genetic/evolutionary programming. The differences between 'Lamarckian' and 'Darwinian&quot; evolutionary programs. 11. Postdarwinism: why have no new species been detected naturally or even in computer simulations? The central thesis of Neodarwinism is that only the environment can select mutations, but not induce or direct them.Since this book was published in 1994, there have been many advances in the areas that the author discusses. Evolutionary programming has taken off, with many applications in finance, biology, network engineering, and large-scale circuit design. Swarm robots are currently under development, with deployment just years away. Computational/intelligent agents are now managing networks, with autonomous agents just around the corner.Encryption and smart-card technologies have mushroomed along with intelligent computer virus detection. Simulation is now thought of as a &quot;must-do&quot; in every phase of business and industry, and simulations are now thought of as sophisticated enough to model real-world situations without any experimental &quot;validation&quot;. Indeed, technological advancement and its application is moving forward at a dizzying rate, and seemingly...out of control?"},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This is a fascinating, well-written account of the popular notion that physics is dead and that the model for the future is biology. The problem with this is vagueness: there are no known mathematical laws of 'biology'. Even in genetics, then only mathematical laws arise from the physics of the genes. The idea of short-circuiting physics is charming but dead wrong. As Wigner pointed out, the discovery of laws of (time-evolution of) nature is impossible without underlying invariance principles, and there are no known laws of invariance for socio-economic behavior. Enjoy the book-it's the best and clearest 'cheerrleading' account savailable of the Santa Fe Institute philosophy, but take it with two or three grains of salt (and don't neglect to sign up for physics while you're at it).

From biological evolution to artificial intelligence to economies, it examines how and why complex, unpredictable systems form, and how they can be managed and created.This book was written in 1994, but it very rarely feels dated. The problems and concepts that technology was dealing with have become, if anything, more embedded and more interesting now. This book is a wonderful guide to anyone trying to navigate today's networked world."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This is an exceptional collection of scientific ideas and discoveries. This book was a fascinating read for me. I am not a scholar by any means and I admit that some of the information was above me, yet I can say that the information was presented in such a manner that intellectuals, as well as non intellectuals, would get kick out the plethora of information, as well as the various twist and turns the book takes.It would be nice to have more of this sort of writing available. Kevin Kelly certainly has his own style. I happen to like his unique style of writing and layout. This book takes you on short little scientific journeys. You never quite know where you are going to end up next and I happen to like that.This book will be enjoyed by readers who are into what is happening in the scientific community, and readers who like ideas about the future of scientific discovery. But, you could say, why not just pick up any of the latest scientific magazines or journals? Well, the information contained in \\"Out Of Control\\" follows a specific path. Even though we have scientific snippets, like in magazines, there is an overall theme, a pattern--the direction, our author believes, science will lead us. You also get a vast look at the variety that is science, technology, information and speculation. Why would you ever need to read science fiction with books like this in print regarding the astounding real world?I would like to recommend this book to people who like science fiction. For me, non fiction is where it's at folks! You just have to be able to get your hands on books like this to know that fiction, ain't got nothin, on non fiction."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"The first few chapters of this book supplied me with the momentum to keep going. Things are not organized well enough to hold a reader's interest once the initial ideas are shot off early on. It's as though the book is a collection of very interesting tid-bits and cool notes that Kelly had lying around as the executive editor of Wired magazine, and finally someone compiled them into book form. The reader gets bored with reading at about the same place the editor must have gotten bored with editing. Anyway, it's about artificial life, emergence, and co-evolution, all of which really are amazing things. A good book for its content if not its presentation."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This is a superb book of systems thinking, systems processes and systems understanding - of complexity. It is not a book, as I see it, of the different topics in the index - it is a book of the inherent, universal order shared by each and everyone of those topics. Personally suggested to me by Dee Hock, CEO Emeritus of VISA, I warmly recommend it to you..."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"This book is filled with ideas, few original, but in keeping with the central premiss of the book (that more is different) it provides an exciting glimpse into a world of the future which will not be engineered, but will evolve. There are particularly worthy ideas on the enabling technology of the web, but the book spans everything from Dante to Eco to Darwin with scarcely a jolt. Excellent reading if you are seeking inspiration."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"The relaxed style of this book makes it very enjoyable light reading. And yet the author covers a wide range of issues in a captivating way that shows his enthusiasm for and experience within the ALife and related fields. For anyone new to the field, I'd recommend this as essential introductory material. I've been involved for (just) a couple of years now but am sure that I'd have benefited from reading this at the beginning. It's cheap - buy a copy and put it by a comfy chair."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"The London Spectator's surprisingly enthusiastic recommendation made me buy it. The book is a great layman's guide to a coming revolution in scientific and engineering thought. Written in a common-sense form, it won't bog you down with formulas and proofs (it's for the layman, afterall), but is EXCELLENT in demonstrating that much of our current knowledge points to some revolutionary conclusions. The underlying theme? Nature had it right all along! If you are interested in visionary (yet simple!) ideas about how man will produce complex systems in the future, buy it! Highly, highly recommended"},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"A fun romp through the fringe-world of contemporary science/intellectual fads.Kelly serves up a rich cocktail of darwinism, ecology, and decentralism --- how local decisions, based on local data (decisions made by particles, molecules, cellular automata, rabbits and lynxes, consumers and producers, or internet routers) add up to a global system that is (maybe) optimal, or at least mostly works and is at least resiliant in the face of change."},{"Title":"Out of Control: The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization","review":"Hardly I found analysis of the contemporary world and of our near future so clear, slim (520 pg. :-)) and informative.I had shivers reading this book and I keep going back to it for reassurances and inspiration.If there was something to read in 1996, it was this book: it'll make your mind a hive-mind!"},{"Title":"FAR BELOW AND OTHER HORRORS","review":"Most of the stories in this volume originally appeared in Weird Tales. The editor, at the time, thought that Far Below was the best story to ever appear in WT--where that came from, I don't know; I would rate Far Below as the worst story in this volume. Overall, I was relatively pleased with the stories contained herein--but I don't think I would pay the $15.31 that Amazon is currently asking. If you can find it for $5-7, go for it."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Progressive Knitting","review":"If you would like to knit & design your own garments, this is the perfect book. Ms. Duncan includes \\"formulas\\" for shaping every conceivable neckline, sleeve, or garment possible. I believe this is the very first place that knitting a raglan from the top down was \\"documented\\". Patterns are included which illustrate the formulas. Naturally, those garments are vintage. I bought my first copy during the \\"counter culture\\" of the 1970s. I'm now on copy 3. My knitting library runs to well over 100 books (& several pc programs) but I still turn to this book to figure out how to set in a sleeve or the formula for a high round neck. You will not find knitting in the round or drop shoulder sweaters here but this is a minor omission."},{"Title":"Visitor Volume 1","review":"Korean high schooler Hyo-Bin Na is a very beautiful young lady and being new to the school, she garners a lot of attention. All of the most popular guys are hanging around her like flies. Hyo-Bin doesn't want any friends though, and she especially doesn't want a boyfriend. You see, she feels as if she is cursed because bad things happen to people who get close to her. And then there's the nightmares. Every night in her dreams she is in a room doused with blood and dead bodies, and there is a voice that speaks to her, wanting to be let in and appears as a dark visage in a mirror. Hyo-Bin isn't alone in the nightmare. She finds out that the room she dreams of is actually the room of one of her classmates, Mi-Soo Kim, and that the two are having the same nightmare, and can see and communicate with each other in their sleep! It's up to the two girls to figure out why these events are happening to them. Meanwhile, Hyo-Bin is beginning to exhibit dark powers that might make her fears about hurting people become a reality.I have to say that this is an extremely well-written horror mystery with shades of shojo romance. The relationship angles never really get too sappy or burden the storyline. Yee-Jung No does a good job of blending the humor and the horror into a disturbing concoction. It really makes me want to go out and get Volume 2 today because of the suspense. The only thing that put me off a little was the artist's style of drawing in which the characters are over-enlongated, making them sometimes look like giraffes with big heads. But once you get over this stylistic complaint, this book is really good."},{"Title":"Visitor Volume 1","review":"I believe vistor is a five book series(or only five books are out right now). The art is not that good, and the storyline goes from dragging, to way to fast. Each one of the books seems to create a new mystery without really giving you a satisfying awnser for the prevouis book.A Beatiful highschool girl just moves into town. She gets a vision of a guy and her on a motorcycle. They crash and he dies. The next day at school she meets him, and he falls head over heels for her. She doesn't want to make any friends, or get close to anyone because she doesn't want to hurt anyone. She has some magical power to be able to hurt anyone who crosses her.she then has another dream where she is trapped in a room filled full of dead bodies, then see's a girl from her class alive in the room. The girl yells at her and tells her to get out of her room. Shortly after this dream they become friends and try to figure out why everynight they get trapped in her room filled full of dead bodies. nothing harmful really happens untill a visitor shows up to the room trying to get into their nightmare.Their friend ship is tested along with their sanity when they keep find dark secrets out about each other and themself.-It's not a bad series but it's not something to be eager to buy unless you like horror, and mysteries-"},{"Title":"April Lady [AUDIOBOOK]","review":"Contrary to another reviewer, I absolutely enjoyed this book (then again, it is a Heyer novel). Because of its light-hearted romantic approach in the midst of \\"the devil's own scrape,\\" this is one of my first recommendations to readers who I am introducing to Heyer.Poor Cardross is in love with his wife, but doesn't know how to show it so very well. To make things worse, it's just not the thing to sit in your wife's pocket, and the servants always seem to walk in whenever he wants to display affection.Nellie, always aware of the fact the she had to marry Cardross/his money since her family didn't have a feather to fly with, finds herself equally attached to her husband, but wondering how she can show him that it's not his money she loves (her pockets-to-let spending isn't very convincing). Due to well-meaning but careless comments from his younger sister, Nellie is aware of his past \\"liaisons\\", and figures that his current reserve may very well be due to the same.The difference in the ages ( 30's vs. 19) accounts for much of the misunderstanding. He's a Man of the Town and she's still a bit of a green girl. She is not the cleverest of heroine's but very likable. He is not the completely rakish fellow one loves to laugh at, but the reader feels that he is indeed the strong and wise hero able to smooth over all the heroine's mistakes.Her unwise choices create many doubts in her husband's mind that he is trying to overlook. His overlooking makes him reserved, causing Nellie to fear his final rejection. Her foolish but generous use of money has created a bit of tension, and sets them up for an amusing conflict that is carried through the book, with laughable little twists-and-turns until the end.Also, the secondary characters - Cardross's friend and younger sister - add tons of color and wit to the story."},{"Title":"April Lady [AUDIOBOOK]","review":"Once again, Georgette Heyer takes the reader on a rambuncious ride with laughs and surpises at every twist and turn and doesn't stop until the very last page. This is a great novel for first-time readers of Regency stories, as the plot and character descriptions sweep you away even as you acclimate yourself to the idioms, mannerisms and delightful dialogue of the English Ton. One of Heyer's more outlandishly comedic novels, you will find yourself laughing at Nell's antics as she tries to settle her debts, which in and of themselves do not seem terribly outrageous but taken in the context of the time period are undoubtably hilarious. I challenge you to be able to put this one down once you realize Nell's predictament -- and wonder how it will resolve."},{"Title":"April Lady [AUDIOBOOK]","review":"If this were anyone but Heyer, I'd probably give it 3 stars. Her ability to write vivid characters, and her sense of fun, earn this one an extra star.I haven't checked, but I'm sure this must be one of her earlier Regencies. You can see her experimenting with characters who become archetypes, like the gamester brother, or the perfect gentleman friend who supports the heroine in her trials.She includes some details that don't appear in later novels, hinting at the darker side of Regency society.My biggest problem is the hero, Lord Cardross. Her heroes often have a harsh streak, but he comes across as too harsh and cold, without the humor that usually softens her heroes. He and Nell are at outs for most of the story, which doesn't help.He's a man in his thirties, while Nell is barely nineteen, and that makes them an uneven match. And he has an unkind and ungracious habit of baiting Nell for marrying him for his money. Since she came from a noble but bankrupt family, the rules of their world dictated she didn't have a choice. He knows that as well as she does. It's unpleasant to watch him holding it over her head.Since Cardross isn't the most sympathetic hero, it's hard to identify with Nell's love for him. She can seem like a bit of a twit. That's especially true since she's got a debt she won't tell her husband about, and all kinds of silly, frustrating scruples about how to get the money to pay it back. She's not all bad, but she reminds me of the kind of female Heyer satirized in later books.Also strange is that we are asked to believe they both fell in love at first site, and that neither one of them has even suspected it, even though the marriage has been consummated for several months. Possible, I suppose, but not pleasant to think about.What saves this story for me is the tempestuous Letty, Cardross' half sister and ward. She's more of a risk taker than Heyer's later young ladies. Of course she is head over heels in love with an unsuitable young man. Letty's attempts to get her own way and marry him before he sails abroad are very entertaining. The lover himself is certainly not what you'd expect.In short, this is not Heyer at the top of her form. For the true fan it is worth collecting, and certainly worth re-reading, but not as often as her best."},{"Title":"April Lady [AUDIOBOOK]","review":"One of my absolute favorite Georgette Heyer books, April Lady is charming, funny, and at one part, heart-wringing.A year into their marriage, both Nell and Giles are deeply in love with each other but assumes that the other had only entered into a marriage of convenience. Misunderstandings between the two are exacerbated by the unwitting actions of Giles's spoiled, willful sister Letty, who's determined to marry a poor diplomat and Nell's brother Dysart, who's always in debt and borrowing from Nell.My favorite moment is when Giles is under the mistaken impression that Nell had sold the family jewels he gave her but he still forgives her and calls for her to come back to him."},{"Title":"April Lady [AUDIOBOOK]","review":"This is one of the lesser visited plots where the main characters are already married and we follow the story as they fall in love.At times I wanted to shake the heroine for being such an idiot and the hero for being so reserved. If they had just opened up to each other and talked everything out, there would have been no problems. Of course, there would have been no story, either.That said, I usually don't care for these misunderstanding-based plots but, somehow, my irritation was overruled by my enjoyment of the story."},{"Title":"April Lady [AUDIOBOOK]","review":"REVIEWER'S OPINION:I did not enjoy reading about the heroine Nell. She did too many stupid things. She was not honest with Giles her husband which resulted in inaccurate assumptions by both of them. They each thought the other didn't care, so they acted in stand-offish ways, which reinforced the beliefs that the other didn't care. How did this start? Nell's mother was ignorant and told a lie. The mother told Nell that Giles only married her for convenience, would never love her, would always have a mistress, and Nell should not show her true feelings or any insecurities. From the stupidity of youth Nell believed her and felt she could not go to Giles with her problems, and she never let him know that she loved him. Nell avoided being with Giles for various reasons. In one scene, Giles wanted Nell to stay home with him, but Nell said she wanted to go to a play with Letty. She really didn't want to go, but she chose to go because she feared Letty might argue with Giles if they stayed home. This was not following Nell's feelings, and it was a stupid reason (IMO). Another problem was Nell frequently acting afraid of Giles, and he saw this. Giles loved Nell, but he never told her. He believed she married him only for his money which was not true. The plot starts with Nell telling a lie to Giles. Then she had to keep making up more lies to cover previous lies which snowballed into a mess by the end of the book. At one point Giles was angry at Nell believing she stole something which was not true, but she didn't deny it which was another lie. This did not work for me. I was more annoyed than enjoyed.Another example of stupidity: midway in the story Felix offered to loan Nell the money, and she said no. I'm shaking my head - what? She was desperate and that would have solved her problem.On my profile page, I have a list of pet peeves. This story used three of them: (1) conflicts due to vague communication and inaccurate assumptions (2) lying with does not fit with one's feelings and motivations and (3) heroine doing stupid things. Sometimes a small amount of these can work, but this story had too much.I loved the narrator, Eve Matheson. She spoke slowly, was easy to understand, and had such a pleasant, lovely voice. She's my favorite female narrator so far.STORY BRIEF:Nell's brother Dysart is an irresponsible gambler. He borrows 300 pounds from Nell which means she can't pay her clothing bills. She doesn't tell Giles that Dysart borrowed from her. She doesn't tell Giles she has an unpaid bill of 300 pounds. She goes to Dysart for help, and they consider and attempt various schemes to get the money.A second story is about Giles' half-sister Letty who is 17 and wants to marry Jeremy who has no money. Giles is against the marriage at this time due to Letty's age. But he will support it in a couple of years. This is unacceptable to Letty who is furious and plans her own schemes. Letty is selfish, foolish, and very stupid.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 9 hours. Narrator: Eve Matheson. Swearing language: none. Sexual content: none. Setting: 1813 England.

Busy, overwhelmed and stressed working mothers are still blindly believing the spiels that these savvy center directors are delivering. Sure, there are many, many child center directors out there who may visionary managers who strive to provide the best care possible for these precious children. On the other hand, there are plenty of center directors out there who don't seem to have the children's best interests at heart. These misguided directors are pushed by the owners to keep costs way down so that they can maximize their profits. Since the youngest children in their care don't have voices of their own, it is so easy to exploit their vulnerability. If you have a child in day care who is under the age of three, you must educate yourself about how to recognize poor to mediocre quality child care. Children over the age of three are more likely to tell you, or demonstrate to you via body language, that they're not happy with the care they're receiving at day care. The younger ones may not be able to express to you that they're not receiving the best possible. They may not be able to tell you that they're being mistreated or neglected. Lots of times, the problems with poor quality child care are not easy to detect. Even those of us who are very savvy consumers and smart business women may not be able to tell if a child care center is offering the best quality care for our precious children.Here is a very, very important clue to look for in a quality child care center. It involves how parents can monitor their child's classroom without being detected by the day care teacher or her students:1. Does your center have state-of-the-art intercoms in the classrooms? These are the intercoms where the director can listen in from her office while on mute. They're usually small white plastic wall-mounted devices with several capabilities for announcements and two-way conversation. These intercoms are used for monitoring teacher-child interactions without the classroom occupants knowing they're being monitored. If your center only has the old-fashioned big brown boxes mounted high on the wall where the principal can make crackly announcements, then you should be very wary. If your child's classroom does not have a way for you to monitor your child via audio without being detected by the day care teacher, then you should be worried. In this day and age of tiny video cameras, Video Barbies, Nanny Cams, and more; shouldn't your child care center be equipt with technology where you can listen-in on what your child's day care teacher is saying to her class? Wouldn't you want to know what your child's day care teacher is saying to him when they don't think you're listening in? What if your child's day care teacher is controlling him with threats? Wouldn't you want to know about it? What if she's saying, \\"If you don't sit down in your chair right now, I'm going to give you a spanking.\\" What if the day care worker is \\"spanking hands\\" when the kids touch things in the room that she doesn't want them to touch? Children under the age of three may not report this to the parent. They may be too scared to say anything to you about it. They may not know that there is anything wrong with an adult saying this to them since they believe they're supposed to \\"listen to the teacher\\". My point is this: If there isn't an intercom in the room for undetectable remote audio monitoring from the director's office, then you should be asking some questions or you should wonder why they don't want you to hear what the day care teacher is saying to these children.Here's another clue about the policy of cell phone use by staff members while on duty at child care centers:2. Does your child's day care center allow the day care workers to keep their cell phones on their person? Have you noticed the day care workers texting or calling on their phones when they're supposed to be watching the kids? Day care workers should not be allowed to have their cell phones on their person at all. The phones are supposed to stay in the purses which should be kept in a locked closet or in their locker. Many top-of-the-line child care centers will issue a written warning to a staffer who is using her phone while she's supposed to be managing her students (seriously!!!). These day care teachers are pretty savvy. If a parent and the director are standing out in the hall listening-in to your class, then it's really easy to know they're out there. Usually another day care teacher will see them coming down the hall and the teacher will send a text message or will call the teacher next door. The next day care teacher will pass the message along down to the next day care teacher. Everyone knows if the director and a concerned parent are on the hall since they use their personal cell phones to pass along important news. If your day care center tells you that they have made arrangements for parents to be able to observe their child's classroom without the day care teacher knowing about it, then you need to ask some additional questions. If these observation opportunities involve you standing outside the classroom door in the shadows, then the center director is either lying to you or she's absolutely wrong. The day care workers spread the news to each other like wild fire by text message. Everyone knows you're out there observing and I promise that they'll put on a really good show for you.I won't spill the beans about all the advice and tips that the author has included in her book. I just want to say that if you really care about quality child care, then you must read this book."},{"Title":"Attack of the 'b' Movie Posters: The Illustrated History of Movies Through Posters","review":"What a book! All the poster/lobby card compilations by Hershenson and Allen are great, particularly Volume 10, Serial Movie Posters, which I suspect is their best seller to date, soon to be topped by this one.We can argue about the &quot;B Movie&quot; in the title, since many of the posters and lobby cards shown are for exploitation, road show, and drive-in films, and there are some A features to be found in these pages as well. But that's a quibble.What images! These were intended to get the farmers off their wagons and into the theatre, and they do serve that purpose. Have a gander at the incredible poster for I LOVE TROUBLE (39), a masterpiece in several senses of the word and from many points of view. The poster for TOMCATS (237) exhibits a very poor understanding of human anatomy but it would cause any healthy male of any age to fumble unconsciously in the general direction of the fly of his trousers. A number of posters and lobby cards feature the immortal Mamie Van Doren, protruding further than seems humanly possible (100, for instance) and Jayne Mansfield (for example 112) is no slouch along those lines herself.I'd love to have seen a poster for BOP GIRL GOES CALYPSO starring Judy Tyler, but one can't have everything!

Although the films were Ed Wood grade z type shlock fare the posters promoting them were class a in artistic design. The general rule of thumbs used by us frequenting the weekly drive-ins was the more outragius off the wall display on those posters(usualy a scanty cladd female and verball quotation to entice the movie going individuals) the most likely the film is a real turkey.Many of us loved making the weekly treck to the driv-ins just to see if the latest presentation could topple the king Plan 9 From Outer Space in realy bad filmmaking.The color posters contained in this volume all are examples of classic poster designing that sadly is lacking in &quot;bland&quot; fare that has been created for film posters from the late 80's to the present day.I highly recomend this gem of a book to any lover of film posters, the price for it is &quot;dirt cheap pocket change&quot; considering the outstanding content it has.A truely unique one of a kind book that I long have searched for and untill now, was never available."},{"Title":"The Impulsive Governess (Signet)","review":"The impulsive governess left me extemely disatisfied. In fact, I lost my enthusiasm as early as the few few pages when I discoverd that the author was fond of head hopping. Furthermore, the predictable plot, and characters that were much too tame(or just underdeveloped), made it impossible for me to enjoy this book. Lord Forestale especially, acted more like a green 19 year old than the grown man he was meant to be, and absolutly nothing like a man sharp enough to be entrusted with couriering important documents for the country at wartime.Sorry to say, i will be giving Barbara Allister's books a miss in the future.Oh, and also, the blurb on the back cover of the book is totally misleading. Deveraux could in no way be refered to as a man with \\"an iron will and molten temper\\"!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Coupland's eighth novel Hey Nostradamus! opens with the Columbine-esque massacre of students in a Vancouver high school in 1988. It is an event related to us through the beautifully woven-together narrative fragments of Cheryl Anway who we soon realise is herself a victim of the tragedy. Cheryl has recently secretly married her boyfriend Jason Klaasen in Las Vegas, and that morning discovers she is pregnant with his baby. What follows are three further narratives covering the thirty years which take us from the eighties to the present day. We see Jason 12 years on, still clearly unable to come to terms with Cheryl's death and having taken on a hermit-like existence; then Heather, Jason's new girlfriend struggling to deal with his disappearance; and finally Reg, Jason's fanatically religious father whose coda brings us to the present day.Many inches have been dedicated to discussing the relevance of Columbine to this text and as a result the novel has been criticised for failing to address the psychology of the teenagers who commit the crime. But this is no exploration of Columbine and shouldn't be read as one. What interests Coupland is not so much the event of the shooting itself but rather the results which it produces. A series of seismic circles pulsating outwards until we reach the here and now.The first two words of the novel tell us what Coupland is really doing here and they are Cheryl's words \`I believe'. Coupland sets the shooting in 1988 for a good reason, and that is to distance it, historicize it almost; to use it as a genesis point for his real theme, which is belief in all the multifarious incarnations in which it exists within our society. Each of the four main characters that share the narrative unevenly between them, are shown dealing with a collapse of the system of belief which has maintained them. These systems range from Reg's evangelical fanaticism, through the bitchy, disloyal Youth Alive! Christian group of which Jason and Cheryl are a part; to the more dubious emotional dependence which Heather develops for the utterances of a psychic, when Jason disappears.Just as the soothsaying's of Nostradamus have helped society to post-rationalise the terrible events which happen on our planet everyday ( most memorably of course in the prophecy of the \`two twin brothers torn apart by chaos' which was beamed around the globe by email after September 11th) so too do these characters twist and manipulate religious or pagan beliefs to protect themselves. It is an hypocrisy summed up most aptly by Cheryl when she states \`I did want Jason, but, as I've said, only on my own terms, which also happened to be God's terms,...I'm not sure if I used God or he used me.\\"There are flaws in Coupland's text; the sub-plot in which Jason becomes involved is confusing and adds little to the development of the story, and certainly confuses the ending in a way that is less enigmatic, more frustrating. However, if you can get beyond reading this as a meditation upon Columbine, you will find a great deal of interest and reward in this text, and a realisation that the issues it is addressing are far more pertinant and universal than it could be given credit for."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Coupland has once again produced a strong story, with an element of the surreal creeping in. Whereas &quot;All Families are Psychotic&quot; had a number of surreal strands that rendered the required the reader to suspend their normal perspective, the worrying aspect of &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot; is that the principle surreal element is a school shooting that is, in fact, all too plausible. One aspect of the shooting is recounted from a victim's perspective (and from the perspective of immediately after the event), whereas the other story strands are taken from the vantage of several years after the event. The chain reactions from this are elegantly woven together - the husband of the victim who can not come to terms with the event, his relationship to his father and how that develops as a consequence of the tragedy, how his family interacts with his father. As with most of Coupland's later works, this story evolves through the different perspectives, rather than follows a rigid plot and time line.As either an introduction to those who have not read Coupland before, of for established fans, this is a volume that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Coupland's latest novel is by far the best of his later books. I have been a devout reader of Douglas Coupland's work and have been disappointed with basically everything since Microserfs. Hey Nostradamus! has changed all of that. Hey! is a critical look into modern fanatacism and the consequences of being a teenager in a world filled with guns, God, and video games.The novel is divided into four parts each narrated by a different character. The connections between the characters are at first, not obvious. Coupland threads these misfits into a disjointed narrative that works. The first part is narrated by Cheryl, who has been killed in a Columbine-style massacre in a Vancouver high school in 1988. Cheryl's account reminds me of Susie Salmon's in The Lovely Bones--She is telling the story from a &quot;space&quot; not heaven, not hell, not earth. As macabre as the plot is, the style works. Her husband's (Jason's) account is not as seamless, but his disillusionment shows well through the narrative.I would have liked to have read more about Reg, Jason's religious fanatic father, but his portion of the book was cut short, I felt. There is no obvious resolution here, but in today's world, there seldom is. This, I believe, is Coupland's intent, or part of it, anyway.For those looking for critical insight into post-Columbine, post-9/11 North America, Douglas Coupland's latest novel does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"A thought provoking and interesting book. It is so different from the other novels that are mass produced and over promoted. Some of the phrases that I particularly enjoyed are:\\"It always seemed to me that people who'd discovered religion had both lost and gained something. Outwardly, they'd gained calmness, confidence and a look of purpose, but what they'd lost was a certain willingness to connect with unconverted souls.\\"\\"My brain feels like a cool, deep lake.\\"\\"Through a Starbucks window I'm watching a sunset the color of children's aspirin as I crash-land n two clonazepams.\\"\\"The point here is that there are certain human behavioral traits that can be talked about, but unless you've experienced the impulse behind them, they remain theoretical. Most of the time, this is for the best.\\"\\"I remember finding out that the world was actually just a planet, in school in the third grade, and I remember hating the teacher, Mr. rowan, who discussed the solar system as if it were a rock collection.\\"Coupland has a great knack for using language creatively and in a succinctly descriptive way. His characters were interesting, albeit all desperately lonely, and his expression of the tragedy and how it affected them all uniquely was fascinating."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I kind of gave up on Douglas Coupland sometime after Shampoo Planet. He is a talented writer, one whose wit and prose I admire even when I admire the book much less. However, it felt to me as though he often took the easy way out with his work. If his wit had been less ready, his books would have been much stronger.My partner recommended that I read Hey Nostradamus. He has stayed more hopeful than I about Coupland as a writer and thought that this book was a real change in direction for him-- the first in a very long time.I agree. While as readable as Coupland generally is, it is much harder-hitting than a book like Girlfriend in a Coma. He (largely) resists the temptation to tell us too much in his trademark monologues and letters. He used a number of sidesteps in the past to elide the hard stuff that comes up in his books, and none of them are evident here. This is a sweet book in the way that all his books are sweet, but he also lets the real sadness through.I recommend this novel for either Coupland fans or readers new to his work. Although there is some violence and adult situations, it should still be a good book for teenagers."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Columbine. That's the biggest step you can take to understanding this novel. In the same way that Microserfs, Coupland's best in my opinion, was \\"about\\" microsoft and the dot.com era, this book is about the killings in columbine, co. More than that, though, it concerns how traumatic events affect the people who surround them.Doug likes to write in first person, and this book is a good vehicle for that; it concerns the lives of four people: Cheryl; a girl killed in the shootings, her boyfriend Jason, who is the damaged survivor, and Heather, the \\"new girlfriend\\"- 20 years later- who still has to live up to the now-a-saintly-martyr Cheryl, and Jason's father Reg, the fractured family's patriarch-of sorts.This all sounds very depressing. However, if you've read Coupland before, you'll know of his ability to turn these traumas into transcendent, illuminating moments of clarity, which he does in this book better than he has in years, since \\"Life After God\\".Don't read this book for it's \\"view\\" of columbine. Instead, read to learn to appreciate the lives of the people around you. Read it to savor the mulchy descriptions of the pacific northwest. Not to fear death but to treasure life. That sounds pretty pithy... Just give it a try."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Douglas Coupland is certainly a Canadian gem. In this book Coupland, through the minds of four main characters, takes the reader on an amazing path through spirituality, human understanding, great loss, and big turning points--all while maintaining his gift of beautifully pointing out obviousness in this world that many of us miss. What I enjoyed most about this book was not only Coupland's wicked sense of humour, but his ability to tell four different views of the same event(s) through four men and women. It is not every day that one comes across a writer who can effectively capture the mind of a male and a female like Coupland has done so effortlessly in \\"Hey Nostradamus!\\". I whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone looking to explore sides of love, loss and understanding on the spiritual and human fronts. It's a fantastic page-turner, too. And I loathe using that term, so I sincerely mean it."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"For many Coupland fans, myself included, he's never been able to top &quot;Microserfs,&quot; and its characters, humor, emotion, and his overriding philosophy about seeking something better and the realization about what that something better really is.After the alienating characters of &quot;All Families are Psychotic,&quot; where the reader was practically dared to care about any of them, we find Coupland again returning to a basic theme with a handful of characters. Each part of this book looks at the Columbine-like shooting, its aftermath, and the long-range effects on the characters.The father character is the most problematic, but the final chapter, written from his perspective, is the key to understanding what this book and Coupland's message is all about. The spiritual themes that Coupland has explored in each of his books (especially &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot;) is once again brought front and center. The final paragraph of the book and its apochryphal nature make you stop and re-consider the Biblical themes that have been carried through the course of the overall story. Rather than rejecting religion, Coupland once again, appears to be presenting in a modern context, very debates about Christianity, and what its preachings really are about, as opposed to the way many of its detractors---and some of its most-ardent practitioners---understand its message to be."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"In Hey Nostrodomus, Coupland gets back to what he did so well in his earlier books, peeling back the layers of familiar people. revealing fears and emotions that we all carry, the little hidden Things that drive us that go unknown to most.More importantly he spends time creating real charactors rather than fantastic plot twists or impossible set ups. This one gets pretty close to telling about real people. People we never get the full story on, people that we pass by shaking our heads. While he hasn't returned to the greatness of Microserfs or Life After God, he's much more on track than than All Families are Psychotic and Miss Wyoming."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"At times, Douglas Coupland's writing reminds of Kurt Vonnegut (particularly when he flirts with speculative fiction as he does in Girlfriend in a Coma and Hey Nostradamus). Even if the novel doesn't completely come together, it's worth reading because of the author's unique insight on everything from the mundane to the very nature of the universe.Hey Nostrodamus is an unusual novel; one that doesn't fully come together but is still worth reading. Coupland has a unique voice and in Hey Nostrodamus, he tackles issues of faith and redemption. Like Vonnegut, I often stop and re-read lines in a Coupland novel - deceptively simple lines of prose - that are so brilliant and insightful, they blow me away.The novel itself though is strangely disjointed. Hey Nostradamus feels like 3 or 4 novellas linked by a common theme and a few of the same characters. The story is told in four parts, each voiced by a different character (Cheryl, the teenager who is killed in a high school shooting; Jason her young husband ten years later; Heather, his girlfriend; and Reg, Jason's father). I would have liked to have seen Coupland give each character a unique writing style. There wasn't much shift in narrative style and the story itself veers in some strange directions, particularly near the end of Jason's chapter (his sister-in-law's reaction to a tragic death and her solution to a chance acquaintance in Vegas is so bizarre it felt like it belonged in a different novel).Coupland has a unique voice and this is a novel worth reading. His prose is filled with astute observations about the nature of faith and how it can both comfort and abuse. This novel may not come together neatly, but life doesn't either.3 stars."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"The Columbine Massacre is an event which shocked and impacted the lives of many people in a small community in Colorado. However, what if those events had taken place earlier, say 1988 and in a community in Vancouver? How would these events affect the people of that community and more specifically those directly involved? How would their lives, with their own complexities and problems, be changed? Douglas Coupland asks these same questions in his book Hey Nostradamus! By offering the story in series of four narratives which all recount the personal journeys of the four narrators (Cheryl, Jason, Heather, Reg), each reacting in some way to the events of that fateful day, and illustrates just how deeply and how long such an violent event can impact upon someone's life.The story principle follows Jason Klaasen his trial, tribulations, and his movements from husband, to would be father, to widower, to loser and to simply gone. The characters surrounding the Klaasen family, as well as the small community, all experience similar emotional ups and downs as they struggle to cope with their loss and return to a sense of normalcy while trying to fill the void created by that terrible day. Religious themes then ring heavily in the book starting with the Klaasen family Patriarch, a strict and often ideologically confused, Reg Klaasen. The Mafioso religious youth group both Jason and Cheryl once belong to as well as reoccurring phrases like Cheryl's scribbling in the cafeteria, as she and her class mates are held at gun point, \\"God is Nowhere / God is Now Here.\\" and the deep need of all character to have some spiritual (supernatural) supervision rings deeply with religious conviction and confusion, many if not all, the character share. With the characters all struggling at some time to deal with their religious convictions and their need to either pass blame or escape guilt they all look to find redemption in the eyes of one another in the unique and odd relationships they develop after the massacre.Coupland manages to skillfully keep the readers attention while dragging them through confusing narration of a desperate teenager, a guilty and a lonely middle aged adult and a crisis stricken elderly man. By hearing the story from four different points of view, and from four closely related narrators the story evolves as the understanding of then historical events evolves with each passing page. Coupland manages to alter bias as he sees fit to help lead the reader through awkward moments and understand the drives behind which skew the narrators' understanding of the events which unfold before them. As years pass new narrators appear, who were not even at school present when the massacre took place (such as Heather), and offer new insight that helps understand the Klaasen family as all narration seems to focus on them in some way.Coupland also through this series of four narratives manages to place a unique emphasis on each section by having the character speak as if in a journal, and always seeming to be blunt and honest. So a certain degree of sincerity, even from the strict Reg, can be achieved because it is felt as if they are attempting to do this not just for themselves, but always for others or for a deeper understanding of why things happened this way. The interesting and compelling characters keeps the reader interested and urges them to read further and further into the book because the plot of the story just seems unclear through most of the story and mystery drives the reader on.Finally, Coupland constantly attacks the reader with new information and challenges the reader to attempt to understand why characters do what they do. Through it presentation the reader achieves a removed sense of judgment, which is more of question of ones own morality than and attempt to understand the morality of the characters, as the unfortunate events unfold and each character experiences loss. The reader tries constantly to understand and when ones comes to the end of the book many questions are left unanswered and plots unresolved, but for some reason with how the story progressed it is no surprise really. For in the end none of the character in spite of how hard they try seem to be able to control their fate and Cheryl's scribbling rings true again, \\"God is Nowhere / God is Now Here.\\" and so it seems right that these things are left as they are.In the end the book is an excellent piece of fiction, a compelling and controversial topic with interesting and likable characters. All of which suck you into a world Douglas Coupland is known all to well at being able to do. Propelled by excellent skill with the ability to write prose in a fluid and understandable way, Coupland's Hey Nostradamus! is an excellent and compelling example of modern fiction and a book that very worthy of reading."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This is my second favorite Coupland book, my fave is LIFE AFTER GOD, but HEY NOSTRADAMUS comes close, and like all of Coupland's books entertains while at the same time making you think. Very similar to SILLY LITTLE RICH GIRL, by Jimmy Gleacher, if you like that kind of writing."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"If you want a summary of the book's plot, then read the Amazon summary or read someone else's review. I'm here to tell you what I thought about the book.That being said, let me just say that, in my opinion, this is the best novel I've ever read. I've read it twice, and each time it's a new, magical experience. I've read all of Coupland's books, and they're all astounding in their own way (with the exception of Elanor Rigby, ugh), buy Hey Nostradamus! is definitely Coupland's masterpiece.Just one page of this book will make you laugh and cry. It's really that good. Again, Coupland hits on the pulse of our modern world and our future for that matter. Even just reading the first five pages of the book, you will walk away in a daze, and that effect lasts through the whole book. Just amazing. It will break your heart.Whatever you have to pay to buy this book, it will be worth it. This will be a book you will want to read again, even after you finish it."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I truley am impressed. I read a great deal and I felt like I was out of truley amazing books, and authors, as I have finished Voneguts collection. But Coupland was GREAT!You can read the novel in two ways, as an easy read, for the pure entertainment he provides so vividly, or for the deeper meaning between the words.A must read!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I bought this book as an impulse. The cover intrigued me and the discription of the book on the back intrigued me even more. Unfortunately I feel that to book didn't have follow through.I found all four voices in this book to be too similar. There was no tangable differences between Cheryl and Jason especially. I also found Reg and and Heather's sections to be extremely forced.This book is timely and I think it had GREAT potential. However I feel it falls flat. The characters are trite and extremely naive to the world.I am giving it three stars."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I'm a Coupland fan, off and on, and found this book easy and fun to read; it had less of an impact on me than others of his have had, and the semi-obligatory spiritual ruminations were no more interesting than others in the same genre, but it was fine overall. It was a library pick for me, and I don't need to own a copy.I agree with previous reviewers that the first two narrators were far more powerful than the last two; I'd add that the book was more interesting before Heather comes along. There are two plots in the Heather section - one engaging (if obvious), the other clumsy, better suited to writers of crime &amp; suspense fiction."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Unlike the other reviewers so far, &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot; is the first book of Coupland's I've read, so I came into it not knowing what a phenomenal stylist he is. Like most of America, I'm laid off right now, so I've been reading a novel approximately every two days, and thus have plowed through maybe 40 books back to back, including some by my favorite authors. &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot; is the best thing I've read since &quot;The Lovely Bones,&quot; a year ago. The other reviewers have made mention of this being Gospel-like, and one of the characters being Jesus-like. I disagree. This is more like &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; without the annoying stream of consciousness, or the sad sick joke about Caddy. Each of the four parts is narrated by a different character, which besides being a compelling narrative choice for the material, illustrates how good Coupland is at invoking the unique voice of every character. I've not seen that sort of control and talent outside of Stephen King (and Coupland would be selling as well as King in a fair world). This is not a happy book, so juggle it on your list accordingly. However, it's a &quot;don't miss&quot; for sure. I'm definitely going to read everything else Coupland has written. (Just finished &quot;Shampoo Planet&quot; and it was great, too.) Oh, and I really liked the ribbon bookmark; publishers take heed."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I, too, have read all of Coupland's books. The book opens with a tragic massacre of a young girl, but it's those around her who survive the incident that suffer the most. After it, no one can figure out how to carry on their lives. Then again, the characters in this book didn't seem to be carrying on much of a life prior to the incident.Coupland's common theme of tragedy bringing realization to his characters falls short in this book. As a fan of Coupland, I was of course moved by the book, but I don't think non-Coupland fans would be altered in such a way. It's a book I *really* wanted to love, but ending up only liking it. If you're a fan, read it. If you're looking for a Coupland classic, start with Microserfs, Girlfriend in a Coma, or Generation X."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I, too, have read all of Coupland's books.

The book's main character, Jason, performs a miraculous act during a school shooting, motivated by his love for his secret wife Cheryl. He's despised by a community that thinks he may be responsible for the tragedy, in which he saves many of his peers but loses Cheryl. Jason is also betrayed by a group of fanatical church-going friends, many of whom survive the tragedy, ironically called Youth Alive!Jason's ultra-religious father Reg represents Lucifer, who in the Bible was cast out of paradise because he thought he rivaled God. Youth Alive!, Reg, and Jason's brother Kent, a Youth Alive! leader, believe that they are the righteous ones, and react in different ways to Jason's miraculous deed...Jason is either ignored, envied, or crucified by them when it appears that God had chosen Jason as his favorite. As other characters take the story's reigns, the typically silent Jason is shown to be more Christ-like than those who pay lip service to God for their own ends, and he ultimately delivers paradise to Reg, who thought he'd been pointing the way for Jason all along.This is a brave effort by D.C., who has no doubt already heard from detractors who'd claim to have a party line to God themselves. I am glad he told this story, perhaps a few misanthropic religious zombies in the audience will read, learn, and rejoin the living."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Hey Nostradamus is about a school shooting, the kind we are all too familiar with, and its aftermath. Three alienated, isolated students in fatigues come into school and start shooting up the cafeteria. Under stress, two of the shooters (the point is made a couple of times that they can't be \\"gunmen\\", but that \\"gunboys\\" isn't a word) kill the third. A courageous student kills another with a thrown rock to the head. Surviving students, emboldened by the rock thrower, mobs the third, crushing him with a cafeteria table. Coupland explores his subject in a creative way, radiating outward from the time and place of the tragedy. The book is divided into four sections, each narrated by a different person, each with a different involvement. First is Cheryl, the blonde, born-again shooting victim. Cheryl tells her story looking back on the incidents of her final day from the perspective of one who has passed on, but isn't in heaven. The cosmology is deliberately hazy - she may be at a way station for souls, or maybe this is it and her faith was misplaced. Jason, the rock-throwing boy and Sheryl's high school boyfriend narrates the second part. The final two parts belong to Heather, a woman who finally breaks through Jason's defenses and becomes his girlfriend, and Reg, Jason's father.Hey Nostradamus is \\"really\\" about a couple of things: faith and God, and how much what we do is who we are. This is the most serious Coupland book I've read, and the most ambitious as he tries to get inside the heads of people of different ages and genders. It makes me want to catch up with what else he's done besides his well-knownGeneration X. Hey Nostradamus isn't preachy or overcomplicated, but it's thought provoking and reminiscent of Nick Hornby's better work. If you like an irreverent writing style but want a little more complexity in the story, you'll enjoy Hey Nostradamus."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Coupland does a great job of fleshing out characters, but leaves the plot sadly in the lurch. I wouldn't ask that everything be resolved happily, Hollywood-style, but just that the major plot questions somehow be answered. It seems like a cop-out to end the book the way he does."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Best. Book. Ever.Hands down the most provacative and utterly mind-blowing book I've ever read. It fascinated me from cover to cover. All 5 times. Coupland's humor is unmatched, as well as his uncanny ability to make the reader completely addicted.I picked up this book on a whim, happened to come across it, thought the cover was amusing, bought it. I'm thrilled that I took a chance and judged a book by it's cover. I read it and immediately fell in love with the characters and Coupland's writing.I think it's more fun to read if you don't have the slightest clue what it's about. I've let numerous friends borrow it and they all agree. Just read it. It's amazing.I don't think any of that made sense. But, ignore that, just read the book."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"If you can appreciate excellent writing with a bit of ambiguity in the storyline, you will enjoy this book. There are some incredible passages of character description, where the honest reader must silently admit to seeing a bit of himself in each of the courageous, self-righteous, selfless, misguided, and sad people in this story. Coupland tackles enormous topics (tragedy, addiction, zealotry, poverty, and random and organized crime) with incredible restraint, humbly refraining from expounding on the inexplicable. Your mind remains engaged long after the last page has been read."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"&quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot; has an atypical structure, each of its four chapters being narrated in first person by a different character. The first part of the story is told from the point of view of a victim of a high school massacre that is obviously patterned after the Columbine incident. Her recounting of that violent day sets the pace for the rest of the book, as the subsequent characters are, in turn, effected by its events. Each of them is lead, at some point, to question his or her religious convictions - some are strengthened and others are lost.By the time the novel reaches its fourth segment, it has morphed into a completely different tale than what is expected from the beginning. The transitions can be jarring, but then, so can life itself.I found myself sympathizing with each character as he or she took hold of the story, despite the fact that they were each capable of some pretty horrible or foolish acts. The moral flaws of the individual characters don't seem to matter though. It's the rest of the world that's a mess, and they're just trying to get through it."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This is not a novel that ties up every loose end and makes it clear what the writer's message or point is. Life can be unsettling and it can be hard to understand. That's especially true when high school kids start shooting each other. When the unthinkable happens, most normal people start to question their long-held beliefs and wonder why such a tragedy can ever take place.That's the backdrop of this book that covers a high school shooting that is set in the supposedly peaceful world of western Canada. The aftermath of the shooting is told from the perspective of four different people. It includes the perspective of one of the victims. her boyfriend and his father. Along the way, the writer provides some interesting perspectives on religious belief, revenge and the animosity that humans can place on one another.There really is no end to the book and it shows how the suffering from a violent crime can continue its impact long after the actual crime. Sometimes those impacts are caused by people who react to the crime and try to &quot;fix&quot; things.In summary, if you want to read a book that will make you think and will challenge you, then pick this up. It's not overly ponderous and you can read it quickly but I guarantee that you will be thinking about it long after you are done reading it."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Hey Nostradamus! may be Douglas Coupland's best novel yet. In telling the story of a Columbine-like massacre Coupland resists the temptation to concentrate on the whys and hows of the killing and instead weaves a story of how the massacre affects the lives of those who experienced it. The book tells the story of four people, one of whom dies in the shooting spree and the other three who have to live with its consequences. The story explores the way people deal with tragedy, but it goes beyond this. Hey Nostradamus! explores the unintended consequences of emotional support, the nature of acceptance and denial, the way people form relationships, and the way that society focuses on select aspects of events. It is not happy story, but it will make you aware that people are much more complex than they are generally given credit for. Each of Coupland's four main characters starts off as a cliche. The book peels away the public face of each character and reveals them as being different aspects of each other. The book is, in effect, a novelization of R.E.M.'s song Everybody Hurts."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This book was centered around four main characters: Cheryl, Jason, Heather and Reg. The book is divided into four parts, one for each character.In the first part, Cheryl describes the Columbine-like shooting in her school during her senior year in 1988. Her and her boyfriend Jason had just gotten secretly married six weeks ago and she just found out last night that she was pregnant. She goes back and forth between the events that led to her death and the events that led to her marriage of Jason. She is in a sort of purgatory with darkness and silence and she can only hear certain prayers, but just the words, not the voices behind them.I was hooked from the very first part since I just finished reading The Lovely Bones and having the character talk about her life while she was dead seemed very similar to me.The next part fast forwards in time to 1999 and is written from the viewpoint of Jason. He is writing a letter to his nephews and manages to express only his hatred for his father, Reg and the fact that he has never gotten over Cheryl's death. He expresses that he blacks out when he's been drinking and especially so when other drugs are involved. There's a few pages where he's blacked out and some strange things happen to him. I never really fully understood what was going on during those few pages, so I might need to read them again.Heather writes the third part in 2002, three months after Jason's disappearance. She is Jason's girlfriend and the closest thing to a stable relationship he's had since Cheryl. She is approached by a psychic who tells her things only her and Jason would ever know. She trusts the psychic as she has no other choice if she wants to find out what happened to Jason and if he's still alive.While I was reading Jason's part, I was looking forward most to Reg's part, the final part which takes place in 2003. Reg is one of those holier-than-thou types and has some pretty atrocious beliefs. He told Jason's sister-in-law that one of her twin boys might not have a soul because technically, one was a clone of the other one and he didn't believe clones could have souls. He treated Jason and his mother poorly. In the end though, there is no satisfying resolution with Reg.I thought the book was well written and interesting, but I was left feeling that there wasn't much point to it. What was it all for? Perhaps I'm supposed to be left with this feeling. The book's central theme is that God may no longer be there for His people. He may no longer care to help them or hear them. In that effect, I think it would be more aptly titled &quot;Hey Nietzsche!&quot; rather than &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot;I really didn't think I was going to like this book at all when I first heard about it (so why I decided to read it, I do not know) but I was pleasantly surprised and might end up checking out some of Douglas Coupland's other books."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Four different voices with staggered time periods tell a compelling story that echoes the recent high school shootings we've seen so often in recent years. I read this book in 24 hours, all the while wondering what the next narrator would add to the tapestry. Time well spent, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"The cover of Coupland's new novel contains a \\"universal\\" symbol of religion - an icon of a person kneeling in prayer, found in an airport interfaith chapel in the United States. One would consider that Coupland found this throw-away symbol to be both ironic and meaningful, as he has also incorporated it a set of three-dimensional sculptures for a future gallery exhibit.He uses the symbolic nature of religion to define inclusion or exclusion in society for his four main characters in Hey Nostradamus! - which allows for some interesting situations for plot devices, but fails to delve deeply into the beliefs embodied in the characters.In addition, Coupland fans will find many familiar characters in his latest novel, which makes one wonder how much of the novel is constructed much like the arrangement of life-size statues that Coupland exhibits in galleries - with his stock characters arranged in plots with slightly different features and composition.Cheryl, a high-school student who narrates her brief life, death, and partial afterlife after a school massacre, is vaguely similar to Jared, a ghost character in Coupland's Girlfriend in a Coma, who dies at his prime as a high-school football star. However, Cheryl's character or memory never really has an impact on the rest of the narrative after her death - even on her widowed husband Jason, and it is frustratingly unclear how Cheryl's faith was challenged or changed as she is ethereally narrating the event.Jason, a rough-and-tumble guy with a loner streak and serious father issues, reminds the reader of Wade from All Families are Psychotic, who also share alcohol issues and experience in shady dealings that end up putting them in serious jeopardy. One would think the strange turns his life has taken would justify more than what is equivalent to a \\"tell-all\\" letter to his nephews as a vehicle for his narration. His mysterious disappearance leaves the reader with more questions than answers.The reader is then introduced to Heather, Jason's girlfriend. Readers of Life After God will recognize the pet personalities that Heather and Jason construct as almost exactly the same as the make-believe creatures generated by a desperate father in the short story, \\"Little Creatures\\" - for example, the dog character \\"Doggles\\" was modified to a frog character named \\"Froggles\\". The rest of her story is used more to distract the reader about Jason's disappearance and start to introduce the changes that are happening to Jason's father, Reg.Reg has the only strong character development in the novel and some compelling internal dialogue regarding religion and the internalization of his religious thoughts and doubts in his relationship with his son. The last chapter is a Hail-Mary pass to a meaningful statement that the reader will have decide for themselves whether or not is complete.Unless you've already read \\"Little Creatures\\" and Girlfriend in a Coma, I'd recommend picking up these two first before delving into Coupland's latest work. The interaction of the surreal and deeper character development in these works will leave the reader much more satisfied."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Fiction allows a reader to experience dreadful events. Yet there is a vast gulf between driving by and witnessing the gory aftermath of an accident and being handed an understanding of how truly tragic the accident becomes in the lives of those involved. Coupland succeeds in his tale of a Columbine-style massacre by comparing and contrasting the effects of the events on characters drawn well enough that the reader cares what happens. Unlike many authors, he is not wielding emotional and physical violence without thought--yet be prepared for the violence nonetheless.Columbine was all about emotional turmoil on a staggering number of levels. Coupland does a stunning job of laying out the ethical and moral landmines inherent in any thoughtful analysis of tragedy. Naturally, any analysis of tragedy ultimately becomes an analysis of religious faith (or the lack thereof) and the limits and power of forgiveness and redemption. Sadly, nothing can be quite so devastating as the misuse of religion to cover one's own deficiencies, to excuse faults or to supposedly gain power over others who may lack the self-control to follow their own path or in some other fashion be susceptible to the misuse of religious belief. Not only is the misuse of belief treated; Coupland offers several thematic threads (though seemingly odd in the case of the psychic) that show the power of faith and belief. Furthermore, there are several characters who do terrible things and then seek forgiveness. This exploration of the limits of redemption and forgiveness will stay with the reader for a very long time.Very, very deep stuff but not for the immature or unprepared. Coupland invites us to examine our own motives and provides a reminder of how utterly inadequate we are to judge the actions of others. Finally, though we are incapable of adequate judgment--Coupland reminds that we have the duty and obligation to protect ourselves and others from the hurtful effects of the misuse of freedom by others. In other words, a well-aimed rock can prevent much suffering."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This book is a beautiful modern-day opera; I have never read an author who so accurately describes North American, English speaking culture better than Douglas Coupland. Hey Nostradamus! has a way of jumping out at you, like a beautifullypositive line in a negative stanza, or a flower on a block of obsidian. The Biblical connection at the end stands out beautifully:\\"Awake! Everyone listen, there has been a miracle - my son who once waas dead is now alive. Rejoice! All of you! Rejoice! You must! My son is coming home!\\"It forces nothing. It's as if everything Coupland has to say were a round peg poised above a round hole, and he had simply to push it in."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"But for those less passionate about his unique style, I would probably borrow, not buy this book. I agree with the Amazon.ca review which say that the first 1/3rd of the book is mesmerizing. In fact, it's momentum kept me reading through to the end. By the time I put it down, I found myself feeling sad, touched, and yet again impressed by Coupland's ability to capture characters who, despite their crazy circumstances, feel real."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Coupland continues to impress me with his work, and I think this is quite possibly his best novel to date (I consider Girlfriend in a Coma the other contender). It evokes some of the same emotions as All Families Are Psychotic, but without the implausible absurdities that occur in that story. It all falls together in the end in some somewhat unexpected, but quite realistic ways--not so much in story as in character development. This book is told in first person from the perspectives of four major characters, from 1988 to 2003, beginning with Cheryl, who is killed in a Columbine-style high school cafeteria massacre, then moving on to her boyfriend Jason, eleven years later. Jason's character is the most richly developed, and his section of the book accounts for over 100 pages of the book's 244, though the characters of previous chapters continue to echo through the later ones. I very highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"People really freaked out about school shootings a few years ago, but Douglas Coupland cranks back the dates a little for &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot;, his latest satirical, poignant book. It resembles a non-apocalyptic, smoother &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; in some ways, but stands alone entirely.High-schoolers Jason and Cheryl were secretly married in Vegas; shortly afterward Cheryl told her new husband that she was pregnant. Only hours afterward, she was dead -- gunned down by three outsider classmates who decided to shoot their classmates. Jason kills one of the assassins, but is too late to save Cheryl. Media spin casts him as a possible conspirator, and his manic-religious father brands him a murderer (just before Jason's alcoholic mother hits his dad with a lava lamp).Years later, Jason is still haunted by the death of his pregnant wife (nobody knows that they were married), angry at his rigid father and the hardcore, empty Christian group YouthAlive! that added to his pain. Now he is gradually slipping into a new relationship with a woman named Heather -- one with a difficult secret of her own.The book is split into four sections: the first is Cheryl's, looking back on her life and her death, then at Jason (before, during and after the shootings), then to Heather, and finally to Jason's ultra-religious father Reg. It's a bit reminiscent of Coupland's &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma,&quot; with the teen boy growing to manhood haunted by his lover/wife and child, and the passages by the POW of a dead person, but there the resemblance ends.Coupland touches tricky subjects like religion and school shootings carefully. Though he comes down hard on preachy, gossipy, judgemental types, his beef is not with religion or Christianity so much as people who use it for themselves; at one point, Jason says that his father has a &quot;pagan&quot; mentality that sacrifices everyone else. (After his dad said that one of two identical twin boys didn't have a soul) The YouthAlive people are thoroughly disgusting, but the worst part is that there are actually people like these, vultures and gleeful puritans.Needless to say, the most vivid characters are Jason and Cheryl (even though Cheryl's dead as it ends); Coupland does a good job with feelings of teen desire, frustration and maturation. Heather's a less 3-D character, while Jason's parents are a little different -- his mom rises above the alcoholic cliche, and while Coupland provides greater insight into Reg, I still despised him.It's very much a Douglas Coupland book, very insightful and well-written. Definitely worth reading and thinking about."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"\\"Hey Nostradamus! Did you predict that once we found the Promised Land we'd all start offing each other? And did you predict that once we found the Promised Land, it would be the final Promised Land, and there'd never be another one again?\\" (Coupland, 91)Coupland's Hey Nostradamus! is a tale of loss and the infinite spirals of emotion that stem from inimitable and incomprehensible acts that serve as more than mere speed bumps on the road of life, and go on to tarnish vast quantities of people via a ripple effect. Furthermore, Coupland briefly and vaguely touches on religious themes and how religion plays a role in some people's lives. The novel is told in four parts.The first part is told, in a Lovely-Bones-esque kind of way, by Cheryl Anway, the victim of a heinous school shooting. Cheryl glances in retrospect at the events leading up to her death, and informs of her covert marriage to Jason, her high school sweetheart, and her recently discovered pregnancy. Neither of which anyone but the two of them knew about.Next we hear from Jason, the boyfriend who has yet to really put the past behind him and move on with his life. Jason, as would be expected, moves through life in an apathetic manner, and doesn't ever really allow himself to live, love, or forgive. Jason gives his account of the shootings, as well as what happened shortly thereafter, encompassing his own feelings and his family's disintegration.Third we hear from Jason's eventual girlfriend, Heather, who comes along after the previous insert from Jason. She talks of her relationship with Jason, and of her own recent loss.Finally, Reg, Jason's sanctimonious father whom everyone loves to hate yet can't help but feel sorry for, writes a heart-wrenching letter to Jason. In this letter he divulges his insecurity with his faith, and attempts to make amends for parental misgivings.After reading this novel, you will find yourself chewing up various emotions and spitting them back out only to find a bitter-sweet reminiscence left in your mouth. Though that may sound at first like a bad thing, it only attests to Coupland's ability to really drive his points home and, in so doing, force his readers to experience a novel rather than simply read it. Hey Nostradamus! is a dissection of raw, brutal, human emotion, told in the intriguingly vivid and witty manner characteristic of Coupland's other works. I have loved everything I have read by him thus far, and will definitely continue to support his work. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Not have read any other books by Coupland, Hey Nostradamus was captivating and far from boring. The details of the characters personalities and way of life made them really come to life and no longer were just fictional people from a book. Coupland gave each and everyone of the characters a story, and he chose to have four of them tell their stories. Each of the four started to tell their story a bit before the point where the other had stopped. The way this book was written, it would have you crying and not able to stop reading.If you want a thought provoking, insightful and captivating book that will have you not wanting to stop reading; this is the book."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Hey Nostradamus! is the latest novel by Canadian author Douglas Coupland. Coupland is perhaps best known for coining the phrase \\"Generation X\\" - taken from the title of his first novel. I have been a huge fan of Coupland's since that first novel - even though much of his work is spotty (for example, I thought \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" started very strong, then meandered away to mediocrity).This novel, however, is brilliant from top to bottom. Similar to the atrocious Booker winner (\\"Vernon God Little\\"), this novel is a take on school shootings. But where VGL does it's best to explain the \\"why\\" of school violence (and fails miserably), Coupland wisely uses the school violence as a starting point. He's much more concerned with \\"what happens afterward?\\" This creates a much more complex novel that explores not only teen angst, but also familial emotional abuse, spirituality, religion, feelings of urban isolation, and a host of other themes.By using four narrators, Coupland is able to take a core theme, spirituality, and absorb it and examine it from vastly different angles. Moreso than in his other work, Coupland captures the unique voice and experience of each character.Overall, this was a fascinating read, and one that will stay with me for a long time - especially the \\"Heather\\" section. An amazing novel."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I read plenty of books, but few of them are novels, probably because, as I age, I can &quot;hear the devices clanking away&quot; (in the words of Richard Rodriguez, author of &quot;Brown,&quot; who knows what he's talking about).Nevertheless, I remain drawn to the novels of Douglas Coupland, who like me is from Vancouver. That despite his being an extreme example of &quot;write what you know&quot;--his characters are pretty much all young, white, and middle class; they live in the Western United States or just across the border in Canada; when they travel, they go to Vegas or Oregon or Seattle, never to Alberta or New York (forget about Japan or Madagascar); they all talk and think in some variation of semi-ironic, simile-heavy, pop-referencing Coupland-speak; their themes are sudden loss, pointless death, loneliness, running away, and vague dread, even from the afterlife; their tales often start strong and then slowly vaporize rather than coming to a strong conclusion. Clanking devices indeed.Somehow, though, I don't care. His novels are better than his non-fiction, which (while entertaining) feels dashed-off, undisciplined, and improperly researched. In fiction, he takes advantage of those same tendencies to write with a strange propulsion, even when his characters are doing nothing but sitting and thinking. The stories are short but dense. His eye for detail evokes the true feelings of a place. Even his weakest books, such as &quot;Shampoo Planet,&quot; &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma,&quot; and &quot;Miss Wyoming,&quot; have something to say, although neither the reader nor the writer might know exactly what that is.&quot;Hey Nostradamus!,&quot; from 2003, is an extreme example. It takes place almost entirely in North and West Vancouver, and revolves around kids in high school, and what becomes of them and their families. There are many deaths, some deserved, some uncertain, some shockingly random. It's about people who want to change themselves, but can't. Only one of the four major characters does change, and only far too late, when he's irrelevant to everyone to whom it would matter.And yet, there at the end of the book, I nearly cried. I think it's Coupland's best written work since &quot;Microserfs&quot; a decade ago. Go read it."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I thought this book was a return to form for Coupland as many of the other reviewer's here have mentioned. I had been a bit disappointed by the last few Coupland books but was blown out of the water by this one. It's closer in spirit to &quot;Girlfriend in a Coma&quot; and is one of the more spiritual books he has written. Unlike Vernon God Little, another &quot;Columbine-ish&quot; book, &quot;Hey Nostradamus!&quot; made me care about the characters and I really felt for them. The book's palatable sense of loss and pain will leave you thinking for a long time.&quot;God is nowhere/God is now here&quot; - whether or not you believe in God, this book will make you think again about your place in the world, what you believe in and what you hold dear. An excellent book !"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"While I have enjoyed Douglas Coupland's novels in the past, I just have to say that I was disappointed with \\"Hey Nostradamus!\\" All of the characters were fascinating. With the exception of Cheryl (who dies too soon for significant change) they develop like real people, and are wholly believable. When they do something incredibly unexpected (hello Barb!) it doesn't seem like a simple plot requirement, but a deeper understanding into the character's psyche. Unfortunately this fascinating novel with excellent promise, peters off about halfway into Heather's section, the second one from the end. After Jason's disappearance I was left wondering where the plot went. I think it was an excellent opportunity for more character development, but in the end that isn't enough to carry the novel. And when it so suddenly ends the reader is left grasping for closure. I understand that the characters are left without closure, but that doesn't make the readers enjoy it any more.Additionally the wry humor that I associate with Coupland was virtually absent, particularly in the last third of the novel. Without even a hint of humor to lighten the emotional burden, I felt just as bleak as Heather and Reg, and even sort of wondered why I continued to read.Anyway, if you are obsessed with character development, and find plot and conclusion secondary, you will love \\"Hey Nostradamus!\\" But if you are looking for some ultimate meaning, and something that isn't so much of a downer, go back to number one and read \\"Microserfs\\"."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I can't decide how I feel about this book. It kept me reading, and it was interesting. It was technically well-written. After I finished, I was still thinking about the book and the characters for a few days. Still, I can't help but feel there was something missing. Like the characters needed more development, or the story needed to add up to more.A quick summary: this book is a story about a school shooting in a Vancouver suburb and how it affects people. The story is broken into four sections. The first part is told by Cheryl, a student at the school, and it's set on the day of the shooting. The second section is narrated by Jason, who was a student at the school, and is still suffering over ten years later. The third part is by Heather, Jason's girlfriend, and the fourth is by Reg, his dad.The first half of the book is interesting. The second half sometimes seems superfluous. It's still interesting, but Heather's part of the book has nothing to do with the shooting, and it seems like a digression."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Well, Hmm...I just finished this novel and I'm not sure what I thought. I didn't like a lot, but I certainly didn't dislike it. This was nowhere near as bad as Shampoo Planet (which Coupland himself admits was not a winner). However, the spiritual elements that worked so well in Girlfriend in Coma (which this reminded of at times) and Life After God (I book I loved) are the main focus here, but they don't always work. The story is interesting and the format highly couplandesque. I admired the characters' ability to try and understand and change, but something was missing for me. Perhaps I did not connect to these people (also something of an issue in his last novel, All Families...but that at least was one big lark). Anyway, lots of people have loved this book. I still love Coupland after having read 6 of books, I'll be in line for the next."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I, too, have read all of Coupland's books. The book opens with a tragic massacre of a young girl, but it's those around her who survive the incident that suffer the most. After it, no one can figure out how to carry on their lives. Then again, the characters in this book didn't seem to be carrying on much of a life prior to the incident.Coupland's common theme of tragedy bringing realization to his characters falls short in this book. As a fan of Coupland, I was of course moved by the book, but I don't think non-Coupland fans would be altered in such a way. It's a book I *really* wanted to love, but ending up only liking it. If you're a fan, read it. If you're looking for a Coupland classic, start with Microserfs, Girlfriend in a Coma, or Generation X."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"\\"Hey Nostradamus\\" is a book about the aftermath -- and to a certain extent theprelude -- of a high school massacre in which 3 teenage malcontentskill lots of students until they are stopped by Jason, the boy-friend(and secretly the teen-husband) of one of the murdered teens. jason killsone of the mudereders. Another is then killed by the crowd of teens;the first had quailed after the first round of slaughter, so his twoaccomplices had killed him. The saviour is then falsely accused of having been an accomplice, and though soon exonerated legally, remains under thecloud of suspicion for the rest of his troubled, alcoholic life. The storyis told through four voices -- that of the teen-bride, Cheryl, Jason, Jason'slater partner Heather, and Jason's father Reg. But all 4 voices are one,and I suspect this is not entirely intentional (because there are signs-- unsuccessful -- of trying to give them distinct flavors), althoughthe book's moral is that we are all sinners as well as victims, no oneworse than the other, if you look close enough. God is on trial here,in a variety of flavors of spirituality and anti-spirituality. There isan attempt at a redemptive message -- mainly via the father, Reg, by farthe least credible character, who is portrayed first as a despotic anddestructive moralitarian, greeting his son's heroism, with the accusationof having become a murderer. (He does not mean the accomplice theory! Hemeans Jason killed somebody; so he had homicide in his heart!) Reg, weare to believe, eventually admits to himself that he was a religiousfraud of some sort, and he becomes human as just about all the otherdramatis personae self-destruct. Actually, there are no other dramatispersonae: they are each just variants of Jason's -- probably the author's-- perplexity about human suffering and frailty. No real resolutionhere, just some moments that succeed in evoking the human condition --and others that fail. I have not read anything else by Douglas Coupland, butI suspect that his sense of humor and his keen ear for trends would be bettertrained on a less morbid theme, because he does not really seem to haveany new light to shed on this one. -- Istvan Hesslein"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I am a big fan of Douglas Coupland, but I found Hey Nostradamus! rather disappointing. It definitely had its moments, but for the most part was aimless and pointless, and seemed like he was just trying to meet a deadline and hurry and get the book finished. He did finish it, but with no apparent ending. If you haven't read any of his books, I would highly recommend NOT starting with this one. Try Generation X, Girlfriend in a Coma or Microserfs instead. Maybe his next effort will be better."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This book starts out exactly as a Coupland novel should; with a massacre in a high-school cafeteria. Unfortunately, Coupland kills off the most likeable character in the first chapter, and the rest of the book kind of struggles from that point to find a stable footing, never quite accomplishing it.\\"Hey, Nostradamus\\" is readable enough, with echoes of \\"Girlfriend in a Coma,\\" as Cheryl's family and friends try to find meaning in the message of her demise. However, I came to the end wishing she'd just woken up to answer some of the questions and heal some of the broken lives.Coupland chooses to end with the least sympathetic of the four protagonists, and I thought this was a mistake. Really, if I'd put it down after Cheryl's segment, I might have been content. After Jason's, maybe still. Beyond that, the thread that pulled this book along was never quite re-connected, and my patience, at least, was gone.If you're new to Coupland, stick with Girlfriend in a Coma, for the same teeny-bopper angst and time-travel elements, drawn together in a much more optimistic, philosophical, and cohesive way. If you're a fan looking for your next fix, well, go ahead and buy it, but this probably won't be your new favourite.*** POSTSCRIPT ON RE-READING A FEW MONTHS LATER ***On re-reading this book, I decided it wasn't a bad thing to end with Reg, the unsympathetic father character. A strange thing, perhaps, and highly unexpected. Yet Coupland writes it well and pulls it off. I still like Girlfriend in a Coma better, but this is a worthy new novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Just finished the book. I've read everything he's ever written. The last few have seemed to struggle..He's such an effective story teller. I love the situations he creates, but he always falls apart somewhere around the end. I was riveted to this book. Hooked from page one. By the end of the third section I was angry, cause I knew he'd drop off again...On the inside cover of the book it describes this as people 'Wrestling with their spirituality'. He should figure out his spirituality before it ruins his career as a writer. Too much on the God thing. If your a Coupland fan, you may want to reconsider rushing out and buying this, simply because it has his name on it. Hey Doug! Relax!...Get confession out of the way, and come on back to the group!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This is an iteration of the New Testament, and it works much better than the original. The book's main character, Jason, performs a miraculous act during a school shooting, motivated by his love for his secret wife Cheryl. He's despised by a community that thinks he may be responsible for the tragedy, in which he saves many of his peers but loses Cheryl. Jason is also betrayed by a group of fanatical church-going friends, many of whom survive the tragedy, ironically called Youth Alive!Jason's ultra-religious father Reg represents Lucifer, who in the Bible was cast out of paradise because he thought he rivaled God. Youth Alive!, Reg, and Jason's brother Kent, a Youth Alive! leader, believe that they are the righteous ones, and react in different ways to Jason's miraculous deed...Jason is either ignored, envied, or crucified by them when it appears that God had chosen Jason as his favorite. As other characters take the story's reigns, the typically silent Jason is shown to be more Christ-like than those who pay lip service to God for their own ends, and he ultimately delivers paradise to Reg, who thought he'd been pointing the way for Jason all along.This is a brave effort by D.C., who has no doubt already heard from detractors who'd claim to have a party line to God themselves. I am glad he told this story, perhaps a few misanthropic religious zombies in the audience will read, learn, and rejoin the living."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I've been hearing about Coupland for years but this is the first time I've actually read him. I found the writing interesting and the storyline compelling. I enjoyed the thoughtfulness and introspection. The plot twists were fun. I must say, however, as one who has been fairly active in conservative Christian churches in Western Canada (primarily the Vancouver area) for most of my life, that the characterization of Christians was pretty far off the mark. The pathetic \\"Christians\\" in Coupland's story don't resemble anyone or any church I've ever been associated with. Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to a healthy critique, even of my own attempts to know God, but this was stereotyping, plain and simple. I'd expect better from someone of Coupland's literary reputation.Still, a pretty good read!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"My fav Copeland book is still \`Microserfs' despite its inevitable dating, but that's cos I work in IT and it's all so true!Nonetheless I really enjoyed this book, in what I regard as a return to form for Copeland. It's packed with insights, investigations and thumbnail homilies. The little gems that hold time still and examine life or self for a moment or two, before releasing hold and letting the story fly free once more. The book is structured in 4 unequal parts told in the voices of Cheryl, Jason, Heather and Reg. Cheryl & Jason's parts have over 10 years between them, but Jason, Heather & Reg altogther have only 3-4.With such a Copeland-type story, it is about many things. Themes such as religion, loneliness, love, nature vs nuture, rage, the randomness of life, and the human condition are built into the story of how many, many lives are affected by a cataclysmic event - in this case the gunning down of students in their high school cafeteria by 3 fellow students, and the impact that has on students, their families and those that are in their lives long after the event. The strongest voice is Jason's, both because he has the longest section, and because the event had such an impact on him for so many years.It's a strong story, without being preachy. It raises many questions and doesn't provide many answers. Like Cheryl's stroll to her car that morning, it provides a brief moment of perfect clarity of vision, even as in the next moment it can be incredibly sad. Such is life, death, religion, family, loss, and the awful things that human beings can do to each other. Those little trueisms can be comforting, or a hard reflective mirror.Very accessible, very readable - a book that will touch you, move you, but perhaps most tellingly, make you think."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I was a bit unsure about this one at first. I've loved Coupland since the Gen X/Shampoo Planet days, but was most underwhelmed by Ms. Wyoming and All Families. But Hey Nostradamus! is fabulous. Coupland gives us a handfull of characters, each one more imperfect than the next and all of them you can care about, especially Jason. This is one of his best."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I wish this book was longer. It stayed with me long after I finished it.

WONDERFUL!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Coupland once again creates a soul-crushing and yet hyper-real psychocosm that forces the reader to dive head into a world of tragedy and inescapable dilemma. The characters that are fabricated in this web of relationships and death force the reader to care about the people contained herein. They can't escape, and neither can you."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Cheryl and Jason, in order to remain faithful to God, delay sex until they are secretly married at age seventeen. Their church youth group condemns the two, believing they are fornicating. Then Cheryl is killed during a massacre at their school and dies in Jason's arms. For about two weeks, Jason is blamed for the school shootings. Although he is found innocent by the police, many people still believe he is guilty.The first part of this novel is penned by Cheryl after she dies, trying to understand her life, God, death, her marriage and other issues.Jason's story takes place ten years later when he struggles with his life. He's never recovered from losing Cheryl, his terrible relationship with his parents or his loss of faith. Cheryl's parents and brother write to Jason about their remorse from losing Cheryl. The three letters contain widely differing accounts of their lives at the time of the massacre and now.Part three, by Heather, tells of her relationship with Jason and having to deal with his sudden disappearance. Part four is from the viewpoint of Jason's father, Reg, who had been a hypocritical, legalistic religious nutcase. He becomes a likeable person finally.The characters seem alive and easy to care about. They face battles every human feels. Their actions and how they do or don't resolve issues keeps readers intrigued.The story gently condemns fake Christianity instead of the real relationship with Jesus that keeps us loving God and others. If you appreciate Christian novels that are well-crafted, you'll enjoy this story."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I read this book for the second time, and it still has all the bitter charm and morbidity of a real disaster. I was sucked into the text upon my second reading and ended up reading it in two days. Then again I may be biased for my collection of books is heavy on the Coupland."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This is a story about high school massacre in Vancouver in 1988 and how that massacre affected various characters in the novel, at least on the surface. More than this story being about a cause and effect play by play of an unfortunate event, it is about how people deal with situations with faith and the difference between religion and spirituality. Before I get ahead of myself here I would like to say that this book is not at all preachy, nor is it accusatory or abrasive. It is not so much a book about religion as it is a book about how people act when being 'religious' or not, and what that actually means. Each of the main characters in turn display a fervent belief and then a denial or realization that what they once believed may not be what they supposed it to be. Some people may not want to read this book because it has religion in it, and to those under that category I say that you will not be offended and will enjoy the book. To those who may read the book because it is about religion I want to say that it is more about individual interpretation and potentially exploitation for personal gain than it is a celebration of any faith, and you may be offended at some parts, but not deeply.The novel told through the eyes of four people, and each person was strongly impacted by the narrator before him or her. The story begins with two high school sweethearts, Cheryl and Jason, who love each other immensely and get secretly married (both because they love each other and because they want to have sex without committing a sin). Cheryl, the first narrator, became religious because she liked Jason and he was very religious (because of family reasons), but she soon come to strongly associate with the faith personally and throughout her segment of the story she speaks only to god, and we the audience over hear her prayers. Then one day a couple of youths from their high school hijack the school cafeteria with a couple of guns and kill some people, one of those people being Cheryl. Jason comes in to save her at the last minute and kills one of the terrorists, but is too late to save Cheryl.Jason is the next narrator and we come into his life several years after the tragedy. Though Jason was seemingly religious in high school, he was so because of his father's fervent, almost nervous devotion to religion. His father was a very judgmental man and Jason could never seem to do anything quite good enough to satisfy him. After the massacre it was rumoured that Jason had planned the entire thing, and of course a majority of the town believed it. Even after he was proved innocent by the law and was named a hero by some of the papers his father could only see the fact that he'd killed a boy, no matter how many lives he might have saved in the process. Jason's account is very bitter in some places. The world had not been kind to him and he could not move on. Unlike the other narrators, Jason's account doesn't largely deal with his own personal relationship with religion. He talks more about how others relationships with religion have affected him, and how even though he isn't religious himself, he still falls back on some of the institutional rituals followed by people who believe.The next narrator is named Heather, a woman who enters a sort of awkward relationship with and eventually marries Jason. Jason disappears shortly after her segment begins, and Heather deals with a psychic named Allison who seems to be in contact with Jason on some sort of spiritual level. This segment was interesting for me because it made me reflect on how people in contemporary, secular society seem to find pathways to express some sort of religious behaviour. Obviously believing in a psychic being able to contact individuals is a reflection of faith on some level. But more than the whole psychic thing, what was interesting to observe was Heather's behaviour and relationship with her desire to contact this person. Her need at these times were, while completely devoid of religion, were still strongly tied to faith. And what's more is I could associate her behaviour to what I've seen people feel while in a romantic relationship, or while at work, or studying, etc. That almost feverish desire is present in many aspects of life, not just religion, and that calls into question where one can draw the line between faith and religion. Or where one can start to separate faith and spirituality. Religion has a very defined identity in pop culture, and if you're not a card carrying member, the idea of it can be very unattractive. But how many of our day to day hopes and dreams and actions could be classified by an outsider as being likened to what we classify religious action? Just something to think about.The last narrator is Jason's father, Reg. We hear many tales of this man throughout the novel, most of them unflattering. So by the time we get to hear him speak there is already a sort of prejudice against the man. Reg's account is more of a reflection than it is a narration or a tale recounted. He speaks of his faith, but in a refreshing way that I will not go into detail about.I listened to this book aurally and I really enjoyed the voice actors. I thought the people chosen were well suited to their roles and were a pleasure to listen to. Overall this was a good book and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"This is one of my favorite novels. It's the most poignant book of Coupland's I've read.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I was really surprised at how disappointed I was with this book after seeing all of the positive feedback it had gotten. The book started off great, and about the last 40 pages just kind of bored me. I suggest reading the first two chapters and skipping the rest."},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"Douglas Coupland is an amazing writer and Hey Nostradamus! is more proof of his greatness. This book touches upon many different aspects of life, ranging from tragedy, false accusations, religious fanatics and hypocrites.

It went on and on and on and on and didn't really have much of a point except to say that mass killing of teenagers ruins a lot of lives which isn't exactly a big epiphany though. I found Cheryl to be a big phony, Jason was depressed yet extremely self-centred, and Heather was just a very insecure person who needed intensive therapy to help her see that she deserved to be treated well and shouldn't stay with people who can't possibly meet her needs.THis was just a book about a bunch of messed up people who continue to mess up their lives and then mess up the lives of everyone around them.It had tragic overtones, obviously, just mostly I thought it was just pathetic.I did NOT like it! Coupland could write better than this!!!"},{"Title":"Hey Nostradamus!","review":"I read this for a book club. The reviews here and the jacket blurb intrigued me. The jacket blurb was the best writing I found between these covers.The characters are two-dimensional and interchangable. Their prose and dialogue is the same no matter who's speaking. No one was developed well enough for me to care what happened to them and each narrator was more sanctimonius and vapid than the last.The dialogue is incredibly bad. No one talks like this, especially not the teenagers in part one (narrated by Cheryl).Each character preached at me and, given their choices in their cardboard lives, I didn't appreciate it. I expected it from Reg but from Jason? And from Cheryl? I read her section eagerly, looking forward to watching her die, terrible as that sounds.What would have helped this story was focus on... anything, really. There are scenes and plotlines that begin and go nowhere. The key to this book could have been the fathers/sons: Reg, Jason, Kent, the twins and Cheryl's unborn child. In his section, Reg says that Jason can never know his pain, having never been a father. That's all the attention the subject is given and all we can do is bristle and read the few remaining pages. Meanwhile readers know this isn't the case. But we don't get a great enough sense of this being the key to Jason's life, we don't care and subsequently what could have been an interesting aspect of the story from a literary standpoint is wasted.On the good side, it's a quick read b/c there's little to think about and nothing to challenge the reader.There's a reason this book is out of print."},{"Title":"Caring for the Dead","review":"I read this book with no expectations. What a pleasant surprise it was. It is very stylized and descriptive. The author uses metaphors and humorous observations to express God's most important (and forgotten) messages. It is rare to read a book these days with characters that are more unique than what I see in any summer blockbuster movie. Caring for the dead makes the effort to be better than that--and it succeeds."},{"Title":"Caring for the Dead","review":"As I read this book I realized how our selfishness can drive us away from others that we love.

Because you know, sometimes nothing illumintaes perversion more than normality. There is nothing like candor to make us wish we never knew intimacy and in &quot;Watching The Body Burn&quot; there are many such regrets. When I run the world, this book will be required reading for all writers as he is simply one of the most compelling prose stylest outside of Kate Braverman I have ever read. I wish he was my mom and told me stories at night but I would probably grow up so totally twisted I would appear normal again."},{"Title":"Frank Stella's Moby-Dick: Words and Shapes.(Book Review): An article from: Leviathan","review":"Moby Dick and Frank Stella are both American classics. And in this book the author provides a thorough, informative and stimulating analysis of the Frank Stella &quot;Moby Dick&quot; series wherein Stella produced at least one interpretive art piece for every chapter of Herman Melville's classic novel. This is probably the most insightful description I have read for how a modern, abstract artist goes about putting his pieces together, what the artist is thinking, what the artist is attempting to communicate and how those thoughts are reflected in the abstract lines, shapes, colors and symbols. I have to admit that at times I didn't get all of the points that the author was making however this is to be expected when providing analysis of an abstract artist's interpretation of a challenging novel like Moby Dick. All in all, a must read for lovers of great fiction and/or modern art."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"\\"Ender's Game\\" by Orson Scott Card is one of my all-time favorites. And I thoroughly enjoyed all the sequels. I consider him one of the finest science fiction writers of all time. Little did I suspect that he has also written excellent historical fiction.\\"Saints\\" (first published way back in 1984) begins in Manchester, England, in 1829, in the midst of the horrors of the industrial revolution. A family falls on hard times and you quickly get caught up in their day-to-day struggles for survival. But no sooner do you think you are reading a latter-day version of Dickens, then the Latter Day Saints appear. Young Dinah Kirkham and her mother and brother convertto Mormonism and emigrate to America -- extraordinary events that the author makes seem inevitable, from his thorough build-up of the characters and their circumstances. Dinah becomes the focus of the book, which follows her from age 10 to age 100, marrying Joseph Smith, and later Brigham Young. She becomes so real, so believable, so necessary to the history of the Mormon Church, that when you are done reading the novel, you'll be impelled to do one Google search after another, looking for evidence that such a woman really lived. The author also succeeds remarkably in making the strangest beliefs and practices of the Mormon Church -- including polygamy -- seem natural and inevitable: psychologically \\"true\\"."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I normally read Card for his science fiction and fantasy, so I expected to be rather uninterested in Saints. Also, I am not religious at all, and books which focus on religion tend not to interest me. However, even though it took me a while to get into it, I completely loved this book. I was willing to completely accept and believe in the religious views of all of the characters, and become completely absorbed in the story. Orson Scott Card does in Saints what he does in all of his science fiction and fantasy-- he tells a story you believe, about characters you truly feel for, who become, in some way, a part of your life. If you are a fan of Card, this book is worth reading, even if you normally only read science fiction or fantasy."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"\\"Saints\\" is a novelization of the life of one of the wives of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter-day Saints (the Mormons). The book follows Dinah from her childhood of poverty and misery in England through her involvement in the early Mormon movement in the United States. Card manages to make it seem plausible that a smart, tough, self-reliant woman like Dinah could accept Mormon \\"plural marriage.\\" The one part of her life that I didn't fully understand was Dinah's conversion to Mormonism in the first place, which is, of course, crucial to the story.I was fascinated by Card's characterization of Joseph Smith. You can't quite decide whether he's a raving egomaniac on a power trip or whether he truly believes he's heard the voice of God and is determined to be faithful no matter how difficult it may be or how crazy God's commands may seem. Or maybe it's some of each. It seems to me that a lot of strong religious leaders are like this, and maybe there's no sure way to tell what's really motivating them. Card also leaves open the interpretation of Dinah's treatment of her children: Is it a painful but necessary consequence of acting faithfully, or an inexcusable abdication of responsibility, or some of each?\\"Saints\\" is an engaging story and a powerful study of the faithful life. Also recommended: \\"Stone Tables,\\" Card's novelization of the life of Moses."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"Card is never better than when writing from the heart. This book would seem to be the definitive proof of that theory. The levels of this book, its range and versatility, amaze me every time I read it. If you know Card from his science fiction, you will be rewarded by reading this. The characterization, plot, and story are up to his usual high standards. (If you fall into that group, and have no prior knowledge of the Church of Latter-Day Saints, you may find here an introduction to the subtext running through much of his work.)Some have criticized this book for its irreverent look at the founders of the Church. To them I would reply that reading this book helped bring me back to the Church. Reading it was like sitting at a grandparent's knee and learning my own history. I felt moved to borrow a copy of the Book of Mormon from an astonished childhood friend and re-read it. I loved reading about Dinah, but more than anything I was moved by Card's portrait of Joseph Smith. I think his story, and his vision, are even more powerful when viewed through the context of his humanity. The Prophet was a man, with a singular vision, a marvelous sense of purpose, and a miraculous relationship with God. In this book, Card reminded me of these things, and in so doing, helped give me a deeper understanding of my faith. Even if I am the only reader to be moved in this way, I would say that my return to my faith makes a bit of irreverence well worth the price."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I was looking for a book by Orson Scott Card (having never read one before) and this was the only one available at the library that day.I imagine most people looking for this book are either OSC fans or Mormons (or interested in Mormons.) Not only have I never read any other Orson Scott Card, but I also am not a Mormon and know very little aside from the bare basics about the rise of the Mormon religion. However, as one who enjoys historical fiction, in that regard I am qualified to give an opinion.As a piece of historical fiction, the book is very well-written, with attention to details and his characters are complicated and true to themselves, seeming not to be re-hashings of characters created centuries ago, and not simply having the motivation of propelling the story. The book seems written to deceive - or at least blur the lines between fiction and reality, making you wonder how much if the story is indeed true, how many of these people did in fact exist.The book is essentially in two parts. The first half tells the story of the Kirkham family and the odds they face - the father deserting them to fend for themselves in lives of poverty in 1820's Manchester, the three children each finding their own destiny, the eldest son rising to prominent engineer through his own sweat and determination, the youngest son having successes handed to him thanks to his family's endurances, and daughter Dinah struggling to be an independent woman in a society ruled by men.At the midpoint of the book, the family is split over the arrival of Mormons, one of whom converts half the family in one night. Any true believer has to go to America to build the new city, so half the family wrenches itself from the other half, tearing mothers from children and brothers from sisters and husband from wife in a heartbreaking time all due to conversion.In the second half of the book, the author examines the struggle of accepting and living with the Mormon principle of polygamy, called plural wives or celestial marriage. At no time did I truly understand the concept as they did, but it was engaging to me to try to understand how this crept up and sustained itself (and against what threats, inside and outside the Mormon city.) Dinah, the heroine of the story, falls in love with Joseph Smith, founder and leader of the Mormon faith, and he has already secretly taken a few other wives. Dinah is friends with Joseph's first wife, Emma, who does not approve of &quot;celestial marriage&quot; and so is in the dark about Joseph's other marriages. Once the cat starts to come out of the bag, Dinah becomes a vocal advocate of &quot;celestial marriage&quot;, even convincing her brother Charlie's wife to give Charlie her own sister to marry as a second wife.I did not feel that the author was trying to convert the reader or defend a principle, only to investigate how it is possible that a strong and independent woman could advocate polygamy, and how the advent of the new idea might have arisen and been accepted into a society of people we might recognize if we had been there to see them."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"If you read Orson Scott card for his Science fiction, I admit this is probably not the book for you. But I read him for his depth of character and skill for telling a story of epic proportions. I am not Mormon, but I love a good historical tale and I was so intrigued with this story that I actually searched out a Mormon to see how true it was! To learn that there is much actual history to this story only gratifies me more. Dinah, the main character, became like a sister to me and I rejoiced and remorsed with her. She taught me a lot of things about strength of will and even had some &quot;magical&quot; talents like many other of Card's characters. I abhor polygamy, but for Dinah I was willing to suspend even this hatred of that patriarchal institution. When we watch any movie or read any fiction, we go into it expecting to supend disbelief as long as the artistry is there. With Orson Scott Card in Saints, the artistry is definitely there. I've read this book twice, and once more to go over the really great parts."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I had already read the first two &quot;Alvin&quot; books by Card when I found Saints. This book was an amazing read. I suspended the rest of my life to complete it. I am a strong Christian though not a Mormon. I don't think a reader's religious preference should take away from what a marvelous job Card does creating believable characters and a story based on historical facts. I think it is fascinating to learn where the roots of religious convictions come from. It helps us to better love each other no matter what we believe."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I loved this book! I have read it three times now, and each time find something new to enjoy about it. I had to laugh at the reviewer who found it somewhat unsettling for non-Mormons. I think that it's probably more unsettling for Mormons, due to the characterization of some of the early church leaders. However, I actually enjoyed the way Card gave these people human qualities. They may have been prophets, but they were also people, and nobody's perfect. In fact, it was the reality of these particular characters that made me love the book so much in the first place. I also enjoyed the way he had his characters deal with the issue of polygamy. Card has taken a very difficult practice for church members to understand, on an emotional level, and given some perspective as to why people chose to participate in it. This book is not for everyone, though. If you are a Mormon who thinks The Work and the Glory by Gerald Lund is the definitive novelization of early Church history, this is not for you. But if you are open to a somewhat more realistic approach to that era, you will enjoy Saints. And if you are a non-Mormon looking for an interesting historical fiction, again, this is for you."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I know a lot of Orson Scott Card fans will be out of their comfort zone reading this book. Well, so be it. I think it is a magnificent introduction to the history of the Mormon church. Other reviewers have criticized it for not having enough \\"lovable\\" characters.How \\"lovable\\" are real people? That's who you feel you have gotten to know in this book. Fictional characters mingle with historical characters, and Card has been honest enough to make them ALL as complicated as people really are. Joseph Smith is not portrayed as a sinless martyr, he is portrayed as a human being, with human failings. This doesn't take away from his great accomplishments -- his accomplishments are so great precisely BECAUSE he was fallible.And the character of Dinah is a triumph. Perhaps her strength of character isn't \\"lovable\\" to some. But for those of us who look for well-rounded, realistic female characters in books, Dinah is GREAT! She is independent, strong willed, and follows the strength of her convictions even when it means personal sacrifice. She is symbolic of the many real women who joined the Mormon church despite severe persecution.\\"Saints\\" is a long book and a complicated book. It is not a \\"light read.\\" But it is a WORTHWHILE read -- and will also give you some insight into Orson Scott Card not only as a writer but as a member of this uniquely American church, the Church of Latter-Day Saints. (Hence the title.)"},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I know some readers have been disturbed by certain scenes in this book. I can't imagine why, unless they would be disturbed by historical nonfiction about the same time period, since everything that happens is essentially historically accurate, albeit with fictionalized characters. Orson Scott Card has said (I'm paraphrasing from &quot;A Storyteller in Zion&quot;) that he wanted to write a book that would be accessible to any reader, without the reader having to decide whether to personally believe in the same faith as the characters, as long as the reader understood that the characters themselves absolutely believed in the truthfulness of mormonism. I think he succeeded, and personally, as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I finished the book with my own faith strengthened, not diminished. Also, its nice to read an LDS Novel in which the early leaders of the church talk and act like real life human beings, as I'm sure they really did, instead of sounding like every word they ever spoke, even in casual conversation, was prepared beforehand for public oration and inclusion in the journal of discourses."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"Shipped fast and the best deal I found on this book Could buy from this seller again.Best price I found by far on this book, shipping reasonable.This was a present.

It's not even that I have a minimal opinion about the Mormon faith. I just couldn't get into this book. I meandered along during the first half, mildly interested in the characters. However, when they turned to the Mormon faith, the book lost me from there. How could a family who had been through so much be taken in so readily and easily? As I skimmed the last parts, I discovered I didn't miss much. The heroine is coarse--I never could love her, feel sorry for her, or identify with her. I couldn't even dislike her. The male characters are clumsy and dull, the storyline is rather boring. Even the love affair between the Prophet and the heroine lacks depth. I couldn't really believe such an uptight, &quot;strong&quot;, silent woman would fall for his &quot;visions&quot; and &quot;voices&quot; from God (in other words, his lies).

Instead, he tells the story of the early history of his church as he understands it: its ugly truth is no more ugly than that of the start of other religions, and far less ugly and cleaner than most.If you love Card, then read this book after you have read the memory of earth series.

I am a practicing Latter-Day Saint and did not know what to expect when this 600 page tomb showed up in the mail. However, I got into the book right away and found it difficult to put down once I got started. Cards' characters draw the reader right in.In many ways, this book is a triumph of characterization. You will fall in love with the Kirkham family and even forgive some of the family members who make some bad choices because you can understand WHY they make them. The characters in this book just feel real. In addition, Card perfectly captures what it would have been like to grow up in the early 1800s and join the Mormon church. He covers the difficulties inherent in leaving family members behind and how difficult it would have been for God-fearing people to adopt the practice of Polygamy. I've done quite a bit of a research regarding Mormon history and I did not find one false note in the novel. In fact, I had to keep reminding myself that it was only fiction, which to me is the hallmark of superb writing.If you are not Mormon, you may want to pass this one up, unless you are interested in reading about early Mormon history and the plight of the laborers in England during the industrial revolution.If you are a Mormon, however, and want to better understand the early Saints, be sure to buy this book. I got more out of it than reading a dozen biographies. No one can write such interesting, flawed yet loveable characters like Card. And you will definitely enjoy the journey he takes you on."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I like this book.I first read this book years ago, and thought it was a biographical novel. It isn't. Dinah Kirkham is not and was not a real person, but rumor has it that her life was based on events in the lives of early LDS women :-)The characters are believable and realistic. I like them, even the ones I hate, because they seem so human:Joseph Smith is portrayed in a very human form -- he gets mad, he's scared of his wife, he is ornery and cantankerous as well as compassionate and understanding. I still think he was a lecher, whether or not he was a prophet.Dinah is portrayed so well, it's hard to believe that a) she is fiction; or b) that she was created by a man.What happened to the Mormons was a huge blot on the American landscape. Harried for political reasons, murdered (again, politics), denied First Amendments rights. An aside: Utah Territory allowed women to vote, but they were told that if they wanted to become a State, they had to revoke that right. This book uses the harrassment as historical background, but it doesn't really focus on it.It's the kind of book that I will re-read, because it reads as real.I plan on visiting Nauvoo when I finish the book again. I now live about 35 miles north, on the Iowa side of the Mississippi (you're not missing much). And I'm Buddhist, if anyone cares.Anyhow, I found this an enjoyable read and I guess I was kind of disappointed to realize that there is no diary of Dinah Kirkham hiding in the Great Salt Lake temple. But you have to wonder what is hiding there."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"Read this book.Taken from the journals of the author's own Grandmother, Dinah Kirkham, this is a fascinating tale of the early days of the Mormon church, and what went on in the hearts of the people who lived it.English born Dinah Kirkham, abandoned by her father, abused by her employer, forced into marriage by a tyranical older brother, Dinah yearns for the face of the man who looks like God.Forced to choose between her children, the husband she cannot love, and her conscience, Dinah's story is a riveting drama of human emotions and the strength we find to follow our hearts.Have you ever wondered how polygamy worked among the Saints? This is the only book you need to read. Informative, but not with dry statistics, this book takes you down into the hearts and souls of those who lived it.You will not be dissapointed. I read this book over and over, it helps me understand people, but especially men and women relations.This book is called Saints, but it tells the human side of a people striving for something better.I say it again, you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I am a Mormon and I found it to be a curious &quot;fiction&quot; of our early leaders. Card takes liberty with dialouge and thoughts, but is mostly true to character.

This is understandably not written for the non-Mormon audience."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"For describing the hardships of the Mormon pioneers, Saints is way up on the number one list with the series &quot;The Work and the Glory&quot;.

Every avid reader who enjoys historical fiction should definitely invest in Saints."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I was captivated by the characters. The historical background is presented in a way that makes you feel as if you are standing right there. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"Most Mormons will love this book, and non-Mormons will find it a compelling read. In many ways, this might be Card's best book, Ender's Game notwithstanding. The story begins with Dinah's father abandoning his family in 1820-1830's Manchester, England. Card provides a vivid portrayal of the early Industrial Revolution, with all its poverty and abuses. Dinah and her family survive and even prosper when her brother succeeds in designing and building a new railroad locomotive. Dinah is forced to marry and is now a respectable mother of two. Then she meets Heber C. Kimball (a real character), who with Brigham Young and other early Mormon leaders are on a mission to England (true story). She is converted and vows to join the Saints in Nauvoo, Illinois (about 1840 or so). There she meets Joseph Smith and becomes a plural wife (fictional).The events in Nauvoo are accurate, and it is hard to remember that Dinah herself is fictional (though suspiciously similar to another famous Mormon woman, Eliza R. Snow). Smith is portrayed accurately, as are the other non-fictional characters. The origin of polygamy in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and its cause and effects are historically true, as far as I know. I recommend this book to any lover of historical fiction. I also recommend this book to anyone curious about the origins of the LDS Church. This is a warts and all depiction of Smith in the Nauvoo period, and the best novelized portrayal of those historical events I have ever read."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"A history of the first Mormons. Told from the view of a woman who loved Joseph Smith. Issues of God, love, morality, polygamy and survival are all explored."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"Saints is an amazing read. I was taken in by the harshness of life in 19th century industrial England and by the difficult decisions these people made. It's not a religious-feel good piece of fiction. It will make you angry to read this human account of how laws, culture, and religion drove people to make extremely difficult decision. This book does not gloss over Mormon history. The depiction of historical characters are based on research and are not meant to test a Mormon's faith. They were people who had their weaknesses. Card presents them as people--not supernatural beings. If a Mormon really believes Joseph Smith and Brigham Young were prophets, they must realize they were imperfect mortals who faced tremendous challenges. This book did not weaken my beliefs, but reinforced the great odds these early Mormons were up against. It amazes me that this unlikely religion ever amounted to anything and now has over 14 million members across the world (not to mention two US presidential candidates)."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"Every character in this book is so well defined I feel now that I have known them personally. Many of Dinah's decisions are difficult to the extreme. Yet, I experienced both the pain and the joy with her. I noticed my mixed feelings as Card shows the integrity of multiple wives within the Mormon doctrine. Women who found themselves held within the clan of sister wives were significantly better off than the abandonment and condemnation of single women in the 1800's. The issue is not an easy one, but I learned a different orientation through Card's book. No doubt there were abuses of the doctrine. However, likely not different than infidelity in a monogamous relationship. Having said all this I found the story compelling. It was difficult to put the book down. Another winner for my all time favorite author, Orson Scott Card."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Orson Scott Card but 'Saints' is one of his better books. Call it a Mormon combination of L'Amour's 'Ride the River'(written from the prospective of a strong female) & Brown's 'DaVinci Code'(fictionalized history with a dash of conspracy theory). Will make you apprecieate the sacrifices of the early Mormons. I doubt it'll rock your world or have you racing to the nearest Mormon house of worship but you could do a lot worse."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"This is a topic that is already challenging enough for some of us who are descended from the early Mormon polygamists. As I continually grapple with my own understanding of this practice, I felt I was at a great disadvantage reading historical fiction--not knowing completely the fact from the fiction. I guess I had better make a trip to the archives myself!All I can say is that I hope my great-great whatever was kinder, more humble, and more lovable than any of the characters portrayed in this epic!"},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I am often ambivalent about OSC writing about Mormon Characters.I am sometimes troubled with the dichotomies of whether OSC is an intellectual Mormon, or a \\"Mormon Intellectual\\" some of you may know what I mean.\\"Saints\\" is a tale broken down in thirds, the first third being about the life of working poor in early 19th century England, fascinating gritty and moving as we follow the early life of the story's protagonist from early childhood abandonment by her father, to her abandonment of her own children because she feels compelled by God to join the Saints in Zion.The second third is about her reluctant pull into Polygamy in the early church history, her love and Marriage to the Prophet Joseph Smith until his martyrdom.The End of the tale deals with the Pioneering travails to Utah, and her life long battle defending the \\"principle\\" of Plural Marriage.\\"Saints\\" is a very interesting look at the history of early Mormonism, but one that may be hard on the uncommitted members of the Church. So am I glad I read \\"Saints\\"? Yes I am. Would I recommend it to others? Yes, but only sparingly. Or only with advice, I don't know which. One thing is clear, OSC has an immense knowledge of the early history of the Church, and I believe a great love for the Gospel as well, so I am not qualified to criticize this fascinating novel for over exposing the early histories of the Church, or the foibles of its members. It is true that if there is a general fault to find with Mormons, it is our tendency to remember history in a favorable light, and to many this tale may be seen as unfavorable. To me however, it just makes me grateful to live in the modern half of the latter-days.So bottom line is, if you want to see how hard life was for the early saints, and to understand the sacrifice entailed in the practice of Polygamy, this is an excellent book to feel the day to day stress in the formative years of the Church. For a look at what it is like to be a Mormon in a non Mormon town in Modern days, read \\"Lost Boys\\" and learn or remember who we are today. So, I guess the fact is I am not as conflicted about OSC as I am for the intelligence of others, so excuse my ramblings and read away, decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I have been an Orson Scott Card fan for many years. After a while it came to my attention that the only work of his that I had not actually read was one of his earlier works, &quot;Saints.&quot;Unlike the science fiction that makes up most of Card's bibliography, Saints was his first stab at historical/religious fiction. A life long Mormon, it is not surprising that Card decided to pick his faith for his first non-SF novel.The book is broken up into two parts. The first part takes place in 19th Century England following the misadventures of a down and out family. The book caries an almost Dickens's tone following the families downward spiral. Card is actually trying to create sympathy for his characters so that the reader will be more open to the second half of the book.Slowly, presumably after the reader is hooked, the family becomes involved with Mormon missionaries in England. After being converted, the family migrates to the U.S where they meet up with Joseph Smith and his followers.I must say, that as Card presents his Mormons in &quot;Saints,&quot; they are not a very loveable bunch. It is very hard to have any sympathy for the main character or for Joseph Smith. After a while, it becomes even hard to finish the book considering such a lack of identification. It seems as if Card is writing &quot;Saints&quot; in order to justify or reconcile the actions of the church founders in his own mind. This whole novel seems an attempt to convince himself that plural marriage and the actions of Joseph Smith were godly.&quot;Saints,&quot; despite it's flaws is a very important book in Card's progression. This is his first novel that manages decent characterization. Before this novel most of his characters were flat and unbelievable. Here, the characters are believable, just un-sympatheticIt is possible that Card was only able to surmount his inability to create deep, meaningful characterization by writing about a subject that is obviously very dear to him. His later books reflect this depth and growth.Be that as it may, he has never been so preachy and boorish! He attempts to build reader sentiment for his characters but the their actions prevent their identification as even decently misguided religious people. It is a grand drama filled with no heroes."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"First of all, I don't like the cover of this book. It's reminiscent of either a low-budget romance novel or maybe a low-budget western. And the title isn't very helpful either.So the only reason I even read the book was because I'm a big fan of the author's fantasy novels (Ender series, Alvin Maker series, etc.)Another weakness of the book, at least in terms of popular appeal,is it's setting in 19th century Mormon pioneer history, both in England &amp; in America. This setting for the story would hold interest for some, but could be boring or off-putting to others.But as you get into the story, and Card's character Dinah grows &amp; develops, the story just sparkles! His insights into human nature, and how his characters reveal their inner selves in response to life's challenges, are as sharp as a razor blade. The prose in this book is a true gem; the book begins: &quot;The day John Kirkham abandoned his family, he came home early from work. ....&quot; Card's characterization of the subtleties of the relationships between men &amp; women in the 19th century are particularly strong.The setting &amp; subject of this story are a bit off the beaten path, but the quality of the writing is so high, and the insights into human nature so keen, that you almost don't care; the setting could be anywhere &amp; this book would still hold your attention. When I hear the phrase &quot;don't judge a book by it's cover&quot;, this is the book I think of."},{"Title":"Saints","review":"I am relatively new to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints[Mormons]. I knew some of the &quot;Principle of Plural Marriage.&quot; This book helped to put the human aspect to it,to make it real.I felt almost every emotion possible as I read it.

I'm glad I did, but the book left me feeling a little put off, because it didn't seem to answer some of its own questions.Most of the questions this book attempts to address have to do with the Mormon practice of plural marriage. Even though there are echoes of his other works (dysfunctional families a la the Ribeiro family; a nearly word-for-word recitation of his short story \\"The Best Day\\"), the chief question that Card asks is \\"What *was* the practice of plural marriage?\\" Card seems to be partially at war with himself as he attempts to answer that question. In Prentice Alvin he comes out firmly on the side of Ockham's Razor: plural marriage is a way for a man to have sex with a lot of women, as Cavil Planter does with his slaves. But in \\"Saints\\" Card grapples with the issue and ultimately concludes that the determination of whether the practice was a product of lust or divine will can only be decided by those who lived it, in other words, those who lived it received revelations telling them to do it. Well, that may be the case, but it's an unsatisfactory answer for third parties such as ourselves, I think you'd agree. We're smart enough to look around at charismatic religious figures who want to screw with our reproduction, from Heaven's Gate's John Doe, to David Koresh to Jim Jones. Was Joseph Smith one of them? Card would have you believe that No, he wasn't. But he doesn't succeed in explaining why not. I don't know, maybe it's an impossible task."},{"Title":"Hands Can","review":"It's a beautiful example of how some wonderful words can sing with amazing photography of children.

Rather than committing the travel book era of using factual trivia to make the book more weighty, he uses allusions and background explanation as a way so that his life in the places he visits has a context and an imaginative quality. This book, Nearer My Dog to Thee, finds Mr. MacKintosh an older, but no less idealistic and whimsical,traveller, now over 50. The &quot;plot&quot; of the story is quite simple.Graham takes a pound pet from Rosarito to a remote Baja national park forest, for a Summer of camping. Mackintosh's non-fiction has a story-telling quality which makes the trip much less important than the travel.So many travel book authors spend too much time trying to impress the reader with erudition or descriptions of the awe-inspiring or absurd. MacKintosh here merely lets a story flow, about a trip not many of us have taken, but we all wish and think we could. That may be the beauty of his writing--this is not &quot;trip as impossible journey&quot;, but &quot;the natural world as accessible to all&quot;.I have a few minor quibbles with the book. Sometimes he refers to traits as &quot;Mexican&quot;, when the traits are more properly the traits of some people he meets in Mexico. That's not to say that he's exhibiting any disturbing bias--he clearly is deeply fond of the Mexicans he meets. Rather, it's a narrative shorthand device I find imperfect.Still, I give this book the highest recommendation. I'd read each of his other books, and thought them grand.But this more mature man exhibits a more mature writing style in this work.He still has the boyish enthusiasm, but it's now admixed with an integrated, mature perspective. I won't quite say that the &quot;old Baja hand&quot; is becoming old, because this one is refreshing and new. But I will say there's a richness here that really inspires.It's hard to describe a MacKintosh book to the novice, because the combination of down-to-earth first person narrative and interesting historical detail is so deftly done. His narratives are friendly, in the way James Herriott short stories were amiable. But he casts his net quite widely--after matters of the heart and spirit, admissions of personal shortcoming, and sheer reverie at the joy of being alive.I read Graham Mackintosh because while taking me to the middle of nowhere, he makes me nod and say &quot;yes, I relate to that&quot;. I'll take that over any number of avalanche deaths and murderous seas in my travel reading. He's the travel writer for people who really prefer amusing, friendly novels."},{"Title":"Nearer My Dog To Thee: A Summer In Baja's Sky Island","review":"I've been a fan of Graham MackIntosh since I read his \\"Into a Desert Place\\" many years ago.

Volpe has done all of the difficult sorting and taxonomy we are obliged to do before we can come to our own terms with a novel. Who is each narrator or character, what do the events look like in chronological order, etc. To have that kind of work done for you for such novels as &quot;Absalom! Absalom!&quot; and &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot; is worth the price of admission.In the second section, each novel is given a reading, and while one may not always agree entirely, they almost invariably identify all the major features and events of the novels and are often closer to very careful glossed summaries than they are argumentative. If you've read a novel, these are comprehensive enough to return to you whatever you might have forgotten. If you haven't read a novel, they function very adequately to convey the essentials.The third section provides detailed chronologies of events for nine novels.If you're interested in making your own sense of the novels, Volpe's meticulous work will allow you to get down to business more quickly."},{"Title":"A reader's guide to William Faulkner,","review":"The author explains Faulkner in a direct, straightforward, \\"Hemingway\\" style, risking reductiveness but undeniably expanding the potential audience for the book. Readers entirely new to Faulkner may benefit from the general introduction as well as the interpretations (basically sound, \\"widely-received\\" readings) of individual novels. Others may understandably take a pass on the first two sections in favor of the third, which provides a breakdown of the narrative order as well as the \\"actual\\" chronology of each of the chapters in Faulkner's novels. Included are scene descriptions based on compiled evidence from the chapter as well as verbal clues that alert the reader to scene shifts in a narrator's consciousness.A downside: Like most other commentators on Faulkner, Volpe often takes too seriously the seriousness of Faulkner. This is especially apparent in discussions of \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" Unquestionably, it is apocalyptic, tragic, visionary narrative, but it is also supreme farce. Readers need to know that it's OK be bemused by the first chapter and to laugh out loud at the second. Critics have done a grave disservice to Faulkner by representing the novel with such unrelenting sobriety. (Reading Robert Browning's \\"Caliban Upon Setebos\\" might be the first step to a cure from much insensitivity to the playfulness of Faulkner's discourse.)Finally, the page references to Faulkner's novels have not been updated to agree with the current Vintage editions. And the decision to ignore all of the short fiction might have been more palatable had the author not cast aesthetic judgement upon it, in effect \\"ranking\\" it beneath the novels. Faulkner's short fiction is not only of the same high order as his long narratives but is inseparable from them."},{"Title":"Crystal Meth Cowboys","review":"Prepare to have your senses supercharged, your awareness stretched 'till it either hurts or crosses that invisible barrier into ecstasy. Knoerle uses the entire prose canvas without turning the whole affair into a seff-idulgent jazz freeflow, orchestrating character, space and time so brilliantly that the senses are excited to near overwhelm, like the drug bearing the title, but without any of the side effects. Proof that a good story isn't in the drama, conflict, plot points or suspense-and yes, Crystal Meth Cowboys has all of this-but in how it is told, the manner in which metaphor is diffused from &quot;molecules contracting inside a tea kettle,&quot; as Wes and the Mayor-elect pause to consider the absurdity of what they are doing, both from an intimate and existential framework, and its lasting impact on our own consciousness. To this end, Knoerle is more than an author. He's a brave catalyst to our own enlightenment-whether we love him or will forever curse his name for this is another matter-but in either case, it's a rare achievement for a writer of fiction.

It is a quirky, hard-boiled novel in the tradition of Elmore Leonard, filed with moments of graphic violence, but also warmth and humor.As the story begins, we meet rookie patrolman Wes Lyedecker during his first night working the streets of Wislow, California. His partner, Officer Thomas Bell, is the most colorful cop on the force, a man with a sharp wit and a natural instinct for trouble. The two men bond quickly after a routine disturbance call brings them face-to-face with a wildly deranged suspect overdosing on methamphetamine. Alerted by this deadly confrontation to a surge in the local supply of the drug, Bell begins to suspect that a meth lab is operating in the area. When he and the young Lyedecker investigate, they start to unravel a deadly conspiracy.Knoerle gets all of the details just right, especially the descriptions of law enforcement procedures and nomenclature. He gives his police characters realistically colorful dialog, including an amusing bit in which the experienced Bell bewilders the neophyte Lyedecker with a barrage of unexplained acronyms. The two protagonists are quirky and unique, especially Officer Bell, yet the story is not all about life on the job. In the background are a romantic subplot and a mayoral election that the two officers become intimately involved in.\\"Crystal Meth Cowboys\\" is the first of what should be many successful novels for Mr. Knoerle.

The story was flat and repetitious, the writing amateurish, the charaters one-dimensional. Bummer."},{"Title":"Australian Short Stories","review":"This book was published originally in 1950 and contained 52 short stories by 48 writers. The stories were written or published between the 1890s and the 1940s. It's the earliest anthology of Australian prose that I've read, predating the appearance of modernism (for the most part), writers such as Patrick White and Hal Porter, and the advent of magic realism or other formal experiments.Most major writers of the times were included, such as Henry Lawson, Barbara Baynton, Price Warung, Edward Dyson, Marjorie Barnard, Steele Rudd, H. H. Richardson, Katherine Prichard, Vance Palmer, John Morrison, Gavin Casey, Dal Stivens and Peter Cowan. Writers of the decades covered who could've been selected but weren't included Marcus Clarke, Frank Dalby Davison, Frank Hardy and Christina Stead.Many of the stories were in the tradition of the Sydney newspaper the Bulletin: realistic, often quietly humorous, sentimental and not very deep, sometimes darker. They showed mainly the lives, virtues and concerns of miners, laborers and farmers. In these cases, the territory was closer to writers like Kipling or Hardy than to Maupassant, Chekhov, Conrad, Joyce, Lawrence or Anderson.Slightly more than half of the works dated from the 1940s. Many of these were set during wartime, on a farm as the young began to join up, or in cities during leave, or in one case during combat. One was a very good work by Peter Cowan, \\"Drift,\\" that I haven't seen in any subsequent anthology. Done mainly in three quick conversations written in the style of Hemingway, between a son and daughter, then their stoic father and mother, then the father and son, it showed the different attitudes and fears of the generations during wartime. Another was \\"Hullo, Joe,\\" by Jon Cleary, about a young soldier invalided out of the war who was coming to terms with his injury and the adjustment to civilian life, and reaching out to someone who understood him. It was written with introspection that was rare.An exception to the realism would be a story by Marjorie Barnard, \\"Dry Spell,\\" in which the narrator walked around wartime Sydney, anticipating destruction and regeneration, seeing a vision of the city at the beginning of its colonial history, and meeting the ghost of a captain-general from colonial times who hoped society would stick through the war with the same courage he'd showed in earlier days.Only one of the stories depicted the experience of World War I. It contrasted favorably Australian mateship at camp in Egypt and adaptability on the battlefield at Gallipoli with the qualities of an English soldier, but later depicted the kindness of an English nurse. Whatever other short pieces were generated by the first world war, they didn't make it into this anthology. In general, with a few exceptions the 1910s and 20s seemed like a lean time for the country's short fiction, judging from this collection.Other interesting things included a comic short story about squabbling miners and greed published around the turn of the century by Joseph Furphy. An aboriginal tale collected and published in the 1890s by Katie Langloh Parker, who's been called the first white Australian to collect such tales seriously and at length. From the 1930s, a comic story by Katherine Prichard, \\"The Grey Mare,\\" which poked fun at a stallion's drive to get at a mare and a young man's desire to get married, and H. H. Richardson's \\"And Women Must Weep,\\" about a young woman's first ball, whose mood called to mind Katherine Mansfield.From the 1940s, \\"Fear,\\" by Henrietta Drake-Brockman, was set on a farm in the north, where aboriginals revenged themselves on a cruel white overseer by burning and looting the farm, a subject not encountered in other collections. Another from the 1940s, \\"The Kid,\\" by Ken Levis, was one of the rare stories told from in the first person, by a soldier trucked into the outback with hundreds of others to search for a city boy who'd disappeared. It showed well the decency, camaraderie and sympathetic concern masked by humor of ordinary people trying to help a stranger. And finally, \\"Kaijek the Songman,\\" by Xavier Herbert, which showed well the difference in values between a miner searching for gold and an aboriginal couple."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"When I first got this book I had absolutely no idea who the man Krishnamurti was or what his life was like. I was simply intrigued by the title of the book. After reading the first two commentaries I began to realize that this wouldn't be like anything I've ever read before. I was reading it through the haze of my own conditioning and I would have dropped the book right there, as nothing was making sense. But something made me want to just read on - I don't know if it is the sheer lyrical beauty of the descriptions in his book or the lure of something that is really true. Whatever the reason, I just could not keep my hands off it after I went on.It can really be a tumultous experience to suddenly realize that the basis of everything that you have believed in and taken support or refuge in is all false. But once you are over that, you then start looking at life very differently. You just stop running with the mad crowd and you stand aside and ask yourself &quot;What have I been doing with my life so far?&quot; Thats the kind of effect that this book had on me and I cannot imagine that a serious reader will go through this book without wanting to change his life after that."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"This is a remarkable book. It is actually three books in 88 chapters. Each chapter starts with an absolutely magic description of people in nature. That is the first book. The second book consists of people telling about their problems and comments of Krishnamurti. These comments are very fresh, original and give new insights. They evoke the reaction \\"why did I never looked at it that way\\". The third book, the third part in every chapter describes his view of life. This is very difficult to understand. I am not sure I am able or should voice an opinion on this part because it so unique. There are no reference points. It is not a philosophy, it is not a religion, and it is not a spiritual path. From time to time you get the feeling, \\"I understand\\", the next moment it is again a mirage. When we look at a beautiful landscape, we can be totally absorbed by the experience of looking. We are not thinking or analyzing. Krishnamurti's idea is that that is the way we should live all the time. He refers to that as \\"experiencing\\". As soon as we start thinking or want to achieve something, we will forever be unhappy. Buddha teaches that through concentration and meditation it is possible, by \\"taming\\" the mind one can arrive at \\"experiencing\\". Krishnamurti totally rejects the need for experience, training and effort. The idea of living without thinking is for me not imaginable. One thing I do not like is that Krishnamurti rejects the wisdom of everybody. Logically, he also totally rejects the idea that people should ever consider becoming his followers or disciples. The risk I see with the book is that people read it as a smorgasbord. Pick up ideas that correspond to those they already have and reject the inconvenient ones. All in all for people with genuine spiritual interests it is a gold mine."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"Krishnamurti writes simpler, more descriptive prose than Hemingway; he dispenses more nondual wisdom in more depth than a score of Zen masters combined; he dissects the armour of the personality more quickly, more gently, more accurately than any psychologist ever has. These are not exaggerations. These Commentaries are, along with his journals and notebook, the only major works in print (at least that I am aware of, and I am aware of most) that he actually wrote himself; the rest of his books are, of course, compilations of talks and conversations. Only a man of such surpassing conscious mastery could write so perfectly with so little effort; if there is any justice in the universe these books will stay in print for a thousand years.If you like Krishnamurti you need these."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"J Krishnamurti's Commentaries on Living are a living testament to the beauty as well as the complexity of life. The peace of the mind which wrote these is almost tangible.When the source is pure, every drop (as every sentence in this book) leads one to purity.But approach Krishnamurti with trepidation, as it is too easy to battle verbally with oneself and others after having listened to him with a haughty seriousness.All he can do is to make you question your own self. That is the beginning. After that, you are on your own, and therefore, free.Nobody can teach you, but you can get taught by everything."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"Probably the best of Krishnamurti's descriptions of nature and the world around him.

If they are you've found them first hand. If not, you can discard them. It takes patience if this is your first K book, to get familiar to the terminology and the approach..."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"It appears (from all accounts) that Krishnamurti was all over the place in his long life. And a lot of it, frankly, is not very edifying.So . . . I think one needs to pick and choose from among his works.This is the one that I would pick.These commentaries were written at a mature (but not yet overripe) period of his life. They are one-on-one encounters with everyday people who come to him to discuss specific topics in Life. They are not abstract lectures or arguments. They are personal conversations and explorations.In that process they INDIRECTLY demonstrate Krishnamurti's radical kind of awareness and how that awareness sees the variety of Life. It's much more of a \\"show\\" than a \\"tell\\" of a certain kind of extra-ordinary consciousness . . . that we are presumably all capable of.We can't be argued into that kind of consciousness (as he seems to sometimes try to do in his other works). But we can maybe come to resonate to it . . . by seeing it at work."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"Krishnamurti has such a simple way of delivering you to a place where you can really open your mind and dig into all the ramblings, beliefs, and assumptions that get cozy in there. He speaks of love obliquely and focuses much of his writing on doing away with the false. To get to truth, we must have unclouded minds, but this is a challenge like no other. It's not a \\"feel-good\\" book, but it is a serious book. I'd definitely recommend starting with the first in the series and working up to the this one."},{"Title":"Commentaries on Living: First Series","review":"K. doesn't hold back with this book, second in a series of 3 commentaries in the later fifties. He's poetic, personal, and overwhelming in his observations that begin with simple stories of the day, a pasttime, a conversation, and then he responds to them with tremendous clarity and humanity. Let's just say he goes big on this series, and hits you with the heavy stuff quickly. Just devastating words, and beautifully put. I've read maybe 15 books of his....The First and Last Freedom was the first, back in \`67, and then The Awakening of Intelligence while I was in the army around 1971. That one is a slow build, with a giant ending...the observer is the observed.Anyway, this, Commentaries on Living, second is real poetry, written in a style he never really went back to after them.

The commentaries open up with Krishnamurti laying down a setting and/or background of the people concerned with the topics presented. Then, they just crumble away into short, mostly ambiguous, commentaries. If you aren't familiar with Krishnamurti's terminology &amp; philosophy, these commentaries can be very confusing. If you are familiar with him, you'd probably agree that they flat-out aren't very good for the most part. I did brighten in finding some of his ideas expressed quickly &amp; to the point, in ways not spoken in other works.

So, on the first day of Christmas, he arrives with a partridge in a pear tree, and the fun begins..... Hilary Knight, author of Where's Wallace and The Owl And The Pussy-Cat, and illustrator of Kay Thompson's Eloise books, takes this old familiar holiday song, and turns it into a joyous and engaging picture book. His marvelous artwork, full of bold, bright color, and expressive detail, grows busier, and more intricate with each page turn, until it almost spills off the paper. Young and old alike will be mesmerized as they pore over the pictures, finding something new and fun each time they open the book. With a delightful and creative surprise at the end to get everyone in the holiday spirit, Hilary Knight's The Twelve Days Of Christmas is a wonderful read-aloud book the whole family can share together, and is sure to become a &quot;must have&quot; classic to help usher in the Christmas season, year after year."},{"Title":"Hilary Knight's the Twelve Days of Christmas","review":"I've loved Hilary Knight's work since I was a child feasting on his *Hilary Knight's ABC.* In his *Twelve Days of Christmas,&quot; Knight provides an original and meaningful interpretation of the traditional carol. I especially love the way Bedelia returns the &quot;true love&quot; of her beloved gift-bringer by making a fair for him to enjoy--love is reciprocal in this book! The second thing I love about this book is the subplot, in which the raccoon struggles to open the mysterious can, only to find a true love of his own. Finally, the concept of each day as a &quot;pick-up,&quot; in which Benjamin brings a partridge and a pear tree (and ensuing gifts) on *each* day, adds a new dimension to the story.

At least, there is a scholarly book that exposes and indicts those who are willingly followers in the ambit of American Communism. Every policy-maker should have a copy of &quot;Beating The Unbeatable Foe,&quot; because it is a critical look at how Communism has evolved into a major threat, and it provides facts on how Red China is using their thesis of dialectical materialism to take over the world. Indeed, in Dr. Schwarz's book, we find out how our American universities have transformed into Marrxist re-education camps and how the hard-core Communists are using religion to further their plans for world conquest. Dr. Schwarz and his Christian Anti-Communism Crusade deserves every American's attention. Indeed, with the help of patriotic men like Dr. Schwarz and Ronald Reagan, we have finally beaten &quot;The Unbeatable Foe.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beating the Unbeatable Foe : One Man's Victory Over Communism, Leviathan, and the Last Enemy","review":"In writing this autobiography, Dr. Fred Schwarz seeks to fulfill his life motto: THAT TRUTH MAY PREVAIL. This book is a must read for anyone interested in either politics or religion. But don't expect a tedious collection of essays on why communism doesn't work. Most of us in the United States basically agree on that point. Instead, Dr. Schwarz's monumental book is a detailed history of the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade, which he founded in 1953. In a compelling manner, the Australian native explains clearly the reasons for starting the Crusade, and why it received such enthusiastic support amoung the American people. As a committed Christian, Dr. Schwarz also defends the Christian name of his group, showing how communism's self-stated goal was to eliminate God from the human mind. Then he covers and carefully refutes the vicious (and invariably false) character attacks aimed at him by the left-wing press and communist dupes around the world. If you're a big Ronald Reagan fanatic, you'll love this book. Even if you're a dedicated communist, you'll still enjoy the book for its great stories and amazing details about how you lost the cold war.

I'm a mom, and my daughter got them as hand-me-downs. I run around now recommending them to parents of [..] girls. (I think boys might find them annoying bcs there are no boys except rowdy ones, really.)Each book has a conflict--a realistic one. And a painful one for the characters. Conflict is the essence of drama, and the quality of the conflict is important. These are great. They could happen in real life--they DO happen in real life. Someone wants a pony but can't have one; someone has trouble in school even though she works hard; grownups make decisions that take the fun away from children.Each book also has a terrific way to resolve the problem. The girls develop a technique that helps them figure out how to solve their problem, how to change the grownups' minds. They each contribute an idea, they refine and modify one another's contributions, they make realistic assessments of what grownups would do. It doesn't always go smoothly, but the girls successfully act to get at least some of what they want.Things always come out fine in the end, but even a skeptical grownup like me would have to say that the solution is believable. It isn't just the grownups giving the kids everything they want because the author can make them.Another thing I really like is that the author does not gloss over the work and responsibility that is involved w/ owning a pony. And yet the books are never preachy.I also like that the girls DO turn to grownups when they're problem solving or when they need help. They don't assume that they have to do everything themselves (the way Harry Potter does, and the way many OTHER kid-adventure books do). And yet, the girls take a very active role in trying to change their world. A wonderful balance, really, and lots of sneakily delivered (and not preachy) lessons in how the world works, and how to influence people, and how to be responsible and trustworthy. (I want to stress tha twhile the books model a very genuine view of how the world works, and how grownups think, they are NOT preachy.)Plus, they're fun. They're nicely written--not terribly difficult. But the characters are well drawn (even the rowdy boys, who grow more fleshed-out over the life of the series). The grownups are believable. The emotions are vivid.It's just an entire wonderful series.

Sometimes it's scary, like when Snowwhite got lost and ran away - in a snow storm that is, sometimes it's sad, like when their Pony Friend Winston died, sometimes it's beautiful, like when a Pony named Beauty had a Foal/or when the girls hand-reared a Foal called Baby (later named Lucky by his new owner) and sometimes it's just plain wonderful, like when the Pony Pals learned how to Ride Western, or when Anna and Acorn did Carriage Driving (believe you me, it's VERY FUN!). The beginning is Lulu moving to Wiggins, meeting Pam and Anna, saving Snowwhite and later she and Anna have to actually buy their Ponies, and the start of the Pony Pals and the climax of the series will reduce you to tears if you're a big softie like me...so, all in all I say: Thank You Mrs. Jeanne Betancourt!"},{"Title":"I Want a Pony (Pony Pals #1)","review":"I love this book it was the frist chapter book I ever read by my self!Now I have the hole seires!

Every story is filled with pony-lore and insightful ideas regarding the care and nurturing of ponies and horses. The girls illustrate an impressive array of problem-solving techniques as they deal with obnoxious young children, local bullies, angry neighbors, concerned parents, and a whole slew of dangers to their beloved ponies. My ten year old daughter, an animal-loving non-reader, was given one of the set as a gift. She finished it in a day and a half. I subsequently bought her the whole set, and now I find her reading under the covers with a flashlight long after bedtime. I don't know what I will do when she finishes them all. &quot;Good-Bye Pony&quot; (Pony Pals No. 8) is a particularly well written and sensitive portrayal of the loss of a lifetime friend and beloved pet.

The books were interesting enough and had enough seriousness and humor to them. This one, not so much. It was just trying to create basically a repeat of the saddle club series. But it missed the target that saddle club hit completely. I know that many people will not find this useful because I am comparing. But it is impossible NOT to compare these series when they are so alike. But the reasons that this book just wasn't getting to me was because I thought that the characters were much too shallow, wheras the saddle club characters had each a unique complexity to them. The story lines were readable, with absolutely no suspense. (The story lines were too predictable) There were no cliffhangers at the end of each of the books. I have learned, that from reading lots of series that if you want the reader to read the next book, you want excitement, cliffhangers, where this series left me picking up the second one with reluctance and dread. All in all, these books just aren't the classic saddle club books that came before them. Cheap remakes of the series, I would have to call them. I know that many people will find these words hard to understand but I feel that I must speak my mind. In the meantime, I think that I'll stick to saddle club and pine hollow books instead..."},{"Title":"1998 Hymnal Supplement","review":"Hymnal Supplement 98's (HS98) liturgical improvements over the hymnal it supplements, Lutheran Worship, outweighs the areas where it is worse than Lutheran Worship (no chant-melody lines) and The Lutheran Hymnal (the congregation reciting The Our Father (The Lord's Prayer) during Communion). It is worth using as a supplement--not replacement--to both Lutheran Worship and The Lutheran Hymnal. HS98 has 113 hymns, a little over one-fifth of the hymns in Lutheran Worship. Yet if one were to compare HS98 with the ELCA's hymnal supplement, With One Voice, both supplement efforts would be, obviously, completely independent--unlike the Lutheran Book of Worship and the LCMS' revision of it, Lutheran Worship. Their hymnic foci are different, with HS98 only having about 25% of its hymns in common with With One Voice. Overall, hymn selection is excellent with a fair representation of Luthern hymnwriters. Although the LCMS' Worship Committee did not choose as many hymns from modern Lutheran hymnwriters as it should have, we see the modern Lutheran greats Jaroslav Vajda, Martin Franzmann, and Kurt Eggert included. In addition, LCMS Pastor Steven Starke will soon be in the company of the Lutheran greats if his hymn writing continues being as strong as evidenced in HS98. Notwithstanding, neither did the HS98 editors forget the other modern hymn writers, with Timothy Dudley-Smith being favored a bit too much, perhaps at Kurt Eggert's expense.The supplement is going in the right direction, but is not yet completely there."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"I can't remember reading a more poorly written book since grade school. I read the whole book solely so I could write this review honestly. Mr. Gehani appears to have slapped together every single moment he can remember about his time at BL, inserted 9 chapter headings at random, and called it a book. His sentence structure is consistent with a 7th grade reading level (7th grade by US standards, so basically, a normal 8 year old). I found myself frequently saying, \\"What the hell is the point of this?\\" after each chapter.There have been many brilliant scientists at BL; Mr. Gehani does not shed any light on the fascinating scientific culture that produced so many Nobelists. He does however, shed light on each and every mundane managerial decision he had to make. Again, I found myself frequently saying, \\"What the hell is the point of this?\\" after each chapter.It's truly sad that this book exists. So many other writers could have done a better job and added something to libraries around America. I wouldn't even use this book for a grade school book report. It truly is that worthless.My review of this book has since been critized. As PhD student in computational physics and chemistry, my failure to \\"get\\" this book is not for lack of understanding of the research that went on at Bell Labs, but perhaps a lack of understanding of why anyone would write this poorly about mundane events."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"SHORT REVIEWWhat happened to Bell Labs? This book answers that question. Gehani shows how the Labs survives but struggles. He thinks Bell Labs can continue but only by quickly changing culture and direction.Throughout his book Gehani provides fresh and important information. We get a rare look into Bell Labs' life, the tremendous freedom to pursue independent, high quality research. Even more so than academia, where tenure provides a backstop, publish or perish was a constant watch phrase. Do your research, whatever that may be, but make sure the scientific community recognizes it and accepts it. Published papers, not profit, was the expectation. As the emphasis changes to helping Lucent's business units the Labs cannot retain its old character, indeed, the old Labs is probably gone forever. Glory can come back to Bell Labs but it will probably be in a different way, helping Lucent first, then society at large. Reinventing itself may prove the Labs most difficult project, still, it may surprise us, as its discoveries and inventions have surprised us for more than seventy five years. Let's hope.DETAILSBell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel, chronicles Narain Gehani's twenty three years at Bell Laboratories. It is a welcome and needed addition to telephone history. Gehani started work in 1978, when the Labs was fully subsidized and owned by AT&T.; He left in 2001, after the Lab switched parent companies, split apart many times, and researchers reduced two-thirds.AT&T;'s telephone monopoly generously funded Bell Labs from its 1925 creation until the Bell System's 1984 divestiture. Each customer's bill sent something to the Labs; slightly higher rates subsidizing research and development. This excellent arrangement lasted nearly sixty years, Bell Labs contributing mightily to building the world's best telephone system. After1984 AT&T; no longer had guaranteed revenue; Bell Labs withered as its parent wandered and floundered financially. Lucent's recent control has not helped.Chapter 1, I Have A Job For Life!, summarizes Gehani's Labs' career, Laboratory accomplishments, its history, and the desire researchers felt to work there. Chapter 2, The Crown Jewel, describes the Labs' confusing ownership, spin-offs, and name changes. Gehani details relations and history between the Labs and Lucent, Bellcore, Telecordia, NCR, Avaya, and Agere. After explaining the Labs external structure, he lays out its internal structure in Chapter 3, Life at Murray Hill. We learn how researchers, managers, and development people get along. Chapter 4, Looking For Dung But Finding Gold reveals how often pure research leads to important discoveries.Gehani's writing turns from Old Labs to New, as Lucent ownership and funding demanded change from pure to applied research. In Chapter 5, Do We Work For The Same Company?, corporate culture differences between Lab researchers and Lucent business people block cooperating. Chapter 6, What Are You Doing For Us?, finds researchers struggling to pioneer science while producing relevant work for Lucent. Chapter 7, Bell Labs Goes West, details the well intended but doomed expansion into Silicon Valley. Chapter 8, Maps On Us, describes a successful web development project between Labs researchers and Lucent business units. It points to a collaborative direction the Labs may have to take. Chapter 9, Most Fantastic Place! recaps Bell Labs bygone university like atmosphere and the changes needed to transform the Labs into something quite different: a market oriented research institution.Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel by Narain Gehani, Silicon Press, 2003, 258 pages, hardcover, ISBN 0-929306-27-9. Consecutively numbered, descriptive endnotes. Good index. No photographs. Minor, first edition layout problems. Easily read type with plenty of white space. Recommended ."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"Crown Jewels describes the evolution of Bell Labs from the gravy-train days under the Ma Bell monopoly to its struggling to stay alive under the faltering Lucent. Aside from back and forth chronology that confused me at times, I found the book to be well-written. However, I don't know that the material is worthy of a book. The entire volume is really summed up in one sentence: Life at Bell Labs was like academia until after the divestiture, and then no one at either Bell Labs, AT&amp;T, the RBOCs, or Lucent really knew how to harness its energy. As somewhat of an industry insider, I was hoping for more details of its products and innovations, but such information was hit-and-miss -- the author talked about &quot;MapsOnUs&quot; in detail, but quickly blew over other products like VoIP and Softswitch."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"At one point, listening to this book while running on an eliptical, I wanted to throw the remote control at the television.In a way, comparing Bell Lab: Life in the Crown Jewel with other stories of innovation engines (such as Where Wizards Stay Up Late and Dealers of Lightning) leads to the same comparison of The Man Who Stayed Behind and I Chose China. Both of these latter two books concern American Jews who went to China in the early post-War years, aligned themselves with the Communist Party, and witnessed Maoism first-hand over a period of decades. However, while The Man Who Stayed Behind is carefully organized, I Choose China is a collection of reminiscences that go nowhere in particular. Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel is a collection of reminiscences that go nowhere in particular. The tenacity with which Narain repeats that there is a conflict between basic and applied research is impressive, but ultimately pointless.Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel appears to want to be a popular business book. I say this because technical and research skills are regularly mocked, but little is learned from a research perspective, either. For instance, in one anectdoe, Gehani disputes whether a colleague actually saved a Business Unit a large amount of money through some new technique. The colleague, the colleague's manager, and the Business Unit all assert that he did. Gehani's \\"test\\" -- to see whether the Business Unit would grant a bonus of a large amount of money, because that employee might again be so productive the next year, ends the anecdote as an example of Gehani's cleverness. The technical details of what this innovation might have been are not discussed. But neither is any business thinking exhibited. Questions of headcount, corporate fiefdoms, and the such aren't even raised. Instead, in this anecdote and others, the reader is intended to exist with a sense of Gehani's unique cleverness.The book is a nauseating example of how corporate lawfare retards actual innovation. For instance, in a sickening passage, Narain discusses how he \\"invented\\" and patented co-browsing, and urged Bell Labs' general counsel to sue others who use this \\"invention.\\" These ridiculous patents exist only because corporate corporations attempt to use the law to club possible competitors. None of these \\"inventions\\" are any more impressive than, say, \\"A Method to Repair Shoe Laces with Scotch Tape in the Event they Break Instead of Buying New Shoelaces.\\" However, large companies that hire lawyers are able to cause enough problems litigating these pattens (that they get by flooding the underfunded USPTO with applications) that they are able to carve out de facto monopolies contrary to the intent of U.S. law. A search on the Patent Office's website indicate that Gehani's first patent was granted in 1995, considerably after he joined Bell Labs. My obvious conclusion is that Bell Labs, ever closer to its decapitation by Lucent, began generating patents in order to force competitors to \\"license\\" obvious methods, or else face hundreds of thousands in legal bills. This is not discuss.The tragedy of Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel is that it might have been one of the best case-studies of an innovation engine written. Perhaps Narain Gehani will still write that book. He is no longer with Bell Labs, and currently serves as the Chairman of the Computer Science Department at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. His publication list is impressive, and Google Book Search brings up numerous other works written or co-written by Dr. Gehani. I hope that I will have a chance to read a more complete first-person perspective, perhaps titled Bell Labs: Decline and Fall, sometime soon. Narain could structure such as book as follows.Introduction: What Went WrongChapter One: My Early LifeChapter Two: From a Professor to a ResearcherChapter Three: (Mis)Adventures with the Unix TeamChapter Four: Concurrent C/C++Chapter Five: The Object Database EnvironmentChapter Six: Years of TransitionChapter Seven: The Columbus GPS SystemChapter Eight: Maps On UsChapter Nine: Cell Center CapersChapter Ten: Commuting from Jersey to the Valley (by Jet)Chapter Eleven: From a Researcher to a Professor:Epilogue: What Went RightSuch a book would be a wonderful read, a great \\"technical autobiography\\" of a man, and a first-person history of Bell Labs. It would explain obviously important parts of Narain's career which are discussed but never described, such as his database and C/C++ systems. Additionally, it would provide a coherent chronology and frames of reference, that do not exist in the current book."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"There are movies like M*A*S*H and books like \\"Torch Of Honor\\" that document, celebrate, and ridicule the way governments can be dysfunctional.Corporations can be dysfunctional, too.One of my favorites is a book called \\"Rivethead\\" about a guy working on a GM assembly line.I have been waiting for one about AT&T...; the \\"old\\", \\"classic\\" AT&T;, that spun off a bunch of subsidiaries, and then was purchased by one of them.This wasn't that book.I was there, too.For 23 years from 1981 until 2004.At Bell Laboratories.If you want to stop reading here and just walk away with a general sense of who I am and where I was, think \\"Dilbert\\", only more so.The terrible thing I remember, however was the sense of a wasted opportunity.When I joined, Personal Computers were just getting launched into the marketplace.Just like NASA was the organization to be a part of in the 60's, Bell Labs (or Silicon Valley) felt like the place to be ~1980:NASA in the 60's put man on the moon?OK, nice job.Bell Labs detects the origin of the universe while they are fiddling with noise levels on a microwave dish.We p*ss patents and sh*t Nobel prizes.Here's a pat on the back, NASA, now go back to launching our communications satellites, rocket boys.(Not to knock NASA, but that's how I felt about the company I was joining.)Now, take that technology swagger and attitude and look at what happened.Ouch!*That* is the story of the failure of Bell Labs to adapt and to capitalize on its strengths.Such a waste."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"Narain Gehani's exceptional book is a \\"quick, enjoyable read\\" on a very complicated global transformation in the research and business worlds today. His insights into the lives of researchers, how they think and work, and how they interact with business units and managers, can transform the way we approach these major business enterprises in the 21st Century. The book can appeal to a diverse audience, including those interested in the telecommunications industry (including software development), in monopolies, divestitures and trivestitures (business and industry), university and business research industries, and the worlds of employees, customers and managers. For someone like myself who has written about research, technical assistance and innovation in the field of disability(Racino, 1999, 2000), it was heartening to have a base to challenge the research industry in that field. Thanks to Narain who just appeared in my life after our years at Cornell University where he obtained his Ph.D. way back in 1975."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"There are good and bad sides to this account of the legendary Bell Labs.On the good side, this book is definitely a _must_ to the BL \\"diaspora\\", people who spent some 5-10 years of their life there, but did not choose it for lifetime. This is true especially for those who experienced the real pioneer era, i.e. when research was still under AT&T; funding without business pressure, and at the birth of optical communications, a field that BL carried to the full end, in spite of many other useful or useless but high research achievements. Good times indeed from 1945 to until the 1990s for talented and die-hard investigators. As one Holmdel veteran wrote it once \\"..it was hard believing that you could be paid to have so much fun\\".The book is very interesting when showing the transformation from this legendary research system model into the new-and-ugly market-oriented one. Regrettably enough, the author puts emphasis on the more politically-correct later stage, instead of telling us what was good and personal in the earlier one. Yet, he provides a vivid account of his (seemingly mild ?) tribulations to get the scientific nerds and egoes under him through such a cultural painstaking transformation, especially when he strove to develop a viable and interesting product which unfortunately failed to interest the blind Top. In the concluding sections, he courageously mentions the infamous fraud that marred this respected institution (but it could be a \\"vaudoo\\" trick as well to avoid really adressing the core of the issue: scientific dishonesty as a mushroom on a decaying environment). In spite of many repeats and heavy commonplaces \\"scientific- vs. market-oriented research problem, or the reverse, and again never really solved\\", it is written in a soft and agreeable style, with that touch of personal and sincere account that makes you want to read the book to the end (could CS engineers of the world unite and follow such a writing example).On the less good side, there is way too much lip service to the author's past line/patriarchal hierarchy: basically GOD, as incidentally represented by VP research, then N+2 and N+1 or self, yielding annoying or meaningless expressions such as \\"the post-(my boss)BL\\", and so on. For any experienced-writer viewpoint, the final edition looks embarassingly perfect and rosy, in spite of some episodic 'disagreements' and other ego-tantrum lullabies. But the reader may forgive the author's sincere epitaph for the \\"great\\" bosses that made up his career, and understandably, that book is a dedication to them. (now are these heroes really dead, or enjoying happy lives in California start-ups instead ? We may surely save our tears in the latter case). We would have liked to know more about the causes that precipitated the doom of Telecoms, as viewed by the seemingly unique institution in charge. The competition and ROW must have been following in daily angst the Murray Hill saga, with its waltz of questionable promotions and friendly departures. Overall, it looks like the author stayed inside a fall-out shelter during all the events that got the market and stocks down to where it still lags. The painstaking story of the N-vestiture of the BL hologram, which gives a conceptual ground to the book, is alas no substitute to a real personal 20-years account. Maybe when the author was a post-doc researcher doing science and papers in his laboratory keyboard, hoping to get to the boss position, could we have learned something about the Crown Jewel times. Unfortunately, this is where the intimate story is skipped, and thus the official one (taht the reader is offered) starts with the \\"day after\\" the demise of the Crown, and the Jewels in the process of running away.At the beginning of his book, the author is very honest (say at least careful) to mention his lack of knowledge of non-CS activities at BL. But nevertheless he seems to praise Raman amplifiers (invented in Germany, France and Japan in the 80s, notwithstanding the discovery of SRS in fibers at Holmdel in the 70s) while remaining blind to the discovery/development of the erbium fiber amplifier at the BL Holmdel facilities. Such an event triggered the entire WDM revolution and generated billions of revenues for the new market-oriented BL BUs, their subsidiaries and an opportunistic submarine branch in particular.The author was probably not interested in the history of BL to such an extent, past his office/coffee-machine loft at Murray Hill. A bit more curiosity and less self-centeredness would have been a plus for such an otherwise very commendable personal account.This lack of curiosity about other fields, due to internal competition, rivalry or complete indifference between BL sites, was typical of the older BL regime. This book thus indirectly provides an unwanted homage to these lesser-known and shadowy aspects of the Labs. But glamour of the past is also important for little boys and girls.One star yet for \\"buy\\" in a 1/0 decision space."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"Having worked some with Gehani, it is important to clarify some of the errors in some of the other reviews. Narain indeed knew a lot of the \\"big names\\" at Bell Labs, as did many of us. However, it was not the culture, nor the tendancy to really put those folks on pedestals. Also, I expect Narain to write about things he was most involved with, such as MapsOnUs or the many other significant contributions he made. While the book may be hard to understand by those without \\"Bell-shaped heads,\\" it is interesting to read by those of us who were there."},{"Title":"Bell Labs: Life in the Crown Jewel","review":"A must read for those working in organisations where a fine balance needs to be made between the sweaters and the suits.

I took this guide with me to Peru 9-09. For the last nine years I have lived in, and traveled throughout Peru. Frommer's keep surprising me with new relevant information about Peru. Kudos. Especially informative is Frommer's first section: \\"What's New in Peru\\". In Frommer's the Cusco, the Machu Pichu and the Inca Trail section alone take up 100 pages and the information is excellent. If you are going only to these locations then this portion of the guide is reason enough to buy Frommer's. Also, for ornithologists (bird watchers too) Peru is one of the greatest countries on earth and Frommer's has good coverage on how, where and with whom.In the world of Peru guides (this year I have reviewed five) there are two types of guides; those guides that are written for the wandering/explorer/backpacker who wants travel to the normal visitors' sites, but will also go \`off the beaten track' (Footprint, Let's Go and Lonely Planet [the best is LP, see my reviews]), and then there are the guides for the traveler who like comfort, have money and will visit only the main tourist attractions: Cusco [Machu Pichu], Puno [Lake Titicaca], Arequipa [Colca Canyon], Lima, Iquitos and the lines at Nazca ... this is where Fodor's and Frommer's fit.Frommer's is much better than Fodor's in many aspects, and in comparison to all the guides, Frommer's excels in providing you with the important and essential information needed to plan your trip (entry requirements, health, travel resources, when to go, suggested itineraries, recommended reading, etc.). Thus, if you are staying on the tourist route then you will do well to have this guide in your knapsack.Frommer's recommendations of restaurants in Cusco is much better than the 2005 guide but still not what it should be. 'Cicciolina' restaurant is a must, but on the other hand the 'Inca Grill' is expensive, so-so food and targets the tourist trade. Check out tripadvisor online for current eateries or ask a local professional where they eat. Take care when asking the local guides for restaurant recommendations, as they will normally direct you to a tourist restaurant and thereby get a free meal and commission from the restaurant.If you are NOT exploring Peru or going off the beaten-path this is a very good guide. For those that desire to go down the road-less-traveled get Lonely Planet. Frommer's Peru is Strongly Recommended 4.5 Stars"},{"Title":"Frommer's Peru","review":"It appears to me that the first reviewer may have a chip on his shoulder and ought to have stayed home, wherever that is. As someone who was raised in Per&uacute; and return often, I believe that the author of Frommer's Per&uacute; did a very good job, especially considering that most guidebooks don't include much about how tourism is endangering many heritage sites in the country. Neil Schlecht obviously cares and let's readers know, politely, that they need to walk softly through this beautiful nation.I loved the fact that I recognized many of the places he recommended - La Casa de Melgar in Arequipa is indeed a marvelous place to stay, for example and it was a thrill to read his section on Cajamarca, my second favourite Peruvian city, after Arequipa.I liked his Best of Per&uacute; section, although I believe that he missed on the best markets/shopping section and would have liked to read more about how tourists are also endangering the textile and folk art traditions given that they want cheap shopping. For example, more and more textile artists are using synthetic yarns and dyes because they're fed up with visitors bartering them down to pennies for an object that took weeks, if not months to make. Take a moment to consider that the folks who make authentic Peruvian textiles and folk art need to eat, feed and educate their children and have a right to have their work and themselves treated with respect and dignity - heads up to the first reviewer!Per&uacute; is, in many ways, like India in that one could travel there every year for the rest of one's life and not see everything. Personally, I would follow Schlecht's advice and get off the \\"tourist trail\\", into the north, the central highlands - the Mantaro Valley, Tarma, the Chanchamayo Valley for a taste of the *real* Per&uacute;, not yet the flavours of the month.Good for you, Neil Schlecht and good for Frommer's.

This book was very helpful, as well as the blogs and forums in the Frommer's website. However, I was dissapointed to find that even though this was the latest edition the prices published for a lot of the things were already obsolute or not completely accurate which sort of threw off our budget for the trip. One good example is the \\"boleto turistico\\" that can be purchased in Cusco to visit a lof of the tourist attractions around the area. The book published a cost of S/70 and it actually cost S/130 per person. Unfortunately prices for turist attractions and transportation have gone up drastically in Peru. It was just unfortunate that I paid extra to have the most up to date information and prices about traveling to Peru and we came to find that the price information was inaccurate in some ocassions. Other than that I give a positive review to this travel guide."},{"Title":"Frommer's Peru","review":"My two friends and I went to Peru for the first time for spring break. Overall, it was an amazing and fun adventure and I can hardly wait to go back. Frommer's Peru (2010) was a great help with the overall planning aspect of the trip (we did the one week itinerary). Here are things that I feel would be beneficial for travelers:1) Getting a taxi from Lima airport to the main city-just ignore all the people trying to get you to use their service. Walk to the left toward the domestic arrival/departure. Cross the street where the passengers are being dropped off and get your taxi from there. You'll pay less than 1/3 of what those guys at the door charge. You can also walk out of the airport drop off (less than 10 mins) to catch a cheaper taxi (not recommended if you can't really speak Spanish well). To do this, once you walk out of International arrival terminal, go left and walk pass domestic arrival and keep walking until you walk around the curve and out of the gate. You'll see taxi dropping off passengers. These taxi drivers don't have their own paper works, that's why they can't get into the airport. Negotiate your price first! We paid between 15-20 soles to downtown and 20-25 soles to Barranco.2) The maps in the book are bad because there are less details and the street names have been changed recently. Try finding a map of the city you're in and use that instead.3) The price for a combi from Urubamba was 1.30 soles instead of 3 soles as the book suggests. If you're not sure about the price, ask one of the locals ridding next to you.4) If you don't want to hike up to the Pisac Ruins, then hire a taxi. We found a tour taxi company right across the river toward the right. They stored our luggage for free and we paid them 40 soles for round trip. They dropped us off at the top and pick us up 2 hours later (the time can be negotiated). They even lent us a map of the ruins.5) Try doing all your shopping in Pisac because it was the cheapest place to find almost everything. The cheapest my friend got an alpaca blanket was 50 soles, but I believe it can even go lower...maybe 45 soles.6) If you take pictures of the locals with little llama, you'll only need to tip them 1 sole for each local. Even if they ask for more, just say no and walk away.7) Machu Picchu was so much fun, but you do need to book both the train and the entrance ticket in advance. For Machu Picchu ticket, I found this website to be useful in explaining the Peruvian government website: http://www.andeantravelweb.com/peru/destinations/machupicchu/index.html. Remember that train ticket has to be changed 24 hours in advance, so plan your trip accordingly.8) You can enter/exit Machu Picchu at the gate all you want for the day of your ticket. There are no restroom/toilet or restaurant once you enter the gate. The weather for Machu Picchu is unpredictable, so bring your rain gears and it's much warmer than Cuzco and Ollantaytambo (7,874 ft/2,400 m).Good luck and have fun!"},{"Title":"Frommer's Peru","review":"This book has been very instrumental in helping us plan our trip to Peru next May.

Especially if you want basic information on hotels & restaurants, etc."},{"Title":"Frommer's Peru","review":"I was really disappointed with this, the most 'recent' book about Peru. I have recently moved here, and was looking for some information about places to go and things to do when I had holiday time. The information is often incorrect, the prices are exorbitant and the whole book reads more like &quot;go where I suggest because they let me stay here free in exchange for a promotional blurb&quot; than a truly objective presentation of options.The whole book is skewed towards the requirements of people who are going to use their two weeks holiday to come here and spend all their money with people who will tell them what they should and shouldn't see, (and screw them on the prices in the process), and really only see the Peru that they could have just as easily seen on the Discovery channel for 1000th of the price!Prices quoted mostly all pander to(and therefore legitimise)the inflated prices that the tourist industy sharks try to inflict on travellers. General rule - take prices quoted and reduce them by a third, and you are still being generous.Travellers here should try to ensure that their money is going to the people who actually work for it and need it - not to those who live in the top 15% of the income bracket - and Frommer's Peru is just helping the rich keep the poor down.I say go with the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide, and buy the &quot;Inca Guide to Peru&quot; when you get here (if you can't buy it elsewhere). It is a little older now, but the maps are excellent."},{"Title":"Frommer's Peru","review":"It was great, very informative.

During the last two years of the war, and at the risk of his life, Fritz Kolbe brought to the Allies over 2600 secret documents from Hitler's Foreign Office in Berlin. As a result, at war's end he was regarded as \\"the prize intelligence source of the war.\\" For all this, he asked nothing.Kolbe was a minor official in the Foreign Office who had managed to maintain his position despite never having joined the Nazi Party. He came to detest the Nazi regime and, despite the inherent risks, resolved to do everything in his power to help bring it down. In early 1943, despite not being a party member, he managed to wangle a trip to Bern, Switzerland as a diplomatic courier. Once there, he attempted to contact the British secret service but they turned him away.Kolbe then managed to contact the Bern office of the fledgling American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) - the forerunner of today CIA - which was headed by Allen Dulles. Kolbe brought with him about two hundred Nazi top secret documents. Dulles was somewhat uncertain, but decided to take a chance on Kolbe and gave him the cover name George Wood. From that time on, Kolbe provided Dulles with highly classified information regarding the third Reich, its plans, its weaponry, its manufacturing plants and their locations, damage to factories and other installations by allied aircraft, Germany's negotiations with other countries, and strategic information concerning the Japanese war machine. In addition, Kolbe's information helped identify German spies and/or their locations in Ireland, Ankara, and Africa.But sadly, much of this information was never acted upon by the Allies. For some inexplicable reason the OSS office in Washington assigned his file to the counter-espionage service which spent most of its time trying to verify the authenticity of the source. Even more sadly, shortly before his death President Roosevelt mandated that no special consideration should be given to Germans who risked their lives to aid the Allied cause. Germany's surrender must be unconditional.Thus the ultimate irony: It has been said that no good deed shall go unpunished. So, if Fritz Kolbe's heroic efforts to help bring down Adolph Hitler's Nazi Germany can be considered a good deed by mankind, then Kolbe certainly received his just reward. For at war's end, and with the newly established German Foreign Office largely staffed with ex-Nazi officials, Fritz Kolbe found himself blacklisted as a traitor and left out in the cold.He had many friends in America's Office of Strategic Services (OSS), but despite the best efforts of his friend, Allen Dulles, who's reputation as a spy master Kolbe had almost single handedly created, Kolbe was never able to resume his career. Instead, he went from one low paying job to another until his death on February 16, 1971. This was a sad end for a forgotten hero who strangely enough might have wanted it that way."},{"Title":"A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II","review":"It seems like the release of previously secret information from World War II will never end. This book is based on information from the OSS archives that was finally released in 2000. It tells a story that was simply unknown before.Fritz Kolbe was a walk in. One day he walked in to the OSS office in Switzerland and offered to spy on Germany. Both the British and the Americans were very concerned that he was a double agent. Eventually though Allen Dulles, then head of the OSS in Switzerland took a chance with him.Kolbe was a medium level officer in the German foreign office. He was not a Nazi and became disenchanted with the Nazi regime. All in all he passed some 2,600 secret documents to the OSS.After the war Kolbe wanted to continut working for the German Foreign Office. But the Nazi officials who had by then re-entered the German government considered him a traitor and refused to employ him.The CD is read by Michael Prichard, who has recorded some 430 full length books."},{"Title":"A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II","review":"This is a truly unforgettable biography of a German civil servant and diplomat who risked his life to spy for the allies during WWII.He was a member of the German diplomatic service, who had the courage (almost alone among his colleagues), to refuse to join the Nazi party. As the war went on, he was steadily promoted, ending up in a position in which he had access to top-secret documents. Driven by his conscience, he decided that he must help the allies, and this he did at the risk of his life, by smuggling documents to Switzerland. For his first trip across the German - Swiss frontier, he wrapped secret documents around his thighs, under his trousers! Discovery by customs agents would have led to his arrest and eventual execution.When he first arrived in Zurich, he attempted to contact British and American spy organizations, but was treated by them with great suspicion, and considered a 'double agent'. Eventually he was able to gain the trust of Allen Dulles who acted as head US espionage in Switzerland during this period. Fritz Kolbe worked with Dulles for several years, during which he was able to transmit over 2,600 secret documents to the Dulles organization. From the outset, he astonished his American colleagues by refusing any and all payment for his dangerous work. As the war end approached, he even attempted to form a guerilla group in Berlin, but was dissuaded from this by his US handlers, who persuaded him that his work as a spy was too important for him to take on extra risks. When the war was over, he was unable to find employment in the German diplomatic service, because he was considered a traitor by the many ex-Nazis who had managed to re-enter German government service. He died of cancer in 1971."},{"Title":"A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II","review":"Delattre does a craftsman-like job at relating the story of this virtually unknown spy. The problem is the paucity of sources. The number of written documents is limited, and interviews virtually nill. So much of the story is embellishment and an imagining of what took place. You really can't get a handle on who Fritz was or what motivated him from the primary sources, you only have the author's conjecture. This is mostly because nobody is left to be interviewed. The book came out in 2005, so the only people that were interviewed was Fritz's son and and an official who worked in the OSS after the war, neither of which knew Fritz well.Really the only insight into Fritz comes from his son. Fritz's son, who was being raised in South Africa, didn't see his father from 1938 to 1951. He was in Germany for three months in '51; and then didn't see his father again. The insight into Fritz's character comes down to the following three things. First, Fritz didn't care about his son, did not want to be involved in his son's life, lectured constantly when in the same room as his son. Fritz didn't even try to contact his son for 3 years after the war. The second insight from the son was that Fritz was always trying to score with the ladies; kinda strange for a married guy to be doing that in front of his son. Finally, Fritz was super competitive and made his son uncomfortable when they played a game of chess. These are really the only personality bits that come out in the book. The rest of the insights into Friz are just Delattre's creations.That's not say the book isn't well sourced and researched, it is. It's just the creation of Fritz as character comes mostly from Delattre and not people who knew Fritz. But that is to be expected in popular history, people like to read for entertainment and they like stories. Actual History is seen by some as boring, so most publishers get their authors to goose the facts into a novel-like story. But I didn't feel let down, as the author does present the facts and often interrupts the narrative to explain the limitations of the sources and tell the reader that somethings are just guesses.So all in all, I think Dellatre did a good job at balancing the need to be entertaining with the need to be historically honest. And in the process, he produced a very satisfying book."},{"Title":"A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II","review":"Until I had picked up Lucas Delattre's \\"A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II\\", I had never heard before of this book's fascinating subject. Without question, he became an important source of information to the United States on the state of affairs in Nazi Germany towards the latter half of World War II. But still more fascinating is that he came \\"out of the cold\\", unannounced, and introduced himself to skeptical American and British intelligence operatives in Switzerland as a German foreign service employee willing to work alone against a diabolical, despotic regime. Delattre - and his English translator George A. Holoch, Jr. - have told a riveting tale in the best tradition of a Graham Greene or John Le Carre novel, but here, the truth is surely much stranger than fiction. I was especially intrigued with how well Kolbe had won over the Americans, especially Allen Dulles, the OSS station chief in Switzerland, and that he managed to provide - without any detection by his superiors in the foreign ministry or by the Gestapo - invaluable information on Nazi-occupied Europe and Japanese-occupied Asia. And I find it remarkable that Kolbe escaped detection by the Gestapo when quite a few of his friends and colleagues did not, and were executed eventually for their resistance against the Nazi dictatorship. It's a pity that this story had a bittersweet ending for Kolbe, who could not serve in the Federal Republic of Germany's foreign ministry due to the influence of former Nazis who objected to having a \\"traitor\\" working in their midst; much to Germany's credit, he has been remembered posthumously with a memorial room in the current Foreign Ministry office. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested not only in World War II, but in events in Germany immediately after the war."},{"Title":"A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II","review":"I just finished reading the book and found it to be extraordinary in all regards. I found the courage and conviction of Fritz Kolbe to be inspiring. His service as a member of the German Diplomatic Service during the WW11 placed him in a position of trust and confidence with access to information that could be useful to the allies. He provided this information for ideological reasons and not for personal gain. I would have thought that after the war, he would have been duly recognized for the risks that he took and the contributions that he made to the allied victory. Regretfully, this was not the case. It is apparent that the lack of recognition and the blacklisting that he encountered did not cause him much anguish. He seemed content with his role and had the personal and professional satisfaction that he had acted properly. He sacrificed his relationship with his son in order to pursue the path that he thought was correct. The book was well written and really told a story that should have been told many years ago. I am glad that I had the opportunity to read about the events of the time and a dedicated German who had the courage to act when everyone else was seemingly silent. If this review helps, I hope that you enjoy the book as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Life of Fritz Kolbe, America's Most Important Spy in World War II","review":"Lucas Delattre's documentary of Fritz Kolbe is one of the most riveting tales of espionage I have ever read. Kolbe, a German citizen who hated the Nazi regime, was employed by the German foreign ministry and offered himself up as a spy to an American OSS officer in Switzerland. The Americans were skeptical at first, believing that Kolbe might be a double agent.During the last two years of World War II, as Germany was crumbling under constant bombardment by the Allies, Kolbe made several trips from Berlin to Switzerland where he handed over top secret documents to the Americans. Had he been caught (and he almost was, once), he would have certainly been executed.I have read most of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels, and this story is better.

A fascinating read"},{"Title":"Causes of World War I (The Road to War: Causes of Conflict)","review":"One on the one hand most people who read about history know that the cause of World War I was the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. That \\"Incident in Sarajevo\\" is indeed where John Ziff begins \\"Causes of World War I,\\" and the cover of this volume in The Road to War: Causes of Conflict series has a picture of the assassination on the top of its cover, with the Kaiser shown with a drawn sword below. But once setting the stage for the assassination, Ziff starts looking at the conspiracy that was involved and the political issues that generated it, as well as the specific circumstances by which Ferdinand and his wife were shot and killed. The assassination sent in motion a chain of events that led to World War I, which requires Ziff to go back and establish what was in place at that point.The second chapter details \\"European Harmony: The Great Illusion,\\" explains how the lack of war on the continent for two generation since the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) was not a sign that that the 20th century would be one of peace. Of course, we have the vantage point of hindsight to know how wrong Norman Angell was in his 1910 book, \\"The Great Illusion,\\" although his argument about economic interdependency can be seen as predicting the Common Market, which has succeeded where the League of Nations did not. The establishment of the Prussian Empire was seen as representing German unification, but once the internal situation was set in Germany the Kaiser moved on to territorial ambitions. \\"Rivals for Power\\" sets up the coming conflict as being not between Prussia and France again, but rather between Germany and the British Empire, although France's global interests would come into play as well. The building tensions resulted in what Ziff labels a tangle of alliances, and the key in this chapter is looking at how the Russo-Japanese War and a series of crises in Morocco moved Europe towards a major war.Having laid out the groundwork, Ziff now continues with the chain of events that happened after the assassination in \\"July 1914.\\" The assassination, known as \\"the match that lit the fuse,\\" and the Austria-Hungary ultimatum to Serbia led to not only the first declaration of war but also those that followed. However, I found it interesting when Ziff explains how Germany and Russia both wanted to keep the conflict to just Austria-Hungary and Serbia. The strength of this book is how Ziff starts with what everybody knows in terms of the assassination, then goes back to set up the players and their positions so that he can work out the chain of events in the wake of Ferdinand's death. The works well for instructing young students on the various causes of World War I, just like the title promises. The final chapter looks at \\"The Great War,\\" reducing the world war to a couple of pages and just a general look at what happened. Ziff touches on the aftermath of the war as well, where I find it telling that he ends with the Treaty of Versailles rather than the League of Nations, since it was the former that was more important in leading to the next world war.In the front of the book there is a list of Notable Figures from Leopold von Berchtold to Wilhelm II, all of who are European (i.e., no mention of Woodrow Wilson). In the back of the book there is a chronology that starts with Prussia defeating Austrian in the Sven Weeks' War of 1866 and ends with Great Britain declaring war on Germany in 1914. Ziff also provides a Glossary of terms from \\"annex\\" to \\"ultimatum,\\" and a list of Further Reading that is divided into Books for Students (e.g., Christine Hatt's \\"World War I, 1914-1918\\") and Books for Older Readers (e.g., Barbara W. Tuchman, \\"The Guns of August\\"). The book is illustrated with historic photographs (including Ferdinand and Sophie minutes before they were killed) and paintings to go along with maps and propaganda posters. Young students should compare what the map of Eastern Europe looked like then with not only how it looks now, but before and after World War II as well, to have a sense for how the names of countries changes while the ethnic tensions remained."},{"Title":"Causes of World War I (The Road to War: Causes of Conflict)","review":"The \\"Road to War: Causes of Conflict\\" series from OTTN Publishing features outstanding titles that introduce young readers in grades 4 through 6 to the causes of five American wars over the last two hundred years that saw significant American involvement.

I am an actor whose faith plays a large role in how I approach things (especially art) and the decisions I make. The spirituality discussed in this book seems watered down and manipulated to suit the individual's needs. Most of the people interviewed talk about their faith as if its only purpose is to make them feel warm and tingly instead of how their faith shapes their relationship with a living God and the people around them that most religions tell us we are called to serve and love. This book has a few interesting moments, but I wish it would have dug a little deeper."},{"Title":"Working on the Inside: The Spiritual Life Through the Eyes of Actors","review":"There's no other book like this, and you'd think there would be, given that theater and religion are so linked in their histories. The discussion of actors' spiritual lives is not given in general terms but is quite specific. The author interviews actors from many different traditions, and she brings in ministers to provide welcome overview and comment. The writing is clear as a bell, reflecting the author's journalism background and her astute questioning.Actors really are spiritual, and their sporadically rewarding lives require faith, and not just faith they'll get the part, but faith that their own journeys are moving on the right road. No one can tell you this; it's why a spiritual life needs cultivating, and the actors interviewed here are all different, and they are all generous in sharing their insights. My church book group loved it. The accounts -- including those by Liam Neeson, Vanessa Williams, Phylicia Rashad, Edward Herrmann, and the effervescent Kristin Chenoweth are enormously interesting.I think this is an avenue that is so fruitful, and I wish Ms. Blaney would write another - perhaps with not so famous actors, or actors just starting out. \\"Names\\" sell books, though, so perhaps they could be mixed into the brew.

Buy it in the paperback version. A class I am taking requiresBookkeeping the Easy Way, a truly dated, confusing text. I read the sample pages of Schaum's Outline on Amazon's \\"Look Inside,\\" saw how helpful it was, and then got cheated by buying the Kindle edition.The Kindle format evidentially does not allow for tables and charts, so those are presented as embedded graphics, and this book has millions of them. These graphics are too small to read on my laptop, and vanishingly microscopic on my iPod. They can be enlarged on the iPod, which then requires tons of scrolling about the small display. When it becomes large enough to see, the resolution is too low to read easily.Worse, the graphics are clipped just as small as possible, likely to create a smaller electronic file. The text is shorn hard to the edges, without any margin. The failed assumption appears to be that it would make no difference, since the white background of the graphics would match invisibly with the white background of the Kindle. This neglects that, on PC and iPod, Kindle reader can display black or beige backgrounds, which are important to those of us with visual impairments or folks who want to read at night. With the black background of the Reader app so tightly skimming the black text of the graphics, the display is nearly impossible to read.Kindle is turning out to be a bit of a con. Sure, it's convenient for buyers and cheaper for publishers to distribute electronically, but with about a dozen Kindle books in my collection, not one is worth its money or even ready for distribution. Kindle books are riddled with spelling errors, improper hyphenation, and cheap-shot substitutes for proper tables. We would have been better off with something more like the plain text files of Project Guttenberg. At least those were honest about what they were. Amazon needs to proofread Kindle books, format them correctly, and enable all the features of the interface in every book.

It is written in an easy style, with much love and nostalgia by one of the sons in the family, Bellamy Partridge. He is also the author of 'Country Lawyer', 'Excuse my Dust', 'The Old Oaken Bucket', 'Fill 'er up; The Story of Fifty Years of Motoring', 'Sir Billy Howe', and 'The Broken Compass'. When looking at any period in history we can get no better example of the true flavor than an account of someone who actually lived it. Bellamy discloses things he realizes are out-of-date, but as the book was written in 1941 other items and customs are also revealed as charmingly 'antiquated'.At risk of stealing just a bit of the author's thunder I will insert here just a bit of the foreword;&quot;foreword: When, soon after the close of the Civil War, Father hung up his shingle as a cub lawyer in a country town he found the building shortage so acute that only one home on Main Street was for sale. This was not exactly what he thought he wanted, but since it was the best he could do he bought it. It was a big barn of a house that had never been occupied until Father moved in with the puny beginings of what was destined to become a sizable family.The builder, a man named Brush, had intended the place for his own use, but before it was ready for occupancy he became financially involved and had to sell it. Brush had bought doorknobs and other hardware for the place, but since they had not been attached to the freehold he carried them away before giving possession. Father understood this perfectly; the hardware had not become a fixture and so remained the personal property of the seller. Mother never could understand it, and all her life she regarded Mr. Brush as a petty thief who had as good as stolen the doorknobs right off her doors.&quot;I continually found myself thinking of 'Cheaper by the Dozen' by Frank Gilbreth, a book I have loved since a child, and I would have enjoyed this one too. It has something for almost any age, from the rough games of the boys, the weeping of a daughter not yet allowed to wear a bustle, and the more subtle structure of the relationships between the father, mother, grandmother-in-residence, and the people they come in contact with. In an offhand, but revealing way, everyday things are revealed for our inspection. From the boiling of water on the stove for laundry, the care of the horse, the clothing, ice skating, dating, firecrackers, celebrations, Prohibition, a new baby, church, school, chores, and card-playing the author has frozen in time a lot more than he knew."},{"Title":"Big Family.","review":"I think Big Family is a very good story.

For those who want to understand who Hornblower really is, this book is probably the most revealing in the Hornblower series. Unlike the other stories which contain lots of naval action at sea, this book occurs mostly on the land of Spain and France, and the rivers of France. As a result, those who like the Hornblower novels for their battles and action will find this book to be one of the least satisfying in the series.We all know ourselves best when we face problems. After the many successes in his career, Captain Hornblower ended up in Ship of the Line fighting an impossible battle between his ship, the Sutherland, and four French vessels. Taking horrible casualties, Hornblower struck his colors and surrendered at the end of that book. Flying Colors opens with Hornblower in a Spanish prison, with the expectation that he will be tried and executed for having flown French colors as camouflage to aid an attack. His wife, Maria, is pregnant in England. Hornblower also yearns for Lady Barbara Leighton, the wife of his admiral, whom readers met in Beat to Quarters and saw again in the beginning of Ship of the Line. Hornblower is in despair as he visits the dying and imprisoned sailors who are in the same garrison.Many troubling questions go through Hornblower's mind. How well will he face death before a firing squad? Will his weak body betray him?His first lieutenant, William Bush, is also to be tried. At the end of Ship of the Line, Bush lost the lower part of one leg. Will Bush survive the injury and trial?What will happen to his wife and unborn child after he is dead?Can he resist sweet temptation, when it is offered?Can he escape death by firing squad?Even if he escapes, how can he hope to be exonerated in a court martial for losing the Sutherland? Captains aren't supposed to surrender their vessels, no matter how badly damaged.If he escapes the court martial, how will he handle being in love with Lady Barbara while being an unhappily married man with a new baby?Will he ever have a chance to command a vessel again?Anyone who has ever known self-doubt will find Hornblower's trauma realistic and refreshing. He becomes more like an ordinary person with normal feelings in this book. As a result, I found Hornblower to be much more appealing here than when his brilliant intellect guided him to smooth success in the earlier books.Eventually, Hornblower finds himself wanting in many of these regards . . . but moves on. Ultimately, he faces new satisfactions and disappointments that indicate to him that his idealistic, perfectionist view of the world is a flawed one. Everyone else is merely human as well. Hornblower is deeply disappointed.Forester raises an interesting point in the novel. There are real heroes in the book. These people are true to themselves and have total integrity. Public adulation will never be theirs, however. On the other hand, the world needs heroes . . . and new ones will be created, whether or not they deserve the honor. The possibility of remaining a real hero is improved by not having to deal with the issues that can tempt one away from heroism and integrity. So Bush is shown to be a real hero, while Hornblower is simply a self-doubting actor who is extraordinarily capable of creating great results.The book does a magnificent job of using the title theme throughout. Having struck his colors on the Sutherland, Hornblower now flies his colors again in this book in every sense of that phrase. Watch for the subtleties of how this is done as you read the book.If you know French, you will enjoy the challenge of imagining how Hornblower manufactures phrases from his limited command of the language to accomplish what needs to be done. As I read the book, I mentally made the necessary translations.The book is also interesting for displaying the consequences for the French of being under Napoleon's rule. Hornblower excoriates the Corsican tyrant in the earlier novels, but here we see that others are being squashed underneath authority's boot as well. Many of the social observations about the French people in 1811 are very nicely done in this book.What is more important: Being fearless or overcoming your weaknesses? What can you do today to overcome your weaknesses and help others to do the same?May you enjoy the peace that comes with living a life of integrity!"},{"Title":"Flying Colors (Horation Hornblower, Book 7)","review":"In all the years I've been ordering from Amazon.com, I've never been disappointed!

The &quot;Painter's&quot; deadly secret gives a whole new slant to passive aggressive behavior, with surprising consequences. The book artfully combines historical and fictional characters in the familiar setting of old Madrid. The antics of the characters will make you look for more work from this budding author, Mr. Hovious. I enjoyed it and I think you will."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Painter: A Novel","review":"Matthew Hovious's first novel, Secrets of the Painter, is -- like most thought-provoking works of art -- a hybrid of many different genres. In this case, historial fiction, political satire, and metaphysical debate come together to tell the life story of Luis Malasana, a Spanish painter who strives to perfect his craft while surviving the increasingly (but all too plausible) surreal world of mid-19th century Spain. Luis Malasana is hardly a likeable protaganist and indeed, a great deal of the book's power comes from the fact that Hovious never makes the mistake of trying to make his fictional protaganist any more redeemable than his real-life models. History has shown that creative genius and human compassion rarely go hand-in-hand and those who would dismiss this book because Malasana neither loves little puppy dogs nor acquires an adorable sidekick during the course of his life would be guilty of missing the point entirely. If Malasana seems, at times, to be incapable of feeling any sort of love for the rest of humanity, it is only because it is obvious that he has devoted all of his love to his art and Hovious is to be commended for so perfectly capturing the type of all-consuming passion that is necessary to feed the spirit of the true artist.The book's central conceit is that Malasana practices his craft under a curse that everyone he paints will die shortly afterward. To a certain extent, it's an unnecessary plot element -- Hovious' descriptions of the often farcial political turmoil swirling around Malasana and his grasp of the often conflicting motivations that inspire Malasana's genius are more than enough to create a compelling tale and hold the reader's interest without the introduction of the supernatural. At the same time, it works brilliantly as a metaphor for the type of self-centered, narcisstic life that artists like Malasana were often forced to live in order to keep their art pure. Some of the book's strongest scenes are the ones that simply feature Malasana and another character debating the metaphysical implications of the pursuit of art and the higher truth that it represents. Sadly, these are not the type of esoteric themes that one expects to find in modern literature and their discovery here serve to make this book all the more valuable to the truly enlightened reader.Lastly, Hovious is to be commended for bringing to life a fascinating cast of characters. While Malasana is one of the most fully rounded protaganists that I've ever had the pleasure to come across, Hovious fills his book with intriguing supporting characters, many of them actual figures from history. Especially touching is his portrait of the doomed Carlos de Montemolin, one of the many pretenders to the Spanish throne who finds his life as defined and cursed as much by his royal parentage as Malasana's life is defined and cursed by his artistic talent.Secrets of the Painter is not a book that will be mistaken for a work of mainstream fiction but that should hardly be taken as a criticism. It is not a book for the common reader but, as Luis Malasana would undoubtly agree, who wants to live out their days being common?"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Painter: A Novel","review":"Lu&iacute;s Mariano Malasa&ntilde;a is a young man exiled from his village, an orphan with no connections and no hope. He lives with a waitress named Lola and works as a butcher's apprentice during the day. His only joy is created through his paints. His talent is impressive, containing a raw brilliance that he is sure will someday gain him a comfortable living.One night, so close to finishing a painting of Lola that he feels will become a masterpiece, his model refuses to pose. He kills her in a fit of passion, but instead of feeling horror, he seems to become almost possessed, and he uses her blood to finish her portrait. The result is the most lifelike creation he has ever seen. He faints from exhaustion and her spirit curses him in a dream, saying, \\"So shall end all you portray in paint.\\"Unfortunately for him, it is no dream. Fruit, flowers, even a poor mule are painted by him, only to die. Not quite believing, he even paints a nasty neighbor child, only to discover that his new talent is all too real. His paintings are even better, even more lifelike for the sacrifice. He figures he need not worry, for there will never be commissions for him to paint portraits, but fate places him in the position where nobles and other people of power insist that he must paint them. What should he do? How can he say no?I found \\"Secrets of the Painter\\" to be an intriguing book. Malasa&ntilde;a is not the most sympathetic character in the world, he is selfish and pretty much unrepentant. He considers himself no worse than any of the other ways fate deals death. Despite this, he is fascinating, very smart and very driven. Even though some of his actions are questionable, one cannot help being happy for his successes. The historical details are very well done, not heavy, more of a light pencil sketch in the background of the painter's life. Malasa&ntilde;a does not see much of the life around him except where it directly effects him, so it makes sense that neither do we. The concept of a painter killing people through portraiture is interesting and I enjoyed seeing what Hovious did with it. I found Hovious to be a technically proficient writer. For example, there is a scene where he mirrors Malasa&ntilde;a's actions with another character's that is clever. He also uses some delightful ironies...the parallel of photography, and the fears of some cultures that it will capture souls compared to what Malasa&ntilde;a is doing was thought provoking. Despite its sort of Poe-esq concept, this book is far more literary than thriller. An interesting and thorough slice of life in late 1800s Madrid, \\"Secrets of the Painter\\" is sure to please anyone who loves historical fiction with a twist.Four out of Five stars--Cindy Lynn Speer, GWN Book Reviewer6/17/2002"},{"Title":"Secrets of the Painter: A Novel","review":"\\"Secrets of the Painter\\" is a book about the painter Malasa&ntilde;a, a fictional composite of some of Spain's real artists of the 19th century. The story follows his rise to prominence in his profession from humble beginnings as an orphan in the provinces. What makes him unique is his belief that everyone he paints will die at once; significantly, we are never told whether he has truly been cursed, or has merely been led to believe that he is by the influence of nightmares, alcohol and coincidence. Believe it he does, and so he must face a question: is he willing to give up everything to spare others?The answer of the young, coarse, arrogant young man is no. Over the next 40 years, however, he'll find his resolve put to the test. In the upper ranks of the aristocracy he runs across moral cripples who equal him in indifference to the suffering of others (a bit of social commentary by the author, perhaps?); yet as he grows older, he shows that he too can grow as an individual, and the declining years of his career are not devoid of love, friendship and a stoic acceptance that he must after all play by the rules - the rules he set for others.Some chapters are better than others, and the author's youth shows occasionally, not in the nature of his prose but in his choice of traits to emphasize in the characters. Overall, however, this is an entertaining read, a life's story quickly told and most of all a look at the darker side of human nature when inclined to moral relativism. If faced with Malasa&ntilde;a's choices - if the lives of a few unknowns were all that stood between us and our dreams - how many of us would be decent enough to give it all up? Fewer, perhaps, than those who would follow the painter's path through a lifetime of rationalisation."},{"Title":"Secrets of the Painter: A Novel","review":"This book is worth the price just to get acquainted with an auther that has great potential. Unfortunately, this first attempt is marked by inexperience. While it needsd re-writing and editing, the book is still very entertaining.

There's plenty of descriptive explanation that goes with each of the nine categories and the photographs are grouped accordingly to make it easy to skip to the styles that most interest you.My only major problem with the book is that, while the photographs are absolutely beautiful, and the collections are phenomenal, the photos makes one think that these collections are well arranged and displayed. The majority are not! The displaying of these collections often appears to have been thrown together without much regard to how to display them in such a way so they will attract attention and enhance the room as well.It's one thing to create a great collection. It's quite another thing to feel compelled to display every single piece all at the same time. When you get into that, it's just overkill and the collection ceases to be that interesting and becomes a burden to try to absorb. Better to put out a few pieces here and a few there and store the rest and exchange what's out for what's stored periodically, rather than put everything out at the same time. Doing so is more a matter of the ego of the collector and less of a desire to enhance the collection with an attractive display.I recognize that a sizeable portion of these collections are from all over the world and displayed in homes where their owners reside, still there are display concepts that should be universally used if you really want other people to appreciate your collection. In this case, less would definitely be more!"},{"Title":"A Passion for Collecting: Decorating with Your Favorite Objects","review":"Perhaps I'm too much of an American, but the preponderance of human(?) skulls, animal skeletons, and taxidermied animals freaked me out.

Some of the interiors look quite ugly to me (turquoise paint with gilded trim), but entertaining nonetheless.I hated the organization of the book or rather the lack thereof.

Hodapp may lay things out in a simple-to-understand manner, but one can rest assured his research and analysis is as thorough and complete as one can hope for. This book is highly recommended to every student of Freemasonry. Even those who've been Masons for years will learn something new."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"The author of this book goes in depth with as much as he can about Freemasonry.

I have recently petitioned the Masons for membership knowing almost nothing about them. However, after reading and studying this book I at least, have some basic knowledge regarding the fraternity, its history, and some of the symbolism involved.

If you know nothing about Masonry and are perhaps curious about this ancient fraternity, Freemasons for Dummies will answer most of your questions. Even if you were made a Mason long ago and have many years of experience in the Craft, you will still likely find a thing or two of interest in the pages of this book.Freemasons for Dummies is written by Chris Hodapp, a Past Master of Masonic Lodges in Indiana, and a member of the Royal Arch Masons, Cryptic Masons, and the Knights Templar, along with many other accomplishments in Masonry. Chris Hodapp is certainly well qualified and knowledgeable about Masonry, and shares this knowledge in an enjoyable, easy to read writing style, that makes Freemasons for Dummies both informative and fun to read.The book is divided into six major sections:1. What Is Freemasonry ~ a history of Masonry, along with its philosophy and a discussion of some of ceremonies.2. The Mechanics Of Freemasonry ~ explaining how Freemasons are organized, more about ceremonies, and the symbols of Freemasonry, along with a discussion of the myths and misconceptions surrounding the Masons.3. Knights, Swords, Fezzes, And Dresses ~ discussing the appendant bodies of Freemasonry, such as the York and Scottish Rites, the Mystic Shrine, and the extended Masonic family.4. Freemasons Today And Tomorrow ~ Is Masonry still relevant today? What is the future of the Masons? And... how to become a Mason yourself - 2B1Ask1.5. The Part Of Ten ~ This section discusses 10 groups of famous Masons, 10 anti-Mason hoaxes and conspiracies, and 10 places of Masonic excellence: including the Freemason's Hall in Philadelphia, the Templar Church in London, and Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland.6. Appendixes ~ Here we find the \\"Regius Manuscript\\", Anderson's Constitutions, and a list of the Grand Lodges throughout the United States and Canada.While there are certainly much grander tomes written about the Craft of Freemasonry and its mysteries, Freemasons for Dummies should not be discounted as a serious reference. Freemasons for Dummies is well-written, informative, and highly recommended for anyone interested in the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"Having been a member of the Masonic fraternity for more than forty years, I have had occasion to read most of the classics on explaining and defending Freemasonry. Now we have a single volume that treats the subject in a clear and fair fashion.Brother Chris Hodapp has produced the very best one volume book on the general background of Freemasonry that I have ever read. As is true with all of the \\"for Dummies\\" series it is a primer about the subject. Since it is written in the style of the \\"for Dummies\\" books, it is an easy read and doesn't get bogged down in a lot of technicalities. However, since it is so general, there will be some Masons that will find that a few details don't fit their particular jurisdiction. This does not spoil the soup!The history of the Craft covers the subject in an across-the-board manner that gives the reader enough to understand where it came from and how it evolved.The section on religion is an excellent treatment that is fair to the objections of some religious bodies and helps the reader to understand some of the criticisms of Masonry. Yet it gives viable arguments that support Freemasonry in spite of some of these objections. And the hoaxes, myths and misconceptions about the fraternity are very well presented.Explanations of the organization of Masonry and the history and place that the variety of appendant bodies have within the fraternity, are excellent.The thoughts about the future of this centuries old fraternity are positive and even suggestions for its revitalization are interesting and timely.This is THE book for anyone that does not know anything about the Craft as well as the member that may know something of his fraternity but can't quite put it all in perspective. And, the seasoned veteran of the Craft will also learn a lot.I heartily endorse the book for anyone interested in the subject of Freemasonry.Bravo, Bro. Chris!!!Bro. Bil Vassily, Past MasterLiverpool Syracuse Lodge #501Grand Lodge of New York"},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"Although I'm not a Mason, I've sampled perhaps a dozen books on Freemasonry during the past year. As I read this book, I knew it was the resource I'd been looking for.I wouldn't have thought the subject matter would fit the \\"For Dummies\\" format very well, but it does. Although the book is encyclopedic in its coverage, it's always clear and lively, and it never takes itself too seriously. It's a fun and informative read, as well as a reference to return to. I recommend it as the best introduction to Freemasonry I've found."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"Before getting into the nuts and bolts of my review of Freemasonry For Dummies, honesty compels me to disclose that the author, Worshipful Brother Chris Hodapp (read the book to get the skinny on the Worshipful Brother part), is a friend and Masonic brother whom it has been my great fortune to know for several years. Those of us in the Indiana Masonic community have long been informed and entertained via articles he has had published in the Indiana Freemason and by his musings on Hiram's Forum, an internet discussion board that he moderates for the Grand Lodge of Indiana. The stars were surely in their proper alignment when the For Dummies publishers contacted Chris about writing this book. Freemasons For Dummies is a book that sorely needed to be written and Chris was the perfect choice to write it. I'm delighted not only for Chris, but also for our fraternity and the many thousands of new readers who will be exposed to his enormous talent as a result of reading this book.Pick any topic addressed in Freemasons For Dummies-Masonic history, philosophy, symbolism, ritual, et. al. A trip to your local library will reveal dozens of tomes on every aspect of Freemasonry and its appendant bodies. Open almost any of the books and you will discover that much of it is written in language that in comparison would make the deed to your house read like a trash novel you might take along to the beach to pass the time while you catch a few rays. You will also find that there is no one book that adequately dissects all the basics of Freemasonry. The sad result is that there are a lot of Freemasons who know virtually nothing about the history of their ancient fraternity save what precious little they may have picked up in their lodgerooms over the years. Most non-Masons are either ignorant of Freemasonry altogether or awash in a sea of misconceptions and outright lies even if they have family members and friends who are Masons.In Freemasons For Dummies, Chris Hodapp tells the fascinating story of Freemasonry using plain language and his unique wit to keep your attention, but don't let it fool you for a moment. This book was impeccably researched and Hodapp shows that he knows his stuff. Obviously, the format of the For Dummies series precludes the presentation of an exhaustive history and no one would purchase this book with the expectation of finding one. Hodapp has done a masterful job of condensing the history of Freemasonry into one chapter and he hits every mark as the story unfolds.As you progress through the book, you will be introduced to the philosophy of Freemasonry, Masonic symbolism, the inner workings of a lodge, and get a virtual peek into a lodgeroom while the degrees of Freemasonry are being conferred. Much of what has heretofore been considered secret is revealed to the reader while the real secrets of Freemasonry remain unscathed. You will learn about several of the appendant bodies of Freemasonry such as the York Rite (including the Knights Templar), Scottish Rite (32nd degree Masons), and The Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine (better known as that fun-loving group, the Shriners), and many more. Perhaps most importantly, you will see many of the popular conspiracy theories, half-truths, and lies bandied about by anti-Masons systematically debunked.If all that isn't enough, in Chapter 14, Hodapp climbs up on his soapbox and delivers some spot-on social commentary that addresses the relevance of Freemasonry in the 21st Century. I promise you it is the equal of anything you will read anywhere in any publication. This chapter alone justifies the price of the book. It is here that Hodapp really shines and displays the eloquence that I believe will ultimately transform him from the new kid on the block to a place among the elite of Masonic writers. Chapter 15 confronts head-on many of the issues modern Freemasonry is faced with as it tries to carve out its niche in today's society and will be of particular interest to Freemasons.Freemasons For Dummies is a primer for Masons new and old as well as for prospective Masons. It merits a place on the bookshelf of every Mason no matter how well-read he might be. As master of my lodge, I intend to make it required reading for all of our new initiates. For those non-Masons who just want to learn more about that group of men known as the Freemasons, this book is without equal. Nowhere else will you find a more concise, easy to read, or informative treatise on the subject of Freemasonry. Chris Hodapp has written with intelligence, style, and a sense of humor that successfully demystifies Freemasonry and makes Freemasons For Dummies an easy read."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"This is perhaps the best resourse out there on the craft.

He tells of Masons of note, not least those who figure importantly in the history of our country (U.S.A.), and notes the leading role it has played in building a sound society.

It provides the essential information about the history, values and symbols of Freemasonry without the mumbo-jumbo that so often makes Masonic literature abstruse and unclear. As well, Hodapp's book covers the controversies surrounding Freemasonry and its opponents.Don't be put off by the Dummies series imprint. This is essential reading for Masons, those interested in becoming Masons, spouses of Masons--who are always a little bit unsure about what their partners do in the Lodge--and people simply interested in demystifying Freemasonry.Hodapp's book is quite American Freemasonry oriented, but don't let that put you off.

While not wanting to learn too much ahead of time, for example: the details of the degree ceremonies are best left unknown ahead of time for a nicer experience, I still wanted to learn as much as possible. This book allows you to learn as much or as little as you would like with warnings ahead of time within the chapters about what they cover for those of you, like myself, who would rather experience certain aspects of Freemasonry before reading about them.I have found this book worthy of reading several times and I also plan to keep this in my collection to refer back to as the years go on.I highly recommend purchasing it regardless of your Masonic experience.

Considering the title, my expectations were very, very, low. So, imagine my surprise, when it turned out to be one of the best books (perhaps the best) ever written on the history and purpose of Freemasonry. Not only for non-Masons but for new Masons as well.I expected this book to have a cheezy expose of ritual, signs, tokens, and passwords. Instead, the author reveals none of it. He does point out that this kind of information is readily available elsewhere but he certainly wouldn't put it in the book himself. Instead he talks at length about the history of the craft, its purpose, and evolution.The absolute *best* part of the book is at the end where the author presents a breathtaking discourse on the continued relevance of Freemasonry today. He points out how our culture is becoming more disconnected. How we interact primarily with machines and our social interaction decreases at a rapid pace. He refers to this as 'social capital' and how we are losing it without realizing just how much we are giving up. His personal anecdotes on the topic are touching and his commentary is very insightful.I would very strongly recommend this book to absolutely anyone even vauguly interested in petitioning a lodge. I would suggest they skip right to the end of the book first, and then go back and read the entire thing at their own pace.Brother John W. Ratcliff"},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"A wonderful introduction to the Craft for the idly curious and a terrific trivia feast for the veteran member. Sums up all the information I had to pick and choose from dozens of sources to get an idea of what was \\"going on\\" before I became a member three years ago.The meat and bones of the fraternity-structure, ranking, concordant bodies, history-are fascinating reading even for someone who isn't interested in that sort of thing. But the author seems to be maintaining the status quo as far as relaying masonic information and lore to the public are concerned. His adamant stance that the fraternity evolved exclusively out of the craft guilds of the Middle Ages and cool dismissal of any and all other theories of origin will surely generate a snicker out of anyone who has made a serious in-depth study of the meaning of masonry. The esoteric element, the philosophical interpretations of the rituals as well as the allegorical side of Christian and Jewish history and symbolism, not to mention the Knights Templar enigma are all pooh-pooed by Mr. Hodapp without a second of hesitation. A reading of any of the many masonic books by British authors Chris Knight and Robert Lomas will open one's eyes to different and well-documented original views as to the possible origins of the craft.Given his impressive masonic pedigree, I can't believe that Mr. Hodapp, in his heart, refuses to recognize any other analyses of the origins of the fraternity than those he espouses. Indeed, I get the impression he knows more than he's willing to let on. I once read a book about a person travelling through Israel. He hooked up with a few other westerners and they got to talking about religion, philosophy, etc. This person said that some of his friends back in the states wanted to go to India to immerse themselves in that country's great and ancient religious systems. The eyes of one of the travellers widened in horror. By no means, he said, should anyone from the west, without proper mental training, take on the study of Oriental religion and philosophy. Most western minds cannot take on the complexities of that ancient train of thought, born of a culture which, as masonic author W.L. Wilmhurst put it, was at it's spititual height when northern Europe was under an ice cap.If he does know more than he purports in his book, perhaps Mr. Hodapp has done the right thing in keeping things \\"quiet\\". Just as a man has to approach the fraternity of his own free will and accord, the deeper study of masonry demands the same prerequisite. And always remember, \\"There are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy\\"."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"I found not all was true to my Jusisdiction but a good read.

The most valuable lesson I came away with after reading this book is the \\"closed door\\".Only an individual can open the door to the lodge, no one can open it for you. The lodge awaits the curious and the free thinker.On another note The \\"Dummies\\" series I have found clearly written and full of useful information on any of the topics I have read. The publishers choose their authors well, this made purchasing this book all the more easy."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"You don't have to be a Freemason (yet?) to appreciate this one.

Of course there isn't any ONE book that covers everything, but this one covers most of the things that anyone who wants to learn more about Freemasonry or is thinking of becoming a mason should know.

My Entered Apprentice ceremony has been scheduled for April 2010.Review: Christopher Hodapp goes into great detail of the history of Freemasonry, both the good and the bad (yes, there were some less then perfect men in the Freemasons). He does display some bias in his writings; obviously as a 32 he is \\"Pro-Masonry.\\" But, unlike many of the anti-mason authors out there, Hodapp has obviously done his homework. He provides dates, names, and verifiable facts (not just self experienced anecdotes, and snippets of stories overheard). Where there are rumors of Freemasonry, but no verifiable facts, he states that as well (such as the rumor that Napoleon was a Mason).For those unfamiliar with the Dummies books, they're a little like reading a textbook and Hodapp's Freemason for Dummies is no exception. I found it interesting, and his conversational writing conventions are easy to digest and humorous at times, but the back-and-forth referencing can be somewhat tedious. Many times throughout this book he mentions information presented and previous and future chapters. It works well if you hunting through for specific interests, but if you're a cover to cover reader like I am, it becomes quite distracting."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"I've been a mason for nearly 30 years.

The book covers an immense amount of ground ranging from the history of the craft to religion to all the appendant and concordant bodies of Freemasonry.While no book is perfect and certainly no book can tell you everything there is out there on a subject as vast as Freemasonry, this book is an excellent primer and answers a lot of the early questions and fills in a lot of the early gaps for someone who is considering joining or has recently joined.The only real gripe I have about the book is that the author goes into way to much detail on the appendant bodies of Freemasonry. Some of the groups he spends a lot of typing space on are fairly obscure and probably don't deserve that much space in a \\"Dummies\\" book. This makes me think the publisher wanted the book a bit \\"thicker\\" so they threw in some filler. The reason I get annoyed by this is because someone new to the craft should not be bombarded by filler on obscure side bodies when there is plenty of historical and present day information that could have taken those pages instead.I am also not a fan of pushing new brothers straight into appendant bodies like the Scottish Rite right away since there is so much to learn in the Blue Lodge before you start another path.All told I am a big fan of this book and have bought a total of six copies as everytime a friend or Brother wants to start learning more about Freemasonry, I get him a copy.I do recommend this book and would buy it again."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"The first book by Christopher Hodapp I read was \\"Conspiracy Theories And Secret Societies For Dummies.\\" When I first read it, I wasn't a Freemason, but my father and grandfather were. After I read the book cover to cover, I went back and re-read its Freemason chapter. I've seen accusations against the Masons for much of my adult life, and it just didn't make sense that my grandfather and dad were involved in something evil, Satanic, nefarious or underhanded. I've read books with wild conspiracies against Freemasons, but it all seemed so contrived. That book motivated me to talk to my dad about it. So I went out and bought Hodapp's first book, \\"Freemasons For Dummies,\\" and read it cover to cover as well. I've done a lot of research, read all sides, met other Masons, and talked it over with my family. I finally petitioned a lodge in May, all because I picked up these books.If you don't know what a Mason is, read this book. If your relatives or your neighbors were Masons and you never asked about it, ask them, while they are still alive.

What is the history of Freemasonry? What is the relationship of Freemasonry to religion and to politics? Does Freemasonry have roots in the Rosicrucians or Knights Templar or ancient mystery cults? Finally, in this book, I found an enjoyable, accessible compendium of answers to most of these questions.Author Christopher Hodapp, a Master Mason and 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason, does a fine job of breaking his topic into well-organized, manageable chunks. In his first section, he outlines the basic history of Freemasonry and explains its underlying philosophy and relationship to religion and politics. The second section deals with the structure of Freemasonry, in terms of organization, ceremony, and symbolism. (When he mentions aspects of ritual in this section, he gives spoiler alerts for those seeking initiation, which is a definite plus for those who would rather share in the experience than read about it.) Hodapp then goes on to describe the \\"Appendant Bodies\\" of Masonry, which is great for anyone confused about the nature of the York Rite, Scottish Rite, Shriners, or any of the other ostensibly Masonic orders floating around. Part four is the practical section. In it, Hodapp outlines the challenges that Freemasonry, particularly as practiced in the US, faces in the future, explores its relevance to an increasingly fragmented society, and explains to the interested reader how to become a Masonic Brother. In section five, the author takes a tip from David Letterman and provides some interesting and entertaining Top Ten Lists of Freemasonry, and in the final section, he provides two historical documents of Freemasonry as well as contact information for all the Grand Lodges and Prince Hall Grand Lodges in the US.All in all a thoroughly enjoyable read and one that is quite informative. My two complaints are slight. One is that, because of its format as a reference and not a linear, read-from-front-to-back work, the book tends to be repetitive. The second is that the author, probably because he is from Indiana (just kidding, Hoosiers), engages very little with the esoteric aspects of Freemasonry. However, there are many other works out there dealing with Masonic esotericism with varying degrees of credibility, so that doesn't take off too many respect points for the author and his well-written introduction to Freemasonry for dummies like me."},{"Title":"Freemasons For Dummies (For Dummies (History, Biography & Politics))","review":"I am a college student, and was told by a co-worker about Freemasonry, something I've never heard of.

There were good explanations for some diseases but the authors are unable to accept the notion that belief in God can be compatible with the knowledge that germs and bacteria change, mutate, and develop quickly. To me, that is as blind as scientists accuse Creationism of being. It implies that there is only one correct answer and denies the importance of compromise in every facit of life. Both sides have to accept each other and compromise to find truth in medicine."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"This book should be renamed 'An ultra-Darwinianist guide to why we get sick'. This book is written for doctors and laypeople who persumably know very little about evolutionary theory. However, nowhere in this book do Williams or Nesse acknowledge their ultra-Darwinian bias. I took objection to many of the things this book proclaims and the asumption that everything is an adaptation. This book is potentially very powerful and has some good points but was ruined for me by the arrogant assumption that this particular view of evolution is without debate."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"This is a very readable book and an excellent introduction to a subject that has hitherto been sorely neglected. The main argument presented by Nesse and Williams is that disease must be understood from the perspective of evolutionary biology.The authors begin by asking, \\"Why, in a body of such exquisite design, are there a thousand flaws and frailties that make us vulnerable to disease?\\" Through evidence and insights from evolutionary biology, the authors carefully give a detailed answer to this question, which might be summed up thus: The mechanism of evolution fits our bodies for reproduction, not for optimum health. Furthermore the mechanism is imperfect and subject to mutation. Additionally we are in competition with other organisms, e.g, viruses, bacteria, etc., that work toward their fitness, sometimes at our expense (the parasite-prey \\"arms race\\"). Noteworthy is the idea that natural selection cares little for the maintenance of the organism after the age of reproduction, and that sexual reproduction actually fosters mechanisms that increase the fitness of youth while neglecting the aged, leading to the phenomena of senescence and death.Seeing disease from the viewpoint of evolution, the authors argue, helps us to understand disease and the mechanisms involved, which in turn can help us to fight disease. Allergy, for example, is a disease characterized by an over active immune system. Copious amounts of histamine are produced to fight off a few molecules of pollen. Why? The authors make the point that our immune systems operate on the principle that better an overreaction to something harmless than an under reaction to a real threat. It's like jumping at the sight of a piece of rope lying on the ground. It's not a snake, but better this little harmless error than being too slow to get back from the real thing.Some other interesting ideas: Fever has a purpose. It raises body temperature enough to interfere with the chemistry of some pathogens, thereby killing them. If we take medicines that reduce fever, are we prolonging our illness? In some cases, the authors answer, yes. If we take medicines that suppress coughs and sneezing can that also prolong our illness? Again the answer is in some cases, yes. The point is that in treating the symptoms of disease we need to make a distinction between which are defensive mechanism of our bodies and which are not. Some pathogens, for example, make us sneeze or cause diarrhea in order to better spread themselves to the next victim. The rabies virus makes a dog bite other animals in order to spread itself. But our bodies cause us to cough and sneeze primarily to expel pathogens.The authors see some of our health problems as the result of genetic \\"quirks,\\" or evolutionary hangovers. Dyslexia is an example. In the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation back in the Stone Age, dyslexia was no problem because there were no books to read. Indeed, it might be that the dyslexic approach to some perception problems, is better than the \\"normal\\" one, allowing a quicker, better understanding of the objects being viewed. Other genetic quirks include our predisposition to eat too much fat when available because in the EEA there was precious little fat to be had so it made sense to eat as much as possible when it was available. Something similar can be said of alcohol. Before agriculture, and especially before the process of distillation, a predisposition to alcoholism was no danger because there was very little alcohol to be had. These \\"quirks\\" are examples of disease caused by \\"novel environments,\\" much of the modern world being a novel environment to our Stone Age bodies.Nesse and Williams show that the modern environment, which requires a lot of close work from all of us, especially the reading of books, is the cause of the epidemic of myopia that modern humans experience. I would like to add that it is possible that myopia under some conditions could be adaptive. In the rainforest it would probably be better to see well close at hand than far away (the opposite of what would be valuable on the savannah). Also those people who concentrated on things small and up close might well identify and process food sources overlooked by others.While this is an excellent book, gracefully written and full of valuable information and insight, it is now a little dated (copyright 1994), and some of the ideas need reworking in light of recent discoveries. For example, while the authors discuss the ill effects of too much fat and sugar in our diets, they say nothing about the carbohydrate intolerance that leads to obesity. This too can be seen as an evolutionary quirk since there were no cultivated fields of amber grain in the prehistory, and the grains that were available were small and required a lot of hand processing so that it was very difficult to overindulge. Consequently there was no need for natural selection to evolve a protection against eating too much. Also their discussion of heart disease and how it is the result of genetic factors and faulty diet fails to mention the idea that heart disease might be caused by a bacteria. (See for example, Plague Time: How Stealth Infections Cause Cancers, Heart Disease, and other Deadly Ailments (2000) by Paul W. Ewald.)All things considered, though, this is a classic of evolutionary literature, nicely presented to a nonspecialist, but educated public. Now if we can only get the doctors to read it!"},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"Slightly modifying an oft-quoted line by the famous biologist Dobzhansky, Nesse and Williams conclude, &quot;After all, nothing in medicine makes sense except in the light of evolution.&quot; In this lucidly written book, the authors make this assertion throughout. They lay out principles for interpreting aspects of human health from an evolutionary perspective. For example, some of the body's responses can be viewed as adaptive defenses (e.g. fever), others the products of novel environments (e.g. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS). The authors raise intriguing examples, from adaptive withholding of the body's iron stores to pregnancy sickness, that put flesh on the bones of these principles. This book does a fine job of overviewing the ways in which an evolutionary perspective can contribute to a richer understanding of medicine than the more proximate (e.g. what are the chemical and genetic bases to schizophrenia?) focus alone can provide. For this reason, it may long be seen as a seminal contribution."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"-Why We Get Sick- is a discussion on novel way of thinking about sickness, an epiphany on the perseverance of human vulnerability. The book addresses whre disease come from and why we get such diseases. Nesse and Williams carefully state 6 major causes of diseases: Defenses, infection, novel environments, genes, design compromises, and evolutionary legacies. Our immune system is the frontier battefield of any intruders. Studies have shown that at the first point of contraction, the immune system proliferate T-cells against the HIV virus. These immune cells fight the best they can to prohibit HIV settling onto the CD-4 cells. The only reason the immune system loses is because the HIV virus is simply too smart that they mutate into other forms and fool the T-cells. The first sign of the cold virus triggers series of defensive action-fever and sneezing are actually not illness, but defensive/immunological responses against the virus.Bacteria can evolve as much in a day as we can in a thousand years, and this gives us a grossly unfair handicap in the arms race. That's right, according to the authors of this book, we are in an ever-lasting struggle with bacteria and virus because they evolve so much faster than we can imagine. TB disappeared more than 40 years ago after the discovery of antibiotics. TB is now coming back with an even more potent form-a kind that no longer can be treated by the old antibiotics. Evolution of the virus plays a significant role here. The possibile treatment would be chemical mimetics, synthesizing structurally similar compound to treat the new strain.The more I read the more I'm refreshed by the authors. They discussed the cause of allergy and why some people are so allergic to plants and pollen while others are completely immune to them. The book also makes distinction between virus and toxins. How does the body identify novel toxins? What is the sinificance of maleness and femaleness? These are questions we all address but of which we never consider in the evolutionary point of view. The authors do not argue that evolution is the main cause of why we have allergy, AIDS, influenza and gene defects, but they have done a brilliant job in exploring the matter in this side of the argument."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"Both authors are scientists of the highest caliber, and \\"Why We Get Sick\\" is a marvelous, important, and valuable read. The book's purpose is to include functional evolutionary explanations into ordinary medicine, a project that is only slowly coming to be. The key to unlocking so many mysteries behind so many diseases is to look beyond proximate causes and look instead for functional, often evolutionary, causes of disease and dysfunction. This requirement demands that we don't stop at signs and symptoms of disease, but that we understand how the disease disrupts the function of organisms. Only by a functional understanding of disease, which requires an evolutionary perspective, can we both prevent and treat disease more quickly, accurately, and thoroughly.The classic case is fever. Hopefully, we all know that most fevers are generally good for us (to a degree), namely that it is the body's own defense mechanism to raise the body's temperature to help kill pathogens. Some fevers, obviously, need to be treated with aspirin, but by doing so, you may actually prolong the disease. If we understand that fevers play a vital evolutionary role in helping us ward off pathogens, we'll not want to reduce a fever unless absolutely necessary (e.g., very high temperatures). Our body's own immune system is a marvel of evolution at work; and we need to learn to work with it, not work around it, much less against it. Certainly we ought not be taking antibiotics for viral infections, yet patients demand it, and doctors give in. There are health consequences to this slipshod type of medicine.If we understand, similarly, that being biped is relatively recent in our evolutionary history, and we understand how our visceral girdle is designed for quadrupeds, not bipeds, then the fact that so many of us get back pain should not come as a surprise. And, the more sedentary and unexercised this girdle becomes, the more prone to back disorders (e.g., herniated discs) we become. Part of the evolutionary scheme of things is preventative as well as curative, so rigorous exercise of our midriff girdle will do much to prevent back disorders resulting from flabby girdles. By taking the evolutionary function into account, we are better able to prevent as well as treat most disorders.These are just two examples of a plethora of diseases that, when given their functional aetiology, give a fuller account of what steps are necessary to keep us healthy and which steps are necessary to treat illnesses. The authors maintain that we must get to the true, real, and functional cause of most disorders before we have a real grasp of disease itself, thereby opening the door to both conventional and evolutionary prevention and treatment. I can't possibly do justice to the depth and breadth of this very important work. While I believe it should be in every doctor's library (like \\"Darwinian Psychiatry\\" should be in every psychiatrist's library), it is also one book most health consumers need to understand. Some parts are challenging reading, but it's worth it.I do have several criticisms. First, the book is not the finest in scientific writing for the layperson. Many doubly compound sentences (and subjects) would have been better developed with a shorter, simpler sentential writing style. Second, no footnotes; there are notes at the end of the text, and no bibliography. Third, the organization and presentation in the first part of the book could be better, with implications made explicit. These criticisms, while not major, do affect the overall rating of the book."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"This book offers a stimulating challenge to medicine and a thoughtful discussion of how (Darwin) evolution theory applies to us. Mr. Nesse and Mr. Williams provide a careful survey about how evolutionary factors can shape and affect human health - the causes and effects are being discussed in a plain-language manner. Have you ever thought about how the sneezing, the fever, and the coughing are all front-line responses of our immune system? Why do you think the once-eradicated TB come back with a more potent strand? The book provides a refreshing yet convincing view that bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an everlasting arm race."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"As a bright artistic type who is basically scientifically illiterate, I often find myself unable to get through more than a third of my organic chemist husband's science books. Why We Get Sick is written for both the scientist and those who are just plain interested in knowing about things, i.e. people like me. Like all theories, what is presented here could be flawed. However the authors present a very intriguing point of view about health and the human body. Well worth tripping over a few unfamiliar words."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"\\"If you are starving in a rain forest, eat the camouflaged frog that is hidden in the vegetation, not the bright one sitting resplendent on a nearby branch.\\"At first glance, this quote from WHY WE GET SICK wouldn't seem to be relevant to the topic. But since the hypothesis of the book is that evolution and natural selection govern the senescence of aging and the physiological responses to diseases and mortally competitive environments, the fact that the gaudier frog has evolved with potent internal poisons that (should) signal \\"danger\\" to any potential predator makes the connection vis-a-vis both the amphibian's toxin and the starving hiker whose internal defense mechanisms may at least cause vomiting and diarrhea if frog's legs make it onto the dinner menu.As authors Randolph Nesse and George Williams summarize:\\"First, there are genes that make us vulnerable to disease ... Most deleterious genetic effects ... are actively maintained by selection because they have unappreciated benefits that outweigh their costs ... Second, disease results from exposure to novel factors that were not present in the environment in which we evolved ... Third, disease results from design compromises, such as upright posture with its associated back problems ... Fourth, ... natural selection ... works just as hard for pathogens trying to eat us and the organisms we want to eat. In conflicts with these organisms, as in baseball, you can't win 'em all. Finally, disease results from unfortunate historical legacies ... the human body must function well, with no chance to go back and start afresh ... Susceptibility to disease ... cannot be eliminated by any duration of natural selection, for it is the very power of natural selection that created them.\\"Under the umbrella of natural selection, the authors include everything from the obvious and non-arguable, such as fever as a mechanism to kill invading pathogens with heat, to the less obvious and perhaps debatable, such as the instinctive desire of small children to remained unweaned from mother's breast, which serves to prolong lactation and ensures that Mom won't become pregnant with a potential rival. Other examples fall into the category, Gee, Why Didn't I Think of That, including the morning sickness of pregnancy, which serves to prevent Mom from ingesting toxins during that vulnerable period when the unborn child is experiencing peak organ formation, and the causative agent of gout, uric acid, the build-up of which also protects the body from the aging effects of oxidative damage. Then there's cancer, which wouldn't be a problem had we not tissue cells that grow and regenerate. And did you know that premature ejaculation in the male is ostensibly selective, in an evolutionary sense, for those men that can get the gene transfer job done, so to speak, and then flee before the female's alpha male partner shows up to brain the interloper with a knotty pine cudgel?Nesse and Williams lucidly present an unconventional paradigm of medicine, a different perspective from which to view disease and aging, that's only accasionally preachy. They rue the fact that it's not part of the mainstream, and argue for its inclusion in the curriculum of the country's medical schools. They fail to mention what I think is the more practical route to widespread acceptance, i.e. when it can make the medical industry lots of money.Hey honey! How about some frog legs for dinner?

The authors make a very compelling case for the usefulness of a evolutionary perspective in medicine. I have a couple minor complaints (but don't let this discourage you).

Not a problem if you're paying attention, but they may sometimes give the impression that their is more data to support a contention than there actually is.

It's great for students, classrooms and anyone interested in Evolutionary medicine."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"In their book Why We Get Sick the authors(a physician and a biologist) assert that an &quot;evolutionary&quot; perspective has been overlooked by western medicine in its analysis of sickness and disease. To correct this oversight, Why We Get Sick reconsiders the evolutionary perspective as a distinct, yet mutually beneficial partner to current &quot;proximate&quot; explanations now being used in our medical community.) The authors contend that when an evolutionary perspective is introduced into the medical analysis of sickness and disease, we benefit from a new way of thinking about illness. These assertions made by the authors within the framework of the &quot;new&quot; Darwinian medicine are startling for two reasons. First of all, Darwin's theory of evolution has been around for awhile. Secondly, an evolutionary perspective not only has relevance, but may prove beneficial to doctors and patients. Yet an evolutionary perspective, the authors concede, is little used and misunderstood even to this day. Of course, its lack of application in the analysis and treatment of disease, poses a major question to all of us, whether we are historians of science or not. Indeed, &quot;many participants in this debate don't even agree on what disease is&quot; , never mind the &quot;public policy implications&quot;, or the impossibility of &quot;deducing&quot; moral and ethical principles from &quot;biological facts&quot;. That would take a whole book to discuss. Just what does characterize the &quot;dynamics&quot; of an evolutionary perspective in the analysis of sickness and disease? In other words, what makes this perspective relevant to an analysis of disease and sickness? Also, how could an evolutionary context, once it was implemented, continue to stay relevant? These questions (and many others) may have helped to organize this book. Furthermore, as the authors searched for answers, they may have provided us with more groundwork in this &quot;new&quot; field of science called &quot;sociob!iology&quot;. It seems that the framework for the &quot;new&quot; Darwinian medicine gets its underlying focus from two explanations for the &quot;susceptibility&quot; of homo sapiens to sickness and disease. Furthermore, these two areas seem to overlap, perhaps without our realizing this &quot;confusion&quot;. These two areas include, first of all, Charles Darwin's &quot;theory of natural selection&quot; as an &quot;explanation of the functional design of organisms&quot; The second area or focus in the analysis of disease comes from the medical community's &quot;proximate&quot; explanations for why we get sick. Proximate explanations are referred to by Neese and Williams as the &quot;What?&quot; or the &quot;How?&quot; questions which attend a diagnosis, something we all do perhaps only too well. While these two areas ( &quot;proximate&quot; vs. &quot;evolutionary&quot;) often overlap sometimes to the point of confusion, it is the lack of a twin perspective (or keeping the individuality of both explanations distinct) which may keep us unnecessarily in harms way. By reconsidering the evolutionary perspective as a distinct yet mutually beneficial partner to the &quot;proximate&quot; explanation, the authors hope to reinvigorate western medicine's analysis of sickness. In other words, the authors want to extend the reach and the focus of our commitment to health, both as individuals and for the sake of our communities.In conclusion, let me quote from Martin Heidegger as a way of pointing out that the coordination of efforts of the authors (Dr. Neese and Dr.Williams) is exemplary and is suggestive of what Heidegger calls &quot;an inner readiness for communal cooperation&quot;. This &quot;inner readiness&quot; is still a long time coming considering Heidegger made this remark during a 1929/30 lecture course&quot;The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics:World,Finitude, Solitude.&quot;The precarious situation in our communities and the g!rowing gap between physicians and patients induces a frantic inability to find (let's call it) &quot;common ground&quot;. This does not even consider the disastrous &quot;polarizations&quot; that the AIDS epidemic produce among all the so-called &quot;special interest groups&quot; which ignores the need for consensus amongst us all to prevent the spread of this disease.Heidegger writes( nearly 60 years ago):&quot;Philosophical knowledge is supposed to be superior because of its more universal character...corresponding to this hyper-sophisticated pseudo-philosophy, what we find in the field of research is a stubborn appeal to the so-called facts and an inability to understand that a fact yields nothing by itself, that every fact we can produce has always already undergone a process of interpretation. Between them, the hypersophistication of philosophy and the intransigence of the sciences create the hopeless situation in which both parties obstinately persist in talking past one another and foster the spurious freedom in which each eventually leave the other to its own devices.&quot; One important aspect of this book is that two individual, the authors of this book, one a doctor in the field of psychiatry and one a biologist, did not talk past each other and their cooperation has given us a book that we all must examine during this time when so much hangs in the balance, if only for its way of showing how we might sow the seeds of a mutual understanding."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"From an evolutionary standpoint, it is reasonable to ask why we are plagued with disease, both physical and \\"mental\\", and why we age. It is not so hard to understand if the disease is due to viruses or bacteria, which evolve along with us in an evolutionary arms race. For this reason, some scientists have postulated that many illnesses ranging from heart disease to schizophrenia are also due to living organisms, and certainly there is increasing evidence for the importance of this viewpoint. Nesse and Williams provide other answers. Some of these answers - changes in environment and habits, rare mutations - are straight forward, others are more subtle and interesting. More than anything, there are inevitably tradeoffs. The gene which causes sickle cell anemia helps protect against malaria. In a few instances, an evolutionary perspective provides immediate suggestions for changes in medical practice, in the care of newborns and in the treatment of fever. More significantly, it has a role to play in the guidance of future research aimed at specific diseases. The book falls somewhere between a popular explication, and an original contribution, the contribution primarily being that it organizes many separate findings, and sets them out in a more general framework, while posing a host of possible PhD research questions. Much of the background information in Why We Get Sick is of great interest, and I only wish there was more background on the immune system. The writing is competent, and almost always clear."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"This is a very readable, intelligent introduction to a perspective on medicine that is very useful for those of us who recognize that we have to manage our own medical care. It provides us with a basis for asking questions about the recommendations that doctors make. Those recommendations can be short-sighted. Most medical schools have not provided doctors with a useful evolutionary perspective on disease and medicine. The evolutionary perspective is simple enough for an intelligent lay person to grasp and use and novel enough to give insights that most doctors will not be able to provide.Together with some knowledge of psychosomatic medicine (also neglected in most doctor's education) evolutionary medicine can give a patient sound footing to formulate a holistic perspective on health that few doctors will provide. Unlike holistic perspectives based on, say, Chinese medicine, this kind of perspective is more directly and obviously scientifically based. Accordingly, it is more likely to help a patient earn the respect of doctors that is needed for them to accept the patient as a full partner in the diagnosis and healing process."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"There is a growing realization that many diseases are related to or caused by pathogens. Lack of understanding of evolution of microorganisms makes us ineffective at treating disease.The evolution of antibiotic resistance is a good case in point. Working with advanced electromagnetic technologies to eliminate pathogens quickly demonstrates that evolution of microorganisms can occur quickly enough to affect treatment during the course of treating a single episode of a disease in a single patient. There needs to be a new field of the science of internal ecology of the body that builds understanding of the ecosystems of the microbiological agents that outnumber our cells.That said, Nesse and Williams give an easily readable primer on some of the fundamental evolutionary thinking essential for successful understanding and treatment of disease. It is unfortunate that more physicians are not deeply familiar with these issues. The improper handling of disease with current antibiotics makes the organisms that cause them more deadly. This could easily be minimized by correctly approaching treatment from a base of understanding of evolutionary biology.While this book is a good step into the deep waters of internal ecology, its easy reading makes it somewhat superficial. To start getting the real scoop, you need to read Ewald's work. A good starting point is Plague Time: How Stealth Infections Cause Cancer, Heart Disease, and Other Deadly Ailments.As one simple example, Plague Time points out that the Borna virus is usually associated with Bipolar disease. After working with a few individuals with Bipolar disease, I've found they invariably have the Borna virus. This is untreatable by conventional medicine. Using electromagnetic techniques, the virus can be eliminated or reduced in number. This results in immediate cessation of a manic/depressive episode in some people. There are numerous other examples of these issues in heart disease, cancer, auto-immune diseases, and so forth.The fact that microorganisms are becoming more resistant to treatment and getting deadlier from improper management, combined with the fact that many diseases are caused by unrecognized pathogens, means that every individual needs to come to grips with evolutionary biology or risk becoming a victim of it."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"Okay, I am not finishing this book (I read about 60%) because I feel like the authors are just talking just to talk and aren't really saying anything. I will explain why:First, before I get started on the content, on the Kindle edition titles of sections continually appear on the bottom of a page while the content starts on the next page. Did anyone think about that when this was released?Secondly, I expected this book to be heavily scientific and detailed, I.e. knowledgable. It is not that. This book reads more like someone's half-hearted dissertation, a theory based on logic but with little evidence to support it. I don't disagree with the message, which is that evolution has created many ways for bacteria and viruses to invade us, and many ways for us to repel them and heal ourselves. Of course that's the general idea, but I bought the book to learn more in detail. But this isn't a science book, it's a theory book. You don't learn about medicine and how the body behaves. Instead you read things such as: inflammation and fever are ways for us to make our bodies inhospitable to bacteria. Duh, really? You think? Would you like to be more specific? Apparently not, the authors don't want to be more specific.Another example: I was very interested in the section on cancer. The first several pages of the section talk about how we have so many cells with so much history from cells of our many predecessors that there are just too many opportunities for cellular mistakes to occur. We should be lucky we don't get cancer more often, the authors imply. Oh, really? They just got through most of the book telling us how we have so many evolutionary defenses from multitudes of different microscopic invaders, and yet we shouldn't expect similarly rigorous defenses from cellular defects over our evolution? Their theories just explain what we already know: we have defenses for some sicknesses and not others. The authors also give us pearls of wisdom such as: genetics help determine our predisposition to cancer, and if we kill ourselves off by living dangerously while young we probably won't have to worry about cancer. It kind of sounds like they're either making unsupported claims, reading some news articles, regurgitating the obvious, and any other way of trying to add as much as possible to pad the book to make it longer.Stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Why We Get Sick: The New Science of Darwinian Medicine","review":"Many human sicknesses arise for quite understandable reasons when you think about the evolutionary pressures that has been acting upon us.

It stresses the impact which evolutionary biology should have on medical progress. It challenges head-on long ingrained medical treatments of symptoms, which in fact are a part of the body's defenses against illnesses.It explains the beneficial effects, among others, of fever, vomiting, low iron levels, pain, cough, diarrhea, fear, anxiety or panic.The basis of the book is Darwin's theory of natural selection which explains the functional design of all organisms. Natural selection involves no plan, no goal, no direction, only \`selfish genes' (R. Dawkins). Survival of the latter depends on their reproductive success, not on perfect design, health or (sexual) satisfaction. The role of chance ensures that the future course of evolution is unpredictable.The authors see six categories of evolutionary explanations of diseases: defenses (ex. fever, emotions); infections (ex. by bacteria); novel environments (ex. artificial light, agriculture instead of hunting-gathering); genes (ex. mutations); design compromises (ex. walking upright predisposes man to back problems); evolutionary legacies (ex. food passes through a tube in front of our windpipe).The book contains also a serious warning: New breeds of disease-resistant plants should be treated very cautiously.Why has, until now, the medical profession not taken advantage of the help from evolutionary biology?

Heady and sumptuous as a fine red wine, EATING UP ITALY: VOYAGES ON A VESPA -- part travel memoir, part specialty recipe book -- recounts Fort's journeys all over the stunning Italian countryside, while lavishly showcasing each region's own unique culinary \\"nuances\\".Italy's romance and mystique lay in its beautiful language, hearty people, culture, fascinating history...and, of course, its wide array of mouth-watering edible delights. One would be hard-pressed to find a better qualified author for the task. Fort, one of Britain's most renowned food critic and writer, formed an enthusiasm for Italy at the tender age of 11. The love affair with the country and its cuisine has only deepened with time, as Fort, at age 50, takes a \\"gastronomic tour\\" of the beautiful country from its southernmost tip at Melito Di Porto Salvo to the northern region of Turin.Fort brings the tastes, aromas, and regional culture of Italy directly to the reader, in stunning clarity, coupled with a signature wit. EATING UP ITALY is a bonafide travelogue on its own merits -- nonetheless, Fort doesn't rest on his laurels, expecting us to take his word for it. The tried-and-true age old recipes, generously peppered throughout, involve the reader and add an inimitable richness to Fort's personal experiences, on his travels.From regional delicacies to every-day local cuisine, Fort's selected recipes and instructions, layered amidst engaging anecdotes teaming with insight into the lives and food of the locals, are easy to follow and tempting to try. Fortunately, many of the recipes are \`formalized', using easily recognizable standard measurements, as many Italian cooking techniques are known to use vague measurements such as \\"a little bit of this, a little bit of that.\\" Some recipes may be easier than others, as some call for ingredients that would be challenging for a typical North American \`foodie' to find at their local market.The book, itself, is bound beautifully with a \`foodified' rendition of Venus di Milo. Its lovely thick buttery paper and dark brown ink, lends itself an \\"old world\\" feel. At the back of the book is a comprehensive index, in case a particular recipe or notation requires reference on a whim.Truly a voyager's enchantment and a food lover's bible, EATING UP ITALY captures the incredible country that has it all, and will have any food lover or travel enthusiast shouting \\"Bella! Bella!\\"One can only wait with bated breath - and grumbling stomach - for Fort's upcoming labour of love, EATING UP SICILY.My rating is 4.5 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Eating Up Italy","review":"The traveling by Vespa in Italy idea is what first attracted me to this book. I'm both a Vespa nut and a lover of Italy. My wife and I have a home Puglia and have traveled quite a bit elsewhere in that grand country. I fell in love with both the charming scooters and a cuisine that's close to heaven on earth. I'd enjoyed Peter Moore's \\"Vroom with a View,\\" his story of traveling by Vespa from the north to the south of Italy. Eating Up Italy happens to be the story of a man traveling by Vespa in the exactly opposite direction, but it's really not about traveling by Vespa at all. This lovely, classic scooter (Fort rode two different ones on his trip) is only incidental to what this book is really about.Eating Up Italy is about food, Italian food, an amazing cornucopia of food, prepared in a dazzling variety of ways by people who relish it and to whom food is part of their identity, their heritage and their culture. Fort follows the track of the famous unifier of Italy, Garibaldi, who traveled with his army from Calabria in the South of Italy to Turin in the North around the time of our Civil War. As Fort scoots from town to town and region to region he experiences the amazing patchwork quilt of local cultures, customs and cuisines that make Italy unique. This astounding diversity among people is held together by their common passion for eating and food, wonderful food in all its forms. This book is a love song to the unrivalled quality of the Italian gastronomic experience in the face of changing times, global agrobusiness conglomerates, and the pressures of standardization pressed up the member of the European Union \\"for their own good.\\"Fort recognizes the unique value of the individualism he discovers in people and in the food they treasure. Each chapter is also followed by recipes for many of the dishes he savored, so the book is also a mini cookbook of joys celebrated by people whose towns are as different from one another as nations are, yet who are made Italian by a culture that has grown in much part from what they harvest and consumer from the land and the seas around them.Fort is an Englishman and he writes with the clarity, richness and imagery that makes English Literature great. This is no trivial travelogue. It is a book I will keep in my library. A very tasty treat indeed."},{"Title":"Eating Up Italy","review":"Reviewed by Cherie Fisher for Reader Views (2/07)If you were not hungry when you start reading \\"Eating Up Italy\\" you will be by the end of the first chapter. This story is about the author, an Englishman, who has had a lifetime affair with Italy finally following his dream of touring the country from the southern tip to the northern border on a Vespa. It must have been a comical scene with him slowly and carefully navigating his Vespa on the road with crazy speed demons.The book is more than a recipe book. It contains wonderful descriptions of the people that he met along the way, the food that he ate and the places that he visited. His writing style is very colorful and descriptive and you often feel like you are traveling with him on this journey. I would have loved to try the ice cream in Pizzo, the self-proclaimed ice cream capital of the world, or the wonderful sweet charms in Sulmona. Also wonderful are the descriptions of the pastas, cheeses, and on and on...... This book really has it all!Each chapter is about a different area that the author visits. He gives vivid descriptions about the area and discusses the food specialties of that area. Each chapter has a recipe section for recipes from that area. Most of the recipes look wonderful, but some of them would probably not appeal to Americans as it uses ingredients that are not used often here. I figured the best way to get a really good appraisal of the quality of the recipes in this book is to pass them by the critical eye of the Italian Chef from Milan that I am dating. Overall, he found them to be excellent recipes and he has promised to make me a few of them!\\"Eating Up Italy\\" is a very well written book and would make an excellent gift for anyone who loves the culture, passion and food of Italy. It would also be a book for anyone planning a trip to Italy. And if you weren't planning a trip to Italy when you start the book, you probably will be by the end of it.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Eating Up Italy","review":"This as an estheticaly beautiful, artsy-looking book with high quality pages, cover, illustrations and a gorgeous cover design.Well written, the food descriptions will make your mouth water; the descriptions of places will make you feel as if you're there.What's unusual is that this book combines recipes with the travelogue, about 50/50.Recommended for all foodies with an interest in Italy. And for everyone interested in Italy who also appreciates good food."},{"Title":"Eating Up Italy","review":"I only read really good non-fiction books -- and this was one of the best I've read in the last 10 years. Made me seriously want to visit Italy, and not as a tourist but as a hungry person. I tried some of the recipes and they're really good. If you want to understand something deeper about Italy and her cuisine -- which is really just good food -- I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Eating Up Italy","review":"If you seek to understand the minute subtleties and regional differences of Italian food, this is a wonderful, lovingly written book. But if your head is turned by the subtitle, \\"Voyages on a Vespa,\\" save your money. You will be disppointed that the two Vespas he uses for months and thousands of miles barely get mentioned. There is one small, generic photo of a scooter at the beginning of the book, and one of an odometer towards the end. When he returns the rental scooter at the end of his journey, he sums it up by saying, \\"It was a brisk, unsentimental parting.\\" As a Vespa enthusiast, that will also sum up how I react to my parting with this book."},{"Title":"Energy and the Environment","review":"I needed this book for school and its been doing everything you would expect from a book ever since I got it on amazon.

I read this after finishing Ben Hogan's Five Fundamentals and was expecting something along the same lines. This book is more of an anecdotal book of Harvey's stories throughout his life.

Bought for my 11 year old but a great read for any age. Would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"Ben Crenshaw doubled over and openly wept after holing out to win the 1995 Masters tournament. His golf teacher, friend, and father figure Harvey Penick had passed away shortly before the tourney. Ben felt that Harvey was \`guiding' him in the final rounds, and the emotions finally overtook him. The impact of the moment was very touching, but it wasn't until I finished Harvey's Little Red book that I began to understand the poignancy of the connection. The 90-year-old Penick had taught Ben since Ben was 7. The little red book of the title is the notebook, journal, and freeform diary of Mr. Penick. Compiled from golf observations throughout his life, it was only in his waning years that he agreed to allow anyone to see it. What a treat and a privilege it was to read. This is a wonderful piece of literature. Having recently completed Hogan and Armour's instructional guides, this was an excellent follow up. Not nearly as meticulously mechanical and cold as Hogan, nor as blandly wandering as Armour, Penick's actual instruction is extremely straightforward in its scope. I also think that the longer one has played golf the greater one appreciates this work. Not written strictly for the beginner, as the other two books are, Harvey comments not only on instruction and mechanics, but also course design, tournaments, hustlers, metaphorical imagery, and caddying in the early part of the century. Throughout the book, his love of teaching and his immense pride in his pupils continues to carry the theme, allowing one to understand the connection he had with his students. Having become extremely weary of the cloying media and corporate anointment of T. Woods, reading about golf as seen through Harvey Penick's eyes was a much-needed tonic. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"I first read this book two years ago. I saw it on the shelf of my local book store and thought I would see if he could help where all others had failed. Two years and twelve strokes off my handicap later, I can honestly say his methods and teachings work. But this book is about more than fixing the problems of you golf game. This book is about life. If I had never improved my golf game one iota, I can say that I still got more from this book to help me with my personal life than I ever could from another self-help book. His teaching and his lifestyle were simple. His outlook on life had one important credo, &quot;Take Dead Aim!&quot; With his teachings and those words as my mantra, I have not only improved the quality of my golf game but I have improved the quality of my life. This book is a testament to the fact that not all things in life can be had by making more money than the other guy, but rather by finding what you like to do (play golf), work at being the best you can be (practice), and then treating others as you would be treated were you in their shoes. A must have for not only any golfer interested in improving their game, but for anyone. He says himself that these words are nothing more that the thoughts and teachings of an over-grown caddy, but beleive me this is one caddy with the wisdom that can only come from years being true to himself and the game he loved."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"Boy Howdy! I've been playing golf for two years now, and like other golfers who've started playing the game, I too watch The Golf Channel religiously looking for every possible tip to help with my swing. Reading golf magazines, and the like. Well,this past spring I purchased The Little Red Book, and it along with two other books written by Mr. Penick, are the only books on golf I have, and I don't need no more. I'm telling you,as you read this book, it's like Mr. Penick is right there with you, helping you to &quot;Be At Ease&quot; and to &quot;Take Dead Aim&quot;. I love the Slow Motion Drill, and it's my goal to purchase a weighted club and use the drill extensively during the off season. Most of all, I plan to devote as much time as possible to my short game, because Mr. Penick is right when he says a twenty foot putt is more psychologically damaging to an opponent than a 270 yard drive off the tee. I carry &quot;The Little Red Book&quot; with me every day along with my Bible in my book bag. Sound crazy, but that's how I feel about Harvey Penick. In fact when people ask me if I have an instructor, I tell them it's Harvey Penick.."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"Maybe it's a coincidence, but I lost 10 strokes off my game during the week I read this book and put it into my practice routine.

Whether it's the lengthly section where Harvey gives his thoughts in the grip, or the extremely terse paragraph explaining why he never joined the tour, Penick uses the right words at the right times.I've read it several times and often take it with me on long trips. It's broken into several very short segments, sometimes two or three on a page, sometimes two or three pages. This means you can always pick it up, read a quick snipit, and walk away from it.Lastly, I've found that whenever my golf game is struggling, I read this book and it always somehow gets back on track. I don't know if it's from the lucid instruction or the comforting philosophy, but either way this book has become an integral part of my golf regimen."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"I started playing golf in summer '96, at age 62, soon after retirement, and immediately became addicted to THE GAME. I began reading all the how-to books I could find, and I even taped TV shots of pros to study their swings in slo-mo. But none of these helped me so much as Mr. Penick's Little Red Book, in which he discloses THE MAGIC MOVE, and the SLOW-MOTION DRILL. Those two pages are a must-read for every hacker.

The book is so easy to read and the &quot;tips&quot; are so easy to understand and follow. Anybody who has the time to practice the &quot;tips&quot; of Mr. Penick will surely improve his game tremendously.Now I understand why Mr. Penick is considered one of the greatest (if not the greatest) golf teachers who ever lived.

I am only two thirds the way through the book and found Harvey's tips, remarks and positive approach to the game of golf extremely helpful. I have taken on board as much of his advise as possible and the improvement to my scorecard have been outstanding. As a lefty, for some years now I have played off a 23 handicap. After reading a large portion of the Little Red Book, in my first game with my Social Club, and only the second visit to a neighbouring 18Hole Golf Course, I came home the winner, having completed the round with 48 Stableford Points. I immediately had my handicap reduced by 5 strokes. I am looking forward to completing the book and know it will remain by my bedside for many years to come. I will be forever grateful to Harvey for sharing his knowledge of 50 years plus.

Buy the Ben Hogan book instead."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"This book contains many entertaining anecdotes gathered over the course of may decades. Harvey Penick chose to become a teaching golf professional rather than barnstorm the country during those early years of golf tournaments when many professionals were simply glorified hustlers. Eventually Penick became widely respected and many notable players and duffers stopped over to visit him at the practice tee. Over time, the wooden shafted golf clubs gave way to titanium steel.I certainly enjoyed the historical perspective that the book provided. Although some golf instruction is included in the book, it is more of a nostalgic look backwards to days spent in the Texas sun mowing the lawns and watering the greens. Reading a book like this is not a bad way to spend an afternoon. Harvey Penick had a good life.If you are searching for a serious golf instruction manual, however, you may want to choose another book."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"If you are serious and passionate about golf, you must read this book.

Mr. Pennick's insights are quick and concise. This is ibe of the best instructional books I have ever read. The only advice I have to give is to take one tip at a time. Pick one thing to work on, when you feel you have achieved what Mr. Pennick said, then move on to something new. The tips are also sprinkled with tales of yesteryear and legends of the game. It is difficult to read this without wanting to put the book down and try each tip as it comes along, I would say read the book once, then go back and work on the things that made hte most sense to you.T"},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"One thing mid to high handicappers such as myself notice about better golfers is how much knowledge of, and feel for, the game they have.

But he can also help those of us who have yet to break 90 ... his little book of wisdom contains many gems that, unlike your typical golfing magazine article, won't necessarily have you swinging in front of a mirror. Instead they will crawl inside your head and stay with you. And the sweetest and best among them are quite simple: \\"Take dead aim.\\" \\"Don't move your head forward,\\" and so on. The game of golf, we all know, is not simple, but it teaches one to be humble -- like Harvey Penick, the legendary golf pro. A new book about another great golf pro, Warren Smith, includes the story of Ben Crenshaw at Augusta a few days after Harvey died. After winning the Masters, Crenshaw broke down, his head in his hands and his elbows on his knees, an image that is burned in the golf history books.

Throughout his entire career, as coach at the University of Texas as well as the Head Golf Pro at Austin Country Club, Penick scribbled notes into his \\"little red book\\". When he wasn't writing in it he \\"kept it locked in my [Penick's] briefcase.\\" (p. 21). His original plan was to leave the goldmine of knowledge to his son Tinsley. But one spring morning in 1991 sitting under a shade tree with Bud Shrake (1931-2009) a sense of guilt came over him. For the first time he was compelled to share his information packed book with the world. Thank goodness. This book is chock-full with principles covering all aspects of the game. Penick's book is so fundamentally driven that you will benefit from it no matter what your skill level is.First and foremost Penick's book discusses practice. Starting out in golf at an early age is certainly advantageous for your game, but it isn't necessary. The real key is practice. And not just going out and hitting 100 balls at the range, but quality practice. Take quality lessons. Whether you want to go to the range or get your practice in on the course, just make sure that you are conducting your round effectively. The chapter \\"Golf Medicine\\" covers fixing one thing at a time (p. 27). The complexity of the golf swing is immense and requires you to really break it down. He asks \\"What's the Problem\\", is it club face or the swing itself (p. 28)? Penick lays out the fundamental structure to learn the game.Penick discusses form from such a basic concept that beginners will understand it clearly and advanced skilled players will understand to keep it simple. The more advance we become as players the fancier we become in our attempts. Stick to the basics. Penick breaks down hand position, grip, and holding the club. Sound like it's all one in the same? Well, it's not. As a matter of fact all three are quite different. Though ideally you want all three to work in unison, and Penick tells us how to make that happen.The mental aspect of any sport is elemental to success. Penick broaches this subject with such chapters as \\"Do You Need Help?\\" (p. 43). Don't fool yourself. Penick says \\"If you play poorly one day, forget it...If you play poorly for a third time in a row, go see your professional.\\" (p. 43). What he is saying is everyone has a bad day. Don't let it frustrate you. The chapter \\"Psychology\\" points out how certain words can play tricks on the mind (p. 73). For example Penick says that you should tell a golfer to \\"grip down\\" as opposed to \\"choke down (p. 73). The word choke has a negative connotation in the world of sports and should be avoided. Confidence is crucial. Avoiding negativity is a keystone in the fundamental development of any golfer.The techniques and concepts Penick provides us in \\"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book\\" are the fundamental aspects that the golf swing is based on. If you are picking up a golf club for the first time this book will help build you a foundation to work from. Likewise if you have been playing for years, this book will reinforce the foundation you have already built.ReferencesPenick, H. & Shrake, B. (1992).

Easy download to my husband's Kindle and being a golfer, he found it very interesting. Now to get his wife to read it!"},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"Harvey Penick wrote his masterpiece with this book, a simple, common terms, way to understand all you ever needed to know about golf. In an age of technical, computer, look-alike golf swings, Harvey Penick wrote a book that the common man can understand.I have used the thoughts and tips from Harvey's book for over five years now, and it has done nothing but help me become a better golfer, and student of the game. Harvey's tips are great not only for amateurs, but are used by professionals as well. This book is the bible of golf books, a starting point for anyone interested in the game, or interested in getting better.I know people who read this book every year getting ready for the golf season, and it does nothing but help them with their game. Some of the best parts of this book are when Harvey shares anecdotes from his life, which are always filled with humor and applicable to the golf world, and life.Harvey Penick was a mad who had integrity, and that is why his legacy lives on. This book is highly recommended to golfers, and non-golfers who might just catch the golf bug after reading this book."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"If I could compare this book to a golf swing, I would say the set-up and approach looked good, but the writing fell apart through the impact zone and follow through.There is a lot of praise out there for Harvey Penick, and based upon the numerous comments in the book's forward by the well-known golfers he mentored, I have no doubts that the praise is well warranted. Unfortunately, while Penick himself in the book's introduction sets up his \\"Little Red Book\\" as a lifetime's masterful compilation of golf wisdom and best kept secrets finally made public, the book fails to live up to the author's own advertising and is a bit disappointing.A fair amount of down-to-earth tips, techniques, and golfing philosophy that Harvey had applied to his students are shared in the book. And if just one of those tips can improve one's golf game, then I would say the book is worth the price. But too often, the \\"Little Red Book\\" comes off as an exercise in name-dropping and rambling golf anecdotes, many of which are not all that interesting nor amusing. It pains me to say that, knowing what a revered figure Harvey Penick has been to some in the golfing community, but that is just my honest assessment.What also disappointed me about this book was that although Harvey Penick gives a couple of concessions to the virtue of humility, there appears to be a somewhat bragadocious quality to the narrative. That would be more excusable if the \\"Little Red Book\\" was in fact packed from cover to cover with the invaluable tips Penick promises in this introductory chapter, but that is not the case. Here is a short example of what I am talking about:In the chapter titled \\"First Things First,\\" Harvey writes about a man who came to his country club seeking out \\"this famous teacher, this Penick fellow.\\" The man says if Harvey is \\"such a great teacher\\" perhaps he can give some advice on how to get out of sand traps. Harvey 's response - which abruptly ends the brief chapter - is something to the effect that it is better not to get into sand traps to begin with...a response that is not only rather obvious but neither practically helpful nor particularly clever.That exemplifies too much of the tone of this book, which is unfortunate, because there are some good down-to-earth visualization techniques and other bits of instruction, which, if solely focused upon, would have made this a far better and more useful read."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"This little collection of wisdom from Harvey Penick has become the best selling sports book of all time. Which just goes to show you, when it comes to golf instruction, less really is more.Penick proves you don't need stop-action photography and a lot of technical nonsense to have a great golf book. His simple observations are far more valuable. Even when Penick is addressing a complex mechanical issue, such as the position of the right elbow, he uses language and images that everyone can understand. His entire approach to the mental game is summed up in two pages on \\"positive thinking,\\" and his advice on putting is priceless.So if you feel like you're getting overloaded with too much information, put everything else away and pick up the little red book."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"Harvey's little book is well worth it. I am new to golf, but I found the metaphors and stories to be very helpful. It is not as direct as many golf books, but it is wise. I found good information on the swing, bunker play, practice, and many others. Penick has firm opinions on many golf matters, but these are generated by a lifetime of golf and observation. If you have been whacking away on the driving range, this book could really help. It helped me to stay focused on fundamentals. John"},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"In evaluating this book, it's important to note what it is, and what it isn't.It isn't a straightforward instructional book. It's very non-linear; for example, the grip is not discussed until page 30, and the stance until page 110. Instead, this is more a book of collected observations about the game, its pleasures and pains, its pitfalls and secrets for success, and its personalities.Another thing it is not: a classically well-written book. After all, Harvey was a golf teacher, not an author (it appears that -- to his credit -- co-author Shrake allows Harvey's voice to come through, instead of completely rewriting his thoughts). What ultimately results is a slim volume full of both anecdotes and helpful tips (I have worked my way out of swing problems many times by going back to the Little Red Book).A complete instructional guide to the game? No. This is a modest work -- very appropriate to the quiet and gentle man who taught a U.S. Open champion, a Masters champion, and hundreds or thousands of lesser-known golfers whose ability and appreciation for the game were enhanced by their having known Harvey Penick."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"The greatness of Harvey Penick is not in his vast knowledge of golf but in his knowledge of people. He took the same pride in teaching some of the greatest pros as he did in teaching first time golfers. He would only tell a player what they needed to improve and it would never be the same thing from golfer to golfer. He would never allow others to observe him with another student for fear they would hear something that did not apply to that players game. It is that fear which kept him from writing a book. The fear that readers would take to heart the wrong advise.However, this book is a work of art that stays far away from that fear. As art it stays away from the science which is so easily misinterpreted. There are no pictures, drawings or physics. There is only the best advise available on the game.As you read this book you will read about how some of the best players approach the game and how beginners can find their way into it. You will read about some of the history of the game. There are descriptions that simplify the most complex things about the swing. And there is one page written just for you. Harvey had a knack of telling golfers just what they needed to hear when they needed to hear it, wherever they were in their development. Somehow that magic lives on in this book. You will enjoy everypage in this book, but at somepoint you will drop this book grab your clubs and head out the door having just read just what you needed to make a difference in your game.Read everybook you can but come back to this one. It is the grain of salt to go with all other advice."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"This book is a wondeful adventure for anyone involved with golf.

The man's name is Harvey Penick. The book he wrote is called;&quot;Harvey Penickcs Little Red Book.&quot; The main theme of the story is mmainly to tell about the golfing and teaching life of Harvey Penick. Harvey Penick had a little red book where he would write down the notes on what is changing or progressing in a students golf game. Harvey would also write down his golf tips in his book. Harvey had a series of books. This bok is one of many books he wrote. Harvey Penick wrote another book called,&quot;The Game For a Lifetime.&quot; That book he could not complete because he passed away before he could. Tom Kite one of his best friends took over and finished the book for him. He just used the knowledge he had gained from Mr. Penick. I couldn't tell you the whole story because alot of it is on the teaching of golf. What I can tell you are the little things such as, Harvey had a son named Tinsley, and a wife named Helen. Harvey was born in Austin,Texas.Harvey was the head pro at the Austin Country Club. He worked there until 1975 and held the job for fifty years. After that his son had taken over his position.Harvey, after he retired, decided to hang around the country club and teach whoever wanted to be taught about golf. I don't want to give away all the aspects about Harvey Penick. If you would like to know more on this amazing man you'll have to read his book for yourself. The book is only about 180 pages long.

It really lacks a lot of technical details but I will say Penick makes it a point that he is not an overly technical teacher. He does mention \\"the move\\" about turning the hips to the left and tucking the right elbow to the body (the tucking of the right elbow is not explicityly mentioned in Hogan's five fundamentals, Hogan explains it with the downswing plane). If you really want to learn how to play golf I'd say read Hogan's five fundamentals.

If you take golf a little too seriously, read this."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"This book should be read in conjunction with taking lessons from a qualified professional instructor. Its message is a valuable one, but not so much for the beginning golfer, and the book is quite clear in stating as much.. At no time does the book pretend to be an instructional guide for those who've never played the game."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"I was told that Harvey Penick was one of the most influential teachers ever to instruct the game of golf. After reading this book, I know why. The stories he tells about players he has instructed over the years adds to the quality of the read. Never before have I read such a complete and thorough explanation of the games many facets. Speaking from personal experience, if you want to improve your game leaps and bounds in a short amount of time, read this book and apply everything said in it."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"The Little Red Book is the typical book you see on your buddies desk or sitting on a coffee table and cannot put it down.

You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"A great compilation of information on the game of golf, one of the best I have seen. Harvey Penick is a true master of the game and his experience shows through his stories. This book consists mainly short stories, ranging from a 1/4 page to four or five. I found that I most enjoyed the stories about people he encounters along his long journey through the game of golf. The tips and suggestions he makes make complete and logical sense, especially if the problems you are experiencing are talked about. I know my game has certainly improved with help from this book, if not physically, mentally. It makes you more aware of the environment and what is going on around you. This book just makes the game of golf that much more enjoyable. I have played golf for about four years and am a fifteen handicapper. I love the game and played all of summer vacation except for two days. This book has shown me another side of the game of golf I had previously not totally seen. When I go out and play now, I notice things that I have never noticed before. The way the sun hits the greens around dusk and how the mist swirls over the tee box in the morning. That is what kind of book this is. The kind of book that opens the minds of hackers everywhere. I highly recommend this to any player of the most mentally challenging sport ever played by men and women alike."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"I was told this was a phenomenal book, but had always approached golf instructional books with the attitude &quot;I need to see a picture of the perfect swing&quot; before I would consider it. After listening to Harvey Penicks The Little Red Book, I now understand, his words are worth a thousand pictures. I have listened to the audio several times and each time I picked up something new. Quite possibly it's the best book I've ever heard. Matthew Sedlacek"},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"I started playing this great game almost 40 years ago. For a time I was playing 2 to 3 days a week and was scoring consistantly in the 80s and occasionally in the 70s, although that was rare. About 10 years ago I quit playing, why I don't know. About 6 months ago a coworker persuded me to play a round with him and I was hooked again.We play once aweek and I don't have much time to practice. As a result I am strugling to find my swing again. I usually shoot in the 90s and occasionally higher. No matter how hard I try I couldn't break 90.Then I found this wonderful book. When I started reading I found I couldn't put it down. I finished it in a few hours. It was a pretty easy read but kept my interest. However I remember feeling a bit disappointed when I finished it. I didn't find any wonderful secret to fix my swing , or so I thought at the time, just a lot of common sense suggestions. And a less radical approach to improving my game.The next day , (today as I write this review) I played 18 holes on a course I scored a 96 on 2 months earlier. The difference today was it is much colder, 35 degrees as we teed off. The greens were frozen solid from the overnight cold temps. It was impossible to hold a shot to the green longer than 70 yards. The ball would take one hop and over the green it went.Needless to say I didn't expect to score better than the last time out but when my round was finished I had an 83. I'll say again an 83. WOW, that's at least 10 strokes better than my average and 13 strokes better than the last round played in better conditions.What happened? I'm not sure, but I know it was because of this book.Harvey's approach is to fine tune what you are already doing, not to radically change your swing, and that, I think, was the reason for my remarkable round. And keep this in mind. I didn't have time to practice what I found in the book. I fully expect to break 80 next year with a little practice.If I was a highschool golf coach this would be required reading for everyone on my team. If you haven't read this book do it soon. you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"Yes....that's right....I said it is one of the greatest books ever written on golf and I stand by that....I first read it years ago, and ya know when I read it most recently? Last week! My golf game was struggling...anyone who plays knows there is so much technical jargon to think about, and once all these thoughts enter your head, you're done for! That's where the legend Mr. Penick comes in. Forget about rotating this part of your body 90 degress and your ankle must be at a 32 degree angle and so forth....Take dead aim! Get the negativity out of your head, remember a few SIMPLE methods to hit the ball, and as Taylor Made once advertised, Find Your Game! My game was gone...I was hopeless and didn't know what to do with myself....I saw the book on my shelf, read it (very easy read), and my next opponent better be ready! If you love golf, and you wanna read a book that just makes sense (and provides a lot of inspiration) this book is highly recommended. A man's entire life experience with the game he loved is in this book...treat it with respect...heed the words....and the next putt you drop you might find yourself looking up at the heavens saying &quot;thank you Harvey!&quot;"},{"Title":"Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings From a Lifetime in Golf","review":"I kind of like this book for an easy read about golf. Penick records a stream-of-consiousness flow of thoughts about golf and golfers and things links-related. I wouldn't go here for any kind of technical advice, but for just thinking about the game, it's a good read. And one of the things about golf is the mystique and the thoughts that surround the game as we are all reminded that we never really win; the course always wins!

I read the book because I was told it is a good example in marketing and business management ideals. I don't even play golf! I was able to apply Harvey Penick's words to attitudes and approaches to life though! He not only teaches what he has learned about golf during his long rich life, but he also teaches a philosophy in how to live one's life. His methods of evaluating the actions of his students and sharing what he has learned in an effort to improve thier lives is obvious to me. He refuses to use negative impressions in his teachings. Instead, he accentuates the positive. He educates by guiding his students instead of \\"teaching\\" them. I love his ability to teach with images, parables and metaphors. His chapter \\"First Things First\\" about the golfer who wanted to get out of sand traps is great! After all, the problem is not always what you think.

This is a manifestation of the complexity of our world and the way humans deal with it; no matter how deep you go, there are still questions and mysteries. Some subjects are easier to study than others, but the academic who studies pornography is up against some particular problems. Lisa Z. Sigel should know. She is a professor of history who has previously written _Governing Pleasures: Pornography and Social Change in England 1815 - 1914_. In the introduction to the current book for which she is editor, _International Exposure: Perspectives on Modern European Pornography 1800 -2000_ (Rutgers University Press), she notes particular problems in the study of the subject. It is often hard to find complete collections from which to draw primary material; research on cinematic pornography might simply be illegal in some places; it is hard to get grants to do such studies; and \\"few other historical sources can so quickly get scholars arrested at customs.\\" There are, however, intrepid academics who are slogging through for us, and _International Exposure_ brings together ten of them with diverse subject matter. Sigel justifies the endeavor: pornography is a vigorous commercial activity, it provides information about types of sexual behavior by time and place, and it indicates cultural attitudes toward sexuality. Nonetheless, most of the chapters here indicate the need for further resources and study about how pornography is produced and used. If you find detailed and academic examinations of aspects of the subject interesting, you will find much here to enjoy. The themes are a grab bag, as befits an edited volume. Initial chapters have to do with Germany, England, and France in the nineteenth century; there are chapters on early twentieth century England and France as well as contemporary Britain; three on post-communist Russia, Ukraine, and Hungary; and finally a chapter on the borderless cyber-world.In an examination of obscenity laws in the German states in the first half of the nineteenth century, it is disconcerting to find few German works on the wrong side of the law that we would consider anything close to pornographic now. Books that had sexual themes even without descriptions of physical intimacy were considered obscene if they depicted an unstable social world or women who were seductresses unworthy of a man's trust. One chapter traces how the image of the flogged slave was used by abolitionists, and since the image was sadder (or more arousing), the slave was generally a female. This sort of BDSM play is very common; that it might be directly related to the slave trade is something I doubt many participants acknowledge. Sigel's own chapter is on pornography that depicted incest in Edwardian England, and gives a brief history of incest laws and the philosophy behind them. Novels on the theme proved to be a charade about the family, with mothers restricting sexuality, daughters as both eager tempters and victims, and fathers as otherwise fully respectable gentlemen. The paternal perpetrator in the charade was freed from responsibility and any taint of violence. In the chapter on the Hungarian pornographic film industry, we learn that stag films were first turned out as early as 1899; pornography has so often spurred communication technology that elsewhere Sigel says that \\"it has become a clich&eacute;d claim that pornography spearheaded the growth of Internet technologies.\\" Hungary was exporting stag films by 1910, but was displaced as a center for production by other countries. Budapest has recently risen as \\"the center of the porno world,\\" with filmmakers from around Europe coming to Hungary to make \\"Budaporn.\\" One observer wrote, \\"Pornography is an industry for Hungary, not a tragedy.\\"The tone of each chapter is serious, with plenty of references and footnotes, but given the subject matter, there is wit on display; in discussing \\"shemale\\" porn, for instance, there is reported a climactic surprise unveiling \\"as the beautiful \`girl' with feminine curves and soft skin is dramatically revealed to be genitally and often priapically male.\\" I have only mentioned here the chapters I found most interesting, but each of the ten throws its light on aspects of a large subject that no one can doubt stirs a deep human interest. There is little titillation here, much intellectualizing, and lots to think about."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Of all the countless, thousands of books I have read, &quot;Johathan Livingston Seagull&quot; is my number one favourite book. It is so much more than a simple story about a seagull who learns to spread his wings and fly. The book can have many individual interpretations, depending on how you relate to it, and to me that is the magical wonder of this beautiful, inspirational book. For each one of us, the book has its own personal meaning. To me, it is about personal freedom and having the courage to be the person you want to be; the freedom to become all that you were meant to be, not what someone else expects you to be. It is about spiritual freedom and how our fate on this Earth, and in whatever worlds may follow, is determined by the choices we make. As a parent, it is about learning to let go, for giving your children &quot;wings,&quot; is the greatest gift they will ever receive. By setting them free, when they are no longer yours to hold, you are giving them the freedom to grow and the dauntless courage, strength and independence to fly on their own in an uncertain world.I have read this book so many times throughout the years that the pages are dog-eared and worn. The book is short, but the powerful lesson and message contained in these few pages is one many people never learn in an entire lifetime, no matter how many lifetimes they may live."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"It was over a decade ago that I began my spiritual journey of transformation. For all those years, in all the self-help bookstores I dropped in on, I found a copy of Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Not once did I even pick it up. Then, one fateful day, I held it in my hands, opened it up, and began to read. And read. And read. Wow! What a beautiful book about the awakening of the soul, about soaring with spirit! This is a book about the courage to fly free, about the courage to throw out the shackles of society that keep us down, about realizing that this life is not about what you are given, but about what you do with those gifts.

It's a very spiritual book, it not only tells you to do your best, but also that you should connect with the things you can actually see on earth before you try to understand what you can't see. Richard Bach writes this book based on methaphors which in my opinion are used very wisely. It's a very short book, but it gets the point accross which is what a book or any publication should do."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I can't remember how I first heard about the existence of this book, but boy am I glad I found it. It was first published before I was born, but it's one of those classic books that will last for generations. Although it's incredibly simple (only about 90 pages, many of them featuring simple illustrations of seagulls), it's the content that shines. A beautiful, inspiring story of perseverance, determination, going for your dreams and being true to your heart. Don't let anyone tell you you CAN'T do what you dream of. Anything is possible, even the impossible.I don't know how widely distributed this book is, but I think it should be given to each and every child in school. It should be required reading. It's simple enough for children to read and comprehend. A truly beautiful little book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I read this little book in my late teens, and i never saw seagulls the same way again. I would always look to see whether a Jonathan Livingston was among them :)Years later i read a series of books, The Wave by Laura Knight Jadczyk, which reminded me of this one: perhaps all there is in life - and after this life - is lessons. And for some - people or seagulls - just eating and sleeping is not enough; they will always strive to learn the truth about themselves and the truth about life and its meaning, and about love.In the words of Bach: \\"...his own way of demonstrating love was to give something of the truth that he had seen to a gull who asked only a chance to see truth for himself.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Many will pan this masterpiece by Richard Bach as fuzzy and warm. But it is Jonathan Livingston Seagull's simplicity which allows the book to be vulnerable in this respect. However, this vulnerability, this love, allows it to soar.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull embodies the principle of mind over matter. He inspires us to push ourselves into the realms where our dreams are in reach.

We can take Jonathan with us in whatever we endeavour. Whether it's to run that extra km or the bravery to try out a new idea in business, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an essential read. \\"No Lmits\\"."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Mostly everyone got this book for their children or for personal inspiration. I am 17 and found a less 'childrens' book attitude. Maybe I have a biased opinion or something but I found a little bit of a deeper meaning. I found the whole novel somewhat metaphorical to homosexuality. The way Jonathan is outcasted from his flock (society) and forced to live with only his kind. When he learns to love both himself and the others that misunderstood himself he decides to go back to his original 'earth'. He finds Flecther who also shares his past self. He teaches him and others.

I feel that nothing other than such a blunt remark justifies my feelings towards this mish-mash of bogey, high-faultin' pretention and early 70s self-help gibberish. Clearly, this tripe hooked on to the swinging trend of cascading times when mid-life crisis was hitting people from 16 to 76. It will take the reader about an hour to puff through the briefness on nothingness with such inspired pages like &quot;Johnathan Livingston Seagull flies!&quot; on a page with a picture of the bird soaring off high into the sky. Real deep. The basic, Scientology inspired motivation is keen wrapped around something passed off by its publisher as literature about you and me and us and them when, in reality, it is about Richard Bach's own trifling human insecurities and his pompous belief that if he feels it, we all do.

All you need to do to make this similar to something from the Bible is switch a few words around; I don't enjoy that sort of allegory. (Jonathan, also known as Son of the Great Gull?) And then, a lot of the meanings behind this story are dead cliches; &quot;do what you love and you will be happy.&quot; Give me a break here; if you want a little religious didactic story that's fun and expository and by Bach, read &quot;One.&quot; Skip this one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Of all the thousands of books (on all the many topics and themes) I've read in my life, this has to be the single biggest piece of drivel I have ever had to endure.Given to me as a present, I assumed it was some vanity press self-help crap.

Here I am thirty-eight years after the first publication date reviewing this powerful classic. Why is this little story about a seagull such a powerful read? What makes this tale of a nonconforming gull so timeless?I'll confess, I read Jonathon Livingston Seagull when it was first released in 1970. Part of me \\"got it\\" and the other part was trying to figure out why there were so many pictures of seagulls? Then, came the movie sound track written and recorded by Neil Diamond. That was it - I was a \\"believer!\\" I got the message big time. I realized that with effort and belief, I could potentially conquer the world.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a seagull with ambitions to fly higher, faster and farther than a seagull is supposed to fly. As a consequence of his expressed ambitions, the gull leadership expels him from the flock. Disappointed but undeterred, he leaves but becomes a teacher to other gulls with similar ambitions. A large number of pictures of seagulls in action are used to press home the points.Jonathan Livingston Seagull is the personification of any human who has aspired to do break out of the herd and do great things that others consider \\"irresponsible.\\" Once shunned from the flock, he becomes the leader and educator of an alternative group that clearly will soar higher and further than the flock he was expelled from. It is a good lesson about life expressed in an unusual and entertaining manner."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"What can I say of Jonathan Livingston Seagull that doesn't make me smile..From being referenced as Jonathan myself by family members to re-reading the book at every life milestone, this book has been a part of my life.It doesn't matter if you believe in idealism or realism. JLS enables us all to believe in much more than flying. We can reach new heights only if we try. We can challenge the status quo only if we believe in ourselves.Even if you have read this book before, try reading it again. You will find something different this time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book beautifully shows us why it is difficult to break out of the crowd mentality and that allows us to be compassionate with ourselves when we get stuck. It shows us where the crowd mentality comes from which gives us greater understanding of our fellow souls that seem intent on keeping us in the crowd and from that understanding we can be more compassionate towards them. But most importantly it shows us how to break free of the crowd and how we bless ourselves and the whole of creation by doing so.The greatest gift that you can give the world is to heal yourself.The story is short and yet so deep that you may never see the bottom, therefore it speaks to everyone on all levels. As folk point out, you can read it in one afternoon and it will be with you forever.What have you got to lose?"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Every five to seven years I re-read this book and each time the intrinsic meaning of the book changes for me.

I was directed to read it in 1991 and to this day it serves as a symbol of belief to me. It reminds me that we are all capable of so much more if we believe we are and do what it takes to make it happen and especially if we dont let ourselves be sidetracked by doubters. In fact a seagull is the centre piece of my company logo. Sometimes I think books come our way at a partiucllay meaningful time to ourselves which is perhaps why this book seems to attract such varied reviews I loved it and also enjoy the spin off movies and sound track. Every time I see a seagull soaring high in the sky it brings a surge of 'joy' to me"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a simple, yet profound little book suitable for all age groups. It's a story about living life with great expectations, boundless dreams, and belief in oneself. It teaches the key lessons we all need to learn and practice in our daily lives. It's psychological, spiritual, inspirational, and emotional; above all it's the Truth. Jonathan and his family of seagulls teach the reader follow their dreams, escape the ordinary, and transcend the limits of the ego. Spread your wings and join the Flock in their fast paced spiritual adventure to the pinnacle of success; success which is defined by one's inner self rather than the society that surrounds us."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is the first Richard bach book I read and I was in grade school.

Told from the point of view of a seagull, the author uses his knowledge of flight to frame this tale of a quest for perfection. This tale also points to the importance of sharing knowledge with others, even the unwilling, and stresses the importance of compassion, love and example. A quick read, this fable packs quite a few lessons into a small package, all without becoming overly preachy."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"To start, i must say i loved this book.

After reading the book, I view us in society as the flock, and many of us are curios to learn about something different that may not be socially accepted or is beyond our understanding. The problem is we do not have guidence as the gulls do in the book from Jonathan. That being how I compared it to life, I still belive it is a valuble book to read because it can motivate us to strive to learn what we have a passion for and to share our knowlede. After reading about what a great gull Jon was we woiuld like to picture oursleves more like him, and it can influence the way we view life. This can only be a good thing! So, I recommend you read this if you haven't!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I first read this title as a serial magazine story, in a flying periodical. As short as it is, the story was presented in four or five installments. Like most pilots I could fly forever without any other purpose than to \\"punch holes in the sky\\", so the book immediately struck a cord. My wife gave me the hard cover edition some years later, and I've reread it many times. The lesson to follow ones dreams is plane and up front. The fact that life is short is reflected in the length of the story. The presentation of bias to the point of segregation even violence is a lesson we all could learn, but as old as the story of Joseph's coat. I have been tempted to pass the story on to my grand children, but the denial of Heaven and with it God, would be in violation of everything in me that's Christian."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I first read this book while in college.

He transcends the paradigm imposed on him by the other seagulls and is banished from living with them. He pushes himself to be the very best that he can be, and eventually he is lead to a place full of other seagulls like himself, who desire to grow and learn all they can. He meets a great teacher who shows him how to transcend even the laws of space and time, and Jonathon Livingston Seagull ends up taking his place as a teacher. He eventually returns to a land of seagulls like the ones who banished him. He shows them his abilities and teaches the ones that will listen to him. It is a very short book, but it leaves you with a lot to think about. It is a very effective metaphor of growth and personal enlightenment that reaches a wide audience. I highly recommend taking a look at this book. It inspires you to push yourself to greater heights and it causes you to examine your own paradigms."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"My father purchased this book for me when I was a child although I did not really grasp what the story was about until recently. The story is inspirational and I think it was a great experience to have read it as a child and now reread it decades later. The book is a short, quick read so it is appropriate for anyone but I think the importance of it may be lost on a lot of people until later in life. For anyone who has experienced adversity or likes inspirational tales, I definitely recommend picking up this book. It is not a huge time commitment and has a huge reward relative to the small amount of time necessary to complete the read. My suggestion is to read it once a year!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Bought this book for my sons's 15th birthday. He enjoyed reading it.

People keep saying that this story is unrealistic because seagulls aren't intelligent enough to reach a state of perfectness, but this story isn't about birds.

It contained good descriptions of the characters and explored the religious outlook of a young gull striving to better his kind. I strongly believe that, although shunned by his kind, Johnathan had the right idea. Richard Bach is an excellent author."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":": Richard Bach takes Jonathan Livingston Seagull to a level of thought that few are able to attain. Although Jonathan tells others that any can attain the level he has achieved, the majority shun him being unable to give up their old and limited ideas - ideas which have been accepted for generations.This was and is a wonderful story; however, Bach does not provide many new concepts to indeed challenge his readers. If you would like to attain the level Jonathan Livingston Seagull achieved, then I would recommend the book An Encounter With A Prophet. This book will indeed challenged accepted beliefs; and provide new and enlarged concepts in the areas of religion, psychology and philosophy - ideas to replace the limited beliefs which are now accepted by and binding the majority of people today.If you have the courage to leave the old behind and attain a new level of thought get this book. It provided me with concepts which allowed me let go of my old limited ideas and soar!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"this is a book for all to read. i read it first at age eight when it was only an animal adventure. have read it many, many times since and own a dog-eared copy. i am only 18 now, but already it has caused changes in the way i think and live as a young adult. i thank richard bach for his profound understanding of the cosmos and relating of it that all can understand. i encourage all to read it. if you don't understand it the first time, keep on reading it or try some of his other books, such as Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah, There's No Such Place As Far Away, Bridge Across Forever(sort of a sequel to Illusions), Kahlil Gibran's &quot;The Prophet,&quot; or Trina Paulus's &quot;Hope For the Flowers&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I purchased this book to read to my children, delighted with the story of diligent striving to accomplish a goal based on an aspiration in spite of cultural bias that first laughed at then reacted violently against the aspiration. After different readings it gave my kids the opportunity to talk about segregation, another time about punk rock, another time about eating habits--such variety engendered by a simple seagull. The quiet, overlay photographs were a pleasant addition that I appreciated--I've had too much of garish cartoonish illustrations in my children's books. The book continues to well serve its original purpose. However, now each time I read it, or read it to friends (adults), it grows in meaning. Bach's message that we are more than we ourselves often recognize (physically, intellectually, spiritually, and metaphysically) is far from subtle, once noticed; it is evident in every scenario his seagull hero suffers through. I saw the movie (awful) years ago, so only recently picked up the book. Neil Diamond's orchestration suits the book much better than the movie. The book is easy to read, and perfect for periodic rereading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I'm giving away my age when I reveal that I first read this in my mid-twenties in 1974 , when it was the 'runaway' best-seller in the land.

If you are a 'seeker', Jonathan will show you how to 'fly' as high as you wish to go.

The story of a seagull named Jonathan Livingston who soon becomes an outcast that desires to discover the meaning of flight is pretty gripping. As he works his way through all new types of flight, you begin to find hidden meanings that Richard Bach leaves for you.

I read this book after reading a large numeber of new age and transcendal lit., such as the celestine prophecy, Dr. Dyer's books, Castaneda, etc. And I cried and I was filled with joy. I was elated to have read such an allegory, when the time was right for me to read it. I believe that we, as friends, parents or siblings, should not &quot;force&quot; this reading onto anyone, but maybe just mention it, and allow for every person to choose the right time to read it, be they a child, adolescent or an adult.

Even after everyone put him down and told him that he couldn't. So that right there was why i liked this book so much. It was also written very well.

A Seagull, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, discontent with squawking and pecking for food, finds himself outcast from the brotherhood. Believing that there is more to life than \\"flying to eat,\\" he spends his time in isolation, determined to find what that is.This book is not about seagulls - it is about life. It is about conformity, for conformity's sake. It is about breaking out of that mold that we are forced into. It is about the Spirit that is within us all, if we dare to chance a peek.We can live our entire lives - squeezing ourselves into someone else's idea of what it means to be successful, rich, powerful, happy. Or we can find what these mean for ourselves, if we spread our wings and fly!Jonathan teaches us to *be*; to practice perfection in whatever form it may manifest. Jonathan also shows us that this may not be easy, however,"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I read this little book in my late teens, and i never saw seagulls the same way again. I would always look to see whether a Jonathan Livingston was among them :)Years later i read a series of books, The Wave by Laura Knight Jadczyk, which reminded me of this one: perhaps all there is in life - and after this life - is lessons. And for some - people or seagulls - just eating and sleeping is not enough; they will always strive to learn the truth about themselves and the truth about life and its meaning, and about love.In the words of Bach: \\"...his own way of demonstrating love was to give something of the truth that he had seen to a gull who asked only a chance to see truth for himself.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I liked this book. 'Twas warm, and fuzzy, too. Fact is, I liked it the FIRST time I read it-- when it was called &quot;Anthem&quot;.

I suppose just telling people what they want to hear has sales potential, if nothing else."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a timeless tale about a seagull seeking perfection in flight, and, along the way, learns something about loving and transcendence.Okay, that sounds weak the way I say it...Really, it is a touching story about being the best you can be, while not letting others stop you in following your dreams. From Jonathan's beginnings of becoming an Outcast of gull society for the love of flying to his return to the Flock, the reader is swept away by the charming parable and empathizes with Jonathan's plight. You will gush over this book (as I probably am in this review).Who should read this? A better question is &quot;who shouldn't?&quot; It's short enough to read to your children at night (it may take two or three nights), or for an adult to read in an afternoon. The powerful message to &quot;be the best you can be and live true to your dreams&quot; carries across generations and cultures and is always worth hearing.Overall, this is an extremely uplifting, clever, and wonderful book. Just be warned: do not buy just one copy! This book is guaranteed to be one that you will want to share with your friends, family, and coworkers. I'd hate to see you to be without it while your book was on loan. You never know when you might want to &quot;gush over a gull&quot; yourself..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"\\"Johnathan Livingston Seagull\\" gave me something which hardly any other book has given: a sense of flight.This story has an abundant sense of exhilaration which is literally absent from most of contemporary literature.While dealing with the theme of the genius against society, &quot;JLS&quot; is fundamentally a metaphor of how man can reach God. It is a little surprising that no reviewer has mentioned the religious significance of this story.The message it carries actually could be elaborated into a grand philosophic vision which can change the very essence of religion and man's conception of God and Heaven. (Johnathan Seagull has been called \\"the son of the great gull\\").\\"JLS\\" goes to the root of the psychology &amp; character of the lonely genius, the path-breaker and presents it in terms of the essentials : his loneliness; his devotion to the truth; his constant pursuit of higher &amp; higher levels of achievement &amp; self-realization; his complete disregard for security &amp; comfort; his thirst of appreciation; his fearlessness with respect to challenging the unknown &amp; not-attempted; his uncompromising integrity. All this is given to you in a capsule in the form of a symbolic tale.It depicts the relationship of the rebel, the non-conformist, the innovator with society and shows that it is the man of independence, genius and vision - he who disagrees and disobeys (and often appears rude &amp; ruthless) who has a tremendous sense of benevolence and goodwill towards humanity - that it is precisely such a man who desperately yearns to share the higher truths of life discovered by him, and his newfound vision, with mankind - and it is precisely such men who are ostracized and condemned; that it is those who break the rules who have benefited mankind much more than those who cling to tradition.&quot;JLS&quot; conveys a lot more: the view that unwavering devotion to one's values, confidence and self-esteem can help one overcome any barrier-that no obstacle is insurmountable - that the Highest can be achieved and the tremendous sense of joy at having achieved one's goals and the best within oneself.This book shall lift your spirits and encourage you to take a new, enraptured view of life, of this world, of God, of MAN.Definitely, one of the best stories of recent times."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is one of those books where it probably was better to have read it when it came out, in the era of the 1970s, in the United States. It\`s better as a story one would read to their child because it does have some interesting points to be made albeit cliches we already know. But I also concur with some of the other critics that it is a bit overly done with the \\"do whatever you fell like\\" mentality, which I find to be destructive in the long term for a society. Just look at the current state of affairs in the States now (as of the writing of this review 2012) as we see what was once a great country is now faltering in so many ways, which is a direct result of the \\"do what you feel\\" philosophy.

It's about a seagull who shuns the social conventions of his flock to pursue his love of flying.The book is divided into three parts, beginning with a predictable follow-your-dreams story and then moving into an Eastern-style cycle of self-perfection and reincarnation, and then there's some business about love and forgiveness tossed in at the end.Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a short book, but even within these confines Bach does little to give the book much ambition or depth. The seagull flies this maneuver, the seagull flies that maneuver, the seagull spouts some platitude about transcending reality. There's no sense of setting, no real insight - just flying birds and superficial philosophy. Bach's writing is otherwise unimpressive. There's at least one continuity issue, and it does feel rather absurd that these birds have such amazingly accurate internal speedometers (Bach rather belabors that point).Munson's photographs of seagulls and beachscapes help to set the mood, but the low quality in which they are reproduced in every version of the book I've ever seen just doesn't do them justice.

It is a &quot;step back and realize&quot; book about life in it's entirety. After reading and thinking of this work, one can truly understand simplicity and happiness. &quot;Very moving&quot; is the first comment in my mind when I think of this book. I read it first when I was 11 years old and have read it at least once a year since, It keeps a heart and soul alive with hope for the future. It is a very quick read due to its brevity, but the thoughts stirred by it will last a lifetime.Mr. Bach, Thank you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"No genius comes from usual challenge. When I was in teenagers, I could not get along with my classmate. I thought I was the different one. I was indulged to read my fictions, and never cared about the entrance exam. As a result, I failed, and it shamed my parents. I was so sad to kill myself.But I had no courage to do that.Afterwards, I found this book in the bookstore, then bought and read it peacefully.Gradually,the seagull, Jonathan,raised up my self-confidence.

I feel that this book is about setting realistic goals for yourself, and about touching excellence. The ideas in the book really related to my shooting career and opened up a whole new preception for me. I believe that this book should be required reading for anyone associated with any sport.

And the story has kept flying in my mind untill I get the audio-tape from my brother, some years later. So, I have duplicated several copies and share with other people. That was quit interesting because each person has created a particular idea of JLS. Now, I understand why, I suppose. JLS is an history of our growing process, and it, this way, relates to universal thruth. As a consequence according to your knowlegde basis or your spiritual &quot;level&quot; you have your picture of what JLS was about!And my dear friend, the story is about, I think, just the supreme energy that has created us and all that in 3D(material world) and energy universe.I will send you more, next time I take a time for that!I have a video-media and it stays at my office I frequently play it. It sometimes feels just as a God's love music.I thank you for sharing what JLS is about, and I hope for you a nice and wonderfull 1997.God's energy be always in your live!

Hands down. This book gives you wings not only to fly with but to free your own mind from the illusions of everyday life. The book focuses on Jonathon Livingston Seagull (big surprise) and his desire to learn to fly. Of course, this is strictly tabooed by the Flock, or other birds. His desire to fly and to learn to fly are symbolic of the love of learning. Flying isn't just another natural instinct but rather an art. Such an art also is language and this book is a Mona Lisa then."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"My children and I were talking about favorite books over dinner one night (children are 10,12 &18) when one of them asked me what my favorite book was.I am not an avid reader, so at first I could not really think of an answer. After a little thought, I remembered back to a book I read when I was in 5th grade - some 30 years ago, that really left an impression on me. Jonathan Livingston Seagull! My children all gave me blank looks - they had never heard of the book.That evening I logged on to Amazon.com and ordered the book. I am hoping we can read the book together, each taking a turn and reading a chapter outloud. (I remember the book being easy to read and fell that even the 10 year old can participate.)I hope it will be as memorable to my children as it has been to me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I related so powerfully to this book that I have allowed Richard Bach's words to shape my life. I believe strongly in the ideas that he proposes in this simple, short story -- that forging your own path is always the best option. I have done so in Jonathon Livingston style, serving as a woman in the nearly all male U.S. military branch, the Marines; skydiving, rock climbing, learning aerobatics in a Cessna, attending undergraduate college in Japan and now, attending graduate school in Egypt.The second message of Bach's book is not just to forge your own path, but to encourage others to do the same -- to choose their own paths and to inspire them to their own individual greatness. I try whenever and wherever I see possible to do so.Jonathan Livingston Seagull lives!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I do not understand how anyone could see anything valuable in this book. It is filled with inane, predictable cliches. I found myself laughing out loud on numerous occasions over the course of the book... Not because the author wrote something witty or clever - but because the book continued to reach new levels of stupidity. I would be worried if a book about a seagull who learned to &quot;fly real good&quot; despite peer-pressure ended up changing my life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I've read that this book, (Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull) was rejected by over 50 publishing houses before it was accepted. (and subsequently became a best seller)This was ground breaking stuff in 1970, but not so much now. However, I'd highly recommend this book as required reading for teens.My oldest daughter read it, and went on and read several other books by Bach.We are all spiritual beings - even seagulls! - and when we make material acquisitions (be it dead fish or large screen tv's) the end goal of our existence, we completely miss the mark and loose the message of our life's purpose.It's a great book with a timeless message."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I read this book at a time in my life when I aspired to become an excellent musician. It was extremely inspirational and somewhat destructive. It follows the silly North American idea of being &quot;the best&quot; at the cost of everything else in one's life. Striving to be the best at something is counter-productive and will leave you empty and frustrated. There is more to life than being the best flyer in the group or whatever. So it's inspirational for trying to achieve goals but leaves out the downside of missing out on life. But this book is *not* mindless psycho babble. It is an interesting allegory and a decent book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I read this book because it was on my list of \\"classics\\" I had never read.

If I ever have children this will be the first book I ever read aloud to them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Save your tab of acid or your years of meditation and become enlightened in just an hour or two by reading this book.Yes, it's a fable, using a seagull to tell a story rich with meaning. And it's the type of meaning that will vary according the individual personality of the reader and his or her goals and dreams.For me, this book showed me the relentless, self-improving, goal-driven perfectionist in myself. Whereas Jonathan was separated from his Flock in his pursuit of Flight, I found that my interpersonal and spiritual life decreased in proportion to my 100-percent attitude of all the way on, or all the way off and nothing in between. That in-between is balance, something people like me lack when they want to be the best in the world at something.But, as Clint Eastwood said in the movie \\"Magnum Force\\" -- \\"A man has got to know his limitations.\\" And we all have them.This book captures it all: Eastern thought, Buddhism, even Christ (if you choose to interpret it that way) -- it captures the Way: The way one lives and the way one ought to live. It shows what is really important in life.Follow Jonathan Gull in his journey as an independent free-thinker who doesn't want to be like everyone else in The Flock. Follow his evolution from finding Flight, to being Outcast, to finding teachers and then, to complete the circle, his becoming a teacher himself.It's a tiny book, befitting a fable. It shouldn't take more than an hour or two to read it. But it's a book you'll want to read time and again, and one you'll remember the rest of your life. What an outstanding achievement by Richard Bach."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I read this book for the first time forty years ago.

I don't think people approach it in a way that will vindicate them; this is a book of concept and emotion... yes, it has not-so-subtle references to religion, but the overall message is not one that can be spelled out as \\"BLAH BLAH I HAVE A CHIP IN MY SHOULDER AND THIS IS HIPPY CRAP.\\"This message is about self awareness and personal freedom. It's about being a leader AND a follower, and the appropriateness of being both. It's about being unafraid of being against the grain, when the choices you make ultimately only affect yourself. (Yes, others follow Jonathan Livingston Seagull, but it's only because they open their own eyes to their OWN potentials. Each bird makes their own decisions... just as each person does in life.)I pity each and every person who cannot appreciate the power of this short but moving novella."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Just as described and with speedy delivery, this was a great gift!

O.K., let's get something out of the way: this isn't great literature, nor is it a great story. This is a sermon, a parable, a mildly entertaining allegory about seeking a higher purpose in life, not simply living for food (or money or job or survival or routine -- whatever else Bach and you might substitute here). For young adolescents this is an easy read with a good message. As simple and easy to read as it is, it really doesn't surprise me that it sold so many copies. I have no idea what kind of editorial reviews this received when first published, but I suspect they were mostly critical of the message's simplemindedness. Bach isn't subtle, nor is he morally ambiguous. But then, I'm sure this really hit the spot for the idealistic flower power children at the time. I only wonder what Bach thinks of it now."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston is a seagull who spends an inordinate amount of time learning to fly in a way seagulls weren't designed to fly. Regardless of how many times Jonathan falters and embarrasses himself, he continues his relentless quest for flight perfection. Being an ordinary gull to him was lowering his standards much to much. He wanted to be able to fly like a falcon, a feathered projectile. To Jonathan, his pursuit of flight perfection was much more important than being a part of the flock so he continued to practice his unorthodox flying skills at the expense of being banished.People may call you crazy and you may lose friends; at any rate, anyone who chooses to \\"fight the system\\" or go \\"against the grain\\" will always find much opposition. If one wishes to live an easy life then by all means follow the crowd, fit in with everyone else and don't cause any friction. If you want to go beyond the call of duty to accomplish what few have ever done however, you must make many sacrifices and endure all kinds of hardships and setbacks.This is a very simple story and a simple lesson but nevertheless very important. Even if you're in your teens, twenties, thirties, forties, etc. You will find this story a good thing to keep at the back of your mind when you're down and things just aren't going too well in your life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"You sould read this book because it's very discriptive.There is tons of parts that relate to real life.There also is alot mediforical scences.this one part was &quot;When one of Jonh's students was flying.He was just about to hit a baby bird at 200 miles per hour.He moved fast to the left and prepared to hit a cliff.When he was sourounde by a white light.&quot; This relates to life by if you have a problem theres always a soulution,and another part was when jonathan described the feeling when he finaly got his nose dive pullout perfect he said&quot;It felt like heaven.

Life is to be pushed to the limit, and that is exactly what Jonathan does!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Courage, determination, perseverance, and dreams--these are the requisites to becoming oneself. Jonathan, the seagull, separates from the flock and becomes an outcast because of his dreams of perfection. . . . And he attains his goal; or rather he goes beyond what he initially thought was the ultimate flight of the gull.He returns to his flock, yet not with indignation nor with vengeance, but with compassion. In his journey towards perfection of the seagull, he, as if of necessity, learns the greatest and ultimate lesson--Love.Thus, he rounds out his education. While he began his journey of becoming himself via separation and differentiation, he truly becomes the seagull when he attains buddhahood-- enlightenment--and comes back to share his understanding and skills with the very tribe that ostracized him.With its timeless themes this classic is one of the most powerful stories of our time."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Personally, this book had a tremendous impact on me.

In Bach's little book, Jonathan resists that pressure and soars to great hights. When he achieves as much as he can he cannot help but share what he has learned with anyone who will listen.I read the book at least once a year. It's like a motivational booster shot for me.

Several years later, I remembered the book as a good book about seagulls, but read it again on the recommendation of a friend. I was astounded at the wisdom that was written within the words to this simple story of a seagull learning how to fly. For me it is a magical and has taught me much of the path of life. I have read this book perhaps a dozen times now at various stages of my life, and each time it answers a question about my life that had been unanswered for some time. Of all of Bach's books, \\"Jonathon\\" is the most magical book for me, \\"Illusions\\" also touches a deep chord with its magical words from the \\"Handbook of Life\\". And \\"Bridge Across Forever\\" awakened in me a quest for a special soulmate to share this adventurous journey called life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"As a teen, I treated this story literally (imagine the look on my physics teacher's face when I told him I understood 'terminal velocity', because of a story about a seagull).Well, the physics lessons are long gone, but the true essence of Richard Bach's work lingers forever - namely, those of us who choose to fly where other would squat, who seek the clear unfettered skies rather than settle for the fish scraps, who dare to break away from the rank and file and forge their own path, are more likely to look back on their life and proudly say: &quot;This I Have Done.&quot;The Moral of this story is undoubtedly: &quot;Fly with the Eagles (in this case Seagulls), or scratch with the Chickens.&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Being the 103rd reviewer of this wonderful book I do not think there is much more to say. However, I find something important missing from the other reviews (at least those I have read) and that is the notion of the &quot;liberation of desire&quot; as Sebastian Moore would say. I mean to say, we should be more open to realizing that the most important of Jonathan's characteristics was that he was the least affraid of learning ever... He trusted the mysteries of life. That was his source of courage to be an outcast."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A sort of self-help book,but in a different format.It tells us of a seagull called Jonathan who has an urge for studying, learns a lot. He was helped by a group of learned seagulls in his progress after a period of time(i.e.when he was invited to a new Flock and home after being made Outcast.) and finally gains spiritual enlightenment.Thus, he returned back to help the less fortunate seagulls in his former Flock.A good allegory, it teaches us the power of our thought and to control it.Also,If you like, you can read it as a fantasty story too."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Simply inspiring, one of the best reads for our soul and mind. It makes the reader conscious of the danger of self imposed limiting thoughts. Recently I found out that many of my friends share the same feeling about the book.

I first read this book 25 years ago and thought it no more than an interesting little read about a seagull who tried harder to succeed. Each time I read it as I get older, I recognised the deeper metaphors embedded within a supremely elegant piece of writing. Richard Bach challenges each of us to have and hold our personal vision, to believe in ourselves, to find and trust a mentor, to experiment until we succeed and to never give up on ourselves. If at first you don't see the meaning, put the book down and read it again five years later!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Ok, get this, like the seagull is the revolutionary who gets killed and then comes back to life to teach us all, like man the seagull is Jesus but he's also Buddha, you dig?And to pad out this lame storyline, Bach gives us a bunch of grainy pictures of birds.

Each time you read these 127 pages you rediscover a whole new meaning. Jonathan Livingston seagull is a world litterature classic, written concisely in plain, simple English. The simplicity of the narrative and the boldness of the style let the careful reader see between the lines that what is at stake in this book is something big, something fundamental to mankind, something you don't get away with the next day.The storyIt is the story of a bird that wanted to fly.It could be Le petit Prince, because Jonathan travels through the universes, see different birds, learn about himself and his condition and discover he is alone.It could be The catcher in the rye, for the little story of this bird reminds us of the time we too, were fleeing our Flock, because of incomprehension and anger.It could be the cavern of Plato, for no one wants to hear about what Jonathan have seen and understood. His discovery changed the meaning of his life in such a way he would not renounce it under a death threat. He will now live for it, or die.It could be Matrix Reloaded since Jonathan is pushing his physical limits so far he enters a new dimension in which more is possible. He learns he is everywhere and everything.It could be the Joconde for it is as mysterious as the Joconde, but unlike the Joconde you know why this book is a bestseller and why it has influenced so much people who read it.It could be this Spanish song heard on the radio yesterday:\\"I will resist, to stay aliveI will resist, although the winds of life are blowing hardI will resist, to stay aliveI will resist, until my dreams are broken to pieces\\"Because Jonathan Livingstone is risking his life against the winds to follow the tiny little star of hope he is the only one to see.Could Jonathan Livingstone seagull be Jesus Christ?

Well maybe I'm just not that deep, but I saw this as nothing but a story of a confused bird with an anxiety disorder. I'm sorry but the whole story was just a little too tough to swallow. By the way, I spent some time at the shore this summer, and I can assure you no seagull that I saw even remotely appeared to be as introspective and contemplative as JLS. Anyway, nice try Mr. Bach, but next time, let's make things a little more &quot;real world&quot;"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Okay, so I used to work for ForeverLiving.com, an MLM company (like Avon) in Scottsdale, AZ. Anyhow, when I came onboard, the company was still transitioning out their old company icon and stamping in their new one of an eagle. The old one used to be the exact image of a seagull as shown on this book's cover. The company's owner (a family owned business), Rex Maughan, told his customers he decided to change the icon image because he saw an eagle spiraling upward in the sky. But the truth was that he was sued by this author's family for using the book's signature image without written approval. Supposedly, Rex had a gentleman's agreement with the author; not something to keep attack lawyers at bay. After the author died, the man's family was running dry on the residual proceeds inherited by this book which is still in print and for sale. Whether they knew Rex Maughan is the 138th richest man in the world or they just knew he was rich, I don't know, but they took advantage of the situation, sueing Forever Living Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Though the settlement amount is a secret, it must have been a lot, even for a man so rich because this book that he used to help mass distribute to all his customers as a philosophical cornerstone of his business suddenly became banned. Not one copy is to be found anywhere on the premises and no one is allowed to speak of it, less they lose their job. I think, after having helped to sell so many more copies of this book when the buzz of it died in the literary community, he now resents the notion of helping even more copy to sell and benefit the greedy family that sued him.Because of all this drama, I finally got around to getting a copy and reading it. And well, it's okay; I guess. I wrote to both Rex and his son, Gregg, and told them I don't understand why it got so much buzz back in the 70s (so I heard). I agree with a quote I read from one critic that it's banal. Look up that word's definition; that was the right word to use. I believe some people enjoyed it because of the fantasy we may have that there's more to this world and our experience of it than we're aware of. Basically, this book will help you daydream of being able to move through time and space instantly, simply by willing it with your mind. It doesn't really give you a technique to try, in case you're wondering. Just practice, practice, practice, and you may eventually be able to experience something like being a god. Oh yeah; that reminds me - this book tries to tell you (in between the lines) that there is no God. Just you and your thoughts but that's enough for you to be your own god. That's why the Catholic Church shunned this book too when it 1st came out.This book is a short read. I forget how long it was but I read it in one evening's sitting."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The book was received in a timely manner and was in good condition as stated.

Renews nothing. A total waste of time (not much but still a waste)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A poor immitation of the New Testament (with animals behaving like people), the book has little to offer for an adult reader. The author, as a former pilot, has intimate knowledge of flying, but for others the goal is hardly attainable, and thus - of little value."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a very brief, easily readable tale about a young seagull who is always stretching beyond his limits. Never satisfied with being &quot;average&quot;, Jonathan wants to fly faster, wilder and better than any other seagull. Over the course of this short story Jonathan is enlightened about his own existence and teaches other gulls like him.This beautiful, heart-rending story is a page turner and a quick read. It is also well worth the time spent reading it and is a good story to keep nearby for reading again and again. I found that this book changed my perspective greatly. It's a very uplifting and heartening work.It's also interesting to note that Richard Bach wrote this story for a fellow friend of his, a pilot named Jonathan Livingston who died in the 1970's.This is a book about limits, precisely, about never letting them hinder you. It's a terrific story."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"It appears that most reviewers of this book read it in their youths at a time when their identities were still forming and when they were in craving inspiration and hope to aid their lackluster adolescent existences (keep in mind that adolescence does not necessarily end with the teenage years for oh so many people, as evidenced by some of the reviews). As with most identity-creating experiences most of these individuals are apparently loathe to let go of thier superficial first impressions of this book and in fact have only reinforced its significance with additional readings. One reviewer is so invested in this book's contribution to their selfness they have proudly proclaimed to have read it &quot;over 300 times&quot;. Is there any better example of how addiction to that which is comfortable eliminates opportunity for exposure to new ideas (I'm thinking of people who spend their lives reading only the bible). How can anyone get anything out of something when it is virtually the only thing they read. Aren't they curious about what else is out there? Apparently not, and so much the pity.It need not be surprising then that most Amazon.com reviewers of this book have done so long, long after forming their emotionally-fortified opinions of the book so that thier reviews are not really reviews at all, but rather emotional defenses of themselves as those whose very identities were in part formed by this short work. As a result those positive reviews tend to be long and detailed while the negative reviews - obviously written by people didn't get much out the book - tend to be short and lacking any significant detail making them very easy for dismissal by the &quot;loyalists&quot;.I on the other hand, at the age of thirty-five, have only just read the book for the very first time. Yes, I admit it is a bit of a surpise. As rediculously simplistic a message that this book contains, barely disguised as serious literature, it is a surprised that my high school didn't assign it as most school readings tended to have such two-dimensional messages (and also tended to swear the student off reading anything for a short time immediately following completion). I, on the other hand, although having obviously heard about the book for years, never crossed paths with a copy for the forty-odd minutes required to snack on its highly-regarded psycho-wisdom. So I came to it as a fully-formed functioning adult, fresh and anew, and this review is therefore in my opinion a more honest appraisal than most that you will read here.My review itself is short: This book would appear to appeal to the same mass of people who religiously watch Oprah and listen to AM radio for clues on how to better live their lives. It is indeed self-help drivel, perhaps the first example of the avalance of so-called inspirational excrement that rolled off the presses in the 1970s and 80s. I'll allow that Richard Bach may have been the first writer to frame the message of &quot;be all that you can be regardless of the obsticles&quot; into an allegorical (read: thinly disguised) format, but that would only excuse the throngs of people who gravitated towards this book when it was first published during the naive, self-indulgent, spiritually-seeking 70s. It explains nothing about the masses who still seem to derive live-altering inspiration from its simplistic story. I don't claim to have an explantation for that. All I am certain of is this: it only takes a quick chanel surf through daytime television - with the popular surplus of JerrySpringerRickiLakeSallyJesseJennyJones et al, alongside the mind-numbing idiocy of the ever-popular soap-opera genre - to understand that there is indeed a very wide audience for this type of simplistic, non-threatening, non-challenging, non-talented, non story. It is harmless, that is true, but it is hardly a contribution to the condition of man. It may appeal to individuals from the inside of a soul-searching crises, but it is also sorely lacking in substance, meaning, and soul. There is much better enriching material available to read. Of those to whom this book has meant so much I can only say: enjoy your lives. But for heaven's sake read some other stuff as well."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is an insullt to people everywhere. The fact that many enjoy it is shameful.

After all, this book is full of the You-can-do-anything-you-want if-you-try-hard-enough nonsense that Americans cherish. That anyone would describe the author's overwrought, shamelessly manipulative, saccharine prose as good literature, however, is simply mind-boggling.People, please, get off your butts and start living your lives!! Trust me, reading feel-good, exploitative books written by savvy, if untalented, authors will do little to change your unsatisfactory existence."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Everyone had limits. I, for instance, will never be Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the first place, I haven't the time or the perseverance to hit the gym, nor the money and courage to get a sex and name change, nor even the ability to fake the accent well. Moreover, even if I accomplished all these things, I would not really be Arnold, but simply a copy of Arnold.So when Jonathan Livingston Seagull triumphantly crows: \\"a seagull is unlimited\\", we know it is a blatant lie, for a seagull, no matter how strong or Austrian, cannot be Arnold Schwarzenegger any more than I can.This, in turn, brings us to another limit. I will never understand why this book, conveniently titled after it's main character, gathered praise. Perhaps if my mind were unlimited and soaring as Jonathan Livingston Seagull's, I could understand such a puzzling quandary.Written by a man by the name of Richard Bach (no relation, I assume to the famous composer, who was far too limited, for he merely wrote symphonies with music, rather than mothballs or goat cheese), this little parable tells the story of Jesus Aslan Messiah the Seagull (Jon for short), who spends his days learning to fly fast instead of stealing people's fried dough or fighting over dead crabs left to roast in the sun. For some reason, this irritates the rest of the flock, and they kick him out for being different.Jon spends the next two double-spaced wide-margined pages perfecting flight, and I must assume that those two pages cover a long bit of time, because soon after, Jon meets a couple of sparkling, angelic Seagulls who take him to Heaven. Serves the nasty scavenger right! I cried triumphantly, for we all know that seagulls are, in truth, vultures that decided the beach was more fun than the side of the highway.I assumed Seagull Heaven would contain a lot of parking lots and dumpsters, but instead it seemed to be a regular old beach. As it turns out, this isn't seagull heaven at all! It's merely another plane of existence, for, as Jon's new friend whose name is unworthy of remembrance teaches us, there's no such place as heaven. Heaven, he instructs, is merely a state of being; it lives within a gull (or person, as it were.). Strange, thought I, this book must release some sort of drug through my fingertips and it has finally altered my mind, for nonsense like this cannot truly be written and published.The drug-induced state did not improve matters, in fact, things became worse. Jon and his friend whose name I still can't remember learn to teleport. Apparently, it's as easy as imagining yourself where you want to be. However, though I tried, I could not will myself inside the TARDIS, but instead was still stuck in my room with a book I had no desire to finish.Jon ascends to another plane of existence with his friend whose name may or may not begin with an S, and there he teaches other seagulls to fly. He himself, of course, keeps training and somehow manages to fly up to Love and Kindness which makes him realize that he wants to go back to the flock that kicked him out in the first place and teach them to fly.He teleports back to his old flock and meets an outcast gull named Fletcher and decides that this juvenile delinquent is a fine candidate for flying lessons. They are later joined by Charles-Roland Seagull, Judy Lee Seagull, and Silly Name Seagull. They fly circles around the Flock.A lame seagull wants to join in the flying lessons, and Jon teaches him that he just has to believe in himself, and lo and behold, it works! Instead of being hailed as a hero, Jon is doubleplus shunned, though some call him \\"son of the great gull\\". I'm sure I've heard this story somewhere, but I can't put my finger on it.Finally, as we near the end, Fletcher Seagull flies smack into a cliff, but instead of dying like a normal person, he ascends, has a little chat with Jon, and decides he's better off back on earth.At long last, Jon ditches Fletch and ascends to do unlimited things, disappearing in a sparkly cloud. Fletch then, in turn, begins teaching young seagull brats to fly at abnormal speeds, preaching at them the entire time.This leads us to one more limit: this book could not be worse. The plot is vague, the philosophy is slightly moronic, and Jon is nothing more than a half-baked Aslan. He exists only to spout the author's viewpoint, but, unlike Aslan, he's not even remotely likeable and is a Mary Sue of the highest order.Disgusted, I tossed the book at the nearest wall and glanced at the clock. It had taken up fifteen minutes of my time that I could never recover. Unless, of course, I look outside myself and learn that Time is Unlimited and that I will exist forever. Perhaps I will even be reborn as Arnold Schwarzenegger.I thought, perhaps, it was just me that hated the book, so I passed it on to my eleven year old sister, who has dubious taste in literature. When I asked her not five minutes ago what she thought of it, her response was ripe with wisdom and pretty much sums up the whole experience. I leave you with her resonant word of wisdom, for she, in one word, accurately described the schlock we have witnessed:\\"Euugh!\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"It's the same feeling as describing the love.

Miss Bock's class. Former nun. Pretty strict but very nice. One day when it was a little loud as we changed classes in our inner city school, she yelled at us; &quot;At East orange high School they may all be shooting heroin in the bathroom but at least it's quite in the hallways!&quot; Our assignment--read a book and build a diorama. You remember dioramas don't you? You take a shoe box, some construction paper &amp; some glue and you build a little scene inside of the box. Let's put it this way, I'm firmly convinced that my wife only wanted to have kids so that she could one day build dioramas with them.I, on the other hand, had no interest then, nor any now, in such projects. Racing through my fevered eleven year old's brain went various schemes and dodges to get out from under this burden. Sadly I did not have the kind of parents who were embarrassed by having me turn in woefully inadequate projects. Remember when your Cub Scout troop did Pinewood Derby and there were always those kids whose Dads had clearly built their car? In our troop we actually had two kids whose dads were Shop Teachers. The Derby cars they brought in could have been sold in stores. Meanwhile, my Father told me it would be a good learning experience if I built my own. The predictable result was that I produced this misshapen, day-glo green, bricklike car with the wheels accidentally glued into immobility. Suffice it to say, I was no challenge to the shop brats, but I did learn something: cheaters win. Absent any illicit parental assistance and devoid of the requisite personal motivation, I needed a really easy book and an extremely basic diorama scene. Thank you Richard Bach!I read mega-bestselling Jonathan Livingston Seagull--all of 127 pages with copious numbers of photographs. Then I took some blue construction paper and glued it into the bottom of the box, cut out the picture of a seagull from the cover of the book and glued it onto the blue background. Voila! Five minutes, project done. As you might intuit, Miss Bock was significantly less impressed by my ingenuity than I was. As I recall she took inordinate and sadistic pleasure in comparing my box to Mark Caldwell's Call of the Wild action scene, which included trees, snow, a moving dog and a little view portal like a binocular lens through which you viewed the scene.Returning to this book now, I feel compelled to defend my vision. The story of the book is almost ridiculously simple. A young seagull wants to learn to fly better. The elders of his flock inform him in no uncertain terms that a seagull only needs to fly well enough to feed himself, that flying is not the point of being a seagull. But Jonathan rebels against the proscribed ambitions of the other gulls; he yearns to explore the boundaries of flight. As he continues to test these limits, the Flock expels him, but eventually a group of younger gulls join him in his quest and together they transcend their seagullness. The message of the book is perhaps best expressed in the epigraph above and in a conversation between Jonathan and Elder Chiang:&quot;Chiang, this world isn't heaven at all, is it?&quot;The Elder smiled in the moonlight. &quot;You are learning again, Jonathan Seagull,&quot; he said.&quot;Well what happens from here? Where are we going? Is there no such place as heaven?&quot;&quot;No, Jonathan, there is no such place. Heaven is not a place, and it is not a time. Heaven is beingperfect.This dual message about freedom and the pursuit of perfection is simple but classic. In his own way, Jonathan fits easily within the mainstream of American Literature with heroes like Huck Finn (see Orrin's review), RP McMurphy (see Orrin's review), Cool Hand Luke and the rest. His quest to escape the limits accepted by the Flock is the quintessential quest of Western Man. And what image expresses Bach's allegorical notion better than a solitary seagull soaring? In retrospect, I think I deserved an A.This book is not particularly profound. It is sufficiently ambiguous that different readers will focus on different aspects of the story and take away different messages. But there is something undeniably compelling about Bach's fundamental faith in the individual. It is an especially appropriate book for teens and even adolescents, but adults looking to kill an hour will enjoy it too. Heck, if you and your kid read it, you can build a diorama together afterwards.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is one of my all time favorite books.

It is so much more than a simple story about a seagull who learns to spread his wings and fly. The book can have many individual interpretations, depending on how you relate to it, and to me that is the magical wonder of this beautiful, inspirational book. For each one of us, the book has its own personal meaning. To me, it is about personal freedom and having the courage to be the person you want to be; the freedom to become all that you were meant to be, not what someone else expects you to be. It is about spiritual freedom and how our fate on this Earth, and in whatever worlds may follow, is determined by the choices we make. As a parent, it is about learning to let go, for giving your children &quot;wings,&quot; is the greatest gift they will ever receive. By setting them free when they are no longer yours to hold, you are giving them the freedom to grow, and the dauntless courage, strength and independence to fly on their own in an uncertain world, wherever the journey may take them.I have read this book so many times throughout the years that the pages are dog-eared and worn. The book is short, but the powerful lesson and message contained in these few pages is one many people never learn in an entire lifetime, no matter how many lifetimes they may live."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This was a very good book! It was about a Flock of seagulls that they thought that the only reason to even live was to fly for food to survive. Jonathan Livingston Seagull was the only gull in the Flock that thought otherwise. Jonathan wouldn't stay with the Flock. All that he wanted to do was fly. Everyday, day after day, he would practice flying. His instructor, Sullivan, taught him new things everyday. Jonathan then went a step further, he went for speed. When Jonathan was practicing speed, he came upon a shoreline where he met Elder Seagull. Elder was the fastest seagull and no one has ever been able to beat him, until he showed Jonathan his trick. Do you think that Jonathan learned how, or did he just walk away from Elder Seagull? I liked this book because it was very interesting. Jonathan Livingston Seagull was an Outcast and wasn't like all the others. He kind of went his own way,and what the others did didn't matter to him.

Then he meets a spirit gull, and becomes a hero to all other seagulls. He continues to fly.The problem with assigning this for high school reading, is that it takes up spots that a good book with redeeming value could be read. Students don't read outside of class, and if we continue to assign this sort of dribble, we will have a world of underread idiots trying to fly."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is a worthless story about some stupid seagull who extricates himself from a group of mundane, materialistic seagulls in order to pursue a 'higher purpose'. He is then taught by equally stupid and like-minded seagulls about how to become stupider, until after much effort he finally reaches the level at which he can teach other gulls to be as stupid as he is. Lastly, Jonathan Livingston Seagull and friends, who are too good to collect food, abandon the less enlightened task of sustenance gathering and live off of the crumbs that idiots on the beaches throw to them. Unfortunately, due to their failure to migrate during the winter (because they began their journey by knowing that they had already arrived at their destination) when no one goes to the beach, they all starve to death (but the author fails to mention this fact, alluding to it only in a brief discourse towards the beginning of the story between Jonathan and his parents when the mother says \\"Why don't you eat? Jon, you are bone and feathers!\\" and the father warns him, \\"Winter isn't far away. Boats will be few, and the surface fish will be swimming deep\\"). To top it off the book is written in a highly irritating style which is probably supposed to make everything seem ethereal but instead makes one feel as if they are in a delusional stupor.Make sure to buy this book so that the author and the publisher can reach their higher plane of existence by buying food and other banal necessities with your (possibly) hard-earned and now wasted money.

From there, go on to &quot;One&quot; - and on and on.....ps&gt;&gt; photography in &quot;Jonathan&quot; is also great."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Although this book seems to be an easy read at first, you will discover much more when you read it twice. Every sentence has a special and important meaning. There is no word useless in this book. Analysing the Story about &quot;Jonathan&quot; makes you think a lot. You would never imagine that this book was written by a pilot, as there are so few technical expressions. The book is much more about how to behave in group that doesn't allow any change. Jonathan is different than the other Seagulls. He wants to achieve something, he wants to reach the limits and break them. He doesn't care about the normal life (eating, flying in the flock). Jonathan wants to convice the other gulls that there is more to live for. The book is very symbolic. You can profit a lot when you compare the achievements of Jonathan with our human goals in life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The book Jonathan Livingston seagull was about a seagull that wanted to be better than the rest of the flock.The main character in the book was Jonathan. The story started when he thought he was a limited seagull but he kept trying to fly fast and finally he went 140 mph (miles per hour ) at 2,000 feet and it was under control! Then he thought how fast he would go at 5,000 feet. At 5,000 feet he went 214 mph (miles per hour ) the second time he went up to 5,000 feet he went 250 mph.When he went up to 8,000 feet and he learned to role, twist and curve and by that night he was so dizzy! The next morning the flock had a meeting and they called Jonathan to the center of the circle, and only honored gulls got to go in the center of the circle but when they called Jonathan to come to the center of the circle they said \\"Jonathan come to the center of shame\\" and they all laughed.Jonathan was always trying new things for a example, he was always trying to fly the fastest. He would fly up to a height of 2,000 feet fold back his wing and fly on his wing tips and then drops straight down reaching speeds up to 230 mph (miles per hour ). He taught eight other seagulls about the beauty of flying he also taught them how to fly really fast. Jonathan was special because he thought no one had limits.I liked Jonathan Livingston seagull because he thought no one had limits and I think that is true!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I first read this thin book with lots of black and white photos of flying seagulls at age 18, while taking a break from my intensive preparations for my &quot;A' level exams in the school library.It turned out to give me much more than a break: It set my spirits soaring as I read and identified with Jonathan for being so enthralled in doing what he loves doing that he &quot;forgets&quot; everything else. The other seagulls &quot;flew to eat&quot; while he &quot;ate to fly&quot;. In a way, Jonathan is symbolic of people who &quot;live to learn&quot; while many others merely &quot;learn to live&quot;.Since then, I've re-read this book two or three times at different ages - in my twenties and more recently, in my thirties. Its meaning to me and the feeling of kindred spirits turned out to be stronger than ever. This is now one of my prized possessions."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A simple and uncomplicated reminder to us all of who we really are. In this busy, hectic world, it's beauty is it's brevity-a place to refer to without using up days of time. I find it interesting that those who choose to give it poor reviews seem to to be so venemous and angry about it. Human nature tends to fear and condem what it doesn't understand-much like the flock of gulls who turn their backs to Jonathan.

This book speaks about the determination to innovate through learning, practicing to become perfect with deep inner philosophy about approach to life. I read this book when I was little depressed and it gave me a message to stand up, think upside down and perform. I could come out of depression by doing what I believed to be correct. I read this book again when I am confident and very sure about what am I doing and it gave me a meaning, dare Innovate dont just follow the set pattern. This book is really inspirational for anybody. Just reach out and read and read it all your life. The best part of this book is its simplicity of presentation."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This slender classic about a seagull who stretches the limits of Flight reads as fresh and emotionally exhilarating as when it first appeared. Disdaining the mundane existence of most gulls--who follow the garbage trails of men--Jonathan dreams of rising above such a demeaning lifestyle, on both aerodynamic and spiritual planes. He boldly pushes his body to perform increasingly difficult stunts, to achieve undreamed of aerial precision and velocity. Until he is callously ostracized for his achievements.We admire Jonathan's quest for excellence, his willingness to sacrifice everything in his noble pursuit of raising seagfull consciousness. To FLY for the sheer joy of it, to grow in wisdom, to chafe at any limitation of the spirit, to experience the ultimate in seagullness--to meet and perhaps briefly be one with the Great Gull.Beneath the surface of this seemingly simple tale of a gull, who literally rises above his own kind, lie themes clearly reflecting the 60's: civil disobedience for a worthy cause, social ostracism, the personal dignity of the sentient individual, refusal to accept the standard restrictions of life as imposed by Society. Bach presents philosophical gymnastics worthy of a seagull's Shangri-La; he includes Christian overtones and ideas of global spirituality as well.JLS proves a teacher of teachers both in Flight and Compasion, but could he really be the only son of the Great Gull? (The movie with Neil Diamond's moving score is a multi-dimensional treat, but read the book first.) Timeless enchantment!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Beautiful book. I bought the Jonathan Livingston LP as well. (found it at a garage sale for 2 bucks.) A good book to pick you up, almost like the opposite of a Dilbert book. Inspiring, touching, and can be read in a short period of time. Also read Illusions, and One by the same author. Illusions was pretty good too. Follows along the same philosophy of being able to free your mind. Just don't take the book to literally, it is more of a figurative book.Have fun with the book!"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is outstanding. Richard Bach surely is to be recommended for his classic novel. He tells the reader about true human nature that is completely true in this world's setting. The Flock symbolizes having no freedom of mind but that you folllow the paths of those who came before you. Their veiws may not always be right. The boook goes much deeper than words.This book is a well spent time of reading"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"It's really amazing that this book, published in 1970, got onto the top sellers of all time list. It is barely 127 pages long - and that includes many pages of seagull photos, with very few words per page. The margins are very large :) It's a story about a seagull who, unlike his comrades, is not happy yelling \\"Mine! Mine! Mine!\\" for food. He loves to soar, and fly. He faces rejection and ridicule for his quest for greater heights. And of course, he inspires all of us to reach for our goals.So first, obviously this book is REALLY short. I just re-read it and, without racing at all, I was done in 16 minutes. It's very short. There aren't long, drawn out characterizations here. Jonathan learns to fly well in about 2 pages, and by page 31 he is fully aware of all of his skills. By page 57 he in \\"Heaven\\" - or at least in another stage of life in with like-minded seagulls, speaking with telepathy. Chiang is the elder there who tells Jonathan that there actually is no Heaven - that Heaven is the state of being perfect. Jonathan decides to return to Earth and help others. He spends a few pages teaching Fletcher his skills, and then vanishes, leaving Fletcher to teach the new seagull students how to fly. The story ends.Really, the story here is that Jonathan and Fletcher were not \\"special\\" in any way. The point is made many times that they were seagulls like any others. The difference is that they chose to strive to better themselves. They were not content to merely eat and sleep. They wanted to become really good at what they could do - fly. The elders explain that for many people, this process takes many lifetimes. If you do well in a given life, you graduate to a \\"higher\\" life where you can then work with people on your next stage of progress. If you just get by in your current life, then you get reborn into that same level, to have another chance to strive.So it's very interesting how different people have interpreted this book to be a religious tome. Christians often say that Jonathan stands for Jesus. He was born \\"with men\\" - he learns his special skills, and then he returns to earth to help guide mankind to be better. There's even a mob scene where the \\"normal seagulls\\" try to kill Jonathan for being different. On the other hand, the story clearly says there is no Heaven - that the point of life is to keep trying and trying until you figure out your own path to perfection. The reincarnation and perfection-from-within is very Buddhist. It's not an external God that gives you this perfection. You are born with the innate ability to attain perfection - but it is up to you to find the desire and take the steps to reach it.I've owned this book for many years and do enjoy it. But I do have to say that it is REALLY short and really basic. The whole Jonathan evolution is barely touched on. You don't get much sense of growth as he instantly goes from normal seagull to glowing Special Seagull. This is sort of a theological primer for those who don't normally read books on philosophy. There are many, many books out there that get into these sorts of topics in a far more meaningful way. But on the other hand, much as the Matrix series got many non-philosophy students to learn about some pretty basic philosophical ideas, this book also opened the door for many people on the ideas of striving for inner perfection. If you handed all of these people a complex tome on the topic, they probably wouldn't have read it. But maybe by getting that door opened, and that interest piqued, they then went forward and learned more. You have to get that interest started somewhere. If the interest came from a super-short, super easy to read, picture-filled booklet, does it really matter?On a personal note, I really do feel that people need to sit back and consider what they spend their hours each day doing. We only have one life - and most of us who can afford to buy books have an amazing wealth of luck that 90% of the world's population dreams of having. We have clothes, we have places to sleep, we have access to healthy food and water. It would be a wonderful thing if each of us spent even a portion of our day reaching out to help others, to help the world become a better place for us all to live in. We don't need to watch TV - there are other far more important things to do in life."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"\\"Most gulls don't bother to learn more than the simplest facts of flight--how to get from shore to food and back again\\". \\"For most gulls it is not flying that matters, but eating. For this gull, though, it was not eating that mattered, but flight.\\" That is what the author of this book says about the \\"hero\\" of this story, a seagull named Jonathan Livingston Seagull.Jonathan Livingston Seagull is different to the other gulls in his flock. He doesn't live to eat, but eats to live and pursue his passion: flight. But his search for perfection and speed doesn't endear him to the other seagulls, that eventually expel him from the flock for daring to be different. To know what happens afterwards, you will need to read this book, because I don't want to spoil the ending.The real question here, I guess, is whether you want to read a story about gulls... I mean, there are so many good books out there, why read a book about a bird?. The answer is simple: the story in \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" is a metaphor about things that can happen to you in real life. Have you ever felt tempted to do the same that everybody else, just for the sake of conformism?. Have you often felt like given up when something you really want to do demands too much work?. Just think about it...I believe that many of us are sometimes like most of the gulls in this book, and we need to learn the lessons that \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" gives us: the most important thing is to believe in ourselves, and always do our best without giving up.I would like to point out that some people say that this book is full of New Age ideas. I really don't think so. Okay, I certainly don't know much about those ideas, and I'm not interested enough to learn more about them. But in my opinion, we often find in a book what we want to find in it.For me, this is only a charming allegory with a very pertinent message: DON'T ABANDON YOUR DREAMS... For that reason, I recommend this book to you. And whether you read \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\" (English edition) or \\"Juan Salvador Gaviota\\" (Spanish edition), enjoy it !!!Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan I loved this book. Jonathan when he came back to help the birds on a lower level of spiritual development, is like, Michael in the book An Encounter With A Prophet, coming back to help Nathaniel. Their statements of truth seem rather hard to accept at first, even by those high flyers who want more than the \\"herd\\" or \\"the flock\\" are willing to blindly accept as truth."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"If there is anything that this book teaches, it is that we have the ability to change reality with the power of our own thoughts. This is one of those books that no matter how many times I read it, will never fail to amaze me. It's the kind of book that leaves you speechless, unable to do anything but think, and wonder.Presented in the form of a charming parable about a seagull's education in flight, Jonathan Livingston Seagull is about far more than the life of one seagull. It is about each and every one of us, struggling to find the answers, to reach something higher that we are not even yet aware of. We are all a little bit like Jonathan, and when we read Bach's story, we realize that we all have the same power inside. That we can do anything, be anything that we want, if only we can believe in ourselves. Bach's message is a powerful and timeless one that stretches across all barriers to reveal the simple truth that we all, at one time or another in our lives, knew: the most powerful force that exists is that of belief, especially in ourselves.I can't tell you exactly why you need to read this book. It's not about something as simple as plot or writing style. There is a rare magic in the words that cannot be conveyed by any other means than the experience of reading the book. All I can say is that once you read this book, you will understand."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"As a preface to my review, I would just like to say that as I looked at some others' reviews of this book, I found it interesting that almost every one of the 259 other reviews before mine either say that this was an amazing book that changed their life and made them understand the true meaning of things or say that it was a waste of time and is a load of 70's feel-good rubbish. This book did not change my life; the theme was fairly standard thinking and is easy to find in other books. However, I still found it an enjoyable quick read that was worth the short amount of time I spent on itJonathan Livingston Seagull is a story of a seagull who rebels against the traditional thinking of his kind: he flies for enjoyment and excitement, not just for food. This behavior is not tolerated by other seagulls, and he is banished from the flock. Throughout the rest of the book, he learns the true meaning of perfection and that what is most important is to always try your hardest.I would recommend this book to everybody. It is very short and should only take one to two hours for most people to read. If you are interested in philosophy and symbolism, you could study this book and find all sorts of hidden information; if not, it is still a good book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"He made me eager to yearn for learning and reaching my limit of learning. It is important for one to know his limits in order to improve them. Bach made me able to stretch my mind and to know my capabilities within some activities. It is not life that is unfair. It is us who are unfair to ourselves. We limit our potential to what is tangible, realistic and reachable. It is the fear of failure. The fear of disappointment. If we manage to break these limits, we impose on our ambitions and capabilities, we will reach a higher level of life. We will know what is the real life we really want to live. By exploring what we don not know, we can learn new things and actually realize who we really are. We can't be parts of others who we know. We will be parts of people we want to acquire parts from. he idea of perfection is too far from our thoughts. Perfection, like any other thing is there. We just need to go up and find it. Find the perfection that we are looking for in ourselves, not the one, others are looking for in us."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I haven't read the way I use to in a long time but reading Jonathan Livingston Seagull has brought me back to the beautiful world of literature. It's very easy to read and doesn't even take long to finish but the mark it leaves on your mind will never go away. It's a story that will actually make you feel safer about life itself and confident in whatever you're pursuing. This story could change someone's life around and make them believe what's impossible can be possible. If your in a situation where you feel everyone is against you this book will show that even though they're not with you there may be people out there like you but they're just waiting for someone to step up. This is truly a story that everyone should read and with all of the stories schools force on kids why isn't Jonathan Livingston Seagull one of them."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"As a child I found this a riveting book. It revealed to me the possibility of being other than what I was. Upon reviewing this memory it has revealed that Jonathon Livingstone Seagull, against all odds, struggled for his own idea of perfection, and I applaud the author for his unique ingenuity in giving human attributes to a bird so that those wishing to go beyond the limiting social constraints can identify within themselves the architect of their constructs, and therefore bring about evolutionary change."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This book is Richard Beak's finest work. A simple story told with complex texture, the bird symbolizes the ineffable longings within humanity for a transcendental epiphany; a neon in the night of our stumblings; flash! I see! I hear! I fly! Valleys of failure and hills of hope are the topographic text through which the tale travels, and white-winged and wide are our stretchings towards self-actualization. This is a work of singular vision, aided by a slight editorial suggestion by me. Beak had just finished the final draft and we were sitting together on Santa Monica pier, feeding bread to the gathering gulls. Hundreds of the wretched creatures, all squawking and pecking and flapping. It was like being in the centre of a feathery blizzard and we were covered in gull-goo and crumbs. Fearing for our lives and an exorbitant dry-cleaning bill, we decamped to the safety of a nearby bar. After a dozen or so fortifying flagons, Beak unwrapped the splattered manuscript and showed me the title. Something about it wasn't quite right, so I propped the stupefied scribbler back into his chair and said, \\"Richie, sure the bird idea's got legs, but Jonathan Livingston TURKEY? When those flocking gulls disappear, take a stumble along the beach and see what else you can come up with.\\""},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a novel about a seagull who wishes to improve himself and to be able to fly faster and better. He is expelled from his flock for this desire, so he continues to live life alone and establish his individuality. Jonathan struggles to reach perfection in his life by flying; this theme of striving for perfection is ever constant in his growth. The story is provocative and makes the reader think about his or her own life. I enjoyed this amazing precursor to the 70's, when people were striving to reach inside themselves to \\"find\\" themselves and be individuals. The novel by Richard Bach is full of great metaphors that can be interpreted by the reader in many different ways depending on his or her point of view. This book can be about anything you want it to be. It can be about life in general, a day in your life, a job, a goal, or almost anything. It's about making happen that which is important to you; its about making a commitment to accomplish your goal so you stick to it no matter what. In Bach's own interpretation of the book he says, \\"Find out what you love to do and do your darndest to make it happen.\\" He also says the book was the result of a series of visions; that he really didn't write it by himself, leading one to realize the book is open to interpretation. Setting and accomplishing your own goals and deciding on your own destiny is socially significant in any society; it is important to every individual. There really isn't much of a plot in this book, and most of it is set in the air. The whole story is a metaphor for rising to and meeting your goals, then setting higher goals. Jonathan tells his mother, \\"I don't mind being bones and feathers... I just want to know what I can and can't do in the air\\" (p.13-14). Once Jonathan reaches his peak, he is confronted by other gulls who tell him, \\"We are from your flock... we are your brothers...we've come to take you higher...One school has finished and it is time for another to begin\\" (p.53). As in life, we tend to reach a certain point where we are saturated with what is available and then we move on, to learn more in a new place. Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a provocative story that induces the reader to contemplate life. It expresses the ability of an individual to succeed at his or her own goals with or without a group. It is an interesting book and \\"readers find themselves motivated and inspired by a book that reflects their desire for success, freedom, perfection, and love.\\" This simple story about an everyday creature is really a metaphor for life. Accomplish your goals and ambitions, then create new and higher ones. As Jonathan learns, \\"The gull sees farthest who flies highest\\" (p.86)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A story that teach you how you can live following your dreams.

Reading more than 100 pages about birds was not the book that I wanted to read at that moment.But a few weeks ago my friend mentioned it and I thought it was time to start reading it and see what was all about.I have to admit that it was a great experience and the moment I started to read I simply could not put the book aside. I felt great when I finished it and it made me think that life can also be nice and full of optimistic things. 'Jonathan Livingston Seagull' is one of them.This is a very nice fable about life, ambition and pushing one's own limits. The more you read it, the more you start asking questions about yourself and your life.Jonathan Livingston is a seagull that chooses a different path than the rest of the birds in his flock. He spends his days looking for perfection - he prefers to learn to fly rather than eat, unlike the other birds. He is single-minded focus on and flying is not the way to make him popular with other birds. Such an attitude made Jonathan an outcast, rejected by his community and he finds himself alone but doesn't want to give up his dreams and ideas.I think the one big thing this story teaches us is that we should all admit our limitations, but the secret consists in trying to get over them, to challenge ourselves and evolve.Only great challenges will make us reach &quot;heaven&quot;, which is just a matter of being perfect. If there is no challenge, then there are no failures and we cannot evolve. Only excellence,intelligence, and skill can set free a spirit that is lookingfor important challenges in life.Richard Bach, who is an accomplished pilot and who has written a great deal about flight, uses the theme of flying in this book as a way of making us think. We have to think of ourselves as creatures of total freedom, free from all rulesin our minds, the place where actually everything happens. We can fly at the speed of our minds, not limited by anything .I think the book is also a story about modern society, where people who are different, the ones who want to make a change, are seen as crazy and are often rejected by the society that tends to be more and more ordinary, with limited views, and no dreams or desires.It is a good story from which we can learn a lot of things: never be afraid of reaching perfection, never stop dreaming. It is a short and very easy to read story, written in a very nice language, full of deep meanings. I think it should guide us all in life.

This book is a really good book for younger children, they can learn from it, like if they want to acomplish something they should go for it. They should do what is exciting to them. This was a good book and I would deffinetly reccomed this book to other people to read."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is the perfect book for those going through a transition and wishing to maximize their personal development in the creative space. This book will take you only an hour or so to read, however it will have a huge impact on your life. The story is an analogy tracing the development of a seagull as it learns to free it's mind, and by doing so reach unprecedented performance. Although Jonathan Livingston Seagull was originally published in 1970, the book is timeless and I have a feeling there is knowledge within that I may have missed and will eventually pick up as I further evolve. May be useful to revisit at various points in your life.Once you've finished Jonathan Livingston Seagull check outGround of Your Own Choosing: Winning Strategies for Finding & Creating Workby Beverly Ryle."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I got this book for my 8 yr old granddaughter and she just loved it.

However, I feel like the book is a bit overrated. I definitely didn't find it life changing like some of the other readers claim to. It may just be the fact that I'm reading it at thirty years old. I imagine had I read it when I was much younger, I would have thought more of it.

In high school as a freshman I was forced to read this book and now 20+ years later I wanted to give it a second chance. I have found adult I appericiate the writing a lot more. However, this story of the seagull who strived to fly his own way just didnt work for me. It was not a horrible book just kind of campy for my taste"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is an excellent book written by Richard Bach. It tells of the life of Jonathan, a seagull who does not wish to follow the rest of the flock. After being banished for reckless flying, he lives out the rest of his days in this life in happy solitude, learning almost all that he wants to learn. Once he moves onto the next life, he meets a wise teacher, and Jonathan learns more than he could have hoped for. After learning so much, he returns to his flock to try and teach them the wonderful things that he knows. Most do not listen to him. Only outcasts, like himself, are wiling to learn the wonderful things that Jonathan Livingston Seagull has to teach. However, all of that is simply the literal version of the story.This story is very deep, with many philosophical and spiritual questions and answers given. The deeper meaning of this book is wonderful, and much better than the story itself. I highly recomend that you read this book, if only to have some of the ideas in it implanted into your mind.Lengthwise, this is a very short book. I read it in just one siting. There were no big words, or any lengthy descriptions. All of the material was presented in a simple and straightforward way. There are many wonderful pictures of seagulls that fill up a sizable portion of the pages. I highly recomend this great book to anyone who is pondering about some of the mysteries that life holds. It will not disappoint you."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach is about a unique bird. This bird is only interested in flying. Of course it's only a metaphor about the importance of seeking a higher purpose in life. Jonathan ultimately learns the meaning of life which according to Bach is love and kindness."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is not the story of a seagull. This is a vision of freedom, captured within the pages of a book. It is the storyof every living being in this universe that yearns to be free. It is a cry of freedom, bursting out of the souls of every one of its readers. Everytime I read the book, I learnt something new. And all that I learnt from the book was essentially just one thing - that we are all free. And that it takes most of us a lifetime to realize it. It's portrayal of the seagull community is a saddening but true portrayal of the real world. This book is a triumph if ever there was one."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is a great book which I've read many times.It's a great metaphor for the \\"live your life the best way you know how to and be true to yourself\\" philosophy.PS.

Then I was looking at the reviews of it and I decided to read it again. Do you ever get that feeling?Anyway, you can read in in less than 100 minutes (I timed it) and so I can now report that it is a good book but not as good as I remember. I found it kinda predictable, and it's not because I read it before.My conclusion: four stars is pretty good, but it will probably make a better impression on someone young than on someone older."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Seagull is an old favorite of mine which I suddenly ran into again, much like an old friend. I read it first as a child, liking the story and not really appreciating the metaphor. I re-read it as a high schooler (and many times thereafter) and could see the book's true value. One of those classics that one always looks back on with delight. Bach evidently chose seagulls in light of his own flying background but the picture of the rat race remains as compelling. I bought soon after a poster of a bird silhouetted against the sun setting over a seascape and the words on it always remained with me : &quot;You see things as they are, and ask why? I see things that never were, and ask why not?&quot;. I don't think Bach said this (can some Amazonian tell me who the author is?) but they seem apt for this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Reading Jonathan Livingston Seagull again after many years, I found myself once again enchanted by the beauty and simplicity of Richard Bach's wonderful little book. It crosses all generations, nationalities and social strata. The message is timeless and still relevant in today's troubled and complex global environment. I gave it to my granddaughter (who is 17) to read and she was just as charmed and inspired by it as I had been so many years ago."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"What a peculiar little book. I first recall reading it in the seventies and it made very little impact on me. So, some almost forty years later I decided to make a second attempt.It only takes an hour or so to read \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". It's a tiny book. It's not even a very long short story. It is, however, allegorical. In simple terms, JLS is Jesus. He has learnt much from his heavenly father and is keen to pass the knowledge on to others. He can even perform miracles.Although this book has been widely praised and sold millions of copies, I had real difficulty in seeing why. It's not that it's well written or even very original. In fact, more than anything, it's just banal. What on earth is all the fuss about?By all means, go ahead and read this book. You won't be wasting much of your life. However, never let anyone tell you it is a great book or that it changed their life. Get real! It's an over-rated very short story whose fame precedes it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The book was in very good condition, thank you:) When my children were small (1970's) I had the album of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, narrated by Richard Harris.

It uses two fundamental motifs of Platonism. 1) The allegory of the cave. Jonathan has a lot in common with the liberated philosopher who manages to free himself from the narrow rules that enslave his peers; the character's vertiginous ascension towards another world mirrors the philosopher's efforts to contemplate Good itself; Jonathan's return to his people, late in the book, shows the necessity of going back into the cave to help the remaining prisoners. (Incidentally, Jonathan's isolation and the lack of understanding he faces throughout his quest is akin to Plato's description of the philosopher in many of his dialogues.) Another key Platonic motif used by R. Bach is 2) the relation between the Idea and its sensible copy. It can be seen in the notion of a True Seagull (the Idea of the Seagull) which serves as a model and guide to each and every particular seagull; their goal is to emulate this paradigm in their thoughts and actions. This tale is evocative and enables many different readings..."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The conclusion is that we should pursue what we love to do.

Trying to put human attributes of adventure and perfection and \\"flying above and away from the crowd\\" onto a seagull could have been a believable possibility but it would have required a good deal more work and a much longer seagull history.It could be considered a poem in prose - sorta - but again it would have taken more work and it would have required the author to hire a poet.

Growing up Gracefully is the theme of the Book with very good illustrated pic of Sea Gulls on the cover page. Captivating attention with this classic read, Richard Bach's fable Seagull named Jonathan Livingstone is an example that teaches about 'Flight' and capture the moments of love and kindness. Jonathan had a deep desire to soar high in the skies and hardly cared for eating like other seagulls. The message was to aim higher for a purpose in life even if its against the wishes of own people. Jonathan is courageous and in pursuit of excelling, he almost has to leave his flock and experience learning with wise seagull who taught him perfect speed.

Perhaps the crowning achievment of Richard Bach, as both a writer and philosopher, this book takes the reader on a journey into Self, through the questing form of a seagull whose spirit and faith know no bounds. In the gulls' journey through life we are given a message, a timeless message - that it is we, ourselves, who set our limits, or don't. Not really a childs book, but neither an adults, this is a book for those of us who have not yet adopted the mantle of cynicism and disbelief in possibility which defines the word and concept of &quot;limits&quot;. &quot;you have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way.&quot; Simple words of an author, or perhaps a seagull, but sometimes it it the simple things which do the most to set us free."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I once read a review of this book that said something along the lines of &quot;it is so vague that anyone from Hindu to Roman Catholic could find meaning in it.&quot; I agree whole-heartedly. This book contains so many mixed messages that anyone of any age at any time could find meaning in it. There is the admittance of a higher power (the Great Gull), and at the same time an extreme emphasis on the greatest importance of the self. Bach's tale of how the story came about(a voice in his head which dictated half the story to him then waited 11 years to dictate the rest) seems a little too far fetched for me. I think this book is a tiresome, low-vocabulary attempt at propheticism.

Within the pages of this novella, first published in 1970, the author takes the reader through an adventure in time and space and reality. The book is titled after the main character, Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who desires to transcend the mundane chores of everyday life, and achieve greatness in flight, and accomplishment, and fortitude. It is an inspirational, and emotionally charged drama which will inspire each reader to aspire to their greatest potential."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A fun little book, it's very short and you can probably read it in one toilet sitting. Jonathon Livingston Seagull is an allegorical tale about a seagull who becomes completely absorbed in the art of flying, he learns everything there is to know about it, and through the help of two birds he flies to a \`higher plane of existence'. There he meets a guru bird called Chiang who changes his perspective on life and helps him transcend time and space. Don't worry, I didn't ruin the book for you as it's not something you can ruin; it \`transcends' story and plot. It is a story about the depths of human (or seagull?) potential and is very worth the read. Hmm, \`very worth the read' doesn't sound quite right, oh well.

The story contains elements of unnoticed ambiguities that will go unnoticed, but the ambiguities are just enough for the reader to put them self in the story without realizing it. If you have a friend read it ask them what they thought about the book and they will get something different out of it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathon Livingston Seagull begins his story as an ordinary seagull that strives to be different, and thinks and sees beyond the ordinary cycle of survival of a seagull. This gull has a dream, and that dream is for something higher. I believe this is a good way to look at life, as we only have one, and may as well live it to the fullest and strive to reach our dreams with the time which we are given. Jonathon shows us that in order to reach these dreams, much hard work and dedication is required because those things most likely will not just come to you. In doing so and possibly achieving that dream, you may not be accepted by those who just live for survival. This is shown in Jonathon Livingston Seagull, as he is deemed \`Outcast' by the Flock.At this point in this story, Jonathon is forced to make a life-changing decision to either be an ordinary bird who is solely concerned with survival, or to leave the Flock in order to pursue his dream to fly higher and faster than any seagull ever known. Jonathon chooses to live as a loner and continue working towards his dream of flying. By making this decision to work hard and sacrifice the social group he had grown up around, he is soon rewarded by going to the next \\"level of life.\\" Jonathon considers this \\"next level\\" as Heaven, though that thought is shot down by other seagulls Jon comes into contact with, because Heaven is known as a place of complete perfection. This \\"next level\\" is really about becoming a new person, and continuing to learn, achieve, and grow.Religion is also very dominantly incorporated in Jonathon Livingston Seagull , as Jon is basically envisioned as a Jesus figure. Jonathon shows the reader that to reach the next \\"level of life,\\" you must help others achieve who don't know how to. Jon descends to a lower level of life back on the seashore he had been casted away from to teach other gulls to break away from the ordinary cycle of only being concerned with day-to-day survival. The gulls of the Flock, as expected, still refuse to listen to Jonathon and will not open up their minds to discover what is beyond their usual life's cycle. Because of this, Jon must find himself a \\"disciple.\\" Jonathon teaches his disciple to teach others to open their minds and follow their dreams, and at this, Jonathon Livingston Seagull's story comes to a close."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Where to start with this steaming pile of book? Well, it's about a seagull who doesn't like to catch food, preferring instead to spend his time perfecting his flying techniques. Right then and there I thought, can't he do both? I mean what's he doing while catching his food - walking? But that doesn't fit in with Richard Bach's simplistic story, sorry, \\"fable\\" because, ahem, he's a teacher. But for some reason this society of seagulls discourages flying for the sake of flying and Jonathan Seagull is cast out for doing loop the loops and whatnot for some reason.The \\"meaning of life\\" for Jonathan is apparently to fly fast. Yeah, simplistic right? But that's it. Jonathan talks about how much more there is to life but all he seems to conceive of this limitless horizon is to fly fast. Anyway.The second part of the book is where the book really shows it's age. It was published in 1970 so it was probably written in the tail end of the \`60s, and a lot of that pseudo-spiritual hippy crap winds up in Part 2. For example, the mystical seagull (a seagull!) teacher \\"Chiang\\" (has to be an eastern name right? That's where all the hippies were \\"learning\\" things in the \`60s), says \\"You will be ready to begin to fly up and know the meaning of kindness and love,\\" (p.55). So now Jonathan's quest for fast flight is about kindness and love? Groovy, man.And how about this for the most mind meltingly insipid expression of their pseudo-philosophy: \\"If our friendship depends on things like space and time, then when we finally overcome space and time, we've destroyed our own brotherhood! But overcome space, and all we have left is Here. Overcome time, and all we have left is Now. And in the middle of Here and Now, don't you think that we might see each other once or twice?\\" (p.57). Riiiiiiiiiiiight.Part 2 is also the part where Jonathan learns how to travel across space and time and Christian values get mixed up with Buddhism ideas (reincarnation) before Part 3 borrows heavily from the Bible, essentially becoming nothing more than a pro-Christian recruiting tool. It's not even well written. Bad metaphors litter the pages, for example \\"His wings were ragged bars of lead, but the weight of failure was even heavier on his back.\\" (p.11). Ergh. Sloppy writing like this fills the book.This ridiculously stupid book - book! It's 87 pages, most of which are black and white bland photos of gulls, followed by blank pages - it's more like a heavily padded short story! - is the least interesting, least wise, least knowledgeable story/fable I've ever read. Once you realise Bach is a pilot the metaphor of a seagull becomes quite transparent and all of that \\"live to fly\\" crap is just Bach's own philosophy of his life.\\"The most celebrated inspirational fable of our time\\" the cover boasts. Well, if this fable inspired you, you're either a simpleton or a child, or maybe a simple child, or even a Christian, because I couldn't find a shred of inspiration in this joke of a book. It's about as profound as a bowl of porridge. Steer clear of false prophets and their laughable attempts at literature, this book is just the worst."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I've heard the raves about this book since I was a young woman & it first came out. So, when I happened upon it at a close-out sale, I bought it.I'm glad I didn't pay much for it.Maybe I am too old to appreciate the 'inspiration' that it is meant to provoke. I think I learned the lessons it teaches a long time ago - from my parents & in church. 'Life is to be lived, and since we are all in this together, we should try our best to make the world a better place'.Frankly, after reading, I wondered what the fuss is about. Yes, I caught what could be subtle inferences to spirituality, but I got a lot more out of other books I've read. But it's basically just a nice story about a bird. If inspiration & spiritual growth are your objectives, I recommend \\"The Greatest Salesman in the World\\". Another quick read, but much more substance than JLS."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a pseudo-Christian parable retelling the story of Jesus in the form of a seagull. The language is simple and unadorned, with very little worth calling \\"style\\". As a literary work, Jonathan Livingston is a very mediocre piece of writing, if olny because its characters are so artificial and lacking in depth. Jonathan Livingston cannot really move you because it is simply a prop for Richard Bach's idea of Perfection. It is an allegory and nothing more. Bad writers who have lots of ideas but have lived and observed little can only people their novels with allegories.Concerning the Jesus simile, let me add that the only difference between Bach's story and the canonical Gospels is that the underlying theology of Jonathan Livingston Seagull is basically Unitarian (from another point of view one could also describe it as Pelagian): Jonathan was not born a divine bird from a virgin and he is not fundamentally different from other seagulls. If in the end he attains divine \\"seagullhood\\", it is only through his own \\"superseagullan\\" efforts. In a way, Jonathan, as his very name indicates, is John the Baptist unredeemed by grace. Hence all the toil and sweat. Augustine of Hippo would have been appalled by this book...Put very simply, Richard Bach's philosophy is one that tells you to make strenuous and unrelenting efforts in order to become the strongest, the wisest and the most beautiful seagull (human being) ever. Salvation is elsewhere, in a realm of luminous and perfect seagulls. In a way, this book could be used to illustrate the absurd and arrogant Olympic motto of \\"altius, citius,fortius\\".Therefore, there is hardly anything new or original to be found in the worldview the book sets forth. And contrary to what some reviewers claim, it is not a revolutionary philosophy. Jonathan is only superficially a rebel. His rebellion is in fact taking place in a very old framework: that of heroic struggle. It is true that the heroic model has fallen into disrepute and we now live in the epicurean bourgeois mode, but to claim that Jonathan is an absolute rebel is false. As I hinted before, this book could have easily been written by a Christian ascetic, and, indeed, what the book teaches can be regarded as a form of extreme asceticism, with the refinement that it is aesthetically appealing. Violence is often aesthetically satisfying.No wonder everyone succumbs to the charm of the story: such thinking has been preached relentlessly from the pulpit and from other places of authority for the last 2000 years. I can't help thinking that the message of becoming The Ideal Human Being and of escaping the world through effort and holy war against oneself is essentially a Fascist idea. One could also say that it is the core of the Darwinist social manifesto. The idea that one should strive to become the best permeates our whole society, specially our economy, and is only superficially a message of hope and optimism. It is in reality a message of hateful tyranny, the tyranny of the Ideal over the Real. But we fail to see it because this message is not only familiar to us, it is also aesthetically tremendously attractive. Spiritually, we are all Platonists and flesh-haters at heart.As a philosophical tale, this book, which, as I said, is not very well written, cannot be compared, even remotely, with such unsurpassed masterworks as \\"The Little Prince\\" by French author Saint-Exupery or \\"Zorba the Greek\\" by Cretan writer Nikos Kazantzakis. The Little Prince is pessimistic and suffused with sadness and nostalgia (a typical French mix), but is full of original ideas and insights of great depth, besides being a radical critique of modern society. It is a book one can read and re-read and still find full of enigmas and hidden messages.\\"Zorba the Greek\\" is a hymn to life lived in simplicity and in straightforwardly rejoicing in the senses, the very opposite of the austere message of Jonathan Livingston. And it has style and beauty. It is a book about loving Incarnation, whereas Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a book about pseudo-spiritual escapism based on violence against oneself.For those who want philosophy written not in the form of myth but plainly, Jiddu Krishnamurti's books may also work as a potent antidote to Richard Bach's destructive idealism and the illusory hopes it generates. They may also teach you the right kind of effort. Jonathan Livingston represents in my view the wrong kind of effort."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I remember when Jonathan came out. I think Paul Twitchell had just died, or was just about to. I found it a tribute to his life. Being at multiple places at the same time. Using Paul's 'Soul Travel' to rise above time and space.

What this teaches is that you can write a fairly disguised children's book, or steal the sermon from your local clergyman, add some out of focus black and white photos and make a fortune. THIS is what this book really teaches. I suppose since it was rejected by so many publishers before it was printed, attests to the theme of the book, keep trying no matter what other's say.It also is a not so thinly disguised New Testament in 52 pages. Not beingof the Christian persuasion, and an agnostic at best, I was offended by the Jesus story.....oh, it's about SEAGULLS, I see (gull).I have enough Christianity shoved down my gagging throat now by the media, the politicians in this America founded on separation of church and state.Keep your beliefs and strive to be different may be a nice philospohy, but the jails and unemployment offices are full of \\"independent thinkers\\".

It's usually referred to as insanity.In order to achieve my own personal dreams, I am going to write a nice little booklet about how extraterrestrials have been running the US Government for the past 50 years, and that the mothership is waiting.

It basically erects a facade of enlightenment on a way of life that is essentially childish and selfish - which is a reflection of the life lived by the man who wrote the book - a way of life that most people could not live unless Mom & Dad and/or the government and/or your deceived devotes were paying the bills while you were off at the ashram contemplating yourself.When I first read this back in the 1970's it was required reading from our hippy-dippy \\"humanities\\" teacher in high school.

He received great meaning from the book and I thought - as an 8 year-old - that it was just a stupid book. I remember not understanding the book very well as he read it to me but more so, not understanding why my father was reading a book to me. I didn't know how to respond, how to act, what to say as this strange man read a strange book to me. The book meant something to him but by the fact that he was reading it to an 8 year-old was proof that he was doing it for himself, not me. I couldn't wait until he finished so I could go watch \\"The Brady Bunch.\\"I revisited the book as an adult and still thought it was a ridiculous cliche and unoriginal in its story and execution. Perhaps my childhood memories tainted my adult view of the book (of course they did) but I think you can read the book now and wonder why it was considered so unique and groundbreaking in its time. I realize we can read books like \\"Seagull\\" and \\"I'm Okay, You're Okay\\" more than 30 years later and think they are absolutely moronic because many of us didn't grow up as adults in the 1960s and 70s.

First, it manages to be truely universal. Unlike so many inspirational works, the situation in which Johnathan finds himself could easily become a metaphor for anything worth the aspirations of an individual. Second, it manages to be a reat story. This makes it an easy and enjoyable read, rather than just a series of appeals to perseverance. This keeps the book from becomming preachy or condescending, which is so often the problem with works of this type. Also, the nature of Bach's message is stresses not only the rewards of perseverance, but also the difficulties that are inherent in it, which is important in fulling exploring the intricacies of his point. On top of all of this, Bach has a special gift for prose and storytelling that allows the reader to forget that he/she is reading a work of fiction and instead believe that this seagull really does exist, thus making his plight all the more enlightening. For teachers seeking to motivate students, coaches trying to motivate athletes, or parents trying to motivate children, this is a perfect place to start."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"You all know it this book. You may even have fond memories of your mom reading it to you: I do. But this slimy collection of self-important piety and nonsensical bilge is one of the most horrific encapsulations of what is rotten and bad in western society today. In it, a sentient air-rat decides he's much too important to deal with small minded concerns, like making a seagull's living eating fish. He decides he's some kind of artist. He meets an asian air-rat who is of course much more wise and deep than his own whitebread air-rat self, and becomes some sort of super spiritual air-rat. Not content to jockey around the entire universe like some kind of air-rat version of Padre de Pio, he returns to earth to lord it over the other air rats with his superior spiritual pose. Of course, the only air rats who listen to him are similar outcasts from air rat society. He then attempts (successfully) to destroy air-rat society from within. Because it's a story written by a wretched hippy, the air-rats move on to a higher spiritual plane rather than starving to death, which would be the real outcome of such a course of action.Throughout this abomination against all human decency, reference is made to the word \\"love.\\" As the famous line in \\"Princess Bride\\" goes, \\"You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.\\" The author, of course abandoned his family, and went through a succession of trophy wives once he got famous. Because, rather than being a superior seagull, Richard Bach was merely a self-important monstrous one; a typical scoundrel who tapped into the zeitgeist of his era. He even rationalized the whole thing in a hippy dippy way; go look it up on Wikipedia.This sort of fortune-cookie spiritual hokum and self-justifying baloney is exactly what is wrong with everyone. Duty, honor, decency, good humor and common sense are extinct. In its place is a prim, flatulent, doltish self-rationalization of petulant, grubby \\"whatever I feel like, because I am one of the enlightened\\" idiocy.

Perhaps when viewed in its historical context, being published in the early '70s on the brink of all the self-help drivel that followed, it could be considered original or extraordinary. But to me, it was the opposite. It was as if Richard Bach was trying to incorporate every feel-good cliche and every religious idea into one marketable paperback.If this book changed your life, I am happy that you have been helped.

I was captivated by his \\"Stranger to the Ground\\", so I sought out his more famous \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\\". Great idea and presented well (at first). About the life of an overachiever seagull in the seagull community. Some very interesting technical seagull flight science. I've been around seagulls and casually studied them myself. I was interested in this and looking forward to it. May I add that I wasn't looking for a zoological piece on seagulls . . . I was indeed seeking a bit of whimsy.Unfortunately, after the thrilling openers on the art of flight, the story drifts into metaphysics and becomes rather preachy, with forays into ideas of reincarnation, universal interconnection, be-all-you-can-be, blah, blah, blah. I don't even agree with that stuff but could have written this part myself, considering the hackneyed ideas shared here.You'll likely read this short work in 30 minutes. Half of the book is filler of photos of seagulls in flight. The first couple dozen were interesting. After that they became, well, filler. But without them you would have had a magazine article and not a book.Overrated, but I suppose the philosophy appeals to a literary faction \\"in the power\\"."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Since my youth, this book has been an incredible inspiration to me. It helps all who read it persevere through adversity, trials and triumphs. I have drawn from it examples for teaching, coaching and counseling all who may be in need of direction or strength to carry on. It might be especially helpful for those who are transitioning from one era of their life to another. It addresses the full gamut of life, and life beyond. The only hiccup in the whole of the script, is toward the latter half of the book when the phrase \\"forget about faith\\" is used. Although maybe out of context and not at all what Bach, the author, intended, it is all about Faith. I give a lot of copies out to friends and clients, whenever I get a copy I suggest omitting that phrase. Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a must read for anyone searching for direction in their lives, especially if they are an athlete currently in competitive arenas, or moving on and trying to deal with who they used to be."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This is the story of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a seagull who has some extraordinary adventures. Young Jonathan feels that there must be more to life than eating, the main preoccupation of his fellow gulls, and has become fascinated by flight as an end in itself, not just as a means of finding food. He begins to experiment and discovers that he is capable of flying at high speed and of performing all kinds of daring and exhilarating aerial feats. Outraged by Jonathan's refusal to conform to the norms of seagull society, the other gulls expel him from his flock, but this ostracism in no way affects his determination to learn all he can about flying and his quest for perfection.Some have seen the book as trite and banal, but in my view it can work on a number of different levels. Jonathan's adventures continue after his earthly death, which have led some to read a spiritual meaning into it. It has even been seen as a Christian allegory, with Jonathan as a Christ-figure leading others to salvation. This interpretation has not, however, been accepted by all- some fundamentalists have even denounced the work as satanic- and for me it does not really work, for two reasons. Firstly, although some of Jonathan's followers proclaim that he is the son of the Great Gull (for which read God), he himself denies such claims and regards them as a misunderstanding of his teaching. Secondly, Jonathan's passage to the afterlife is presented not as the ascent of a justified soul to a Christian heaven but as reincarnation on a higher, but not necessarily the highest, plane of existence in which he can continue the spiritual development begun on Earth.To me the book is less a Christian homily than an exploration of the alternative, especially Asian, forms of spirituality which were becoming popular in the West in the sixties and seventies. (It was first published in 1970). Jonathan's mentor in the \\"higher plane\\" is a seagull with the distinctly Chinese name of Chiang. The religious philosophy underlying the story is not so much Christianity but a theistic form of Buddhism, with Jonathan as a bodhisattva, that is to say an enlightened being who, motivated by compassion, assists others towards enlightenment. The book ends with Jonathan's transition from learner to teacher, one who passes on his idealism and his love for flying to other gulls.Coexisting with its spiritual aspects, the book also contains secular meanings. On the one hand it is an obvious satire on materialism and conformity, on the other it can also be interpreted as preaching an optimistic philosophy that \\"you can do anything if you want it enough and if you try hard enough\\". (The secret, according to Chiang, is to \\"begin by knowing that you have already arrived\\"). This would link the book with the self-help and positive thinking movements, although Richard Bach was presumably not thinking of the materialistic side of self-help. (\\"You can have the perfect job, a huge house and millions in your bank account if only you want it enough........\\"). A pilot himself, he was using flight as a metaphor both for spiritual growth and secular self-perfection.The story is a simple one, reminiscent of a fable or folk-tale, but it is surprisingly deep; Bach's superficially simple tale has several different levels of meaning, and it is certainly a work of some literary merit. Nevertheless, there is a reason why I have only awarded it three stars. Even works of literary merit need to demonstrate some sort of value for money. It is not a novel nor for that matter a novella, although it is sometimes described as one, but a short story. My copy runs to 88 pages, but only 40 actually contain the text of the story, most of the remainder being taken up with some unremarkable- and in some cases frankly dull- black-and-white photographs of seagulls. Even that total of 40 pages is only achieved by some very generous typesetting and the use of a smaller format than most modern paperbacks. 6.99 for the paperback version is really too much to pay for a single short story which, in a normal format, would run only to some 20 or 30 pages. Mr Bach and his publishers should consider either bringing out a cheaper edition."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"For anyone who always seems out of step with the people around him.

I also grew up, and still live, near the ocean, where seagulls always maintain a constant presence - which made the metaphorical vehicle for this story particularly apt in my case. It remains one of my very favorite books, even to this day.The truly amazing thing (the thing that elevates this book to a 10) is how elegantly, simply, and deftly the author covers such profound material, with such a minimum of effort and words. The book weighs in at a mere 128 pages ... over half of them B&W; photos of seagulls ... so it's actually less than 60 pages of text. If you reformatted it to small, normal size print, it'd probably drop to about 30 pages. I recently re-read it in about 2 hours, so it's a very fast read - but it's tiny size is greatly outweighed by it's impact. One could easily argue that the story is prose poetry, rather than a short story, because of it's well honed cadence.I highly recommend this gem for anyone (particularly those in their teens and twenties) who's groping about for their emotional, spiritual, and intellectual niche in society, and life in general.Life can be hard, lonely and painful at times - but every once in a while we stumble across a rare gem ... be it a person or a moment or a song or a book or the touch of a friendly hand ... that helps us catch a glimpse of what it's really all about, and which lets us know that we're not alone, and that there are others out there, like us, who occasionally 'get it' too.For music lovers, there's also a lovingly produced full length orchestral album (by Neil Diamond) that was inspired by this book.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The tale of Jonathan Seagull is one of trials and unknown growth.

In the simplistic sense it is the story of a seagull who is exiled from the flock because of unseagull like tendencies. Jonathon was a seagull who dreams of flying, not like the other gulls, but to the full extent of his potential. He wants to be better, to fly better and this is contrary to the nature of the flock. He doesn't fit in and he is exiled for it. After the exile he discovers that there is an entirely different world out there with gulls who are also trying to reach their potential. He becomes part of this world and tries to teach other gulls to not just follow the flock but rather to excel and be a better gull. This is the simple explanation of the story.This is also not all there is to the story of Jonathon Livingston Seagull. This is a fable for us to learn a lesson from. Richard Bach is telling us that we can be like Jonathon Seagull. He is telling us that we must still seek our higher ambition even if our friends and family don't understand or try to hold us back.

As he continues to develop his flying skills, he is cast out of his flock and told never to return. This is where the real adventure begins with Jonathan meeting other seagulls, just like him, who love flying and are perfecting their skills.This is a beautiful story about going beyond our perceived limitations of life and seeing possibilities. It is about freedom, love, and happiness. There are many lessons to be learned from this book including that we are limited by our thoughts and that we are capable of accomplishing our goals.

I have read it as a bed time story to youngsters, and like John Bertrand, in &quot;Born to win&quot; the story of the 1983 America's Cup campaign (Forward by Richard Bach) have worked with Jonathan as an inspirational model for team building and one-on-one coaching. Courage and persistance in the pursuit of personal excellence are tenants of this tale which is underpinned by values which support the personal development of individuals and of society. Our hero is a seagull, with an unlikley scenario in which to provide the reader with a prescription for personal insight and growth. This books descriptive prose allows the reader to be alongside Jonathan as his adventure unfolds (&quot;he eased out of the dive and shot over the waves, a grey cannonball under the moon.&quot;). The book also contains a myriad of photographic illustrations, further entrancing the reader throughout this epic journey. This book should be in every bookcase.

It contains the most important truths I have ever learned.This book certainly could be viewed as Eastern Religion / New Age, and considering Bach's other books perhaps that is his main meaning.However, JLS also contains important non-religious truths which apply to everyday life. For example, based on one of the most quoted parts of the book, \\"Jonathan\\" might answer everyday questions like this:Are you saying I can lose weight and be thin, even though I've been fat my whole life?I say you are free.Are you saying that even though I finished near the bottom this year, with hard work I could finish near the top 3 or 4 years from now?I say you are free.Are you saying that even though the aptitude test showed I'm bad in math, that I could be successful in my dream job, engineering, if I try hard enough?I say you are free.Those answers are very, very different from the prevailing paradigm / meme within our society, which says that nearly everything is determined at birth, so that we are born either \\"fat\\" or \\"thin\\" people, born \\"smart\\" or \\"bad at math\\", born as \\"great athletes\\" or \\"losers\\". Society then tells us that we shouldn't try to change anything about ourselves (since it supposedly won't work), but should spend our lives happy or bitter because of the gifts that were handed out at the birth lottery. A key turning point is when Jonathan rejects the \\"strange hollow voice\\" in his mind which tells him:\\"There's no way around it. I am a seagull. I am limited by nature. If I were meant to learn so much about flying, I'd have charts for brains. If I were meant to fly at speed, I'd have a falcon's short wings... I must... be content as I am, as a poor limited seagull.\\"Jonathan rejects this when he realizes that by tucking his wings close to his body he can simulate the falcon's short wings and fly fast even though he wasn't born with short wings. After he tries this and is able to fly faster than any gull could with extended wings, Jonathan realizes: \\"We can be free! We can learn to fly!\\"JLS says that mental restrictions are the biggest factor keeping us from reaching our potential. Some of those restrictions come from society, and some are self-created mental straitjackets. All of those mental limits are false and unnecessary. The truth according to Jonathan is:\\"Your whole body... is nothing more than your thought itself, in a form you can see. Break the chains of your mind, and you break the chains of your body, too...\\"(That can be seen as a totally non-religious statement. Our bodies today are the result of how hard we worked in the past and the mental limitations we didn't shed, and \\"our thought\\" = our mind is what determined that.)This leads Jonathan to answer these questions very differently from society: Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Should I be egotistical?Society tells us that we should conform, and we specifically are what the birth lottery gave us, like someone might be \\"heavy set, average intelligence but good in math\\". Society says that we should be immensely proud of everything we (supposedly) were born with, and of every victory, and should be intensely ashamed of anything we were born without, and of every defeat.Jonathan however, believing we are not limited by birth, sees each of us as being unique and of unlimited potential. Our goal and purpose in life is simply to be ourselves. This is not the limited self we are at the start of adult life, but everything which hard work could make us:\\"you have the freedom to be yourself, your true self, here and now, and nothing can stand in your way.Are you saying I can fly?I say you are free.\\"\\"Each of us in truth is an idea... , an unlimited idea of freedom, and precision flying is a step towards expressing our real nature. Everything that limits us we have to put aside.\\"This means that ego is meaningless, because what we are today is simply the result of yesterday's hard work, and whatever races we lose today could be won in the future if we work hard enough. Today's ranking and abilities are just the starting point for the rest of our lives, not something to get egotistical about. As one of Jonathan's students thought with a smile once he began teaching his own students, \\"No limits, Jonathan? Well, then, the time's not too distant when I'm going to appear out of thin air on YOUR beach, and show you a thing or two about flying!...\\"The reason why I discussed this in length is to disagree with reviews which say that JLS must be seen as a religious book, and that it teaches only \\"common sense\\" truths. It is rare, not common, to meet anyone who believes what JLS teaches."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A book about \\"instructors\\" full of desire to give \\"something of truth\\" to whoever has a burning drive to learn what is unknown to him - be it some useful method to achieve a specific goal or the meaning behind that goal itself.

I will admit, the fact that it is a short book with large print was a welcome suprise to me at first, but while reading the book I found myself wishing it was longer.By this I don't mean the book lacked anything, but just that I loved the book so much I wanted more.Yes, I, like many, was influenced greatly by this book. I know, I know, \\"He's a seagull!\\" but the fact of the matter is, it doesn't matter what he is necessarily. If you're not comfortable finding inspiration in the form of a seagull, then rewrite the book in your mind to fit your needs. Jonathan in a inspiration because of the things he does, not what species he is.If you are a reader who enjoys philosophy, but not books that over complicate everything for the purpose of sounding more important, JLS is the book for you. It is a short, simple read, but for those with an open mind and a good imagination, its effect will continue for years after you read it."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Sometimes I come to meet the force of tradition which is too terrible at least for me. I think that the more creative one should be -at least- protected &amp; given chances to realize his or her creative ideas as far as acceptable. But it is not so in my society just because such acceptances may result in the break of binding force of the long- lived tradition. Now I, who was very depressed at these situatios, have come to have courage that I will overcome all my difficulties till the days when I am good enough to love my surroundings."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"After I read this book, every time I saw a seagull I thought of Johnathan Livingston seagull and how even though his elders through great shame and dishonor toward him he didnt let that put him down and he still did the one thing he loved flying. Thats why I invite you to live the adventure of flight and life with Johnathan a Seagull in the wonderful book Johnathan Livingston Seagull written by Richard Bach."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I have read and re read this book many times and must have gifted at least a hundred copies. This story is just not about a seagull or about flight. This is a story on the need to leave the mundane behind and push yourself to be perfect in whatever you do. It also tells you that it is not easy to reach there, but the joy of reaching there is worth the efforts. A must for youngsters in particular. Wheever Iam down I just read this again and am back on track going where I want to go. A book that will live forever.C T Lakshmanan, India"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I bought my original copy in '72 and have read and reread it many times.

I was looking through the bookshelfs in the classroom and stumbled upon this book. It was to change my life forever (and I damn well mean that!)This book has a way to put me at peace with myself every time I read it. It's just got an effect which is unexplainable, but undoubtedly real.If I had the money, I'd buy everyone in the world a copy of this book, then the world would be at peace :)"},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"A wonderful story.

It challenges you to be more than you have ever imagined you could be."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"I agree with Pop Psych 101's observation regarding the readers' comments. They are so &quot;feel good-sugar-coated&quot; that it is frightening to see how greatly our youth lacks an understanding for allegory and symbolism. The gull is just a fictional character, people!!...On the other hand, this book greatly affected my boyfriend in positive ways when he was younger, that still influence him today. He is not afraid to be humble at all... and he is a very strong person (both physically and emotionally) And has a very high position, yet he is not afraid to be kind to people on a &quot;lower rung&quot;. He realizes you can be yourself and kind to others, while maintaining a strong character... NOW, did he get this philosophy from this book? No. He got it from Christianity...Yet, it intrigues me that at 30 years old, this book still influences him in subtle ways. And in fun ways...ie: Seeing the Gulls at the Shore, he leans toward me and says, &quot;that's Young Jonathan&quot; I'm going to read this book and find out about it. At the worst, it will be just a well written book!So, people, please read more, and stay away from TV and Video Games... your brains are being zombied out!!!!PS,,, just because many people are believing the same thing... doesn't mean it is necessarily wrong. (or right)."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"This story will change your life forever, if you understand the message.I read this book and saw the movie as a student in the 8th grade. This book has a very strong meaning and has helped me to make a difference in my life. This book has remained as my favorite book, to this day. I still love to read it. Jonathan Livingston Seagull is my role model. I feel that this story also helped me to develop strong charisma in my life.I strongly recommend this book for class readings for anyone with students age 12 or older. I am very thankful to my teacher, Mrs. Jimenez, for sharing this book with her class and me."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"The book is metaphorical, simple, and very inspirational. Jonathan Livingston is a seagull who found it boring to crave for food and tried to fly in the sky, unlike his fellow earth-living seagulls. Jonathan was immediately proclaimed The Outcast and expelled from the Flock; he has been to Heaven and back; he had lots of followers in the end, and made his ideas of freedom popular. Jonathan Livingston overcame the contempt, social problems, and his nature of seagull for the sake of being able to follow his dreams.The book reflects the ideals of freedom; freedom of thought, of self-expression, and of dreaming is what keeps Jonathan going ahead. As every innovator, he must not be afraid of becoming an outcast - and he is not. In the end, he is rewarded with realization of his dreams of rapid flights.The book is somewhat simplistic; the idea is repeated in Gorkyi, Coelho, and many other inspirational writings. For that reason, many reviewers are lowering the rating. But simplistic does not necessarily mean primitive; most pieces of wisdom can be expressed very easily. Jonathan Livingston is a nice metaphor, and the book overall is a cute and inspirational reading."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"Place this between the Tao Te Ching and Sun Tzu - So odd life imitating life -imitating fiction.

The inspirational story of a bird who learns to trust his instincts and break away from society's conventions to discover his true self.

I read the book when I was first opening up spiritually and feeling what it meant to be a divine being created by universal being. This book expresses this thought in a story form, simply and clearly. It also touches upon how you will be shunned by your tribe when you aim higher than mere survival and even how with compassion we need to go back to the tribe to help it to grow, and then leave again. I suspect that many who walked the planet followed this pattern."},{"Title":"Jonathan Livingston Seagull: A Story","review":"When I first read JLS in 1971 I didn't get it; too young.
