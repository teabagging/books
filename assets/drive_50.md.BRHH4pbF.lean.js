The excerpts from Jameson will prove thought-provoking to any student or activist who wants to maintain the critical praxis of Marxism, but wants to move away from its historic economic focus. Consequently, by expanding Marx's concept of the mode of production, and through insightful analyses of history, art, film, music, and architecture Jameson provides an insight into the value of Marxism for what Wendy Brown (and others) have called these postmodern times."},{"Title":"The Jameson Reader","review":"Fredric Jameson (b. 1934) is one of the most influential and original thinkers of our time. He first began to publish important work in the 1960s. After earning a Ph.D. in French literature at Yale in 1959, Jameson revised his dissertation and published it as \\"Sartre: The Origins of a Style,\\" a book which is still one of the finest examinations of its subject.Throughout the Sixties, Jameson read deeply in Marxist literature, from Mehring and Plekhanov to Adorno, Lukacs, and Sartre, and his extensive research and immersion in Marxism resulted in 1971's seminal \\"Marxism and Form,\\" a landmark in Marxist criticism and an unsurpassed dialectical survey of the 20th century's most important communist writings. With this book, Jameson established himself as the foremost Marxist critic of his time, rivalled only by Terry Eagleton, whose approaches to criticism and the dialectic are highly disparate from Jameson's.Jameson's interests and expertise are catholic, and his prose style, so often referred to as \\"difficult\\" or \\"impenetrable,\\" has always struck me with its elegance, precision, and singularity. No one else writes sentences like him, and no other critic's prose offers as much sheer aesthetic pleasure. In his criticism, Jameson's allusions and insights are always profound and original. His powers of associative and lateral thinking are unique. Whatever his subject, from critiquing a Balzac novel to limning \\"The Godfather,\\" Jameson's approach is resolutely Marxist and his dialectic fluid and densely erudite.\\"The Jameson Reader\\" offers readers an excellent introduction to the world of Jameson's thought, with essays ranging from the state of Marxist criticism in modern academe to \\"narrative as a socially symbolic act.\\" His groundbreaking examinations of postmodernism are included as well. The introduction and commentary by the editors are superb throughout.Anyone seeking familiarity with the work of Fredric Jameson should start with \\"The Jameson Reader.\\" No one looks at our modern world with a more penetrating gaze, and if any modern critic's work will last, it is his."},{"Title":"The Last Scream","review":"I liked this book.

A bomb exploded in the \`House of Mirrors' killing twelve people; A person got trapped to death beneath the Ferris Wheel; the manager of the Animal Preserve was mauled to death by lions and so on. Due to these strange and bizarre incidents, Fear Park had been closed till now.Dierdre Bradley has a nightmare about the Park. She dreams about watching the \\"Hatchet Show\\", an event that took place at the park in 1935, where some kids who were chopping wood became crazy and started chopping each other to death. In her dream, Dierdre sees her boyfriend Robin chopping others in the group. Dierdre wakes up and foresees her dream as a warning of things to come in Fear Park. Dierdre's father, Jason is the owner of Fear Park and plans to reopen it to the public. Dierdre cannot convince her father to close the park because they have literally invested all their money into its success, and without it, they would be broke.What Dierdre is unaware of is that her boyfriend Robin Fear is the cause for all the trouble. Robin's father Nicholas, did not want the Bradleys to build an amusement park in his land, but they did anyway, so Robin is trying to fulfill his father's wishes to make sure that Fear Park is closed one way or another, even if it means killing the Bradleys. Having made himself and his girlfriend Meghan immortal, Robin is experienced in the black arts, and chants spells on Jason and Dierdre to close down Fear Park.However, Robin starts becoming very suspicious when Dierdre starts hanging out with a tall, lanky, red-haired guy named Gary. Robin's attempt at killing Dierdre fails whenever she is with Gary. Robin gets convinced that Gary is an immortal person too, and is protecting Dierdre from Robin's spells. Who will win the battle, Robin or Dierdre?Review: Since I haven't read the previous two volumes in the \\"Fear Park\\" series, I really didn't know what to expect. Even though it is fairly easy to understand the storyline (without reading the previous 2 books), this was a really hard book to read, mainly because it was so gory. I have read a lot of Fear Street books, and I hardly remember any of them having this much violence. Some parts were just disgusting, like when Jason starts removing big fat worms from his throat, or when someone starts vomiting green glob from the Ferris Wheel.Also, I thought the book ended really abruptly, because there were quite a few issues Stine never gave an explanation to, especially in terms of who Gary really is. Why did he suddenly start hanging around Dierdre in the first place? If he is not immortal, then why didn't Robin's spells work on him?Even though I enjoyed the twist in the climax of the story, I felt that there was hardly any suspense or fear in the book, and a lot of unnecessary gruesome details. Unless you are a fan of the previous Fear Park novels, I would avoid reading this one."},{"Title":"The Last Scream","review":"This is the last book of the series. I really enjoyed this series.

It is the first novel that I have read by Michael McGarrity, and is a tense and succinct story in the police procedural genre whose realism stems from the fact that it is written by a former sheriff who has been there and done that. The detailed descriptions and insightful observations throughout the book clearly ring true because of the author's background and training. Interestingly enough, despite the fact that the story occurs within a very compressed time period, both the level of detail and complications introduced by the subplots made it seem to progress in an orderly fashion rather than the nonstop pace of much of contemporary crime oriented fiction. This and the New Mexico locale clearly are partially responsible for the similarities to Tony Hillerman's books upon which others have commented.The basic storyline is simplicity itself. A well known local attorney (and friend of Police Chief Kevin Kerney) is gunned down outside his Santa Fe office. There are no witnesses and relatively little evidence, so in the search for a motive the police begin an investigation into both his professional cases and his personal life (he was gay). The investigation turns disastrous when two innocent people die, perhaps as the result of the overzealous pursuit of an apparent suspect who is totally innocent of any involvement in the crime. Then Kerney's horse is viciously destroyed, his pregnant wife threatened, and the discovery of another victim is accompanied by a note that the end result will be that EVERYONE DIES.This a story in which the tension builds as the book proceeds, both for Kerney and his wife Sara and for the reader. It is like you are watching someone assemble the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, but where you know what the picture looks like and he doesn't. This is because the story is written from multiple perspectives, sometimes in the third person but also from the viewpoint of several of the participants including that of the murderer. Thus, the reader gradually understands the motivations behind the acts of violence and eventually learns the identity of the killer, but in a way that heightens the tension. (Remember. this is not a detective story, the mystery for the reader is what will happen, not who did it.)The book provides an interesting profile of a genuine psychopath and the cleverness involved in his acts. And there are some wonderful philosophical insights as well, my favorite probably was how the investigation led Cruz Tofoya to observe how the ripple effect of murder always seemed to destroy so many lives beyond that of the victims.While I really enjoyed the book, there are a few reasons why it did not rise to the level of a five star rating. First, the violence was quite graphic in spots, especially with regard to the animals involved. (Although arguably essential to the story, it is not to my taste.) Second, the ending was quite abrupt and one of a few instances near that conclusion that seemed somewhat unrealistic. While, I can't discuss them without revealing more of the plot than what is on the book jacket, it seemed at times the author chose to reach his desired results by having some of the individuals act somewhat out of character. Third, the book would have been improved considerably for me by the simple expedient of including a map of the area. I was reading most of it where a map was not readily available; I am not familiar with New Mexico and while such geographic knowledge was not essential there are numerous references to the various locales and I would have really enjoyed referring to a map on the front overleaf.One final suggestion is that if you are not familiar with Kevin Kerney, the recurring protagonist of McGarrity's books, you might want to read the previous volume before this book. I wish that I had. In THE BIG GAMBLE, Kerney investigates a case with another lawman, Clayton Istee, a son whose existence his Indian mother had kept secret from Kerney. Since Istee plays a pivotal role in this story (both in terms of the investigation and emotionally for Kerney), the background of that book would have been helpful.Disclaimer: In the interest of full disclosure, I was furnished a review copy of this book by the publisher based my interest in this genre as evidenced by my previous reviews of similar books. I have no relationship and have never met either the author or anyone employed by the publisher, and furnished no guarantee that I would even submit a review. If anything, in order to prove my objectivity I perhaps presented my criticisms in more detail than they deserve. Nevertheless, people in my business have belatedly learned too much disclosure is preferable to not enough, so this addendum is offered in that spirit.Tucker Andersen"},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Having never read Michael McGarrity fiction, I am unable to compare this novel with previous works in what is apparently a series. I actually did not know it was a series until I read it somewhere, so that certainly says something.I like crime fiction, and the challenge of figuring out \\"who done it\\". It's disappointing when it's too easy. That didn't happen here. The story begins with the murder of a prominent gay attorney. There are several angles to be explored, but nothing stands out that makes the victim an obvious target. Our protaganist, Kevin Kerney, is pulled off his vacation to try to solve the crime. He is then yanked smack dab into the middle of the mystery when his beloved horse is killed in a cruel way. It all becomes very personal when a dead rat is delivered to his doorstep along with threats toward his pregnant wife and the rest of his family.I won't go into the details, you should read them for yourself! There are plot twists, interesting characters, real personalities. The Santa Fe setting is a refreshing departure from the usual gritty New York crime novels. The fact that the author is a former detective adds authenticity.Now that I know it's a series, I will definitely look for the others and catch up with these characters. Overall, a fine book that I recommend to anyone who likes a good mystery and/or crime fiction."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"This excellent series continues with a procedural that needs more of Kerney, and a little less of the spare step by step police investigation."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"I had never heard of Michael McGarrity, and found the cover and the plot summary both a bit off-putting, and wasn't expecting to like this book. I was delightfully surprised to discover that unlike many writers in the murder, mayhem and mystery genre, McGarrity didn't slipslide at all into the murky depths of horrifying psychotic evil, gratuitous garbage-language,-sex,-blood,-gore and cruelty, and wallow there for several hundred pages.He wrote a book about a psychotic killer, yes, but he didn't allow his writing to sink to the level of the killer. It's a very good book with breadth and depth even with a \\"less-is-more\\" control over the verbiage, which I like and respect. His story line and characters are engaging. The mystery is compellingly presented. I finished it and rushed to my nearest bookstore to buy all the other Mike McGarrity murder, mayhem and mystery books and have since read them and found them as engaging as Everybody Dies! Keep on writing, Mr. McGarrity!"},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"After about one fourth of the way into this book I began skimming pages and still easily followed the plot. The author has written some fairly decent books but this is not one of them. This book is evidence of formula writing at its worst. The plot is too ambitious with gratitious carnage - cumbersome transition - characters not well developed."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin Kerney is on the hunt for a revenge killer while waiting for the birth of his child. Not everyone dies, but there is a lot of death. Within barely 100 pages, there were already three human deaths and two dead animals. By the end of the book, there were so many deaths past and present that I was immune to it. That's not really a good thing. The book dragged quite a bit. I frequently put it down and really felt no need to get back to it. The narrative seemed disjointed; there was just too much going on. The climax was very anti-climatic. It seemed more like an afterthought to the story. There was a lot of buildup, but not much pay-off. I do like the characters of Kevin Kerney and his wife Sara. There is good character development throughout the series. I have liked the Kevin Kearney series in the past and wanted to like this one, but this just was not as good as the others."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"With a book that's part of a series, there's always the question of whether the book makes any sense at all if you haven't been following the series all along. The \\"Kevin Kerney\\" series has a back-story (the background contains evolving information about the lives of the characters which has nothing to do with the plot) but each book is also quite readable on its own. The mystery plot is good enough to carry even the new reader along.Nonetheless, I'd certainly recommend that you read the whole series- they are all interesting. _Serpent Gate_ and _Under the Color of Law_ are especially good, in my opinion. Worth your while to read them.In _Everyone Dies_, we have a continuation of the backstory of Kevin's son, whom he only recently discovered existed. Kevin gets to know his son better - and to work with him, on this case.The plot: a gay lawyer gets murdered, right in front of his office. One of the questions: is it because he's gay, or because he's a lawyer, or some other reason the police have no idea of? One small bit of stereotyping I could have lived without: the lawyer's life partner owns an antiques shop. Personally, I would like to see authors stop casting gay characters in antiques and interior decorating. That's a small quibble, however- it doesn't spoil the book.Besides the gay community in Santa Fe, we also get to deal with the mentally ill community - always a challenge for the police. We have social workers who are sure that their clients are ALWAYS wronged innocents; questions about how well the laws about screening gun purchasers work; and whether police get enough training in how to approach the mentally ill. Where I live, Austin, we've had a couple of incidents in the past couple of years, of a police officer shooting a mentally ill person who turned out to be unarmed. These incidents are still \\"under review\\" and nothing much has changed. However, when this happens in the book, Kerney is quickly on the ball about changing his force's policy and vowing to improve training. (Makes one wish reality would learn a few lessons from fiction, sigh.)The next character murdered seems to have no connection whatsoever with the first murder. More murders follow, and some are accompanied by personal notes to Kerney. Eventually, Kerney and his staff figure out the connection - and then the race is to catch the killer before the trend continues. All of this is made more frantic by the fact that Kerney's wife Sara is extremely pregnant.In the course of trying to stop this killer, Kerney discovers evidence of another set of murders by a serial killer. There's an interesting twist here - I won't give it away.This series is slightly different from others set in the Southwest, in that our hero is not a Native American; fans of Tony Hillerman who like those kinds of series specifically because the characters are Native Americans might have been disappointed when they first read one book in this series. However, this book should bring those readers back into the fold, as Kevin's half-Indian son, who is also in law enforcement, becomes one of the more important characters.A good book in a good series, one I intend to keep reading the moment any new book comes out!"},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"I've been an avid reader of McGarrity's Kevin Kerney police novels since the first, because he is a highly skilled writer, the plots move quickly and smoothly, the characters are quirky and intuitive, Chief Kerney is very empathetic, and the scenic descriptions take me right back to New Mexico state. Despite the provocations of sociopathic killers, Kerney always remains laconic and cool, in control of his emotions and, seemingly, the events. For good or ill in its attractiveness to the reader, the author never ratchets terror high, even when a killer stewed in revenge, as here, intends it.My total enjoyment of this story had only two blemishes. Midway through, the author mistakenly let us see how the murderer is planting a false trail (rather than let us make that chilling conclusion). Rather than a clever twist in the plot, this view quite took the rising suspense out of the next 50 pages for me. (Perhaps McGarrity should be excused, in view of the subsequent shocking twist he gives to the \\"false\\" suspect.) Second, the ending was too rushed, both as a scene and relative to the intricate build up to it. The climax was too vaguely described, leaving me in doubt as to who had their finger on the final trigger. Minor disappointments are that we never do find out all the ways in which the killer got his incredibly detailed info on his targets; and Kerney allows his wife, Sara Brannon, a military policewoman, to insist on committing a great breakdown in discipline, leading to a more dangerous final confrontation.Thankfully, this is the first time McGarrity has used the plot device--targeting and terrorizing the hero's family--that, repeated, turned me right off of later Cornwall and Patterson mystery series. I'd not like to lose McGarrity, too. The art on recent covers is too generic, urban even, which the horse-loving rancher/policeman Kerney is not at all about; the art should return to New Mexican scenes of the earlier and strongly atmospheric books, please."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Everyone Dies is the newest in a great series, but not the best of the series. We get the continuation of Chief Kerney's relationship with his often absent wife, his recently discovered son and other characters who have grown familiar as the series has developed. There are a lot of violent murders and the gradual introduction to the murderer as he pursues his agenda. It is the good police work and quick analysis of the evidence as the case takes unexpected twists and turns that keeps the reader's attention. It is a exciting, quick read that I would recommend to anyone who likes a good mystery. Skip some of the poorly written &quot;best sellers&quot; that everyone is reading and dig into one of the better written mystery series and you will be rewarded.I would recommend reading the earlier books in the series first to get the background on these characters. I have been a fan of the series since Tularosa and will continue to read any books by Michael McGarrity since they are well written and take place in areas of the Southwest with which I am very familiar."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Like the previous entries in this series, Kerney is once again haunted by his past. As he and his wife (Lt.Col Sara Bannon) get ready for the birth of their son, bodies start to pile up all over Santa Fe. Not only dead people, but rats, dogs, cats and Kerney's beloved stallion. This was an interim selection in the series, that was to give us a portrait of Kerney as an absent father and a new father while protecting his home turf.In the end everyone doesn't die, but a lot of bodies do show up. The 'perp' is a smart ass and we don't find out the reason behind his crimes till the penultimate page in the book. In between we have Kerney playing the steadfast good guy in the white hat, while sharing a first time relationship with his first son (who he didn't know existed for thirty years). All in all it's pretty formulaic and Kerney acts like all TV fathers by getting flustered at the time of birth. McGarrity is usually better than this and doesn't usually go for the easy way out.Too much of the story is people driving around (or flying around) from here to there with touristy descriptions of the local flora and historical settings. Not his bestZeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"This is the first Michael McGarrity book I've read but by the time I finished it, I was out looking for more.Kevin Kerney (the Santa Fe Police Chief) reminded me somewhat of Peter Decker from the Faye Kellerman series. He's devoted to his wife Sara and looking forward to the birth of their little boy. When an attorney is murdered and Kevin's horse is destroyed, its only the start of a killing spree which he realizes will end with his family being the final victims. It's a battle of wits with someone who leaves no clues and a motive is hard to find.The book is violent in its murders but the suspense keeps you turning the pages to find the answers.Now on to the other 6 in this engrossing series."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Kevin Kerney is chief of police in Santa Fe, his wife is due to give birth to their first son and he is building a house. More than enough to cope with without some oddball coming after you with a vengeance, threatening to kill your whole family. And this guy is serious and deranged: people and animals around Kevin are being murdered and his grown-up son's house is blown to pieces. And all the while nearly the whole police force of Santa Fe is involved in trying to track the killer down before he can murder their boss and his family. But the guy is smart and not easy to catch: he has made quite a few false tracks. Until things start to go wrong for him and slowly but surely his plan is starting to go to pieces.This was my first encounter with this series starring Kevin Kerney. He is definitely a very real life police man and the way in which his team tackles the problems is also very believable, which can be explained by the fact that the author was a deputy sheriff in Santa Fe is a very probable explanation for this. The plot is ingenious, even though the reader knows in the end who the killer is. And the descriptions of the landscape, though not disrupting the flow of the story, make you long to go to New Mexico to see for yourself. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Being familiar with the genre of serial mysteries and having read a number of novels in this series, I think this work is pretty much at the apex of what a series can do. McGarrity knows his characters and where they fit in a complex relationship pattern. But then so must his readers. In this novel we see events that are rooted in a complex past.(For example, coming cold to the novel, a reader would be unfamiliar with Kearney's son, Clayton Istee, whose mother and Kearney were lovers in college. Born while an unsuspecting Kearney was serving in Vietnam, Clayton is resolving feelings of abandonment.)McGarrity handles this as well as possible which is why I consider this his best presentation so far, but extra-textal information is a limitation.The novel is primarily a police procedural novel, although the writer uses a sort of fractured narrative - not quite &quot;meanwhile back at the ranch&quot;- as he advances the plot scattered over three or four sites. (NO UNITY OF PLACE HERE) As his characters cell-phone, radio and fax each other, the culprit lurks and listens. He is a shadowy presence, without deep psychological development. Nor does one find the kind of powerful descriptive passages of a writer like James Lee Burke, after all this is a similar but slightly different approach having a continuing character like Robicheaux but with emphasis on procedure.Some aspects of this novel suggest a couple directions the writer may consider. Certainly Clayton Istee may be one path. We have seen how Hillerman moved from Leaphorn to Chee. Kearney's M.P. wife, Sara, now mother but still Lt Colonel (due for promotion) is a possible developmental chain. And Kearney's new ranch - with its nearby wild country - might be a scene of a reprise with the south of the border drug lords he has tangled with before. How long McGarrity can sustain this level and these characters is anyone's guess, but if you are not on board yet, come on."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Everyone Dies is my first Michael McGarrity book and the start of a new series I will be reading. I don't know how this guy has stayed below the radar but this book is as good as any I've read in this genre.Everyone Dies is the latest Kevin Kearney novel, Kearney being the main figure of the book and the series. In this book, killings in Santa Fe ruin a good vacation for Kearney, the Police Chief. At first, the killings don't seemed link but Kearney finally finds out that he, his pregnant wife and his son's family are on the death list. What ensues is a mad dash to find the killer and save his family from their destruction.I think what makes the story so good is that Kearney isn't some daring, dashing hero but just a guy who is looking forward to retirement and moving to his little ranch. He has a rather bizarre marriage as his wife is in the military and stationed in another location, he has a son he only recently learned about and has a down-home quality that makes him the guy you invite over to dinner so he doesn't have to eat alone in some greasy diner.The action in the story is always moving. The characters are added on the fly and he doesn't bog you down in mundane details. However, when he describes locations and settings in the book, you can easily picture them, especially if you've visited the parts of the country he is describing.The only thing I didn't understand in the book was the need to address a gay character and gay community. It doesn't add to the book so I question why McGarrity would find the need to address it.That said, I have begun my quest to go back to Tularosa and catch up with Kevin Kearney and his travels, pitfalls and career up to Everybody Dies.

With his experience at various law enforcement agencies, Mr. McGarrity writes with a most authoritative voice. There is a lot of credibility between the covers.Mr. McGarrity peoples the novel with a host of characters in support of Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin Kerney. The important and continuing ones are fully developed---you truly get to know and care about them.Ultimately this sophisticated tale is one of revenge. A diabolically clever villain from Chief Kerney's past is out to kill Kerney---but not before eliminating those Kerney holds dear. Kerney's wife and unborn son are among the targets.A massive manhunt with all New Mexico law enforcement organizations involved is mounted. Kerney's reputation for decency, fairness and integrity prevents the usual inter-agency turf battles.You feel the frustration, disappointment and stimulation brought on by the day-to-day info gathering, false leads and cold trails the cops encounter---and the elation felt as the pieces of the puzzle come together.In a wonderful twist, the inventive and resourceful villain shrewdly sets up an unwitting loner to take the fall. It is a brilliant cover up, foiled only by the patsy's own extra-legal activities. One of the best reversals I have experienced.New Mexico is an important character in all the Kerney novels. Mr. McGarrity puts you inside the investigation and the Land of Enchantment.An under appreciated author and series. All eight in the Kevin Kerney series are keepers. Do not hesitate to follow this series."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"EVERYONE DIES by Michael McGarrityThe Experienced Crime FighterWhen a former Police Chief who taught at the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy and lives in Santa Fe writes fiction about a crime in Santa Fe he don't have to research the location or his subject. He is writing about something he is very familiar with. His lead characters are Kevin Kerney a Police Chief and his wife a very pregnant Lt. Colonel in the military police. His many characters come out whole with their good and bad strengths and weaknesses for the reader to evaluate as part of the story. It a great story for a reader who likes to get involved.A psychopath with a feud against Kevin Kerney and his family has spent his whole live preparing to wreck revenge again Kevin and killing is merely a means of accomplishing his plan to terrorize the family. He starts out by shooting his first victim and uses knives, poisons, and explosives on people and animals before the end of the story.

Given that murder and mayhem are endlessly popular, competition for readers' attention is keen. In light of the sheer numbers of crime novels that appear annually, it behooves an author to create a work that somehow stands out as uniquely memorable in terms of plot, characters, or literary style. Unfortunately, Michael McGarrity's *Everyone Dies*, while certainly readable, ultimately comes across as just another gore-filled day at the criminologists' office.McGarrity, who apparently bases his writing efforts on real life experience in the field of criminology, displays a knack for weaving a tale of vengeance and criminal plotting that is clever, and at times even inspired. His criminal investigators unravel the deceptions perpetrated by the villain in sometimes fascinating fashion. Also in his favor is the geographically intriguing Santa Fe, New Mexico, setting for this story.Overall, however, McGarrity's literary efforts pale in comparison with other, better-established practitioners of the mystery-writing craft. He includes a few riveting descriptive passages depicting place, situation, and mood, but his efforts pale when compared with those of a more gifted writer like James Lee Burke. His protagonist, Kevin Kerney, simply isn't memorable or particularly interesting when compared to others, such as Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch, and his villain, a cartoon-ish lout who calls himself Samuel Green, lacks the psychological depth that someone like Dennis Lehane would likely provide.There is an excess of gratuitous blood and gore, and the case ultimately is wrapped up in too much of a hurry, almost in &quot;made for tv&quot; fashion. I also found the strong &quot;family values&quot; angle featuring Kerney's pregnant wife and long-long son to be cloying rather than truly touching.Overall, this is a quick, easy read that will keep most readers turning the pages. Perhaps that's enough. But whereas McGarrity certainly demonstrates some talent for mystery writing in this book, there are so many better writers out there that I would hesitate to recommend this novel to my friends."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"I'm rewriting this review because I don't feel I may have done justice to the book in my first review. As aCaveat to the readers of this review, I was contacted by the publisher of the book and sent a free copy of Everyone Dies. My guess being that I had written reviews on books of similar ilk.Several factors entered at the time that I was asked to read the book and review it. To be honest the publisher never intimated it was required I write a review because they sent me a book. Anyway, the major factor that I felt kept me from writing a review worth the book's good and bad points adequately was trying to write the review from a hospital bed while being diagnosed and then treated with pneumonia.So, here goes my second attempt of Everyone Dies. The latest in the long running series written byMichael McGarrity and featuring main character Kevin Kerney. Everyone Dies takes place in and around Sante Fe and other scenic areas in New Mexico. Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin Kerney and his wife, Lt. Colonel Sara Brannon, are on leave and eagerly awaiting the birth of their son when a prominent gay attorney is gunned down outside his office by an unknown assailant. Called to the crime scene and faced with scanty evidence and no apparent motive, Kerney directs his chief of detectives to delve into the victim's personal and professional life, a decision which ultimately leads to a SWAT team screw-up and the death of two innocent people. But the killer has just begun. Kerney's horse, a mustang he'd gentled trained, is viciously and senselessly destroyed, a dead rat is left on his doorstep, and a second victim with ties to the criminal justice system is found in bed with her throat cut along with a warning, EVERYONE DIES.I need to admit right now that I wasn't that impressed with EVERYONE DIES after reading it. I put that off to being ill and feeling like I \\"owed \\" the publisher something for sending me the book.I must say that I've read MOST of the other books in the series. After doing so, I've come to feel that the characters that Michael McGarrity writes about are members of my family. After rereading EVERYONE DIES, I still can't say this is the best Kevin Kerney book. But it does add more \\"character\\" to the already lifelikemanship (is THAT A WORD?) to Kerney, his fiance' Sara, and how the other characters react and \\"live\\" a certain situation. I strongly encourage readers of action-packed police stories to check all of the Kevin Kerney series out. There's alot going for the series. Number one for me: it doesn't take place in LA or NYC. The writer, Michael McGarrity does an excellent job of portraying the natural beauty of the American Southwest. (specifically New Mexico). McGarrity develops believable human relationships for hischaracters to engage his readers.Again, I'd like to thank the publisher for sending me a copy of EVERYONE DIES. Not the best of the writer's work. But good enough to make me want to read more in this series. Another BTW - Many of his published editions have maps drawn by (I believe McGarity's son) placed somewhere close inside the inside cover. I noticed another reviewer who thought the books would be enhanced with a map. The maps are helpful. Just don't expect USGS hiker scale type maps, ok?BTW, This is a review of the UNABRIDGED RECORDED VERSION. I had a relative pick up a copy to listen to while recuperating in bed.John Row"},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Even though this novel is a stand alone book within the Kevin Kerney series of novels, it would probably help to read a few of the others first, only to flesh out some background history on some of the characters.I think that's beneficial only because the murders that plague Santa Fe, NM and Kevin Kerney's department hits close to home. First a seemingly random, yet planned murder of a gay attorney in town has the community and the police baffled. As the story progresses and the body count increases, it soon becomes evident that the murderer is singling out and sending a very private yet cryptic message to Kerney.Kerney then realizes that his pregnant wife, and his estranged son may also be targets, and the clues are vague at best. This is no ordinary killer, this one has spent a lot of time crafting his trade and will have the reader guessing for quite sometime on who's next and where we are going.That's the testament to this novel. You can really empathize with Kerney as he begins to feel helpless for not only himself but those few remaining close to him. The novel does a great job in pacing the action and guesswork, and you'd be surprised how fluid it moves along, all the while the bodies start stacking up.The only issue I had that prevented me from assigning 5 stars was the very last chapter. After the climax, which was a little short after such a wonderful buildup, the last chapter jumped the reader a few weeks forward and everything was back to normal...too quickly and done within only a few brief pages."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"\\"Today he'd argued with a woman he adored, seen the murdered body of a man he liked, and found a horse he loved maliciously destroyed. It was a crummy way to start a vacation.\\" (Page 19)Being a police officer and a target of a smart killer with a score to settle has long been a hallmark of police oriented mystery fiction. However, rarely has it been done so well as in this novel, latest in the series featuring Kevin Kerney.With Lieutenant Colonel Sara Brannon, his wife, home on maternity leave from the Army, Santa Fe Police Chief Kevin' Kerney's thoughts involve the construction of their new home and the pending arrival almost any day of his son. He is supposed to be on an often delayed and much needed vacation. That is until the killings begin.First it is a prominent attorney, Jack Potter who is shot in the chest and left to die on the sidewalk in front of the county court house. Then Kerney finds his beloved horse, Soldier, dead after being shot three times in the stomach. Then the dead rats and the notes threatening Kerney and his family begin to appear. Killing Kerney fast wouldn't bring the pleasure of making him suffer, as he will while the killer circles closer and closer killing innocent victims. As the killer moves closer, targeting his family and the body count climbs, Kerney and his investigative team lag far behind until the final inevitable violent confrontation.As in most novels of this type the reader is quickly introduced to the killer. The action and the viewpoint move constantly back and forth between the killer, Kerney and other characters. As such there is zero suspense as to who the killer is. What is unknown are the reasons why and whether or not he can be stopped in time.Why this novel works and works so well is the fact that as he has done in his other novels the author once again continues to build on the complex characters already established while creating a complicated mystery with multiple storylines. That coupled with his usual strong sense of pacing, action, and the occasional twist creates another page tuner in the best sense of the concept. This simply may be his best book yet in the series, which just keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Everyone dies is an excellent police procedural novel--well-written and compelling, and (for me at least), had the fresh twist of being set in Santa Fe, instead of the usual gritty New York/LA/Boston/Chicago setting that you so very often see. Police Chief Kevin Kerney thinks he is about to take a well-deserved vacation with his very pregnant wife, when a series of murders and other horrors draw him back to the job. Kerney begins to suspect, and rightly so, that he and his loved ones may be the ultimate target, because, as the assailant keeps telling him &quot;everyone dies.&quot; This novel is intricate and well-plotted, a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"Santa Fe Chief of Police Kevin Kerney looks forward to the vacation with his beloved pregnant wife US Army MP LTC Sara Brannon. The couple is at odds over her next assignment at the Pentagon only six weeks after their baby is due.However, their time alone is put on hold when the murdered body of attorney Jack Potter is found on the streets with the crime scene contaminated by a moronic media menace (oxymoron?). Soon others related either by blood or professionally to Kevin are killed with the brazen culprit leaving the message \\"Everyone Dies\\". Kerney and other law enforcement officials in the region put together a massive manhunt seeking to stop a killer who is getting closer and closer to Kevin's epicenter, Sara.Though at times this police procedural feels like Cecil DeMille cast the players, fans will appreciate the energy Michael McGarrity imbues in his hero, support players, and New Mexico that turns a serial killer tale into a personal who-done-it for readers rooting for Kevin. The story line is exciting though the death toll rises rather quickly. The investigation is top rate and the family crisis is fully developed and understandable so that the audience receives a solid episode in a strong series.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Everyone Dies (Kevin Kerney Series)","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author and I was not impressed by his style of writing. With the first murder on page one to the last one in the next to lastchapter, there was not a lot ofsuspense. I could put the book down and pick it up 2 days later to read a couple more chapters.The most exciting part was when the baby was going to be born, if indeed the expectant mother was not killed first.The most touching pary was the sheriff meeting his first born son by an Indian woman. Finding this older son who was in law enforcement too, and establishinga new family seemed to outshine the murder victims left over the country side with a sign Everyone Dies or Youu Are Next on the body or near it.If you are looking forward to exciting descriptions of New Mexico's beautiful colors. look else where.There are other authors of this genre that provide far more exciting adventures."},{"Title":"A Few Interested Residents: Wyoming Historical Marks & Monuments","review":"Wyoming, compared to most other states, is amazingly concerned with its historical past, especially in making it known to the general public. (Just look in Amazon.com at the number of books on Wyoming's historical sites as compared to other states and you'll see what I mean.) This book, probably a unique undertaking, lists not just highway commission historical signs (other states have published books on that), but EVERY sign that points out some piece of information of historical significance in the state, including, for example, all 30+ plaques one sees at Fort Laramie.The signs/sites are arranged by county; each county has a basic map pinpointing each one by number. The numbering system is the same one used by the Wyoming Recreation Commission in 1967 in their inventory listing. The legend that appears on each sign is given completely, and a very specific location for each sign is likewise provided. Dozens of photographs also appear. Also included is a lengthy opening chapter giving the history of historical marking in Wyoming, a very interesting and informative essay.This is a terrific book and belongs on everyone's shelf who is interested in Wyoming's past."},{"Title":"Vanishing Lung Syndrome","review":"Miroslav Holub, Vanishing Lung Syndrome (Oberlin College Press, 1990)I have another new hero in the fight against the utter destruction of poetry that is going on around me, and his name is Miroslav Holub.Vanishing Lung Syndrome is one of those books that grabs hold from the first page and stays with you long after you've put it down.

On that recommendation, I read it and found it to be an extraordinarily original and distinctive time-travel romance.Chloe Plum is a law professor in contemporary New Orldeans whose personal life is in a mess. Her fiance betrayed her. She suffers a miscarriage soon afterwards and finds out she cannot have children. She then begins to suffer from debilitating insomnia during which she distantly hears a baby crying.She reluctantly decides to try hypnotherapy for her insomnia. In doing so, she slips into the life of a past ancestress in Victorian times. What is even more surprising is her ancestress's problems parallel those in Chloe's own life.Olga Bicos does an amazing job with the plot: she keeps two different timelines in dialogue with each other and periodically drops in coincidences to have the two timelines reflect back on each other. The reasons for the time-travel are complex and compelling.This is a wonderful time-travel that is on my Top Ten Romances of All-Time list. This time-travels comes right under Diana Gabaldon's Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber for me. Wrapped in Wishes reminds me of Linda Howard's Son of the Morning in a lot of ways, but this one was first and in many ways better."},{"Title":"WRAPPED IN WISHES","review":"Wow! I just finished this book this morning and ... Wow! This is NOT your typical time travel romance book, even though the dumb title and cover art suggest that it is. I know there is a reason for the title (something in the book), but it doesn't let people know how special this story is. The title should have been something a little more sinister-sounding. The plot is so different, with a lot of suspense and freaky occurrences. It was exciting and scary, because you just didn't know what was going on. There seemed to be no explanation for what was happening. It all came together, with a very satisfying ending. I was glued to this book and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"WRAPPED IN WISHES","review":"After finishing WRAPPED IN WISHES, I am in awe of all the knowledge, clues and messages that are encompassed within this romance.

After a five year relationship with another teacher, she has found out he has been unfaithful while they were in the midst of planning their wedding. To make matters worse, she found herself pregnant but lost the baby. To add another blow to her life, her doctors told her she cannot carry a baby to term. Ever. So she seeks out hypnosis with a therapist known for success.And so begins a story of meeting your true love in another time, 1882 to be exact. Or is he living in the present time? What connections are there between all those close to her 'in the now' and everyone she meets in the past? Who can Chloe trust? And will evil triumph in the end?All of these elements touch base when you read Chloe/Constance and Parker/Harrison's story. There is, of course, a romance. In addition, Ms. Bicos adds some suspense with paranormal touches with an Egyptian theme. At 416 pages it is slightly longer than most romances but you need these extras to understand what is going on. Lastly, the author does a good job of wrapping up all theconcepts that are introduced within this time-travel/reincarnation adventure."},{"Title":"WRAPPED IN WISHES","review":"I rarely read books by authors that I am not familiar with these days. I have so many series that I try to keep up with that I rarely stray. The title of this book is what caught my eye and I was not disappointed at all. It is a wonderful story that spans the ages. The chracters are vivid, and while the latest craze has been these &quot;timeswept&quot; novels this book stands far above many of the rest. Not only does the premise not make you laugh for a long time, it almost makes you wistful. It is a wonderful book by a very powerful author."},{"Title":"Complete Collected Stories","review":"This book was published in 1990 and contained 82 short stories, written between the 1930s and the 1980s.In this collection, I enjoyed light stories from the 1930s, \\"Sense of Humour\\" and \\"Spring Morning,\\" which briefly described the sexual games between young men and women. And a darker piece, \\"Page and Monarch,\\" in which an Englishman from poor circumstances, serving a man of wealth who spoke with a foreign accent, bought a gramophone and then had several workers fired to make up for the cost. Several comic tales from the 1940s, \\"The Voice\\" and \\"Double-Divan.\\" From the 1950s, \\"Things as They Are,\\" in which the author captured precisely the language of two drunk women sitting in a pub rehashing an old love affair.I enjoyed more ambitious stories from the 1960s and 1970s such as \\"The Wheelbarrow,\\" in which a woman returned to the home where she'd grown up, entering the \\"dark mine of the past.\\" \\"Blind Love,\\" about the relationship that developed between a servant and her blind employer, which contained one of the author's fullest descriptions from the point of view of a woman. \\"The Diver,\\" which humorously described the narrator's first sexual experience, in Paris. \\"The Speech,\\" a striking story in which a female leftist activist spoke to a half-empty hall while silently reliving her life and disappointments, differing from many of the other pieces in that it touched on political events in England over the years. And \\"The Lady from Guatemala,\\" which mocked a man of letter's self-absorption when faced with a fanatical admirer.And stories from the 1980s, near the end of his career, \\"A Trip to the Seaside,\\" in which a self-deluded, retired widower looked up a former employee with the hope of marriage and was brutally rebuffed. And \\"The Image Trade,\\" among his last stories and perhaps a very personal one, in which an old narrator watched a photographer couple fuss over him and was astonished after visiting their exhibition later to see the result.For me, these stories were among his best. For the rest, I was unable to appreciate a number of them, finding many to be dated and overlong, with characters, dialogue and humor that were less interesting and whose development and point often escaped me. Despite the occasionally humorous descriptions of relations between the sexes and social classes."},{"Title":"Complete Collected Stories","review":"VS Ptitchett has dared to portray people/society as they actually are.

Tolkien","review":"This is the first book to examine war as a central theme in all of Tolkien's works, and is essential reading for Tolkien scholars. Croft brings together Tolkien's experience of both World Wars and his expertise in ancient heroic literature and shows how they influenced what he wrote. She also details how readers and critics have responded to the role and depictions of war in his writings. Some have disparaged Tolkien as a war-monger and others have praised him as a pacifist. Early Tolkien criticism tended to force The Lord of the Rings into a pattern of allegory for World War II, with the Ruling Ring cast as the atom bomb. More recently commentators have seen Tolkien as one of many authors deeply influenced by their experiences in World War I. This book brings these contradictory strands together to demonstrate Tolkien's \\"well-thought-out, comprehensive, and realistic philosophy of war.\\"The seven chapters lead us through Tolkien's life, showing how he developed the beliefs about of war that are fundamental to all his works.1. Introduction2. The Great War and Tolkien's Memory3. World War I Themes in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings4. World War II: \\"The Young Perish and the Old Linger, Withering\\"5. Military Leaders and Leadership6. \\"The Dull Backwaters of the Art of Killing\\": Training, Tactics, Strategy, and Battlefield Communication7. \\"War Must Be, While We Defend Our Lives\\": Philosophy, Pathology and ConclusionsNow every one of us is in the front line of a new war. Croft shows how Tolkien's complex attitude to war is applicable to our present lives: some wars are just wars; true leaders lead from the front; dogged endurance must replace heroic action; and an attitude of mercy can lead to unexpectedly good results.A number of recent books about Tolkien appear to have been rushed to the marketplace. This one is refreshingly free of typographical errors, and even more important, it has no mistakes about Tolkien's texts."},{"Title":"War and the Works of J.R.R. Tolkien","review":"of Tolkien's use of material from especially the Great War and his adaptation of it in his works. Croft does make one fairly common mistake: she seems to think that \\"casualties\\" means \\"killed.\\" Thus she avers that on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, the British Army lost 58,000 men killed.

The main character, Annie, while seeming to be a simple person, tosses off philosophical musings on work, sex, relationships and religion, which are quite profound. Those of you who are English majors or just literature fans will delight in Jasmine Stone's free-wheeling use of Jane Eyre as the backdrop to the novel. Ms. Stone has a great sense of humor, too; I especially appreciated the use (and misuse) of some of literature's finest quotes.This book is a must read! It has the potential to surpass Anne Rice's pen erotica! It is a well-told tale of love, lust and finding one's way home."},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","review":"I have been an avid reader of the Black Lace series for several years now, and I was so disappointed with this book. I literally had to force myself to continue reading this book. Normally I am completely engrossed in the books, but this one just didn't hold my attention. The love scenes were rather tepid.

Like a lot of books of this genre it has some good parts, but definitely not a &quot;page turner&quot;."},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","review":"Annie seems at first nothing more than a beautiful young girl seeking a little adventure away from her family and conservative sister. She tries her hand at several different jobs and several different boyfriends. Fortunately her stream of consciousness is decidedly not that of a typical romance novel heroine. This weirdness is undoubtedly too much for some of the readers quoted above who expect a more typical heroine and story line.There is some romance and plenty of sex, but these are but the barest bones of the book. Built on top of this foundation like a lacy gothic cathedral are streams of consciousness wherein Annie speculates and fantasizes and quakes with fear and worries and dreams. It is far more fascinating to peer into Annie's mind than underneath her panties. Her flights of fancy are like brilliant literary jazz improvisations.Most people are incapable of being honest with themselves, let alone sharing their secret fears, lusts, hopes, obsessions, despair. This book will give you the privilege of peering into a surprisingly spacious mind, where you can roam freely around. It is full of dark caverns and brightly lit meadows, flowers and deserts, glaciers and volcanic eruptions. Annie is not always consistent, but she never withholds from you; she stands completely naked, not just without clothes, but without the usual inhibition against telling the truth."},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","review":"This weird \\"romance\\" novel is about steamy, okay, raunchy, fun. Annie is in search of herself, starting by defining herself through her sexual needs. As I live in San Francisco myself, I appreciated the tour through all my favorite locales. The drag queens, the prostitutes, the bars - I know these. I liked the literature references as well. Smart and sexy read."},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","review":"KEEP \`EM COMING !Simply put: this is fine, sexy literature. The main character Annie is not your typical erotica heroine in search of a good time with a big dick or two. She's courageous, spiritual, and so exceptionally human that even her fantastic sex scenes seem completely believable. Add some unforgetable second characters, Brad (an ex-prostitute), Tom (Annie's ex-lover), and Angelika (a co-worker and drag queen) to Annie's strange mixture of fantasy and reality and you've got all the makings of a first-rate novel.I've read 10 other Black Lace books and this is definitely the cream of the cream, though I enjoyed the other works as well, especially Emma Holly's. Jasmine Stone's novel was exciting in the way I hoped and needed an erotic novel to be; however, I got to read a great piece of literature in the bargain. More please."},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","review":"When I am not stripping, I enjoy reading books, but this was not one of them. This author is supposed to specialize in lapdancing, table dancing, topless only, or peep shows, to reveal the startling lives of exotic dancers, well, as a dancer, I find this book very exagerated. This is far from the truth and alot of the content in this book is probably from the fantasy world of the author."},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","review":"should be shot in the head.... Out of the norn for Black Lace series of books this is the story of a weak woman sleeping with men that are decidedly loosers.Annie was seraching for herself in this book and compiling a diary of rules to live by. I was always hoping she'd find herself and get it over with, but, to my dismay she finally finds what she was looking for and that was 'nothing'.Sorry the book was disjointed and to say I could never get into it is about the best thing I could say ..."},{"Title":"Stripped to the Bone (Black Lace)","review":"I am an erotica fan - I've read tons of erotica: magazines, literature, compilations, etc, but this is among the worst I've read. The sex scenes are not especially steamy, and there are too few, also - the author's attempt at turning her erotica into a work of literature was lost in the process. The author is obviously a well read woman, but - couldn't naturally make her characters appear to be so (as I believe she had attempted to do). There is more to be critical about - but readers (especially neophytes to erotica) should know that Black Lace publishes many good works of erotica, this volume is not among them."},{"Title":"Internal Medicine (Platinum Vignettes Series: Ultra High Yield Clinical Case Scenarios for USMLE Step 2)","review":"Great series of case-based review - I strongly recommend all the books in this series after using them before my Step 2 exam.

I have read it so many times that I can run through whole pages of dialogue in my head! Reading it is like visiting an old friend. To me, every word is perfectly chosen, every nuance sublime. The novel contains action, adventure, historical detail and romance - what's not to love? Read it (you may have to look for a used copy or try the library) and fall in love."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"The first time I read Trade Wind, I started out not liking it. Three-quarters of the way through I was hooked. The description of the setting captured my imagination. My favourite thing about it is M M Kaye's own reflections on a fading world that the western world still tries to encroach upon. She allows you to see the world for what it can offer and people for who they are. Even today many do not have the insight to look on the flip side of the coin to really understand the people around them. I have now read this book over 30 times in 6 years."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"**Spoiler alert**I almost didn't buy this book because of the couple negative reviews and I'm glad I ignored them. This book was fascinating. If you can't sit through a PG13 movie, it's not for you. If, however, you love to read about all the fallibilities and impossibilities of lives lived in a far off, long ago, and wild place, this is a book you'll want to read. As in all her epic works, M.M. Kaye throws down an absorbing tale. It lacks the heartbreaking sadness and sweetness of The Far Pavillions, but on the other hand, it offers a clear eyed accounting of what life was like on an East African island involved in the slave trade, and subtly weaves a redeeming love story throughout it. There was, for me, a very interesting contrast between the so-called \\"good\\" high society suitor who hides his depravities from his supposed love vs. the more blatant but dastardly \\"man-of-action\\" who can easily follow a nautical compass but sometimes sails disastrously wide of a moral one. True love, however, finally pins him irrevocably in her points. Despite what the hero and heroine get wrong about themselves and about their lives, they do manage, by the end, to get each other right. That, to me, is the beauty of life and love and a good story. I read the controversy over the book's alluded rape scene and, while it's shocking, it's far less shocking to me than the author's accounts of the slave trade on the island, the anachronistic racial attitudes, or the historically based cholera epidemic, which, incidentally, M.M. Kaye's own endnote says she watered down. Good heavens!... I can't help but feel her own own admirable heroine, Hero, would agree. So, enjoy it. Savor it. Keep it. It's bound to have a permanent home on your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I never read one novel twice as I remember most of it and it does not hold any suspence for me. But this one I read in 1994 and ever since that day I have read it as many times as I can. I recommend it to anyone who has a taste for the historical romances."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"TRADE WIND by M.M.Kaye is perhaps one of the best audio novels we have every heard. It is for a very long trip because it encompasses, in the unabridged version, about 25 hours of fascinating listening. The writer spent many years in British Colonies and writes about them, weaving a tantalizing love story with terrific characterization into the history and exquisite descriptions of the time and place. This one is set in Zanzibar during slave trading days in the mid 1800's. It is beautifully written and read. It will hold your attention to the very last word and you'll be sorry it is not even longer! The only problem is that after this listening you will find it difficult to find another audio novel so captivating"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I really didn't expect to like \\"Trade Wind\\" by M.M. Kaye as much as I did. I thought it would be a superficial, fun, beach-read. While it was a fun beach read, it was anything but superficial. The story started out with what seemed to be a transparent plot, but by the end, the building suspense had left the culmination uncertain.In fact, the author skillfully toyed with my emotions. At first I disliked a couple of the characters. Then I became attached to them. The next thing I knew, I disliked them again. Either way, I felt a definite stake in what happened to them.The plot played a significant role in this, but the historic setting was so genuine that one could almost smell the stench of Zanzibar, see the bustling in the crowded streets and hear the crashing of the ocean waves during storms.And finally, the honest and pragmatic way the author presented the business of slavery, and the different manner in which diverse societies dealt with it, added a depth and importance to this book that historic romances don't usually possess.My only reservation was that the descriptions sometimes got long-winded and repetitious. Some readers love that, but I'm a slow reader, so I ended up doing some skimming. However, that does not stop me from heartily recommending \\"Trade Wind\\".Bernardette CostaAuthor, The Six Colorful Annies"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"WOW! What a book. True to its era. Fascinating portrait of a time before the rest of the world was \\"civilized\\". Takes you to a place you would never have an opportunity to visit today. Other reviewers want to quibble with what happens in this book, but you have to adjust your mindset to when it was written and the time it was written about. It's an opportunity to time travel for the price of a book. At it's basest level, you can relate to this book and it's characters. Beautifully descriptive, these characters are real in their time."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I had read The Far Pavilions many years ago and remember loving the book, so I picked up Trade Wind to read recently. I struggled in the beginning because I disliked the main character (and did all the way through the book), but partway through the story branches out and became better. The book is long, seemed slightly overwritten, but I liked the story and learning about Zanzibar in those days--the European and American attitudes, slave trade, the squalor, cloves. The cholera epidemic reminded me of the situation in Haiti now."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"This is yet another novel by M.M. Kaye that kept me up late at nights not wanting to put it down. I found this book at a book sale out at my University and I tell you, It was a great purchase. It is a compelling story about love and hate co-existing. Again, the history and culture of the land of zanzibar and its immigrants holds the reader to the end. I have read this book three times in the year that I purchased it. I laughed, I cried.

MM Kaye is a fascinating writer that will transport you into the past."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend some years ago and found it enjoyable and would like to have a copy,"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"It's hard to know whether this novel is better classified as historical fiction or romance. It attempts both and succeeds at neither.The book is elegantly scripted, but terrifyingly long winded. It takes forever to get where it's going. It's hard to decide if there is any authenticity in the writing, as it is inextricably intertwined with overwrought stereotypes of characters and situations.It is not explicit in any way and fails to convey a sense of depth or meaning to the story. One gets the feeling you're reading the surface of a lovely painting, without seeing any of the reality beneath it.Perhaps that is because reality is as far from the characters in this book as it can possibly be. The two main protagonists embody every negative stereotype of every romantic figure ever written.The male is a ship's captain who ever so gradually falls for the naive yet spirited female heroine. He's a slave trader, the typical \\"dangerous\\" male, who nevertheless has a deeply buried streak of decency. She is the privileged white female, antagonistic to his career and his character, trying in vain to make him change his ways.The book's horrible, fatal flaw lies in the way the relationship between these two is developed. The man, Rory, is depicted as keeping a young slave girl he bought as a child and made into his mistress. She is raped (and later dies) by the fiance of our heroine - rather funnily called Hero. In the climax to their romantic coupling, Rory then kidnaps Hero in retaliation and rapes her. She, of course, ends up enjoying it, and he displays affection and a possessive desire. They later figure out they loved each other all along and..well, you know.Unfortunately, for all its pretty prose, this is the worst kind of romance, one which glosses over inexcusable acts as simply roadblocks to true love. I was struck, for instance, by the scenes after Hero's rape. There is no blood, no trauma, barely a mark apparent, either physical or mental. She treats him with a kind a cool and distant civility. He displays no remorse. They have dinner together and he rapes her again. It is implicit in the writing that she enjoys it.It's one of the most extraordinarily revolting things I've ever read.Do not attempt this book if you are looking for any kind of intelligent writing, whether it be historical fiction, torrid romance or escapist fantasy. It fails miserably on all counts."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"Actually the novel started out very well, with a bossy, determined, but utterly naive, gently-bred American heroine who has set her mind onto rescuing the world. Hero is not a cardboard romance heroine though, her development from an ignorant and ambitious young girl to a thoughtful, responsible woman is credible and moving. Her intentions are always the best, though the outcome is sometimes disastrous. The historical background and exotic flair of Zanzibar does the rest. Why only two stars then? Because the so-called \\"love-story\\" which was plain horrible spoiled it all for me . Rory, Hero's love interest is a slave trader who consorts with fifteen years old slave girls and who rapes women when he wants to have them, willing or not willing, he simply doesn't care. After that he sends them home to face the shame alone. What a \\"hero\\". A more loathsome and disgusting character who is not actually meant to be a scoundrel I have seldom encountered in a novel. Rory makes a good villain, though. However do we like to see a good, feisty heroine fall in love with worthless scum like him? I don't."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I really enjoyed this novel--up until about 2/3 of the way through, the main character is raped by the main love interest. It shocked me. I am sorry, this is something that is compleatly unacceptable. Many allowances can be made for the romantic nature underpinning both of the characters relationship, but it doesn't matter how much romantic feelings there are, rape is rape, and to continue and have the two characters fall in love and live happily ever after is a sad and rediculous thing indeed. Ms Kaye ought to have put her efforts to better use, as the social and political ideas were very good, but unfortunately, the book is worthless."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"M. M. Kaye, the author of two of my favorite historical novels, &quot;The Far Pavilions&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Moon,&quot; does not disappoint with &quot;Trade Wind.&quot; Unlike her other books, which are set in India, this tale is told against the languid, sensuous, often savage beauty of 19th century Zanzibar - a lawless island paradise off the coast of East Africa.Hero Athena Hollis, a lovely Boston bluestocking with a long list of good intentions and a self-appointed mission to abolish slavery, visits her diplomat uncle and his family who are stationed in Zanzibar. In transit, there is a violent storm at sea and the unfortunate Hero is swept overboard only to be rescued by Captain Rory Frost, disreputable scoundrel, privateer, slave trader, etc.. She is eventually returned to the bosom of her family, unscathed, but with a tremendous dislike of the Captain and his chosen profession.This epic romance is chock-full of adventure and excitement - international politics, the slave trade, Arabian sultans and princesses, revolution, pirates, natural disasters, espionage and intrigue. Ms. Kaye's research, as always, is impeccable. Her characters are subtly developed, three dimensional and very believable. The love story is quite unique - outwardly the couple does not seem to be a &quot;match made in heaven.&quot; However, the chemistry does work and the romance provides some unusual twists to the plot. There is a rape scene, as some reviewers have mentioned, but I don't think rape has been romanticized here. There is violence in the novel, as this is a historically accurate piece, about a place that has a violent history. The rape is not gratuitous nor is it graphic. The episode adds rather than detracts from the plot.I was captivated by &quot;Trade Wind&quot; and apart from the spellbinding saga, I learned much about the history of the strange, lovely island called Zanzibar. Highly recommended.JANA"},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"Wow. Please ignore the front and back covers, which will have you convinced that this is an all-sex-all-the-time romance novel, or even one of those interesting and worthy historical romances, a la Bertrice Small.TRADE WIND, as it happens, is more along the lines of an adventure novel, featuring a smart but somewhat naive heroine (named Hero!), drama on the high seas, political plots, good intentions leading to unexpected consequences, an intriguing good guy/bad guy, and plenty of action. And, oh yeah, there's a little bit of romance in there, too. It builds slowly, gradually -- in fact almost imperceptibly -- and it's never graphic. The fact that it happens (finally!) is satisfying, but one leaves with the impression that just a bit more detail would have been nice!Still, I can't fault the book on much; it was perfectly enthralling the whole way through."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I've had this book sitting in my book shelf since 1981 and I've never read it. Why? Well cause everyone keeps saying \\"it's not as good as 'Far Pavilions'\\". They're right of course, but I have not looked at 'Far Pavilions' in a long time. And since I dropped the ridiculously expensive cable package I've been reading more books. Thus I turned my attention to 'Trade Wind' and what an enjoyable read I found. Its style compares more to her mysteries rather than to her famous best-seller. Ms. Kaye gathered up a fascinating history of Zanzibar about slave trading, the Sultan from Oman and his feuding children, an attack by pirates on the American Consulate, and a grisly account of a cholera epidemic in which 20,000 people perished. She includes social commentary on the westernization of the uncivilized world, the duplicity of the French regarding slavery and her trademark scenery descriptions. I'm so glad I finally picked up this book."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I don't think there are very many people who after reading M.M. Kaye's amazing masterpieceThe Far Pavilionsaren't driven on to read her other historical novels. I certainly could not resist the lure of two new fat books written in Kaye's delicious style. But I have to admit to being both confused and intrigued (and a little repulsed) by \\"Trade Wind.\\"\\"Trade Wind\\" is the story of Hero Athena Hollis (named after a horse not a goddess) who received a prophecy from a supposed seventh daughter of a seventh son telling her she would go halfway around the world to do her work and meet the one to help her with it, cause of a power of people to be killed and receive harsh words for it and save more and receive no thanks. Naturally, this stayed with her forever and Hero grew up to be somewhat of an insufferable reformer whose life goal was to go to Zanzibar and stop slave trading.But along the way to the Island (where her cousin in the American consul) Hero is washed overboard only to be rescued by one of Zanzibar's most wanted (by the British, not the actual government of the island) Rory Frost who is suspected of all sorts of no good deeds, none of which have actually been proven. But her short stay with the man challenged Hero's perceptions and her knowledge of the world. And her years on Zanzibar confuse even more what is right and wrong and all the shades of gray in between....There is a lot that happens in this book that is morally weird. It's not a novel where you can agree with what everyone does, where there is any right side or any just person. Everyone makes mistakes, people break laws deliberately and are tricked into doing it, some behave terribly and blame others while others try to do good and are seen as evil for it.There is a certain scene in this book that I won't describe but that is the center of the (biggest) moral controversy and slight repulsion I felt reading it. But I would like to state for the record that as the scene is not so much described as alluded to there can be no real way of knowing exactly what happened and therefore I think that \\"Trade Wind\\" deserves the benefit of the doubt. I myself, reading this scene, did not come to the conclusion that it was really as bad as others say. Otherwise what happened just couldn't have happened in the end. Kaye doesn't strike me as that kind of writer or Hero as that kind of character. (This will all make sense when you read the book I promise!)I also highly recommend while reading this you consider the time and place the book takes place in and its probably historical accuracy and try not to pass too much judgment. Or at least continue onto the endIn the end though this is an adventurous, political, exotic and (somehow and surprisingly) romantic novel. Parts are bound to confuse you about certain characters because non of them are perfect but Kaye carries off the story so well that in the end I was not bothered by things that in any other book would have caused me to throw it at the wall. I was up for two night's strait reading this and can't wait to read Shadow of the Moon, Kayeas well as Kaye's mystery novels.Five stars.A note to potential readers: I feel the need to warn you that the mass market paperback edition of this book has the smallest print I have ever seen. If you have trouble seeing or reading I recommend you read another edition."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I was recommended to M.M.Kaye by my Enlish teacher who, herself, an unmarried woman, thought that the female students in her class should be introduced to the more sophisticated romance genre that was not too modern, and too graphic in its portrayal of a love story. As a result I got acquainted with The Far Parvilions, Shadow of the Moon and Trade Wind. For some reason, Trade Wind, has been in my memory the longest despite that it was not her most acclaimed works (I guess it really depend on one's taste) and finally acquired one copy a decade later. I have, everytime, immensely enjoyed reading about Miss Hero Hollis. I was captivated with the character of the curious, spoilt yet resolute, child of six having her future foretold by an irish wisewoman, growing into a high-minded resolute young woman on a moral crusade to the place of '...sun, wind and saltwater with men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders...'and her fateful meeting with Captain Rory Frost. I have to admit that the pleasure that I get from reading the story arises from the development of her character as she stayed in the foreign land, her trials and tribulations and the belated realization that despite her good but failed intentions, that in life just like in fiction, 'people do things or don't do them because there is something in them that pushes them that way and that they are not always strong enough to fight against', which is aptly said about human nature. And in spite of their differences in values, status and moral conducts, to my opinion, the author did a brilliant job in weaving the relationship of the two main characters in such a way that the romance was plausible, though not always excusable (like the rape for instance),and make the reader understand that like in real life, some things are just harder to account for or justify. The proverbial yet inadequate 'It just happened' holds. In all,Rory Frost is a far cry from a hero that I would want for myself but Miss Hollis is definately one of the best heroines I've ever read despite all her flaws. The characters in the story as well as the description of Zanzibar,both the good and the bad, to me, are very real, the ending is not overly saccharine for my system and I would recommend Trade Wind (as well as other works by this author) for traditional readers who like very good writing, a clever plot and an unforgettable historical romance."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"This is the story of Hero Athena Hollis, an extremely independent woman of the 19th century, vehemently opposed to slavery and all of society's injustices and determined to use her wealth to stamp them out. After Hero's father dies, she is invited to join her family in Zanzibar where her uncle is serving as the American Counsel. Hero's family always expected that she would marry her aunt's son by a first marriage, even though she is not sure she's in love with him.While on voyage to Zanzibar during a huge storm, Hero is washed off the boat deck and presumed dead. However, another ship captained by the infamous slave trader Rory Frost pulls up their rigging out of the sea and finds a half drowned, bruised and battered Hero. Since Hero is such a bruised mess from her ordeal, Rory has no idea what a beauty she is until sometime after she has been returned to her family. To say more of the story than this would be revealing the entire plot, which I don't like to do.M.M. Kaye's knowledge of the Far East shines through, as it does in all her books. She stays as historically accurate as she can, and pulls no punches when describing the customs of the Island, the slave trade, the cholera epidemic and more. And once again, Kaye is able through her books to remind us that the west and east are two different and completely disparate cultures and will never see eye to eye. One other lesson brought to home in this story is when Hero's eyes are opened to the fact that for all her good intentions, going barging in to another culture you know nothing about and trying to change them \\"for the better\\" to the more \\"civilized culture\\" is inherently wrong, and one should look to correct what is one own's back yard first before trying to change the world.This was a wonderful tale and I had a hard time putting it down. Out of print, but readily available at my county library.*******SPOILERS DISCUSSED****I see some of the other reviewers were distressed by the rape scene(s) towards the end of the book. While I do not condone rape under any circumstance, one must remember this was 19th century, in a remote island off the east coast of Africa, during a very turbulent time in that island's history. Kaye set the plot well leading up to the rape and Rory's actions, while not fully justified, did fit in with the story line. There were no graphic descriptions; everything was left to the reader's imagination, with no gratuitous sex at all. Rory showed remorse the next day and while those same reviewers felt that the second night was a rape, I did not get that at all. I was surprised at the vehemence of those reviewers who reacted so strongly and I'm glad I reserved judgment and read the book for myself. It's funny how so many of our soap opera heroes began as rapists after attacking the woman who would eventually become his true love and redeemed by Hollywood to become yet another super couple, yet people found this rape to be highly offensive. I don't get it."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"I added the word \\"novel\\" to the title of this review because the book is so much more than the usual historical romance. It's really a coming of age story set in a time (the Victorian era) and place (Zanzibar) when many young women just accepted the roles assigned them -- and their peers' assessment of outsiders -- without question.Molly Kaye's heroine, Hero Hollis, believes herself to be an enlightened modern woman when she departs Boston for Zanzibar, where she intends to visit her diplomat uncle, marry his handsome son, and help civilize the island. But during the long ocean voyage to the island, her idealistic notions of propriety and morality are totally upended when she encounters Rory Frost, a handsome privateer who plucks her from the sea when she's swept overboard during a storm.Frost restores her to her reluctantly grateful family (Frost is a social outcast and gratitude comes hard even though he hasn't touched her). But as she settles in and begins to learn about her new home and its varied and colorful inhabitants (including a weak Sultan and a contentious royal family, other diplomats and locals, and her own relatives), Hero comes to realize that people aren't always what they seem; that their agendas aren't always clear; and that you may come to regret judgments made on the basis of incomplete information or context.Hero's personal journey occurs over a colorful period in the history of exotic land, including not only political upheaval but natural disasters and a plague. Written on an epic scale (I don't disagree with comparisons to Gone with the Wind or Kaye's own The Far Pavilions), this book stays with you long after you've read and re-read it (as I have, several times). It's one of my all-time favorites."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"M M Kaye's book \\"The Far Pavilions\\" is of course the book that made her famous and it is indeed an excellent book - although very long. Trade Wind is a shorter read and probably an easier read too. Her characters are all drawn warts and all - even the heroine, Hero Athena Hollis, has a very unfortunate tendency to look before she leaps, to believe she knows it all - and it's a refreshing change to have a heroine who isn't perfect. From reading the back of the book I presumed Dan Larrimore, the British Naval Officer, would be the hero, and the evil slave-trader Emory Frost was the baddie. But no, we ended up with two goodies, although one of them (Dan Larrimore) is rather dull.The gradual slide into the love story between Rory (Emory Frost) and Hero is portrayed well. She doesn't immediately fall in love at his feet when she meets him - in fact, she hates him for quite a significant portion of the book. When he first meets her she has been battered by the sea and looks dreadful - it isn't until she is restored to her family and cleaned up that he discovers that she is (surprise surprise!) beautiful.Their hate/love relationship moves nicely along in the book, as does the gradual unveiling of Hero's Fianc&eacute;-to-be-Clayton as a baddie, until a rather strange section of the book which, for me, spoilt it. Clayton kidnaps and rapes Rory's slave mistress (the mother of Rory's daughter) which leads to her death. As a direct punishment, Rory kidnaps Hero.I presumed as this episode played out that Hero would discover at this point that she loves Rory and they would have a nice romantic seduction scene. But no - her rapes her. The next morning he says he won't do it again - and does it again that evening.Of course, by the end of the book she realises she loves him and they get together, he goes on the straight-and-narrow (although we discover at the end that he hadn't been such a baddie after all, and had saved many times more slaves than he'd traded) but, to me, there is always this problem that this man is a rapist. Never mind that we discover Hero quite enjoyed it the second time he did it - it just doesn't sit right with a 21st century mind.Overall I did very much enjoy this book, the evocative writing that helps transport you to the Zanzibar of the mid1800s, helping to instruct me, certainly, on the African slave trade, how it worked, how it was so difficult to stop etc. But that little niggling detail of our handsome hero being a rapist still causes me problems. If only Hero had seduced him, or something, I could have awarded the book five stars. As it is, I can only give it four. But do read it! It's worth it."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"An exotic island, tall ships and storms, and the 19th century slave trade are the background to this unforgettable novel written by MM Kaye who grew up in India and wrote this book while her army officer husband was stationed in Zanzibar.Hero Hollis is very much a progressive 19th century miss - exhibiting a zealousness for good works and a strong puritanical streak nurtured in her native Boston. This all comes undone however when she travels to Zanzibar to meet her fianc&eacute;e and attempts to continue her good works over there.Falling into the hands of Captain Emory Frost blackguard slave trader, libertine and the antithesis of everything she believes in, and becoming enmeshed in the bloody political intrigues and seductive barbarism of the East, Hero finds herself having to re-examine her value system and chose her love."},{"Title":"Trade Wind","review":"Trade Wind is, bar none, my favorite book...period! I first read it when I was 16 years old, and now I'm almost 46. Even after 15+ readings (I've lost count), I still love it. I always hesitate to recommend it to friends, because it's almost like my baby---I don't want people to think it's ugly - lol!!It combines good writing with in-depth factual information about the history and island of Zanzibar of the mid-1800's. The plot is well maintained throughout the book. The romance is secondary, which I like. I felt like Kaye really fleshed out the main characters of Hero and Rory extremely well, and even the secondary characters (like Batty Potter, Dan Larrimore, Salme, Amrah and Sultan Majid) were well done and sympathetic.Without attempting to give away any major spoilers, I will tell potential readers that a part of this book is very controversial. It appears to be a \\"tipping point\\" over whether readers rate Trade Wind highly or lowly. For myself, I think the action is justified within the context of the plotline and the motivation of the lead male character, and personally didn't have a problem with it as it pertains to this story. However, I totally understand that others could find it so."},{"Title":"German Wirehaired Pointers","review":"Only the first 33 pages of this 190 page book are GWP specific.

Dover's edition of Frogs to have a wonderful amount of translation help and historical notes, without being overwhelming (or overly expensive). Since the second half of the play is a gentle parody of Aeschylus and Euripides, it helps to have read those authors (preferrably in the original) to get some of the jokes -- if you're new to Greek Comedy, take a look at K.J.

In fact there is no bibliographic info at all -- just HardPress Publishing. Not even a date. I found this edition by searching on K.J. Dover, so if you've arrived here the same way, be aware that this is NOT the Dover commentary on the Greek."},{"Title":"Frogs (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"I re-read this play recently after being asked to submit a few choices to direct at a local theater, and fell in love with the humor of Aristophanes all over again.His comedies are virtually unparalelled in the surviving classical works. The humor of the plays, particularly the Frogs, is just as fresh and vibrant today as it was thousands of years ago.Dionysus, Greek God of theater, has grown despondant that upon the death of Euripides there are no great poets left on Earth. He resolves to travel to Hades and beg Pluto to allow him to resurrect Euripedes so that he might continue his work.Dionysus, accompanied by his faithful porter Xanthias, travels first to the house of Heracles, dressed as the Greek hero, to ask his advice...as well as directions. Heracles suggests conventional methods (death by ones own hands) before he reveals the path he himself followed.The two then set out to rescue Euripides. Xanthias, being a slave, is given a foot route to follow, while Dionysus enjoys a boat ride courtesy of Charon, the ferryman of the dead. Upon arrival at Pluto's house, and after a case of mistaken/disguised identity ends up in a draw, Dionysus finally meets up with Euripides.However, Aeschylus isn't about to give up without a fight...Pluto has arranged for a contest between the two famed poets to determine the better of them...as Aeschylus decries Euripides as merely a 'flavor of the month' among the people of Hades. A dialogue ensues between he and Euripides, with Dionysus left to judge the merits of each.Full of delightful comic insight into the works of both poets, The Frogs is a completely accessible foray into classical theater that you don't need to be a scholar to understand. While a basis of Euripides and Aeschylus helps to augment enjoyment of the work, it stands apart on its own.An enchanting, intriguing, and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Frogs (Clarendon Paperbacks)","review":"My friend and I were doing a project for school on the internet and we stumbled across the whole text of this play (we were reasearching ancient Greece). We decided to bookmark it, and then during lunches we read through it until we finished it. It's very amusisng, I highly recommend it!

But her mom doesn't ever want to talk about the subject because the reason they got divorced was that Sam's twin sister Sarah drowned in a boating accident with her father. Her mother never forgave her husband and cut off any relations with him. But Sam is so desperate that she and her best friend, Angela, resort to paying a psychic to see if she can figure out where her father is. The answer that the fortune teller gives comes as quite a shock. She can't see where her father is, but she does tell Sam her sister is still alive! Sam must now use her own ingenuity to figure out where her dad is and whether Sarah is still alive!Butler does a real good job of creating an atmosphere of suspense in Monkey Man and I found myself not wanting to put the book down until the whole mystery was revealed. The characterization was decent, especially with Sam, a girl that doesn't want to give up hope about Sarah because she functions with her heart which tells her that her sister is still alive somewhere. You also care about Butler's characters and you hope that things will work out in the hopelessly messed up situation they find themselves in. The ending is a little hokey and far fetched but makes sense in the context of the work. This is a good read for young adults and older readers too."},{"Title":"Do You Know The Monkey Man?","review":"The Book Do You the Monkey Man was the best book I have ever read.

Meir Shalev provides us an angle on their experience that makes it difficult to reduce their exploits to those of secular saints and impossible not to love them for their deeply human foibles.In Blue Mountain, Shalev has given us a great read, portraying the intersecting loves and hates of his semi-fictional village with an unflinching eye and a deeply sympathetic voice. Halkin's English translation comes off the page as anything but a translation, and so places this moving novel into the hands of a public many times broader than the original.The narrator poses as the grandson of one of the original pioneers, bequeathed by his parents' early death into the legacy and kindness of two such oldsters. One is his grandfather, the other the village's hilariously didactic schoolteacher. Growing up as they grow old, 'Baruch's' narrative voice conveys to us his guardians' memory of the Second Aliyah even as we look in on that scene with considerably less innocence about the consequences of Jewish immigration to Palestine than his fictional villagers could have imagined.With reason, Shalev's style is compared to Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez' 'magical realism', though the flights of fancy in Blue Mountain are fewer than those in Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez' One Hundred Years of Solitude. They also owe more to the no-nonsense raw edges of the pioneers' gritty socialist experiment than to the porousness of metaphysical boundaries. Transplanted to their unpromising environs by events as much as by choices, these Jews from Russia and the East had little time for the cultural adjustments and incremental synchronization that easier times allow. They drained the swamps and hauled orchards out of dry land by means of certainties that, if they seem quaintly humorous in hindsight, get no apology from those who felt compelled by the tenuousness of survival to exercise them.That is not to say they lacked affection for the Arab inhabitants of the land they cultivated, for these appear from time to time on the margins of village life as respectable passers-by. Rather, they simply had no time, nor could pausing to reflect upon the pogrom-punctuated Russia they had left behind accomplish much but distract them from the new thing to which they had put their hands.Time, such as it was, existed in order to invent a better way to milk the cows, apply folk genetics to the citrus, and cultivate the large loyalties and enmities that flourish in small towns. Shalev narrates those times.He speaks through Baruch, who should have been a farmer but instead earned millions by turning the family farm into a cemetery for the Second Aliyah's finite number of dead, those who arrived pale from New York and were buried for thousands, as well as those buried fresh and for free from the village's old folks home.Shalev is a widely-read Israeli author of essays, novels, and children's books. To some, he is best-known for his compelling newspaper columns that, not surprisingly, argue that grace and sanity like those with which Baruch narrates the history of the Blue Mountain, ought to be cultivated in the hot zone of the Palestinian-Arab conflict. (See 'In the end, it is the violin that wins', [...])'Uncle Baruch' finishes his tale only when a new generation, sprung from the union of Uri, the village's randiest returned exile, and Nehama, the daughter of the alarmable village cantor, returns to grow up on the land that their forebears had turned to green and to call him 'Uncle'. Perhaps Shalev would tell us that it is by such affectionately-termed traditioners that the story passes from one generation to its successor, so that it remains tell-able and well-told to those who will never drain swamps or walk with as much certainty as the Second Aliyah's 'Movement' found it necessary to do. Or perhaps he simply enjoyed telling the tale."},{"Title":"The Blue Mountain: A Novel","review":"Told with tenderness, humor, and just the right touch of fantasy, Shalev has fashioned a wonderful novel. The characters are vivid and imaginative. The descriptions of nature are enchanting.

Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Blue Mountain: A Novel","review":"Blue Mountain is wonderful! A bit tough going at the beginning, but by mid-way you'll be glad you made the effort. Meir Shalev may turn out to be the best Israeli writer of his generation.

A most enthusiastic &quot;10!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Blue Mountain: A Novel","review":"It helps to have some background knowledge of the history of the settlement of Jews in Israel in modern times to understand the nuances of The Blue Mountain. Much of the book is a critique of the pioneering ethos that settled the country.The novel is set in a cooperative farming village in the Jezreel Valley, and there is no aspect of the pioneering venture that does not escape Shalev's scorn. For example, the motif of the swamps that were drained to create farmland in the Valley surfaces again and again. Toward the end of the novel, newspapers claim that there were never any real swamps in the Jezreel Valley; so one of Shalev's old pioneers recreates one and even hires \\"farmhands\\" from a nearby city to dress as old pioneers and drain it. Examples like this abound in The Blue Mountain.Shalev is fond of discarding linear narrative in his novels. They loop around, going back over events and adding and changing our knowledge of events. It is less effective in this novel than in A Boy and a Pigeon, and Esau. Here Shalev gets bogged down in the process, and it hurts the flow of the novel.That said, this novel is superb reading. Even in translation Shalev's deep knowledge and love of nature comes shining through.

It's like a combination of \\"Little Woman\\", \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" and \\"Exodus\\" that was written by some of the guys from \\"Mad Magazine\\". It is truly a work of art and the trans-lation by Hillel Halkin is spot on. This is not just about Kibutzim but also about those pioneers from Russia who hoped to build a 'new society' in Israel.Like many of my ancestors who came to America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the people in Shalev's village had brought a piece of the Shtetl with them. People wanted to lead their lives based on the rhythm of the seasons and to live by the 'sweat of their brow' and to eat only what they grew. But they also had the notion to build a utopian society based on 'everyone according to their needs'. All would work for the 'common good' but like in the Soviet Union, 'some got more goods than others no matter how common they were'.The Kibutzniks found out that human nature abhors equality. No matter what the society, people look out for their own (nepotism) and try to destroy those who they consider a danger to themselves (stalinism). Not everyone who wants to work hard, likes to see their labor wasted by a 'dreamer' who sits around all day 'thinking great thoughts'. The loss of many of the second and third generation to the cities, shows that you can't remake people into something they don't want to be.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"The Blue Mountain: A Novel","review":"I read this in Hebrew and loved it.

Full of twists and surprises, this is a book you will think about long after its finished."},{"Title":"Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States","review":"This recent paperback edition of Century of Struggle, Eleanor Flexner's classic history of women's suffrage and the work to expand women's rights, has a splendid new introduction by her friend and collaborator Ellen Fitzpatrick, who relates the major events in Flexner's own life to Flexner's deep understanding of the complex social and political problem confronting 19th- and early 20th-century American suffragists. There is no better account than Flexner's of the dogged determination of US women to achieve their political aims, or of the genius of their political inventiveness in a time in which both law and custom were against women's full participation in civic life. The achievement of the vote for women was extraordinarily difficult, infinitely more so than most people realize. In her own preface to Century of Struggle, Eleanor Flexner quotes from Carrie Chapman Catt and Nettie Rogers Schuler: \\"Hundreds of women gave the accumulated possibilities of an entire lifetime, thousands gave years of their lives, hundreds of thousands gave constant interest and such aid as they could. It was a continuous, seemingly endless chain of activity. Young suffragists who helped forge the last links in that chain were not born when it began. Old suffragists who forged the first links were dead when it ended . . . It is doubtful if any man, even among suffrage men, ever realized what the suffrage struggle came to mean to women before the end was allowed in America.\\""},{"Title":"Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States","review":"I agree fully with Jane Eliosoff's review and just wish to add that this wonderful book should be required reading in high schools and colleges. One of its best features is that it is truly multicultural in its treatment of the &quot;first wave&quot; of the women's rights movement, even though this book was written before the word &quot;multicultural&quot; was coined."},{"Title":"Century of Struggle: The Woman's Rights Movement in the United States","review":"This new edition of Flexner's Century of Struggle is excellent. She covers American woman's history since the beginning of American colonization up until the 1970s. She touches on the development of woman's education, job occupation, and political awareness through their activities in abolition. I recommend this book to every American. This book covers many missing holes in our male dominated histories."},{"Title":"HeartPaths for Hard Times","review":"I was given HEART PATHS FOR HARD TIMES during a time of deep grieving and exhaustion, when I was too numb to reach out for what I needed to heal. The subtitle of the book is &quot;Bridges for Coping with Loss and Change,&quot; and I found those bridges in this gem of a book. No kidding--it's the kind of book you'll want in your library for those hard times that come into all our lives...and the kind of book your friends and family would welcome in their hard times. I've given it to several people I care about, no matter what their &quot;hard time.&quot; The collecton of stories reminded me I truly wasn't the only one who'd struggled with these issues. Most helpful, though, were the reminders to reframe my thinking--seeing this time as an opportunity. The stress rating scale was very helpful. The reminder to INVOLVE my body in working in the garden, or massage, got me out of living in my mind. The reminder to find my way back to gratitude was especially significant. And the listing of support systems that helped others reminded me that I had some, too. The book was like a wise, good friend there with comfort but no demands--something I welcomed in my deep fatigue. You could skip around and read a bit at a time or work your way from the stories in the front to the suggested activities in the second part. Ms. Searcy has given us a gift out of her own grieving and losses. My guess is that the wounded healer is the most effective one--she surely is. I can't say enough good things about HEART PATHS."},{"Title":"HeartPaths for Hard Times","review":"This book was given to me by a friend at a time that I needed it. The testimonies are inspiring!"},{"Title":"Cherokee Marriage Dare (Dynasties: The Connellys)","review":"What back cover says:\\"I dare you to fall in love with me.\\"The press labeled coed Maggie Connelly young, reckless, impulsive. Actually, she was a woman in love. With Lucas Starwind. But the hardened Cherokee P.I. hid his battered heart behind a macho bravado. Maggie horned in on his case-and his life-and boldly promised: I'll heal your heart, then you have to marry me.Luke didn't believe in love, but he knew desire. Maggie Connelly-almost half his age-dared him to feel, to want, to hope. But Luke had to resist her, for if he took her in his arms, he feared he'd never let her go...I loved this book. It had me laughing and made me wish I could be as bold as Maggie is. This is the first book I've read about the Connelly Dynasty, but I learned alot about the other characters through reading this book, the twelfth in the series. Plus, if you are a Sheri Whitefeather lover, this book has her special blend of humor, love and one great plot!!!"},{"Title":"Cherokee Marriage Dare (Dynasties: The Connellys)","review":"I've recently discovered Sheri Whitefeater's work and so far I've not been disappointed. Young Maggie Connelly has a reputation as an international partier and has trouble being taken seriously, even by her own family. Maggie's grandfather, the king of Altaria was assassinated along with Maggie's uncle. Now Maggie's brother is getting ready to take over the throne of the small Mediterranean island country. At the wedding of one of her brothers, Maggie shares a dance with sexy PI Lucas Starwind. Maggie falls in love with Lucas. As a child, Lucas' world was shattered when his little sister was kidnapped and killed. He has always blamed himself for not keeping her safe. Although Lucas is attracted to Maggie, his broken soul will not allow him to share his heart with her.Maggie is determined to help solve the case of who killed her grandfather and uncle and stole deadly information from Altaria and to prove that she is more than just a party girl so she blackmails Lucas into letting her work with him on the case. She is also determined to heal Lucas' soul so they can have a life together. Lucas fights very hard to keep his distance from Maggie but quickly learns that she is much more than the surface image everyone sees. He finds it harder and harder to resist her charms.Sheri Whitefeather had done a good job of entwining Lucas and Maggie's romance with the mystery of what's happening in Altaria but it's her characters that really set her book apart. Being the 12th book in the Connelly series, this book does not dwell as much on developing the Connelly clan but on the people in Lucas' life. Lucas' mother is a very sympathetic character who is still struggling to deal with her daughter's murder all those years ago. I especially liked the bodyguard that Lucas got for Maggie. He's one of the most entertaining characters in the book."},{"Title":"Cherokee Marriage Dare (Dynasties: The Connellys)","review":"Could not wait to get this book. Upon receiving it, had to force myself, by thinking \\"No other books until this one is finished\\". I still could not get to the end and it is a short book compaired to most I usually read."},{"Title":"Cherokee Marriage Dare (Dynasties: The Connellys)","review":"Pampered princess insists that PI hero include her in his investigation of his partner & her grandfather's death, given that she has 1 of the CDs he's been looking for. In the meantime, she's going do her best to win his love & marry him. But he thinks their 17-yr age difference may be a big problem & his fear of losing his loved ones keeps him from taking a chance on love.I found this book boring overall. Whitefeather's writing is fine. I just didn't care for spoiled heroines. And a spoiled heroine chasing after the hero makes it doubly worse. I liked the hero. His issues with love was understandable, given his tragic family history. Sexual chemisty & love scenes were ok. The action part of the book wasn't very interesting either.Only partially recommended."},{"Title":"Achieving Competitive Excellence","review":"I have read numerous books on achieving competitive excellence in sports and even ones that claim to give the secrets to achieving that elusive \\"zone\\" state but they all pale in comparison to \\"Achieving Competitive Excellence\\". This book gives concrete ways to boost an athlete's performance. Where other books focus on cognitive behavioral approaches, this book gets right to the core issues and addresses the emotional components that hold athletes back and it is written without technical jargon. This is a must read for parents, coaches and athletes."},{"Title":"The The Beloved: St. Mungo, Founder of Glasgow","review":"This wonderful book is about St. Kentigern, also known as Mungo, which means \\"the beloved\\". While recounting Mungo's life from conception to death and all episodes therein, the author tells a flowing, entertaining tale. His warm insights reveal a deep, mature Christian perspective, while giving an intelligent, well-researched take on events during Mungo's lifetime. Photos are included from such places Mungo is associated with in Wales, Cumbria, and Scotland. A few sketches and very good maps add detail, while fascinating relationships between individuals, even minor personalities rarely seen in histories of the age, are painted vividly. A very moving book that I was able to read in one day."},{"Title":"Health Decision Support Systems","review":"This book is well written and easy to read but is much too basic. The book covers a variety of topics, but none of them in enough detail to be of assistance as a textbook in any but the most rudimentary of courses. For example, many of the major topics in healthcare decision support are discussed in less than one page."},{"Title":"Health Decision Support Systems","review":"The chapter entitled Graphics-Based HDSSs uses only verbal descriptions of graph types. It is ironic that a chapter that discusses the value of different types of graphs to facilitate cognition in different types of tasks imposes the extraordinary burden of making the reader visualize those paradigms unaided and making the reader hope that he correctly understands them."},{"Title":"Audrey Hepburn: A Woman, the Style","review":". . a beautiful and touching tribute to Audrey Hepburn, this rare photo book was published for the 1999 exhibition at the Ferragamo Museum in Florence, Italy. This impressive book of 230 pages is packed with color &amp; b/w photos of Hepburn - many of which have never been published before. The text is in both English &amp; Italian and includes tributes from her son Sean Ferrer, her companion Robert Wolders, and her designer Givenchy. The book traces her career and includes a complete filmography. Thirty pages are devoted to the Ferragamo exhibit of clothing worn by Hepburn; sections include stage costumes &amp; accessories, coats &amp; daytime wear, cocktail &amp; dinner dresses, evening dresses, full dresses (including the dresses designed and worn for her 2 weddings). Full color reproductions of magazine covers &amp; movie posters are included. This publication which is produced on premium paper stock."},{"Title":"Audrey Hepburn: A Woman, the Style","review":"One of the rarest and most difficult to find of books on Audrey Hepburn also happens to be one of the very best. Published in a limited run for a series of exhibits for Salvatorre Ferragamo, beginning in Italy and reaching as far as Australia, this book is worth every bit of effort you can muster to locate it. The book offers over 200 pages of dazzling, mostly never before seen photographs. They range from studio shots to film stills to candid shots. The publication aims to present Miss Hepburn's beauty physically, but also succeeds in showing her true, inner beauty with a very intelligent, well put-together text. Aside from the usual biography and filmography are various writings by the people who knew her best. The preface by her son Sean Ferrer sets up the book quite nicely. I could get very technical with descriptions and offer a more serious critique, but I feel that it is not necessary with this book. The book is very inspired and wonderfully edited by Stefania Ricci, but its strength lies in the beautiful pictures of one of the most beautiful women in history. It's all about the pictures with this one. If you are an Audrey Hepburn fan, this is an ESSENTIAL addition to your collection. FIND IT IF YOU CAN."},{"Title":"Audrey Hepburn: A Woman, the Style","review":"I bought this exhibit catalogue, because it received such good reviews here. I don't regret buying the book, but I don't think the reviews fully do the book justice. If you are an Audrey fan considering whether or not to add this your collection, I highly recommend it, but do be wary: it does some flaws.The Good vs. the Bad.I have very little bad to say about the book. This catalogue accompanied a Ferragamo exhibition of Audrey's style (clothing, shoes, handbags, and hats) as well as rare and famous photographs from her career and personal life. Ferragamo, a longtime friend, and Audrey's sons put together the exhibit. What makes this exhibition unique is that reproduction shoe molds were made, and then select artists from around the world were hired to \\"paint\\" them representing one of her movies. The shoe molds--now objets de art--were then photographed in settings inspired the movies. The photographs were then sold to raise money for Audrey's favorite charities. The painted shoe molds and photographs are included in the book.As you can imagine, since the exhibition was sponsored by family, it is not unbiased. It largely praises Audrey's film personal and personal life. And, yet, for all that, it is not uncritical of her. It points out she lived a quiet life, but it wasn't always a fairy tale. That despite the lack of scandal surrounding her life, she still struggled to find happiness, hope and well-being. So the reader will not feel insulted: Audrey is treated like a normal human being, rather than as a star who should be celebrated. (It is a refreshing contrast to Pamela Clarke Keogh's \\"Audrey Style\\" where every other sentence is \\"Audrey is sooooo perfect, the rest of the universe just failes.\\")The pictures included are amazingly diverse ranging from early career to her last years as a UNICEF ambassador. They are also expertly arranged, as if to tell a story. For example, on a page where Audrey is shown dancing, the pictures are zig-zagged in such a manner that they reflect her moving. (You don't feel as you are looking at a 'still.')The exhibition was divided into parts, and so is the catalogue: Each chapter is introduced by one of Audrey's friends (Bob Willoughby, Valentina Cortese, Billy Wilder, Hubert de Givenchy, and Robert Wolders). The chapters then look at aspects of Audrey's life: dancing, style, simplicity & harmony, and children of the world. The epilogue of the book is pictures of the clothing featured at the museum during the exhibition.Also, the book is bilingual. Each chapter is written in Italian with an English translation. (Don't skip the Italian section, English readers, it has lots of Audrey pics!)I hate to critique this book since it was put together with an obvious artistic eye and special care was taken in what was written and what was featured, but if you are an Audrey fan, you need to know this:There are lots of pictures. They are all wonderful to look at BUT many of them are thumb-nail size. At the start of chapters, they are often shoved into the \\"border\\" near the binding) of the book. (The end of chapters is where pictures are given the artistic arrangement.) It's particularly disheartening that many of the exhibition clothes, shoes, hats and handbags are given this same treatment. I got this because I wanted to see the details--but obviously that can't be done.Books about Audrey's style are too rare, and so this is worth the investment. But I'm sure a better one will come along. This one is also worth buying because it's a rare insight into what Audrey's friends and family think about her legacy: her style, her filmmaking, her charitable work--and how it continues to impact the world today. (One of her sons has written a book as well.)"},{"Title":"Leo, My Big Brother: The Biography of an Achiever","review":"In a secluded and little troubled corner of a vast website in the infinity of the internet, I wish my Great Uncle Norman Kisamore, farewell.

He flew off to war and never came home. He had the same dreams and aspirations as all American young men of that era as he bravely went off to fight for his country. He left a young war bride behind as well as a loving family. His life as a youngster, growing up in rural Western Maryland, brings back memories to those of us who lived there and shared those memories. We relive those happy times through the eyes of Dr. Kisamore (the &quot;litttle brother&quot;), and we remember with loving pride and gratitude those young heroes who eventually gave us back a peaceful world."},{"Title":"Leo, My Big Brother: The Biography of an Achiever","review":"I also grew up in Cumberland at the time this story starts to unfold. I did not know any of the folks in this naritive. However, a similar story was developing within my own family. I had a cousin who flew in B-17s over Germany. The many of the things that happened to Leo happened to my cousin. Reading this book took my back to the late 30's and early 40's and I could relive my cousin's life through Leo's letters. As a kid, like Norman, I looked up to my cousin and the glorious lives they lived. They seemed glorious until they went on those awful bombing runs. The fact that so many of our boys, like Leo, never returned was the dreadful part of being in a war. Fortunately my cousin returned and the stories he told of what it was like made me feel so bad for Leo and his family. I highly recomend this book for the people who lived through WWII and especially those who were born after this era, so they can better understand what it was like living through these times."},{"Title":"Leo, My Big Brother: The Biography of an Achiever","review":"Leo did all the things a growing up kid did in a small town in the 30's and 40's.

His family was so very important to him; he was always thinking of them and they of him. When his B-17 Flying Fortress was blasted out of the sky over Germany in 1943, he was never found and his family never got to say goodbye, but he was never forgotten.

Maybe not, I'll go on...This series had already disappointed me, but I had to read the book with the silly title. The author clearly doesn't understand horses, as when you get farther into this book, you get more confused. Rima wants her pony back, and who wouldn't? The girl LuLu (another thing to laugh at) took a pony that she thought she could keep, without asking if it was anyone's. Then LuLu *lol* spies on Rima (she's pretty insecure to be spying) and sees that the pony is too small for Rima. If Rima has outgrown her already, wouldn't the girl outgrow her quickly as well? That doesn't seem to make sense, and then in the fact that the pony pals think their knowledge is so strong because they know the differece between a horse and a pony. Newsflash! My sister, who's younger and has never been really close to either a horse or a pony, knows the difference.The only people who can enjoy this book as it is are three-year-olds.

I wanna take it to my grave. and on heaven in case I meet the author I'd like to say to him that you did a wonderful job."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"No one will ever write a better book than this one.No one can!I had to read this book in high school and couldn't go past page 80.It seemed to me like the worst and most boring book in the whole world.I didn't understand why I should be interested in a 19th cenetury murderer in ST.Peterburg.A few years ago I decided it was time to read it,if only to see why it is considered such a great literary asset.This time around I understood it!I never thought a writer can be such a great genius or that anyone can create such a perfect creation.I understood that he wasn't speaking only about Russia or about a Russian murderer.He speaks of &quot;man&quot; and humanity.That's why this book is eternal and universal.Some scenes in the book equal the paintings of Rembrandt.I also discovered he can be funny or rather satirical.Dostoevsky is very different in his style of writing than other Russian writers and especialy Tolstoy.He has a kind of corse writing.One feels that he grips life by the b...s.He understands the heart and soul of &quot;man&quot;.I would recommend people to read it after the age of 20,or at least read it again at that age.I liked very much what a reviewer said-&quot;I'm so happy I can read&quot;,it was the first time I too, felt so grateful for being able to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"After reading the other reviews for this book, I felt compelled to put in my two cents - simply because it's a grave misconception, and an entire disservice to the aspirations of the book (if I may be so conceited, bear with me) to state that Raskolnikov is \\"depraved\\", \\"sinful\\", immoral or other such mindlessly aired, banal labels. The whole POINT of this book is enlightenment, specifically enlightenment into the mind of a man moved by his own psychological battle and societal pressure into murdering a perfectly useless old hag. Sorry, but we all know she is - even though that's hardly relevant here; even if she had been angelic, the point is, though Raskolnikov may *seem* animalistic during the murder, etc., he is in fact human - driven by the same motives that drive all humans - a mixture of concern for his family and personal pride - the desire to be great, \\"like Napoleon\\", and to be able to side step and outwit the laws of society and provide for his family, saving his sister from a devastatingly bad marriage of convenience. In some ways Raskolnikov is actually much BETTER than most people - genuinely and passionately concerned for his family with such intensity and altruism that he puts himself through the hell of crime just to spare them misery; in other ways he is insecure - and insecurity about his mental abilities lead him to do devastating things, even resort to murder and mind-games with the police to alleviate his fear of being forever inconsequential. But who among us can say that on a lower level, to a lesser degree, they never felt the same fears, concerns, motives - that in the dark recesses of their minds, when push comes to shove, they would not consider what Raskolnikov does? Any reader who leaves the book thinking it's about a psychotic man who earns redemption, is, forgive me, completely blind to the greater power of the book: the ability it gives us to relate to our fellow man, right down to the criminal within all of us. This book is therefore not ONLY a masterpiece because it is superbly well written, witty, descriptive in a pleasant, non-tedious, eye-opening, humorous way - but also because after reading it you really feel closer to all of humanity, and to the socially restricted basal desires that every honest human can admit to having had. Especially if you substitute the nature of the crime for some lesser crime we all might face, and making exception to its gravity, the psychological struggle is really wonderfully exposed, and it will stick with you forever. A must read, irrespective what the closed-minded say."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I started to read Crime and Punishment for a number of reasons. Firstly, its one of those books that you know is going to come up in some high brow conversation sooner or later. Secondly, you look smart carrying around a 600 page book. Finally, I love Russian literature as a whole (Gogol, Turgenev, Nabokov, not so much Tolstoy...). Mostly, though, I read this to appease my vanity.I was stunned. This book so far surpassed my expectations, it was numbing.To begin with, it has an excellent and original plot. Called the world's greatest detective story, C&P; discloses the murderer (Raskolnikov) on page 10. The rest of the book gives us an incredible look at his motivation; psychological breakdown; acceptance of religion, responsibility, guilt; as well as his interesting philosophical views.Raskolnikov is driven by a Nietzsche-esque philosophy of self-over-society-and-conventional-morality, which leads him to brutally murder an elderly pawnbroker. The act is justified by a \\"greater good\\" rationality (as 1. she is an abusive unloving woman who cheats her clients, and 2. he plans to use her money for good in society). This one intense moment confronts the reader with many difficult questions. Do his ends justify his means? Do any ends justify means so brutal? Can a man ever \\"step over\\" morality? And is the murder rational? If so, is rationality always the highest arbiter of human action?The murder has clear relevence as a political issue as well; Raskolnikov's act parallels the violent revolutionary movements of Dostoevsky's time in many significant ways: Raskolnikov's radical views; his employment of violence against oppressors; (and, when necessary, against innocent bystanders); his intended altruism; etc.All this in the first few pages! The majority of the book that follows is the fall-out from the murder and the resolution of these (and many other) issues inside of Raskolnikov. Its brilliantly done - the intense psychlogical perspectives particularly... keep in mind that Dostoevsky practically invented the internal monologue and stream of consciousness that are now common-place in literature. Equally powerful are Raskolnikov's dreams/hallucinations which are particularly rich in symbolism.Raskolnikov's struggle and ultimate acceptance of responsibility and repentence make an unbelievably strong case for Christian values (which resonated quite strongly even with an agnostic like myself).All in all, READ THIS BOOK. Not just because you'll look and sound smarter (which you will be), but because it is truly unique and amazing story of great moral/philosophical depth."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Review of Crime and Punishment By a Colorado readerA pale - faced man stares at a door that marks his destiny. Beads of sweat run down his sunken face. His fate sealed, he nervously looks at the old woman before him, his eyes darting across the room, barley able to hold the cruel stare of the elderly pawnbroker. Heart pounding, he resists the urge to cry out in terror, and run from the shrewd old woman, but his mind is set. He cannot return, he has gone too far to stop now, and must carry out his desperation induced crime. Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment revolves around a poor man struggling to survive in St. Petersburg, Russia. Raskolnikov, the main character, is stricken with both poverty and sickness. It's these determining factors that drive him into murdering a wealthy pawnbroker. Dostoevsky does a masterful job in describing the intense mental anguish that the protagonist goes through both before and after committing the act. He uses symbolism throughout the novel to help further this description of Raskolnikov's suffering, such as the intense fever he suffers that begins just prior the murder, peaks during the act, and continues for days afterwards. This fever also plays a major role in how those characters around him react to him after the crime. Nearly everyone around him is sympathetic towards him, and try to help, but Raskolnikov view himself as being superior to these others, and so rejects any form of charity offered to him. This is another one of Dostoevsky's commentaries on life. He believes that criminals who aren't used to committing crimes act in generally the same manner as Raskolnikov does. They slowly but surely isolate themselves socially, simply because of the fact that all they can think about is the crime itself. This is true of the main character, but in later chapters he tries to correct this after meeting a prostitute that he views to be a victim of situation, much as he seems to view himself. Now of course, this is not a terribly easy book to read, as most of the names are in Russian, and are at times hard to keep track of. Another aspect of the novel, is that at times, it can get rather dry and slow, but with patience it inevitably gets better, and is masterfully written to delve deep into the psychological aspects of punishment that are not as readily visible."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Listen carefully: when you read a work translated, the translator makes a big difference. Constance Garnett is a fine translator, but she tends to literally translate (not literal as in a machine translation, but rather, so no word is lost). This tends to make the book wordy and grates on many people's nerves (not just mine--read the other reviews here)CAVEAT EMPTOR. You have been warned. A better, more modern translator might be: Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky.And as they say in Russian: &quot;If you don't believe it, take it as a fairy tale&quot; (translated)."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Welcome to the glittering world of dyschronic post-modernist criticism, which has enabled me to recognize that 'Crime and Punishment', published in 1866, was written as a prescient refutation of the Objectivist philosophy expressed in Ayn Rand's novels 'The Fountainhead' and 'Atlas Shrugged'. Without the wonders of dyschronicity, we'd have to mention that 'Atlas Shrugged' wasn't published until 1957 and Ayn Rand wasn't born until 1905. However, surely the fact that Dostoyevsky and Rand died almost exactly 100 years apart will be recognized as a signifier.The most cogent advocate of Randian Objectivism in 'C&P;' is the scurvy Pyotr Petrovich Luzhin, the suitor for Dunya's hand, who speaks for himself in his first face-to-face encounter with Raskolnikov: \\"Love yourself before all others,\\" he says, \\" for everything in the world is founded on self-interest. If you love only yourself, you will conduct your enterprises in a proper manner...\\" and by implication, good things will trickle down to the rest of us. As the most single-minded Objectivist, please note, Luzhin is the only character in the novel who is unambiguously a swine. Even the erratic, half-crazy Svidrigailov falls short of perfect obedience to Randian morality, compromising the order of things by last-minute acts of charity.The scene in the tavern, early in the novel, when Raskolnikov overhears other young 'intellectuals' discussing the logic of justifying a 'crime' by weighing it against the heroic benefits that may result from its success - to whit, the murder of the old-lady usurer in order to gain the capital to achieve a great destiny, the very crime Raskolnikov has been meditating - is not only a parallel to scenes in Rand's work, but it is, I swear, exactly word-for-word a transcript of a discussion I heard in a Harvard dining hall in 1963 between David Friedman (the anarcho-capitalist son of Milton Friedman) and some friends, and that conversation, believe it or not, was repeated verbatim at a drinking session in the Bohemian Grove in 1982, the speakers being Dick Cheney and acquaintances. Remarkable, I'd say! The convergence of libertarianism and neo-liberalism (aka neo-conservatism) is to be found in Ayn Rand.Hostile as Raskolnikov is the the scurrilous Luzhin, his own ethical premises, as expressed in the article he had written months before the action of the novel, are also pure Objectivism. \\"...an extraordinary person has a right... not an official right of course, but a private one, to allow his conscience to step across certain obstacles, and then only if the execution of his idea, which may be the salvation of all mankind, requires it.\\" For the benefit of anyone who hasn't actually read 'Crime and Punishment', the entire 700 page novel is constructed to teach Raskolnikov the error of his assumptions, so that by the time he reaches Siberia he can accept the humble Sonya's notions of suffering and redemption. Yes, readers, I warn you that Dostoyevsky's answer to Objectivism, and to proto-communism for that matter, is... oh, you'd best read it for yourself.One thing I didn't notice, the first time I read C&P; some 50 years ago, was how entertaining it is. That's right, entertaining! What a gallery of vivid characters! What a sensory feast of description, albeit chiefly description of filth, poverty, and depravity! What scorching, sardonic wit with which the principal characters taunt each other! Long and dark it is, but C&P; is also an elegantly constructed fiction, a book that was immediately 'popular' and has deservedly stayed popular. Why, Ayn Rand herself declared it to be one of the novels that most influenced her, though that can be taken as evidence that Ms. Rand wasn't a particularly insightful reader. The only portion of the novel which fails, IMHO, is the epilogue, and I have an explanation for the problem; the Tsarist secret police compelled Dostoyevsky's editor to falsify a semi-happy ending in epilogue format as a condition for allowing the publication of such a dire portrayal of Russian life.Compare C&P;, if you will, with English novels of the mid 19th Century - Dickens, Trollope, Eliot, Gaskell. The English are all about manners and mores. The Russia of C&P; was a world of philosophical and social ferment, far more 'modern' in its intellectual daring. I'm not sure the average Anglo-American reader has caught up yet."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"After reading this book, it is very clear to me why Dostoevsky was one of the most influential writers ever. Nietzsche was in love with him, and valued his insight into the psychology of human nature. Even though I read a translation, it was still a work of brilliance. I can only imagine how great the original is."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is a literal masterpiece of man's search for the self. He uses Existentialist theories to motivate Raskolnikov to commit the &quot;perfect murder&quot;. What makes this work awesome, is the use of his personal writing. The use of language in this novel is informal, yet captivating. The reader has trouble putting this book down as the life of Raskolnikov escalates down a spiral of insanity and loneliness. The realization of his mistakes takes a toll on his well being and he must confess his crime of murder before he loses all hope. The moral issues in this novel are ones of great proportion. Man cannot survive completely alone, and he cannot instill his will over others, when he has nothing left to will, he is nothing, and death is the suitable solution. Raskolnikov almost comes to this conclusion, but a woman gives him hope. Without the support from Sonia, he would have perished. One of Dostoevsky's aims for this novel was disproving the theories of Nietzsche and Hegel in their philosophy of the Uber man. Both believed that man can become extraordinary through their will and actions, and are therefore above the law of man. However, no man is above the law, and Dostoevsky uses Raskolnikov to prove that theory, as Raskolnikov's life becomes more painful to endure. In the end, his confession is his salvation, and once again, he enters the world of humanity."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Absolutely marvelous! I think this book was probably the best work of Dostoevsky. In my personal view I believe that the beginning was much better then the end. The character of Roskolnikov was developed as an angry young man who sees world through morbidly vexed eyes. The ending was a bit disappointing since the character of Roskolnikov was stripped down from an angry young man to a creature that is morally and emotionally destroyed. Dostoevsky perhaps knew better what he intended to accomplish from this book, but in my humble opinion the book should have ended without capitulating Roskolnikov to a standards of the so called \`civilization.' But then Roskolnikov does mean the one who confesses....."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is an intensely psychological book that delves into the mentality of a killer and the long, arduous path to salvation. Furthermore, Crime and Punishment illustrates the need for faith in a cold, godless world. Particularly, Dosteovsky focuses on Raskolikov, a brilliant young college student who commits a pointless murder at the whims of an experiment. As the days after the crime elapse, Raskolnikov becomes a whithered, tortured soul who becomes engaged with the clever police chief. Dosteovsky's depiction of the psychological cat and mouse affair between Raskolnikov and the police chief provides a rare glimpse into the torturous psyche of guilt. Beautifully written, touching and extremely moralizing, Crime and Punishment is a lucid fable that endures to this day, a tale whose theme is still as valid as our society slowly, as in the words of Judge Robert Bork, \\"slouches towards Gomorrah.\\""},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and punishment is, in a single word, an outstanding literary work. It tells the harrowing tale of an ex-student, driven to murder, and the aftermath of his actions. It is superbly written and loses none of the passion and emotion through the translation from russian.The book holds the readers attention, its insight into the main charachters mind keeping you interested untill the end. The writer, Fyodor Dostoevsky manages to extract an amazing tale from the bleak, severe surroundings of russia in which it is set.In closing, I feel that Crime and Punishment is a book thet everyone should read at least once in their lifetime. It is a thought provoking book, offering deep insights into the human mind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"As I said, this novel is definitely slow-paced, so for those whose attention spans are shorter than the average television commercial, you are being forewarned.That aside, this is an absolutely marvelous book, combining elements of mystery and crime with disturbing psychology and provocative philosophy. The story concerns a poor Russian youth named Raskalnikov who has decided that murdering an elderly pawnbroker for her wealth is just because she is a societal leech who contributes nothing. He is blinded by his own poverty and deluded by his Neitzschean philosophy concerning 'extraordinary men' and their rights to commit heinous acts for the general betterment of humanity. Problems arise when he falls in love and is also hounded by two men, one a police officer and another a scoundrel.The story is well-translated in that it is clear and concise, and, by all accounts, preserves the story nicely. The writing itself is readable, and the more philosophical passages are definitely intriguing.Highly reccomended."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I recently read this book, as my first ever of Dostoevsky, and I must say that i now fully understand why he has been hailed as one of the greatest writers ever.

He realizes that social and economic change do not happen through murder, but through charity and hard work, which he learns through helping the prostitute daugher of a drunkard, as well as his own poor family.

He quits school because he can't afford to put himself through, he has sold most of his Earthly possessions so that he can eat, and then he takes the life of a wealthy pawnbroker and robs her house because he feels a sense of entitlement. This story brings the 19th century of Russia to life, Raskolnikov is such an intriguing character, and its characters are one of the book's greatest strengths. The settings are vivid, the plot itself is wonderful. The book is very coherent, it loses little in the translation, which is a credit to the translator, because a bad translator can screw up a book like this. This is a great book and definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is an exciting novel that explored ideas that were way before its time. It is the story of a troubled young man, Raskolnikov, who commits a double murder, and how he deals with the ramifications of his act. Dostoevesky gives his readers a full and complex view of all of the characters, and in the end, you can't help sympathizing with Raskolnikov. Though the russian names are at first puzzling, once you get the hang of them it is easy reading. There are many characters who seem minor, but many develop into important pieces of the plot. Whether or not you end up forgiving Raskolnikov, this is a pyschological novel that forces the reader to look at all aspects of a person's life and then make a final judgement."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I first read this book when I was fifteen years old and absolutely loved it. Dostoyevsky's depiction of Raskolnikov made him like no other character that I have come across in a novel. The author made Raskolnikov's fear and guilt come alive in a way that no other author could have. I could not help but become anxious along with Raskolnikov as he realized the enormity of the crime that he had committed. Dostoyevsky was truly a master of the psychological thriller."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There's no need to go into detailing this classic pshycological study on a warped individual. It covers the full spectrum of emotions, from inner strenghts to utter indifference. Throw in an intelligent detective that uses these same feelings to trap the murderer, a good hearted friend, two loving women, and of course the dreary setting of mid nineteenth century Russia and you have a well written and thought provoking novel. The long critisized ending also provides for a somewhat positive ending. A sequel would have been quite interesting. Dostoevsky uses somewhat similar characters and emotions in his other classic, &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; If you enjoy a study into the inner mind with some interesting outcomes you would do well to read both of these important works."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This was one of the most entertaining stories I have ever read. I was immediately taken in by the plot and fascinated by Raskolnikov's \\"experiment\\". I know a lot of people don't think that long Russian novels are going to be a lot of fun, but this book was. It had an odd, dark sense of humor that I really enjoyed, and one of the most interesting debates over the morality of various life choices I've ever seen. It was really accessible to the modern reader and I think all that speaks to its timelessness."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevski is a powerful and wonderful author, and I have read most of his books. His books are long and complex and perhaps this particular book is the most complex of all. Dostoevsky himself spent time in prison, and his experiences and the soul searching that he did there come out in this book. The theme that runs through this book is that man inevitably pays for his crimes by suffering, and through that suffering he may in fact receive redemption. This book is about a paranoid schizophrenic by the name of Raskolnikov. He causes a lot of harm to people because of his own grandiose idea of his own superiority. But all the harm that he causes he pays for in his own tortured mind. A powerful and sometimes hard to read book because Dostoevsky's characters are so real, and we feel their pain and suffering with them as we read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"...after reading the one star reviews read the best book of all times and you'll understand part of my agony... Raskolnykov."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Be warned; this book is not for those who require suspense and action in their reading, nor is it who enjoy complex interactions and emotional scenes between characters. Granted, this book does contain both these elements in various places, but other than the scene of the murder, the pacing is slow, and until somewhere in the middle of the book, the focus is on Raskolnikov alone. Those who read and enjoyed \\"Anna Karenina\\" but found themselves dragging through the lengthy descriptions of Levin's solitary musings will find the entirety of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" in the same vein. This book is a psychological thriller; Rasknolnikov's conflicts are internal as he struggles to come to terms with his crime, his guilt, the inherent nature of his personality, and ultimately, the value of the human being.After a slow start, I found this book to be surprisingly pleasant, despite its rather dark plot. If you can make it through the first hundred or so pages, the rest should be an interesting, if not entirely riveting, read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This wordy book is easily one of the best i have ever read and really allows you to see the consequences of the crime.Raskolnikov, Sonya, Razumukin, and the rest are all extremely likeable and sympathetic characters. Each one has their own problems and struggles told in this beautiful book. And the work of the investigator Porfiry is wonderful to read.Every literature fan should own a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is a true masterpiece. It's a wonderful trip into the criminal mind. It doesn't spare a thought, it includes everything that the killer is feeling before he commits the crime, after he commits the crime, and while he's committing the crime. It's filled with his conflicting feelings of pride and regret. It displays the theme that someone can't get away with such a terrible crime because there is no escape from their own mind. Raskolnikov could never escape the constant repulsion at himself, and the repulsion of the loved ones around him who knew of his deadly sin.There were some things, though, that put a damper on the reading. I felt like a lot was lost in the translation. While reading I noticed quite a few grammatical errors, and I don't know if that's how it is with most editions of this book, or if it was only mine. It was distracting at times to have to put up with the errors, but it didn't take too much from the book. Once I looked past the errors, I found it an extremely interesting book that is definitely worth investing some time into."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"When a book has a visceral effect on the reader, the author must be doing something right. My father complained of actually feeling sick while reading this, and I had a similiar reaction. There is a pervasive darkness here which is little to do with Raskalnikov's crime and punishment and everything to do with the grime and general despair of St. Petersburg. You can almost breath the coal dust in the air; physical and moral squalor taint everything. Even the supposedly good characters live in a state of degredation, and poverty is everwhere. Given this, the pure moral which Dostoevsky seems to try to draw out of it seems a bit ridiculous, and is the main flaw of the book in my eyes. He tries in the last stretch to uplift, but he's shown us too much squalor to make it believable. This book is a bit of a chore to read, I found, given its length and unremitting tone, and while it's clearly the work of a master author, I don't reccomend it unconditonally."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is an interesting novel in which the psyche of a murderer is explored. The beginning of the book is a seesaw inside the murderer's, Raskolnikov, head, between whether or not to commit the crime. The supposed insanity of this leads Raskolnikov to the house where he kills the woman. After the murder, the guilt of the crime is eating at Raskolnikov and even makes him sick. Amongst all of this Raskolnikov has deal with his sister's engagement to a man he does not feel she should marry. The agony of his problems ends with his decisions at the end of the book.This book at times is very slow, but is probably purposely written that way to show what Raskolnikov is going through. The time that is dwelt on a decision making process may bore the reader and may require a break. It strays away from the murder and gets a little into love and other everyday problems. Like most Russian novels there are numerous names that may confuse the reader. There are so many characters that some seem like they do not even need to be mentioned but everyone plays a role in this book. In order to keep track of everything that is going on pay close attention to names or the book may not make complete sense.When it gets to the more interesting parts of the story the book shows its true colors. The reader then understands why he or she just read thirty pages of basically nothing but words. It becomes intensively descriptive, so much that it may be disturbing to some. But the descriptions and the boring parts play into the author's efforts to truly illustrate the mental process of a murderer. Raskolnikov's mind is thoroughly explored and the author seems to have the skill of putting the reader into his shoes. All in all the book gets really slow at times, but the good parts of book out weigh this and make it a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book has everything - a great story, a bit of history, superb character development, etc. And, surprisingly, it's very easy to read despite it's length and origin. Definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a true classic and is a book that is very easy to read. The story is told very well and is fast moving with several interesting subplots. For those of you who dislike the long rants on politics, religion, ect. that some classics contain then fear not because Crime and Punishment is free of those. Again, I found this book to be very easy to read. If you are skeptical about reading The Brothers Karamazov then I would suggest starting out with Crime and Punishment. If you throughly enjoy it then you will be ready for Karamazov which is a longer and harder read (and better in my opinion). Some of my other favorites are Atlas Shrugged, Les Miserable, and The Fountainhead."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821-1880) is along with Count Leo Tolstoy the greatest Russian novelist His study of criminal mind is without peer in world literature.\\"Crime and Punishment\\" (1866) is set in Saint Petersburg located on the Neva River near the Finnish border. This fog enshrouded capital of Peter the Great is the site of the murder story. A young, penniless former law student Rodion Raskolnikov is a scholastic dropout who spends his days in the squalor of a small apartment in the slums. He has been imbued with the philosophy of Nietzche and the nihilism which were popular beliefs nineteenth century Russian intellectual circles. Raskolnikov believes he is superior to the vast majority of humankind. To implement this hubristic stance he decides to kill a greedy pawnbroker. He kills the old lady and her sister with an ax. He robs them and believes he will never be punished for the crime.In addition to this major story we meet Raskolnikov's sister who has been seduced by a rich aristocrat and is living at home with their mother. We also meet the saint-like Sonya a poor girl forced into prostitution as a means to feed her starving family. All of the major characters are undergoing poverty, illness and suffering through their tormented lives. Countless pages of the long novel deal with their various philosophies concerning life, the fate of Russia and the Christian gospel's relevance and importance in modern life.The novel ends with hope as Raskolnikov repents of his crimes; is sentenced to eight years in Siberia and wins the love of the prostitute Sonya. Dostoevsky is adept at exploring the minid of his characters. His descriptions of St. Petersburg life are detailed bringing his tale to life.This is a pyschological novel which has influenced the course of the introspective novel of the twentieth century. Dostoevsky had been banished to Siberia and understood human suffering perhaps better than any major novelist. It was refreshing to this reviewer that the novel is written from a Christian perspective giving sinners home for forgiveness through the grace of Jesus Christ.Due to the long Russian names, the complicated plot and the number of characters the book is not an easy read. It is, however, worthy of your time and attention. Dostoevsky is an author well worth knowing. The book can be read and re-read throughout life with profit to the reader. It is a spiritual odyssesy through the rings of hell culminating in the joy experienced by earthly and heavenly love."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you have not yet read this novel you are lacking an experience that will change the way you feel about the act of reading. I posit that regardless of what kind of literature you prefer, this work will affect you.I have just finished reading Crime and Punishment for the third time. In doing so, I reconfirmed that what is so gripping about the novel is its psychology. In reality, there is very little going on in the way of physical action. On a cerebral level however, the output of the prose is almost overwhelming. Given the author's own history with nervous instability and his gift for understanding the deeper psyche of modern man, the result of his writing is hyper-intense and visceral. The dream sequences are vivid and disturbing; a talent which has not yet been duplicated by another author as far as I am concerned. The nervous passion with which the main character's terror and excitement are related literally latches on to the reader. Crime and Punishment, at the very least, is an enthralling page-turner. Good luck trying to put it down!While I take issue with the somewhat weak and seemingly incongruent Epilogue (I am not alone in this opinion) I can guarantee you an extremely enriching literary experience in Crime and Punishment. Nearly every second is fraught with emotional overload on the part of the novel's hero, \\"Raskolnikov\\" (which translates to \\"religious schismatic\\"). He is not a likeable character necessarily, but he will intrigue you nonetheless. If you read this and do not find yourself exhilarated, check to see if you have a pulse!This is, without question, one of the must-reads of world literature. If you've any interest in the duality, criminality, and psychology of Man, dive in! To go through your whole life without having read this work is a mistake."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Easily the most exciting novel I have ever read. What gripping drama and what unforgettable characters! I though Tolstoy was great but Dostoevsky is even better. Now on to The Brothers Karamazov. I hope it's just as good."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is probably Dostoyevsky's most famous novel, and with good reason. It contains his famous features of intense psychological, philosophical and emotional enquiry, coupled with the presentation of suffering, a multi-layered meaning as well as different ideas along with his own Russian Orthodox Christian viewpoint. However, the book is also more accessible than most others.One of the main reasons is that it has an actual, tangible plot, and can be seen as a piece of crime fiction. The main storyline is Raskolnikov, a poor student in St Petersburgh, who kills an old lady who is a usurer. He spends most of the novel contemplating, reacting, suffering, running and interacting with others as a direct influence and result of his crime. The characters are also unforgettable as Dostoyevsky presents a very chilling picture of the suffering of many people (for instance the poor) in his contemporary, urban Russia.There is much philosophy in the book, and on that level, this is a mature enough book for there to be no point in trying to get at \\"what the meaning is\\". What is important is just how vividly and strongly the inner world of the characters is portrayed - as an entire landscape of thoughts, desires and interactions.While I read Crime and Punishment, I thought that one of the key questions is simply \\"what were the exact reasons for Raskolnikov's crime?\\". The book presents a very interesting range of possible explanations and it is sorting through them that makes the reading personal. However, one philosophical point that seems explicit enough to mention is Dostoyevsky's reaction to Raskolnikov and his \\"circle\\" as examples of a new, \\"atheist/nihilist\\" - but really materialist - schools of throught that were new in Russia at the time. I think one of the hundreds of aims of the book for Dostoyevsky was to show what he saw as the inadequacy of materialism in living your life. Whether you agree or disagree, the book presents what happens when certain ideas are pushed to the extreme.Overall, the book isn't too long but a very challenging read, both intellectually and emotionally. But it's absolutely amazing.As a final note, I read this in the original Russian so I can't make any statements about this particular edition/translation, or any other."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"3, From the beginning of Crime and Punishment to the very end, Fyodor Dostoyevsky delights readers with his amazing characters and suspenseful setting. The book focuses on a young man out of college, Raskolnikov. He decides to murder a pawnbroker to support his idea that some people are superior and are above morals. What follows is an epic journey into Raskolnikov's punishment and redemption. Along the way, readers glimpse the dreary world that surrounds him and the fates of those around him.The characters in Crime and Punishment are the shining stars of the novel. From the prideful and distant Raskolnikov to the compassionate and caring Sonia, from the strong and beautiful Dounia to the crazy and mysterious Svidrigailov, each person in this novel is very unique and adds their own piece to the drama surrounding Raskolnikov. Several subplots are present, such as the story of the Marmeladov family's fall into ruin, which are entertaining and add to the story as a whole. The story itself is very solid as well, engaging readers with Raskolnikov and everything that follows him after his grizzly deeds.Crime and Punishment is one of my favorite novels. I was plesently surprised at how great this book is. Dostoyevsky is a master at characterization, and it shows in his work. The plot is engaging and really drew my attention. I heartily recommend Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment\\", published in 1866, is one of those books that one reads many times in his/her lifetime and which impregnates your spirit and soul with the self-imprecatory and dense prose of a deranged and disillusioned man, its author being the greatest of the Russian prose writers, Fiodor Dostoievski (1821-1881).This is my second time reading and I am sure I will get back to it eventually many times still.Despite the deep density of all its characters, all of them unabashedly portraying and surrendering themselves to the reader's judgement, sometimes even anticipating them, in the most clear-cut and realistic way - but at the same time seemingly disdaining the pity that one should visit upon them - this is one of those very few books you read with the weird sensation that you are the author, not Dostoievski, something that can only be ascribed to the profoundly realistic knowledge of the human dramas that surround human condition at its worst, in this case, the poor inhabitants of czarist Saint Petersburgo of the XIX century. Also, besides being essentially Russian and universal at the same time, it is auto-biographical at its core, where the protagonist Raskolnikov is easily identified with the man Dostoievsky not only for the Oedipus complex open ajar to the reader discretion.In my opinion, this is one of the 10 best prose books of the Occidental Classical Literature ever written and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I started to read this book because i had to, but no i am overjoyed that I had to chance to read this classic. What a great book. The character devolpment is great, how the author goes deep into the human phyche. The book was not a page turner but amazing either way, i recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a spell binding book with a lot of heart and a lot of depth"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You cannot blame Dostoyevsky for NOT being a &quot;beach read.&quot; If you read this book in two weeks (and people praise themselves for it! how ironic) and got nothing out of it... that's your problem! This is not TOm CLancy and all that garbage. This is a book you must meditate on for a while. Of course it can take you 4 months! What appears to be superfluous is not. It is packed with interesting philosophical insights. Reading should not be a &quot;race,&quot; it's a delicate intellectual pursuit. So, please, do not blame it on Dosto for not writing a page-turner! Readers of the world, unite for the Classics against the evils of American pseudo-literature and reader-digestry!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Only the Brothers Karamazov could possibly compete with Crime and Punishment for the title of Dostoevsky's best novel.Crime and Punishment is an amazing literary feat. In this story of sin and redemption Dostoevsky weaves a great tale. It is a theological novel, a philisophical novel and possibly the finest psychological novel ever written. He studies his characters motives and intent, his philisophical values and how Raskalnikov justifies his actions which by any normal measure is a sinful one. Eventually even Raskalnikov realizes that he is not above other men, intelligence doesn't create a special dispensation for crimes. It's Raskalnikov's journey from guilt to redemption which make this a great study.In some ways much of the angst of Raskalnikov can be understood better if the reader comes from a &quot;high church&quot; background such as (especially) Orthodox or Catholic. Much of the guilt and redemptives aspects of the story are framed in the theology of Dostoevsky's Russian Orthodoxy (easily recognizable to Catholics and Episcipalians).Nineteenth century St Petersburg comes alive. Dostoevsky based his locations on actual streets and apartments; today you can still tour parts of St Pete's and find the actual apartments still in existence (and being lived in).This is a deeply serious work and one not to be taken lightly. One of the few books that I can say may effect you life."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book has always given me a problem. It repulses me. Yet I consider the novel one of my finest reads.When Raskolnikov puts his ear to the door to listen to the footsteps in the hallway, he hears someone on the other side of the door putting his ear to the wood also.He is terrified to realize an inch or so of wood separates the ear of the murderer and the ear of the law. My hair turns white just thinking about it.That part has always given me the creeps. Like the dream about being locked un a shed full of spiders. That is also in this book.You cannot go through life without reading this book at least once. It is a great crime story, albeit a dark story. The detective is as evil as the murderer is good.This is not a book that can be read many times. It is dark and oppresive. It is full of spiders."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the first Dostoevsky book I have read, and I liked it immensely. I decided to read it because of the intriguing plot, as well as Dostoevsky's reputation. Something interesting about this novel is that Dostoevsky used a very &quot;backwards&quot; sort of character development. He had Raskolnikov commit a murder- with no apparent motive- and then spent the rest of the book exploring the character, rather than the other way around. So first we watch this character commit a horrible, terrible crime, one that we should denounce him for, and then we begin to get to know him, and he is revealed to have an astoundingly good character after all. I found myself liking Raskolnikov greatly, and I was able to identify with him as well. However, this book does not seem to fall under the guidelines of a &quot;crime novel&quot; nor a &quot;psychological thriller&quot;. Yes, there is a crime, as well as a study of the protoganist's psyche, but it is not exactly thrilling. This is not the sort of story where you have to keep reading and reading to find out who committed the crime. You already know. Therefore, there is no mystery to keep you interested. Despite all these obstacles, Dostoevsky does what might be impossible for most writers. He makes you care about what happens to Raskolnikov. I was not thrilled, but engrossed. What kept me reading here was the desire to see if Raskolnikov would defeat his inner demons and turn himself in, or be arrested. I'd rather not reveal the ending but I would like to say that I found it extremely satisfying. The subplot, that of Luzhin trying to gain control over Dounia, might have only gotten in the way of another writer, but Dostoevsky was able to inspire such hate in me for Luzhin that I wanted to keep reading just to see him get what he deserved in the end. After reading this, I have decided to read Dostoevky's other works as well, and hopefully they will all be of the same high quality."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment examines one man's decision to kill and his ultimate punishment for it. After one man who feels a sense of desperation (Raskolnikov) decides to kill an old pawnbroker, he delves into a realm of psychological and spiritual anguish and despair. Beforehand he concludes at points that his deed will benefit humanity, for the woman was a despicable person, but the repercussions in the aftermath, namely the isolation from several people of his life--his mother and sister, as well as his friend Razumihin--serve as an avenue to conscientiously come to terms with the act's immorality.Dostoevsky's work creates an atmosphere which is part crime drama and part psychological thriller, but it also has deep philosophical undertones about man's existence---physically and mentally--after the most extreme of crimes. Yet the crime of killing is not the pinnacle of the story (it is committed in the early part of the book), but rather Raskolnikov's punishment, that is, his fall from the depths of society and his mental and physical sickness, that are the novel's essence. Raskolnikov not only deals with his own sense of isolation and delirium as well as the rising suspicion from several officials, but also tries to deal with the problems of his mother and sister, who come to visit him for a time.As unsympathetic as Raskolnikov seems at points, there is also some evidence that he has a moral conscience, and this seems to bring him out of his mental stupor. Under his extreme nervous state he gives his last money to a poor family who eventually loses their father. He also feels a moral obligation to make sure his sister marries someone who is suitable, and that his mother is also taken care of. It takes him quite a deal to get to this point, and because of his agitation, he tells his friend Razumihim to go to his family and make sure they are comforted.It is an association with another troubled character that aids the protagonist. Later in the novel, there is a spiritual connection between Raskolikov and Sonya, a girl who was forced to prostitute to support her family. Unlike Raskolikov, Sonya is deeply religious and moral, praying often and sacrificing and caring for her family and siblings, and seems to bring a healing to Raskolikov's troubled mind. Sonya, in a book rich in despicable characters, symbolizes the purity and saving grace in Raskolikov's world.Dostoevsky's work is rich in philosophy about the nature of crime on one's conscience, this being the novel's crux. Raskolnikov's progression and the penance he must serve are not only in his own suffering, but in his experiences and observations of man's lowliness. The paramount flaw is his belief that he can escape his crime: \\"If he has a conscience he will suffer for his mistake. That will be punishment...\\" (pg. 246).Over all, this is a complex, deep novel that makes one think; this is one of the best psychological crime novels out there, and a superbly written book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I do not wish to tread ground that has already been walked upon--Take what you will from the book--I found it amazing and interesting philosophically, but my point here regards translations and editions:I purchased the mass market paperback version and started reading it, and it was decent, but when I stumbled upon the Norton edition, I realized what I had been missing. The Norton/Jesse Coulson translation is superb; it is the best I've found. The Garnett translation, which is not bad, is on par with others, but I simply wish to add that the Norton edition is, with footnotes and essays and the Coulson translation, worth the extra money for those who wish to enjoy the novel to its fullest."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If Dostoevsky and Tolstoy are considered to be the best of novelists (and they are, by many), Crime and Punishment may thereby be considered one of the greatest literary works, as it substantiated Dostoevsky's claim that he was a great writer (beyond Poor Folk), contrary to what many critics of the time had to say. Common criticism cites flawed style or technique, even claims that Dostoevsky couldn't realize the art he was creating (and so could not have been a real artist). It is for the most part undisputed, however, that Crime and Punishment remains the greatest of psychological novels. It appeals to the reader on a personal level-- time and time again the concept of one &quot;becoming Raskolnikov&quot; is seen in criticism. In my personal experience, I can certainly testify to this. I read the first two parts of the novel on a train from Cologne to Stuttgart, and on stepping off the train, I felt such a connection with Raskolnikov that I was paranoid of being caught by the police for the murder of the old pawnbroker. I was forced to constantly remind myself &quot;it's just a book&quot;. But is it really? Does not the ability of Dostoevsky to influence us this greatly constitute something more than just words on paper? I would encourage anyone to read the book and see for themselves."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I didn't finish \\"Crime and Punishment\\". The reasons I'm about to give made me think twice about typing up a review. My decision has been made however, and some may disagree with my reasons; probably with a disgusted \\"who do you think you are?\\" spoken in my direction. Well, I'm sorry, but do read on if you like.I am not a Dostoevsky newbie. Previously I read \\"The Brothers Karamozov\\" as well as \\"Notes From Underground\\", and both demanded my full attention to grasp what Dostoevsky was trying to put across. He's a very thoughtful writer, and a self-styled philosopher as well. Many times through \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\", he would go for page after page, thinking out loud about whatever subject came up, be it infidelity, God, friendships, gambling, social classes, you name it. The same can be said for this novel, although I was getting confused throughout \\"Crime and Punishment\\", so confused in fact that I had to put this book down, and will not likely return to it.The story is not confusing, really. We follow Raskolnikov, a nearly-useless beggarman while he tries to live his pathetic life in 19th century Russia. Dostoevsky paints a bleak picture of the country at that time, with most people being filthy, drunken, poets and \\"intellectuals\\" eeking out a living by begging and mooching off everyone in sight. Raskolnikov (rascal?) is no different, and spends much of his time leeching off relatives and pawning off anything of value to the local pawnbroker. Shortly into the book, he murders said pawnbroker and we follow the wretch as his inner torments get the better of him over time. No, that's not a spoiler; it's right there on the back cover glurge, silly. A simple concept for a book, something we're all familiar with in one form or another, and the way his conscience affects him after the murder should lead to a satisfying novel. Instead, all I got was confusion. I was able to follow the action, but too much of my time was spent piecing together what I THOUGHT was happening, rather than being taken for the ride the writer intends.Asking myself why I was confused, I picked up \\"Brothers\\" again and opened the book randomly. Reading ten or so long-winded pages of that monsterous work, I was NOT confused. So what was my problem with \\"Crime\\"? Was the book written earlier, when Dostoevsky was a lesser writer? No, that can't be it since I read \\"Notes\\" with no problem, and it had been written many years before \\"Crime\\".Then it dawned on me. Translation! Each of these three in my collection have been written by a different translator. In this case the translator is a person named Constance Garnett. Looking into other books in my \\"unread\\" pile, I noticed that Ms. Garnett's translations are considered \\"definitive\\". I gulped. Could it be that this nonsensical style is what Dostoevsky really intends to put in front of his readers? Was my version of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" NOT translated as it was intended? How, then, to reconcile the fact that I LOVED the novel?I don't read Russian. I am personally incapable of translating a novel from ANY language into English. Maybe I am completely off base. But this novel, as translated by Ms. Garnett, is nearly UNREADABLE. It makes very little sense. These characters behave like lunatics, and can't seem to express their thoughts in anything resembling coherency. Razumihin, Raskolnikov's best friend and essentially a 19th century \\"beatnik\\", is incomprehensible in everything he does. Was this intentional? I don't think so, as the characters who interact with him only find him a \\"little\\" strange. I couldn't understand what Raskolnikov was trying to accomplish, WHY he thought the way he did, nor HOW he was able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes without even trying. This CANNOT be how Dostoevsky imagined his work would be read. He styles himself a deep thinker; not a clown. And Ms. Garnett makes him a clown though this very poor translation. Grammatically, it is as atrocious as anything I've ever read as well.A new reader to Dostoevsky would probably be pushed toward reading \\"Crime and Punishment\\", as it is his most famous work and considered to be his first important novel. But when presented with this sloppy and unreadable script, it's likely to turn them off for good. I know I would have been. It is a crime, no pun intended, for his most important work to be translated as ham-handed as this. Is it possible that poorly-translated Dostoevsky paved the way for other Russians like Tolstoy to steal the center stage of Russian literature? I think that IS possible, and that is an unforgivable crime as well.If anyone should know of a different English translation of this novel, please let me know. I am unable to finish it in it's present form. In my opinion, Garnett is a very poor translator, and this novel is in dire need of a new, readable translation. New readers to Dostoevsky should steer clear. Buy \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" instead."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov, an impovershed student in 19th Century St. Petersburg, conceives a plan to kill and rob a shrewish hag of a pawnbroker. He justifies his plan because he is an ubermensch and she is a louse. The world will be better off if she is dead and he is able to finish his education. Killing and robbing her will accomplish both purposes. After all, the ubermensch owes it to society to commit any crime that will ultimately benefit society. The crime is perpetrated and the rest of the book deals with Raskolnikov's angst over his guilt and his redemption through suffering. Almost every major character in the book is more likeable that Raskolnikov.The philosophy of Dostoyevsky's book seems to be primarily a refutation of Hegelian and proto-Nietschian philosophy and an affirmation of Christian values. Along the way he also manages to work in a rebuttal of social-Darwinism.Having known, prosecuted, and defended hundreds of murderers, I was much taken by Raskolnikov's psychological progression from crime to atonement. Much of his self justification rang true to my experience. I have known many killers who thought of themselves as superior beings above the law, and many others who justified killing on the grounds that the victim lacked human worth. So long as the killer can keep the victim dehumanized, the killer can live with the deed. When the killer begins to regard the victim as a fellow human, guilt sets in and many confess--often years later. Raskolnikov's behavioural symptoms did not, however, ring true to my experience. Although some killers are guilt-ridden to the point of distraction, they can usually control themselves much better than Raskolnikov. His actions practically shouted his guilt.The interplay of the large cast of characters gave the book great psychological depth, but Dostoyevsky didn't beat the reader over the head with the psychology. He didn't tell you what the characters were thinking. Their actions showed you what they were thinking. In my experience, most modern psycho-dramas ladle out the psychology in huge dollops. Modern writers would do well to re-read Dostoyevsky.The abridged audio edition read by Michael Sheen is three hours long, and the tale does not suffer much from the massive abridgement necessary to get the story on three CD's. My greatest complaint with the edition is that Sheen reads the story with a British accent, and the characters all speak with British accents. It was somewhat hard to adjust to a Russian novel read with a British accent."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The negative reviews of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" seem to fall into two catagories: those that found the book \\"boring,\\" \\"full of digressions,\\" and \\"not believable,\\" and those that took issue with the underlying message, confirmed at the very end, that Christianity promises a new life for misguided souls like Raskolnikov who have been corrupted by immoral modern ideas.I once counted myself among those who were bored with the book. Back when I was in college, it did not hold my interest and I set it aside after ten pages or so. I preferred more \\"realistic\\" novels, i.e. those that felt exactly like my small world. Fifteen years later, I found the book absorbing and insightful, but not because I thought Raskolnikov's crime and subsequent states of delerium were exactly \\"true-to-life\\" in all their specifics. I agree with those who were perplexed by Raskolnikov's erratic behavior. At times, it was tiring to follow along with his endlessly agitated moods and continual exhaustion. It seems as if he's at the end of his rope from the first page to the last. However, taking a broader view, he is a young man who rationalizes premeditated murder as a way for him and his mother and sister to escape lives dogged by humiliating poverty. His philosophical notions about crime are a smokescreen and basically immaterial - they're a mishmash of trendy ideas about 'progress' that will enable mankind to escape from 'beastly' fears. Blah, blah, Nietzsche, whatever. What really sets him off is the belief that his sister, whom he obviously loves, is forcing herself to enter a loveless marriage to a wealthy jerk so her family can get a few handouts because her brother is a loser and can't support them. So for me, the book is not about Christian values triumphing over athiestic modern philosophies, and readers who get caught up in this (very thin) thread in the novel are missing the point. I don't even care to know that Dostoevsky's religious beliefs at the time were such and such, and those ideas were simplistic, and they are evident in the novel and... therefore the novel is no good and Dostoevsky is not a great writer... Hunh? If you like fiction and appreciate fully-realized characters whose behavior--Raskolnikov's fits notwithstanding--is rooted in basic human emotions that everyone can identify with like fear, pride, love, guilt, and shame, I think you will enjoy this book. Imagine having to face your own sister after she learns that you murdered two people. The religious angle is not as prominant or as distracting as some of the reviews would lead you to believe.As for the book's \\"meaningless digressions\\" and improbable coincidences, I felt that the author was mainly concerned with the psychological struggles going on within and among the characters and that he stuck to that theme unwaveringly. I read that the published version was 'cut down considerably' from the serialized version by Dostoevsky himself, and I never had the sinking feeling that he was stretching the soup just to fill pages. It's not a sleek modern detective story. It's about people. Admittedly, there were a few 'chance' meetings that felt contrived, but nothing really incredible that made you lose faith in plot--and they usually served to heighten the drama.Here's a teaser: \\"Generally speaking, Mr Luzhin belonged to the class of people who are apparently extremely courteous in society, and indeed extremely anxious to be courteous, but who, if anything should happen to upset them, immediately lose all their airs and graces and become more like sacks of flour than breezy gentlemen whose very presence brings a breath of fresh air into society.\\" Nice, right?"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Ever wanted to get inside the head of a murderer? That's exactly what the legendary Russian writer Dostoevsky does in this classic novel. On the face of it, by the usual standards of literature, this doesn't seem to be much of a novel. There isn't much in the way of plot (the murder happens in the early pages, we know who he is from the outset, and the only real suspense revolves around whether or not he will confess). The language is at times awkward and complex. The setting is believable but not captivating. But the people are, and here Dostoevsky excels: characterization. The focus of the novel revolves around the internal struggle within the murderer's mind, as he deals with the consequences of his action as a moral being. Most modern murder mysteries seek to entertain by focusing on the blood and gore; Dostoevsky goes far deeper by focusing on the mind.Dostoevsky has a deep insight into human nature and psychology. In the process of wading through the text, one can expect to come across wonderful pearls like these: \\"I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don't quite get on with their mothers-in-law.\\" (p37) \\"Even the poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible nervous craving.\\" (p350) \\"And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp the soul and the mind?\\" (p386)This insight into human behaviour especially becomes evident in Dostoevsky's treatment of the murderer Raskolnikov. Many writers are one-dimensional, but Dostoevsky shows how people have a complex system of emotions, often fluctuating from one feeling to the next. He depicts human nature with different layers and moods, as Raskolnikov moves between conflicting emotions such as fear, guilt, remorse, and courage. The brilliance is already evident from the first chapter, where Raskolnikov is introduced as a figure absorbed in selfish isolation. Completely absorbed with the self and away from love of God and man, as he contemplates murdering the old woman pawn-broker Alyona Ivanovna his wretched condition is a convincing portrait of the depravity of the human heart estranged from God. As Raskolnikov later confesses: \\"Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great deal.\\" (p383). With a window into the mind of a murderer, we begin to understand him to the point where we identify with him, and realize that we are all capable of enormous sin. Raskolnikov's loathsome heart is ultimately no different from our own.But Dostoevsky also excels in showing the tragic consequences of depravity: it results in isolation from other human beings, and ultimately from God. Raskolnikov's deteriorating mental and physical state is highly reminiscent of what David says in Psalm 32 about being in bed, wracked with unconfessed guilt. Although Dostoevsky shows the effect of sin more in relation to other humans (isolation) than in relation to God, he succeeds in showing the tragic consequences of the darkness of the human soul. Raskolnikov experiences an increasing sense of isolation. \\"It seemed to him, he had cut himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\\" (p109) Such comments about the psychology of a murderer are particularly illuminating.Yet there is also a sense of hope, as Raskolnikov finds the answer to guilt and its consequences in heartfelt repentance. This solution is enhanced by way of a contrast with the remedy sought by Svidrigailov. Although his guilt is never directly affirmed, we are left with the distinct impression that Svidrigailov struggles with the same guilt over murder as Raskolnikov. Svidrigailov advises Raskolnikov that he has only two options: Siberia or a bullet in the head. But while Svidrigailov himself chooses the latter option of suicide, Raskolnikov chooses Siberia ... and repentance. This inner transformation leads to significant observable changes in his life, with Sonia functioning as a Christ figure. The novel ends fittingly with both realism and optimism about repentance: \\"He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering. But that is the beginning of a new story - the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life.\\" (p505)As a novel, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is not entirely without weaknesses. The occasional blasphemy eg \\"Good God!\\" was surprising. The sentences are sometimes broken, and the flow of the English translation is at times unnatural and difficult to read. Dostoevsky's dialogue is frequently verbose, the lengthy soliloquys unrealistic and tiring. The Russian names are also difficult to keep track of, particularly because characters are at times referred to using different names (to keep your Petrovna's and Petrovitch's apart, consider keeping a character list handy while reading). But these difficulties are in part a result of the inevitable distance that arises from cultural and language differences. In the final analysis this book is not easy to read merely because of its weaknesses but because of its brilliance. Despite the heavy going, it's no \`punishment' to read this book, but rather a \`crime' not to. \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a brilliant psychological and religious study of human depravity, giving you an opportunity to discover something more about your own corruption, as well as its only cure."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The greatest novel of all time was written over a hundred years ago in Russia, by a man few would probably want to spend more than five minutes in the local with. The novel is very, very long, often goes round in circles seemingly nowhere and is infused with a deep religious code that betrays our current vogue for post christian, post socialst malaise. The basic jist of the story is familiar to anybody with a penchant for the t.v series 'Cracker' or the odd Sherlock Holmes novel. So why I hear you cry is it consistently lauded as the greatest story ever told? Simple really, when (and it really is only a matter of when) you read this book to the final page you will never the see the world again through the same eyes. For anybody wishing to foist another piece of literature on us the unsuspecting public, read this book first and then think..... Could you really explain the world we live in any better? Would you not just be repeating something that has already been written? Something with a far greater understanding, deeper compassion? Writing that not only tells us about man's eternal conflict with himself and his brothers, but through beautifully honest prose teaches us that this conflict is actually what makes man seperate from other beings.

Second of all, it's not really fair for me to review this book since others were much more concise than i, but i will give it a shot and tell you what i feel about the book (after all, that's what a review is for).Ok, the subject of this book is: how a intelligent man plot a crime, execute a crime and how he will pay. It's actually a brilliant study of a crime, it's so intriguing and heart pumping. The mood is so dark and sad, i felt traped by the acts of the protagonist, a claustrophobic sensation. The characters were so belivable that i couldn't question their acts and thougts as real. The evolving relations between the characters, their psicological description, the constant tension and, above all, the mental changes that went through the protagonist mind kept me reading this book non-stop.All in all, this is a masterfull piece of work, worth the time reading (and re-reading) and worth the space in the bookshelf. My only advice: buy it !PS: i percieved some sort of religious message behind all the plot (not that big a deal), but of course i might be quite mad..."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Rodion is an intellectual, and aware of it.

Can a single, drastic act change it all? Are we morally obliged to do it, if it's in our hands? And then, why do we suffer, if we did the right thing?

Raskolnikov, who is only 24 when the novel begins, cannot live as he wants to, so he is left to his own thoughts, to unhealthy and endless brooding. He begins to yearn for blood and rationalizes his primordial anger and hatred as some sort of premonition of greatness. And the means to achieving greatness are not alwasy good--after all, did Napoleon lose much sleep over the people who fell victim to his military campaigns? Raskolnikov decides to start with a robbery, but when things do not go according to plan, he commits two murders. In the end, his conscience turns against him, so that he hasn't a moment of peace. He cannot function normally because of his guilt and feels the need, well, almost the right... to be punished.The novel is a gripping look at a moral catastrophe and all its reprecussions, including guilt and punishment. This is a classic. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I thought that Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment was a great book. It was suspenseful, captivating, and well-written. The characters seemed very real and life-like. It was very graphic and detailed, describing even to the last of the feelings of Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov before, during, and after the murder. The details of the scenes of the murder, the police station, and the trampling of Marmeladov were very explicit and well-written. The only bad points of the book are the use of Old English spelling and grammar, and that the story is sometimes hard to follow. The book has excellent detail and was captivating and full of suspense. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to tackle the 493 pages. Overall, it was a good book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"&quot;So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that meets them on the way.&quot; This one quote is in essence Raskolnikov. From his first murderous thought, he plows into a downward spiral of insanity until his own will fails and his psyche is split wide and left for the proverbial vultures to chew and devour apart. This book escalates from nothing into a double-murder, then back down to the farthest corner of a mind's guilt-consuming reality."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In response to the other reviews (my rating states my opinion of the novel itself eloquently enough): You're all wrong!! Well, you are. Put some more thought into this.

The &quot;criminal,&quot; the &quot;murderer&quot; (these words connote so much, I'd hesitate to use them without quotes, at least here . . .), makes one mistake - but it's not the murder. And if you're reading this on an even more elementary level (and thinking it's about how &quot;murder is wrong&quot;, well, go watch some T.V.), then you're probably not reading it at all . . .

It's intoxicating, entertaining, detailed, big, psychologically complex, thoughtful, aesthetically rich, dramatically appealing, and thoroughly rewarding. Personally, I don't ingest it as a morality tale in the slightest; and any morally-oriented preaching that *is* there can be dismissed easily enough.

We laughed our asses off, especially during the scene in the tavern with Marmaladev. (there's also a very funny comic book edition of the book, which reads like one extended non sequitor. example quote: the police inspector tells Raskolnikov, \\"I know you killed that little old woman and her daughter, but I trust you, and know you'll do the right thing.\\" look for this edition in your finer bookstores)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Not all classics are created equal and call me crazy but I hardly consider Dostoevsky altogether an author, much less one of the prestigious classical breed! I do love Tolstoy so this is not a case of not understanding Russian authors. I also love the classics. I just didn't like Dostoevsky AT ALL!And yes I did finish it and I would like to share why I despised it so much.The plot - a young student murdering an old, unpleasant pawn-broker and having to deal with the psychological aftermath - could have been promising, if not for the story telling, the writing style, the character depiction. In short, if not written by Dostoevsky.The author then goes into these monstrous proportions of expressing everything in the characters' minds without relating any one thing to another or tying any of it to the overall plot in even a remotely tangible way. He - the author - is nearly as disturbed and as much on the verge of insanity as his protagonist, Rascolnikov, and while it may sound fascinating, it does not bode well for story-telling of any kind. He subjects us to every unfinished thought, every draft of an idea, every whim and notion, every passing fancy, fantasy and delusion in Rascolnikov's head and yet does not allow us to arrive at any possible sensible conclusion. Following either a conversation or a monologue anywhere in the book is akin to going on a winding roller coaster ride without the remotest thrill - and repeating that cycle a few hundred times until the last page of the book.It is this miserable style of Dostoevsky's story telling which numbed my interest and robbed me of any compassion toward any character whatsoever, for how could an author inspire our compassion or interest when he insists on not telling the story and on not communicating with the reader and instead on leading us on a path which ends in utter incoherence and confusion?\\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a meaningless, maddening maze with no point, no beginning and no end, no purpose, no plot and especially, no prose and no, I do not recommend it at all."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have failed to see what so many people see in this book.

This book talked about how a criminal goes about committing crimes and what they think when they are planning a crime.

It was too long and too much extra info that we didn't need to know just for the sake of using up words, most of the descriptions were unnecessary."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dosotoevsky wrote an exceptionally dull and unbelievably boring book here.

So that I won't even try to deny. I mean, after he killed the two ladies I felt guilty!! As well written as this book is, it is demented, and the things that he says and feels(especially the things that are true)should tourcher any sane person down to their very soul. There are people like this man in the world, of that I have no doubt, but through their pains, sufferings, and guilty consience, things will not be alright, and this is something that should not even be suggested to the weak and fickle minds of today. (Post Scriptum, sorry for any spelling mistakes, I can read well, but spelling, that's a different subject.)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"No matter how many good points there are to this novel I can't shake the feeling of disappointment I have after completing it. It started off brightly, piquing my interest with the story of a young man (Raskalnikoff) contemplating murder for reasons that are not initially made clear. The murder occurs and Dostoevsky then spends the next 300 pages dragging the (anti-climactic) conclusion out and telling me very little of interest in the process.Raskalnikoff's 'Great Man' theory was the only major concept which stoked my flames of thought. From a book entitled Crime and Punishment I expected to gain insights into the nature of crime and consequently punishment. However, I acquired no new understandings about the topic and was left wondering why this novel was so widely acclaimed, or was I just not 'getting' it? From a philosophical point of view there are so few nuggets to be plucked from the pages, especially considering the amount of time invested.This is not a bad novel by any means - there are positives. The novel is very well written with Dostoevsky skillfully painting a picture of the gloomy and miserable St Petersburg of the time, populated with diverse and intriguing characters. However, no matter how good the writing is it is content that counts and this is where the novel fell flat for me. I didn't get much out of the novel; others have; maybe you will - it's your call."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book should be written in one-third of its original size.

Dostoevskiy) could have such a gift. I think that nobody will match such writing for another hundred years."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Critiqued independantly of other novels and evaluated on its own intrinsic merits, Crime and Punishment reveals itself to be a irrefutably excellent novel. Nevertheless, in comparison to other &quot;classics,&quot; it lacks vitality, vitiated by the author's interminable and relentless prose concerning mostly the internal psychoses of a protagonist non-representative of humanity in general. Far better 18th-century novels redolent with evocative imagery and possessing greater thematic depth deserve attention; namely, the Herman Melville's Moby Dick, Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. Melville immerses the reader into a philosophical epic; Dostoyevsky harasses the reader. Hawthorne envelopes the reader's senses in prose so sumptuous it borders on decadence; Dostoyevsky austerely moves along his plot. Wilde smirks sardonically at his hero; Dostoyevsky throws him in our face. To recapitulate, Fyodor has some excellent ideological intrigue within his work--though mostly only a reactive jerk against radical philosophies of his time. His flaw, I believe, lies in his inability to entice the reader into the story, keep him there, and finally send him on his merry way with the satisfaction of having undergone cleverly-wrought enlightenment. I warily entered the story, stayed due to my own inertia, and then finished on my apathetic way, having undergone stale enlightenment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is probably Dostoevsky's best novel. It is a murder story set in late 19th century St Petersburg, Russia.I just finished reading the book, and when I put it down I thought that it was one of the finest novels ever written. Many think it is long like Tolstoy's 1400 page \\"War and Peace,\\" but actually it is a quick read, and I read it in two evenings.The author accomplishes a lot with the novel. It is:- a compelling read, start to finish,- compact for the story, only 500 pages,- it has an excellent set of characters,- contains moral dilemmas,- has role reversals,- features universal themes,- contains excellent but not the world's best prose,- many resonances with the reader,- and it has good drama in spots.Overall, it is a very satisfying read.The Bloomsbury guide has a nice write up on C&P; and it suggests related reading. It did not rate it as a masterpiece: one of 40 books that it considers as masterpieces, selected from the top 375 fiction writers since 1800. There I disagree and think it must be among the best books of all time - based on literary merit.My suggestions for further or related reading would be:(1) Dostoevsky: Brothers Karamazov,(2) Tolstoy: War and Piece,(3) Kafka: The Castle, and(4) Gogol: Dead Souls.Interestingly, Bloomsbury Guide does not rate any of Dostoevsky's works as masterpieces, but it rates al of selections (2), (3), and (4) as masterpieces."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The novel is a very good one, and compared to the crap that passes as literature these days it is a classic, however, it is not a great piece of literature. The book has too many manifest flaws, such as being far too long, far too \`talky', and most of all, aside from the belief that it's a \`Christian tract', the biggest misread of the book is that it is somehow a work of \`social realism'. Nothing could be less true- it is primarily a work of symbolism. This is evident from its title, as the very punishment referred to is not that of the legal variety, but that of internal guilt. Yes, when it was first published, in pre-Freudian 1866, it may have seemed a work of psychological depth, but even compared to the fiction of Anton Chekhov, just a few decades later, it is utterly Neolithic in its approach to the human psyche....If Dostoevsky's novel can be considered great, by some, it is not because of the things he intended within it that manifest its greatness, but that which was unwitting, and beyond him at the time, such as the real key to understanding the work, its great insight, that people do not change at a fundamental level. I was recently watching the Up documentary film series, by Michael Apted, on DVD, and those films are premised on the very notion that Crime And Punishment is, the Jesuit saying of \`Give me the child till he is seven, and I shall give you the man.' We do not glimpse Raskolnikov at seven, but given what we know becomes of him it is not difficult to extrapolate that he was as amoral then as his twentysomething self appears in the book. If Dostoevsky intended this work to be an allegory on Christianity's redemptive power he clearly failed, so I posit that that was not his intent at all, and that the psychological and ethical stasis of most human beings was his major theme.Regardless, the book is not a great piece of art. It contains great moments, some brilliant writing, and is a very good work of art, however primitive, but it is certainly not great. A modern reader can simply not ignore all its manifest flaws, such as the awkward and heavy-handed symbolism, the stilted and unrealistic dialogue, which reinforces the truth of the characters' symbolism, as it veers between mawkishness during some of the death scenes and Raskolnikov's several confession scenes, and preachiness in many of the philosophical engagements.Another problem with the work, one not in the actual work, but in its willful misinterpretation by critics with axes to grind, is that, aside from the confusion over the literary value of the work, all the poor theories regarding psychology and the fundaments of criminality have somehow found their way into pop culture, and done much to lead people astray in their ideas of true good and evil. Yet, the many fundamental questions that Raskolnikov deals with are never directly addressed, and are only used as a flawed premise for the main action of the novel to go off on. Raskolnikov ponders why those who have power or mass murder in war are labeled heroes, gain fame and respect, have paeans and monuments made for them while the low born, who have to struggle with and against each other, are jailed if they kill. In Part Five, Chapter Four, he rationalizes not confessing to the murders by using this defense: \`What wrong have I done them? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That's only a phantom....They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them. And what should I say to them- that I murdered her, but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone?' he added with a bitter smile. \`Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting it. A coward and a fool! They wouldn't understand and they don't deserve to understand. Why should I go to them?' This is a philosophically legitimate point, yet, instead of plumbing this, and applying it to the social caste he exists within, Raskolnikov flies off into mere pop sociological dementia with his ideas on supermen and exceptionalism, never realizing that exceptionalism in one or two fields, no matter how exceeding, brilliant, nor gifted, does not imply any sort of reciprocal ethical exceptionalism.Yet, throughout the book, despite moments of brilliance, whenever Dostoevsky gets too close to the core, the nub of what the book is really about, he backs away. Whether because he lacked the answer or lacked the desire to deal with its clash with his own belief systems I do not know. But it is a flaw, and one that results in banal and bland sermonizing, such as that which ends the book in a very trite Hollywood film fashion:He did not know that the new life would not be given him for nothing, that he would have to pay dearly for it, that it would cost him great striving, great suffering.But that is the beginning of a new story- the story of the gradual renewal of a man, the story of his gradual regeneration, of his passing from one world into another, of his initiation into a new unknown life. That might be the subject of a new story, but our present story is ended.To end, Crime And Punishment is certainly a milestone work in the development of both Dostoevsky and the art of the novel, but a work's cultural or artistic import is not equivalent to its artistic excellence. Therefore, while it may be a great representation of its time, artistically and culturally, it is not a great book- neither as a social tract nor as a novel. It reads more like a mid-stage version of better models to come, which is exactly what it really is. The very fact that such gross misreadings of it has taken root is a testament to the laziness of most readers, and the unwillingness of most to think for themselves. It is this problem with readers, their own anomic stasis, writ into the larger society, that Dostoevsky actually deals with. Raskolnikov, however, still smiles."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This was the 2nd book by Dostoevsky that I've read, well, kind of. About a year ago I started reading The Idiot, but I found that pretty boring and didn't even finish it, but it was a very different case with Crime and Punishment. This book tells the story of a man named Raskolinov who decides to kill an old pawnbroker, justifying his actions by reasoning that the death of this miserable old woman will be better for society. Anyway, it's pretty interesting seeing how the main character behaves throughout the book. Besides the main character, there is an interesting supporting cast such as his friend, his mother and sister, and a family he helps which includes a prostitute he befriends. There are subplots concerning these characters which are interesting and in other novels these subplots would maybe be distracting and bog the novel down, but I think they're pretty interesting in Crime and Punishment and if it weren't for them, the book would be a lot shorter. Also, Dostoevsky does a good job bringing life to every character. I found it pretty easy to distinguish each character and I had a vivid image of what they're like. In reading this book, it wouldn't hurt to know something about Russian ideas and such in the 19th century, but I certainly wouldn't say it's necessary. Reading the novel, despite Raskolinov's plot of murder, I found that I couldn't help liking the character and wanting things to work out for him. For the most part, he seemed like an educated and caring man. I think this novel provides an interesting look into the way in which one's conscience can practically drive a person mad, as it often does with the main character. Although the character is about Russian people in Russia, I don't think that made the story any less interesting as the theme of the novel had much more to do with human nature and little to do with the fact that the characters are Russian. I think most people will find characters and feelings in this book that they can relate to. Overall, I think this book is worth the read. I'm glad I read it and I think it's a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I expected this book to be an incredible read, a mind-altering study of guilt and conscience and other philosophical issues.

The content was no more intelligent and thought-provoking than an episode of &quot;Friends.&quot; And the actual structure of the writing read like a second-grader's short story for English class. Maybe it was just the translation, but it was horrible. How many times did I see the combination of letters: &quot;Aach&quot;? That's not a word in English. Nor is it even a common expression.

It's strange how one is occasionally drawn back to certain classics for a re-reading.\\"Crime and Punishment\\" details the mis-deeds of one Rodian Raskolinikov who is a poor and impoverished student in nineteenth century St. Petersburg. He dreams up the idea of murdering the local pawnbroker and collecting her money. This he does but as part of the process, the pawnbroker's sister stumbles across the crime and she too is murdered. This portion of the book is quite compelling. Dostoyevsky conveys the drama brilliantly. The scene sets the pulse racing as Raskolnikov succeeds in getting away with the crime. Indeed, this section is very good crime writing by any measure.Of course, as time proceeds, Raskolnikov's crime is gradually revealed. He has bizarre dreams of being like a latter day Napoleon:\\"to whom all is permitted, sacks Toulon, makes a slaughterhouse of Paris, forgets an army in Egypt, expends half a million men in a Moscow campaign, and gets off with a pun in Vilno; and when he dies they set up monuments to him - and thus everything is permitted\\"Such views are clearly delusional. Raskolnikov is no Napoleon. He is simply a grubby murderer. Society will not absolve him of responsibility.

I read somewhere that reading Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment faithfully re-creates Russian society of his era in the city from his own experiences. While this is no doubt true I found that the greatest appeal for me was the way the reader is taken on a psychological journey inside the mind of the main protagonist. Starting from the shock of the brutal murders he commits we are led through his vacillating self-justification, guilt, seeking love and redemption to the final resolution. I had forgotten how the novel ended exactly and so was kept interested to see how it would all turn out for Raskolnikov.

I only award it four stars because there is, presumably, a five-star novel out there existing in the minds of the Olympians. The only more perfect novel I can think of is Gustave Flabuert's \\"Madame Bovary.\\"Let me say this about my first reading of \\"Crime & Punishment.\\" It was my senior year of high school. My teacher, Harriet Balle of University City High School in San Diego, was largely a waste of time in terms of her ability to teach us anything useful about the book. Fortunately, she had the good taste to recognize Dostoevsky as a author worthy of teaching to 12th-graders.Upon starting the book at the time -- keep in mind I had read most of Shakespeare's plays, Graham Greene's \\"Power and the Glory,\\" as well as Solzhenitsyn's \\"The First Circle\\" -- I thought it an immense waste of time. In fact, I can honestly say that I read through the bulk of its 400 plus pages without batting much of an eye until the very end, when Raskolnikov, such a [..]through most of it, suddenly begs the forgiveness of Sonya, the prostitute.That's when I wanted to get down on the floor myself. It was quite unlike any other sensation I've ever experienced before or since, and no other art form has ever produced it in me. It was a \\"riding to Damascus\\" experience, and I, like St. Paul, had suddenly been knocked off my horse.Other Dostoevsky novels have almost, but not quite, replicated the sensation of shock that this one produced in me."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"As an avid reader of Dostoevsky, this book was that which inspired me to pursue him completely, this book is widely recognized as one of his two masterworks (the other being The Brothers Karamazov).

It was however written originally as a piece of propaganda. Its author was a political conservative who was concerned about the spread of Western ideas in Russia and how they could destroy society. It was a theme that he was to return to in some of his other novels notably the Devils. The book was written at a time when novels produced in Russia had to be supportive of the autocratic system and this was passed by a state board.The central theme is about a young student who decides to kill an older woman in his apartment block. The reason for the murder is not gain but rather to show that he is a person who is free and like a Napoleon. Dostoevsky also intended to write another novel called the drunkard at the same time. The plot of that novel involved a man who forces his daughter into prostitution because of his inability to control his urges. Instead of bringing them out as separate novels Dostoevsky intertwines the two stories and makes the young prostitute the means by which his main character can be redeemed.The book starts with the murder and follows the gradual realisation by the police of the identity of the murderer. Although the book started out as a simple expose of the way that western ideas could corrupt the youth of Russia it grew into something else. In part that was because of the development, some time after the novel was published, of philosophical systems which stressed a moralism of self actualisation. The sorts of systems of Nietchze and Kirkagaard. It is also a novel which tends to speak to young people. At least once in a young person's life they feel like the hero, wanting to do some act which defines them as superior to the common heard, to express their freedom or individuality. Ironically they identify with the hero who is meant to be an example of a person who is redeemed by rejecting the sorts of ideas which is the reason why people now read the book.Whilst the main attraction of the book is a message which was at variance with the reason it was written it is still a classic. Everyone has to read this as it is one of the most remarkable books written."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky was one of hemingway's favorite authors. That's interesting. One russian and another american. And i think some psychological perspectives of these two writers complement each other. This is a story about a man tormented with guilt. Hemingway himself expressed these same problems (even in his real life). So why does one reviewer refer to crime and punishment in the terms of blah, blah, boring, written in napkins, and then sends a book by John Steinbeck into the stratosphere?) I think that if you read Crime and Punishment you'll see why many americans think they are a little above everyone else. Our conscience doesn't always lead us where we want to go. Just like the hero in Dostoevsky's book. A good book seems to be always alive. But... what more can I say?... I recommend it to anyone who apreciates a masterpiece. Be it american or russian.

This was a great feat in mid 1800s Russia because the mind of Raskalnikov can be compared to that of many serial killers and gives us insight into what kinds of thaughts they share in common. Its unfortunate that the closeminded undereducated can not see many underlying meanings within the book that help develop Raskalnikov, and the complexity of the other characters. It takes intelligence, not action thrills and courtroom twists, like a certain author well leave nameless(Grisham).

Usually, I can at the very least quickly classify a book in the broad terms of \\"I liked it\\" or \\"I didn't like it.\\" Crime and Punishment doesn't really fit in this paradigm. I can't tell you if I liked it or not, because I don't know. In fact, it almost defies description at all. Nevertheless, I will say what I can about Dostoyevsky's novel.The basic plot centers on a young man named Raskolnikov who commits a double murder early on in the story. The rest of the book details the slow, agonizing punishment of that crime, which for him is an internal battle between his intellect, which says that he has done no wrong, and his conscience, which informs him that what he did was in fact very wrong. His internal strife slowly eats away at Raskolnikov to the point where he confesses his crime and is sent to Siberia for hard labor. While in Siberia, his suffering for his misdeeds reaches a climax, and as a result he finds redemption and is reanimated as a person. His soul is restored.The positive elements of the book are several: First, there are multiple scenes which evoked strong emotional reactions as I read. Dostoyevsky had an amazing ability to write viscerally. Second, the novel displays (accurately, in my view) the destructiveness of adhering to a false worldview. Raskolnikov came close to breaking down throughout the story, precisely because he could not reconcile his worldview with reality. Conversely, the author represents well the transformation or regeneration that occurs with true repentance--a lesson that will forever ring true.There are several negative elements of the book, though. As is typical with Russian literature, it is a heavy, long read. I personally could not say that I enjoyed reading it, but while hard, it was worthwhile. (Perhaps it is the literary equivalent to eating one's vegetables?) In addition, Dostoyevsky had several side stories that dealt with the current events of the day--events with which I was completely in the dark. I admit, this is probably more of a commentary on myself than the book, but since I am not in academia and have precious little time to read as it is, it makes little sense for me to study up on such details just to read a book.Overall, I am just not sure what to do with this book. It speaks to the reader on multiple levels and contains much that is good, but it was not particularly a \\"good read\\" in the sense that it was not a book I would recommend to curl up with next to a fire. Reading it was more like running a marathon without knowing where the finish line was. On balance, I am rating this book 3 stars, which I freely admit may reflect more on me than Dostoyevsky's classic work."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use!

All the same, there's a reason why Crime & Punishment is considered the quintessential Dostoevsky novel. Compared to The Brothers' Karamazov, which is as plot driven as it is character driven, C&P is much more character driven - delving deeper into the developing neurosis of Raskolnikov. Despite the fact that it is not plot driven, it's a very quick read compared to The Brothers' Karamazov and other works of fiction of comparative length (can easily throw down 100 pages or more of C&P in a day). My only complaint is the ending - the loose ends are tied up too abruptly, in a manner which suggests carelessness and a sense of \\"let's just get this over with\\" - in the second to last 40 or 50 pages not much happens, and then suddenly several months are condensed into a few pages for the epilogue. It was a bit perturbing considering Dostoevsky invested several hundred pages into the rest of the book, he might have taken more care to address the conclusion. Other than that, it's a super-classic, quite unlike any other work of fiction."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a wonderful book and a must read for anyone who is a fan of classic literature."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I love rereading this and as a free e-book it was totally worth it.

(Boutght two versions, not sure which version I am reviewing here, as the image associated with it does not match either of the paperbacks that I bought.)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I know some literary historians like to consider the modern, realistic novel as having emerged with like, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and some want to credit even earlier writers like Cervantes, or later writers such as James Joyce, but for me, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is the first novel that truly FEELS modern, and reads modern, and considering that the story was first published in 1866, Dostoevski was 50 years ahead of Dashiell Hammett, and although he followed Edgar Allen Poe by more than a decade, it is difficult not to see his influence on so many writers and even film makers that came later--this has to be regarded as a singular, seminal work. It's the story of an axe murderer who commits a double homicide in cold blood, for crying out loud!And yet, I don't know how Dostoevski does it, but Raskolnikov never really becomes an unsympathetic character. Maybe because his description of the old pawn broker was so loathsome, and yet, the reader is closely identified with Raskolnikov's point of view in the preparations leading up to the fateful events, in the brutal murders themselves, in the feverish aftermath, and all the way up to his final confession. The characters are complex. Raskolnikov is complex. The investigator, Porfiry, is complex (he was after all the model for the detective Columbo). In fact, the story is populated with complex characters who are a mixture of black and white, strengths and weaknesses, that contributes to the absolute realism.How it came to be is a mystery of nature, but Dostoevski's psychological insights are nothing short of breathtaking. And, although the rationalization is obvious, the point that Raskolnikov makes about the difference between the great leaders who murder in the thousands during wars and revolutions, vs the man who kills once or twice but with the same goal of improving the existential conditions of humankind--because he simply must survive and may yet live to make an important contribution if he does--well, I don't remember seeing this argument made anywhere in literature before this point-- and it is obviously an issue that Doesoevski himself must have wrestled with intimately. His father was, after all murdered by peasants, and at one point in his life, because of his political activities, he was confronted with the certainty that he would be shot by a firing squad in the morning--and how that much anticipated night must have stretched out before him, and concentrated his mind most wonderfully. Of course, at the last moment, orders from the Czar arrived to commute his sentence to exile in a Siberian labor camp--but he spent the next 4 years working with men who were there not because of political agitation, but for murders and assaults and crimes of brutality. He isn't trying to coax us onto the slippery path of moral relativity, but he wants us to think long and hard about the nature of the Law vs the nature of what is right vs the nature of what is permissible and even acceptable. I mean, look around at the various instances of mass genocide, and draw the observation of who has been indicted for war crimes, and who has not. He also wants us to think about whether or not a punishment fits the crime--whether it settles the debt--if that is what a crime is--a debt that is owed to 'society'. Is that what a crime is--or is it something more transcendental, a 'disturbance' in the force that must be rectified at the Cosmic scale. For, if that is the case, then what is the debt owed to society from the commission of crimes without a victim? How does the victimless 'crime' disturb the Harmony of the Universe? Does the punishment restore the scales of Justice? What IS a crime? Is the sacrifice of the lamb upon the alter a crime? Aggression in combat on the battlefield we justify as self defense? But what about computer programs operating drone aircraft and launching missiles whenever the target acquisition algorithm is activated by a truth table? Or rapacious Corporate Piracy in the form of a hostile takeover? Misleading and deceiving the public through false claims? Well, certainly a crime is defined by law--but how many actions are simply wrong that are not criminal--for which there is no systematic institutional punishment? And in those cases, is there any form of guilt? Is there to be no form of punishment?This is a profoundly thought provoking novel, and it is as much of a thriller as it is a work of profound philosophical speculation. Given the weight of the issues that it raised and thrust into the light of contemplation, there isn't a moment of dryness, or pedantry or sophistry--in fact, as both a social commentary and a detective story, it is relentless. The atmosphere of personal psychological terror with no exit anticipates Kafka by several decades, and is laced with notions common to Kierkegaard. I can only presume that Dostoevski must have been familiar with \\"Fear and Trembling\\" -- the similarity of themes is too much of a coincidence. Kierkegaard's title is a reference to a line from Philippians 2:12, \\"...continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.\\" Which of course, is exactly what Raskolnikov does. In the case of Kierkegaard, he wanted to understand the anxiety that must have been felt by Abraham when \\"God tested and said to him, take Isaac, your only son, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him as a burnt offering on the mountain that I shall show you.\\" Of course, in the case of Raskolnikov, he was never commanded in a Divine encounter to sacrifice the old pawn broker and her pathetic sister, and no Agent arrived in the nick of time to stay his hand--but there is something in the nature of this sort of crime that won't lay down and be silent, at least not to one who is no psychopath. And Raskolnikov may have been arrogant and desperate, but he was no true psychopath--and the torment that he feels is so unrelentingly obvious that it is inevitable that he must confess and accept his punishment. And so, we are left with the final question--here is a crime, here is the acceptance of guilt, and here is the punishment. Was justice done? Were the scales restored to balance? And yet, within a society of supposed civilized institutions--is there any real alternative?There is one more issue that Dostoevski wrestles with throughout this story--and that is the subject of mercy vs persecution, of kindness vs cruelty, and he shares insight about the nature of empathy, of warm feelings and trust vs the lack of feeling that can ignore a dying man, or drive a small child into the cold and damp, or beat a poor horse to death in the street, or trap a young woman and torment her pitilessly--or even take an axe to an old woman who is pleading for her life. In each of these situations he is asking the same question over and over, and again and again, seems to be making the case for mercy, whose quality is never strained, and drops as the gentle rain from heaven on the place beneath, twice blessed, both to the giver and the taker. It is the mightiest, and becomes the throned monarch better than his crown...therefore, though Justice be your plea, consider this--\\"that in the course of Justice, NONE of us should see Salvation...we do pray for Mercy, and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of Mercy.\\" (as Billy the Bard put it)When Dostoevsky faced the firing squad, was he thinking of Mercy? Was he praying for mercy as they tied the blindfold over his eyes? How did it feel when he heard the gunshots, then, after reflection felt no stabbing pains, and moments later, had his blindfold removed, only to hear the words Siberia for you--in that moment did he come to know the particular quality of Mercy?Because, in the final analysis, ultimately: Grace trumps Karma."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The fact that he wrote this on one attempt with so few grammar and spelling erros is amazing.

This is a lesson on how to write about describing emotion and body language, to tell a story."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Without a doubt, the best book I've ever read is \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. That probably has a lot to do with the fact that I myself am being punished for a crime, or maybe I would have liked it anyway, because, after all, it is considered one of the greatest works of literature.Dostoyevsky's life itself makes a great story. He was imprisoned in 1849 for participating in a French utopian socialist group. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted only after he stood before the firing squad in a mock execution. Talk about a game-changer.\\"Crime and Punishment\\" tells the story of Raskolnikov, a young university student who comes up with a theory that men are divided into two categories: ordinary and extraordinary. The latter, Napoleon for example, have the right to transgress the law in any way to achieve their objectives. And so Raskolnikov believed he could commit one vile act - rob and murder an old pawnbroker - in order to obtain the money he needed to begin his mission and prove that he was extraordinary.But things didn't work out as planned. His conscience drives him to madness before he can prove his theory. Dostoyevsky paints the picture of a man who will give his last farthing to someone suffering and in need, and yet is still capable of committing the most loathsome criminal act - all for the sake of a theory.I found myself hoping he could get away with it, and of course, I questioned whether that was because of some moral flaw in my part. But in the end, I saw that the only way out for Raskolnikov was to confess and accept his suffering.I think this passage where Porfiry urges Raskolnikov to confess best conveys the essence of the book: \\"You made up a theory and then were ashamed that it broke down and turned out to be not at all original! It turned out something base, that's true, but you are not hopelessly base. By no means so base! At least you didn't deceive yourself for long, you went straight to the furthest point in one bound.How do I regard you? I regard you as one of those men who would stand and smile at their torturer while he cuts their entrails out, if only they have found faith in God. Find it and you will live. You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too, is a good thing. Suffer!...I know you don't believe in it - but don't be over-wise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don't be afraid - the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again.\\"In life, suffering is unavoidable and inevitable. The sooner we accept it, the sooner we can fling ourselves into life and the sooner we can be free...even in prison.Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book was well writen.

It turned out to be a brilliant treatise into the mind of anapparent psychopath, but may just be any one of us who decides to play God. The characters are brought to life wonderfully by Dostoevsky and their personalities will be recognizable to you. The entangling of the main character's justification for his crime with the psychological drama of his daily life and of those around him, will draw you in and having you asking big questions of your own conscience. The story was written during pre-communist Russia. This provides a great addition to the storyline - a time and place of transition of a historically Christian society into the post-modern world where God is an abstract crutch or doesn't exist at all.

I'd recommend it to people who love to read, not really for the novice reader."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If I were to give this novel a grade, it would be a C. It was very long and drawn out and did not give any realistic views of life. Dostoevsky should have rewrote this one or gotten someone to edit it. I personally don't understand why people write such drawn out works."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is the story of a poor man in czarist Russia who can only purge himself of his guilt through suffering. It deals with the mental and physical tribulation brought upon him by his crime. His troubles are compounded by the conflicting personalities which he possesses.The central conflict in Crime and Punishment stems from Raskolnikov's crime of murder and his struggles with his conscience over whether or not he should confess to the police. Atone level, therefore, it is a kind of detective story where the police seek the criminal, and he evades arrest until the last pages of the novel.On a deeper level, the conflict springs from Raskolnikov's exaggerated theories of \\"the extraordinary man\\" and how such western ideas are opposed to the Slavophile concepts indigenous to Russia. The novel also highlights the eternal conflict between theforces of good and those of evil.Raskolnikov, the protagonist of Dostoevsky's novel, is a handsome and brilliant law student who holds firm but unusual views. He believes that certain superior people in a society standabove the ordinary human and moral laws. To test his thesis, he murders an old woman that is a greedy moneylender. He feels her death is no great loss to society because she preys upon the misery and poverty of her fellow humans.After the deed, he is seized by alternate moods of great cunning with which he tries to outwit the police and moments of nagging guilt when he resolves to confess his crime. Through this fascinating study of a criminal's conscience.On the surface level, the antagonist is apparently the police force of St. Petersburg, especially Porfiry Petrovitch, who investigates the murders that Raskolnikov has committed. All through the novel, the murderer attempts to evade arrest and to mislead the police. However, on a deeper level, the very order of autocratic society in Tsarist Russia seems to be the antagonist against whom Raskolnikov is pitted. He theorizes that vicious, predatory humans like the pawnbroker are evil and deserve to be eliminated in a society that permits such vile people to prosper.Raskolnikov also believes that some \\"extraordinary\\" humans like himself have the right to transgress and oppose ordinary social laws in order to create a new and more just social order. At another level, ironically, Raskolnikov himself may also be looked upon as the antagonist of conventional society and its unjust system.Throughout the novel, Raskolnikov toys with the idea of confessing his guilt. However, he never manages to do so. He brings himself to reveal to Sonia that it was he who murdered the moneylender and her half-sister, Lizaveta. Although she is deeply shocked by his terrible revelation, Sonia promises to share in Raskolnikov's future sufferings and punishment in a Siberian prison camp.The apparent theme of the novel is that of planning and executing the perfect crime, as well as the subsequent suffering on the part of the criminal and his obsessive need to confess. Only the first part of the novel deals with the careful planning that precedes the crime. The other five parts are concerned with Raskolnikov's intermittent moments of remorse and his overwhelming desire to confess and to rid himself of the guilt. However, he is unable to do so until the end of the novel. The act of murder and its effects on the mind of the killer form the central subject of Dostoevsky'sCrime and Punishment.Linked closely to this cycle of crime and confession is the motif of all-encompassing fear. This fear reduces Raskolnikov to a quivering mass of indecision, subject to spells of illness, emotionaloutbursts of anger and horrible nightmares. The crime and its long-term effects on Raskolnikov's behavior and peace of mind become the very punishment itself. Only in Siberia does he overcome the fear and begin the difficult process of social rehabilitation and moral regeneration.One of the important minor themes of this novel is that of the emotional estrangement and social isolation suffered by Raskolnikov, especially after he turns into a criminal. He feels terribly lonely and utterly devastated by his inability to turn to anyone after the double murder. He feels some sympathy for the unfortunate Marmeladov, who dies in a street accident and for the woman who attempts suicide in the River Neva. Sonia's patience and profound understanding finally help him to bring himself to confess his crime and ultimately to reintegrate into ordinary humansociety.To reinforce the theme of isolation and alienation, Dostoevsky makes Raskolnikov often think of \\"the square yard of space\\" to which his crime has confined him. In addition, the novelist frequently introduces the motif of \\"fresh air\\" as a cure for the criminal's isolation and intermittent periods of sickness.Raskolinikov justified his act as follows. Napolean attracted him tremendously, that is, what affected him was that a great many men of genius have not hesitated at wrong doing, but have over stepped the law without thinking about it. He seems to have fancied that he was a genius too-that is he was convinced of it for a time. According to him he has suffered a great deal and is still suffering from the idea that he could make a theory, but was incapable of overstepping the law, and so he is not a man of genius. And that was more humiliating for him a young man with pride than a murder he had committed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky has written a story that deeply analyzes the human psyche. Learn what is going through the mind of a murderer who later regrets his vice. Walk with him as his conscience tortures him to mental breakdown. Know what he feels and what he thinks. Learn how his mind ignored murder laws, morals, and ethics until after he has committed the murder. In the end, you will rejoice with him as he chooses to do penance for his evils.Dostoevsky has ingeniously constructed a tale that strongly reels his readers in. As readers, we easily become one with Dostoevsky's hero. Although murderers are hated in just about every culture, Dostoevsky has presented to us a murderer that invokes our sympathy.This is a masterpiece that all advanced societies will one day highly regard. Once a Russian classic, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is now a literary treasure.If you want to read another book with a writing style that is similar to this one, I recommend &quot;Lolita&quot; by Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'll start off with some criticism, however, though it doesn't pertain to the actual story itself. I don't like how in 19th century novels authors frequently like to have one character babble for pages upon pages. Dickens is infamous for it, and though there isn't that much of this in Dostoevsky's work (at least in this book) I find it boring when he does partake in this awful style of writing. If it wasn't for the great amount of respect I have for this novel, I would have given it 4 stars as a result. C&amp;P is a deep and philosophical work of literature. Raskolnikov, the centre of the tale, is a striking figure by all accounts, and one of the most extraordinary and complex persons I have ever been introduced to in any novel. He's still debated to this day -- and people continue to write more and more essays centring on his personality and actions. Let's just say there's a lot to say about Rodion Raskolnikov, and the author allows the reader to largely discover him for themselves, rather than to merely tell us what he's like. The whole book can be discussed at great length. As I said, it is very philosophical, and it seems to centre around the concept of nihilism. Raskolnikov has his own ideas, no doubt influenced by the nihilistic tendencies of the 19th century Russian intelligentsia, and these beliefs that he formulated were what compelled him towards a bloody murder near the beginning of the book. From there we are catapulted into a dark and serious psychological thriller (as it is commonly called), where we are forced to explore the psyche of this man against the backdrop of a dreary, dark and depressing St. Petersburg. This is a book to think about. I have my own ideas, of course, just like everybody has. Everyone is free to interpret what Dostoevsky is trying to get across, and to agree or disagree wit him. Read it with care. (I still don't know what Svidraigalov's dreams symbolize.)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a mal-shaped book structurally. Raskolnikov suggests to the lawman about mid-way through this long book that he is the killer...and then the book still has hundreds of pages to go! The second half seemed to me a lot of filler. I think THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV a masterpiece, and it is also about a murder. But CRIME AND PUNISHMENT doesn't deserved its classic status. And Nabokov detested Dostoevsky, because he didn't like the idea of characters coming to spiritual awakening through horrendous acts. And, while I think Dostoevsky was a better writer than Nabokov thought he was, that's one of the problems I had with this book: In the end you're supposed to feel uplifted by Raskolnikov's &quot;awakening,&quot; but all I could think was, &quot;But the guy murdered two women! He should be drowned in the river he is standing near!&quot;"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Is it just me, or does it seem that almost everyone who gave this book a really bad review posted with horrible misspellings? I mean what the hell does psuedo intelectual mean? Tourcher instead of torture? Man, get a clue before you criticize. I think some of you people need to go back to Tom Sawyer and start over before you try to hit the heavy stuff."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This great book is free for your kindle, so why not get it? This was the first book by Dostoevesky I ever read, and it got me hooked on his writing, I bet it will do the same to you. The kindle formatting was fine for me, and it was free. There is not much more I can say about this great purchase, only that I highly recomend it. And it is free, so you cant really really regret getting it.Did I mention it's free?"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I simply love this novel by Dostoyevsky! Not only is it a literary masterpiece, but it proposes many philosophical questions as well. For example, the main character (Raskolnikov) speaks about a very interesting idea, the everyman - superman theory. This is an idea that there are two sets of people in the world: the everyman and the superman. The everyman is the ordinary person who lives by all laws that society establishes and they must conform to all circumstances. There are however the supermen, the people who are born in very few numbers, maybe one in a few million, and they are above all laws. The supermen are those that are immune to any restrictions and can even kill people and break the most fundamental laws of society in order to accomplish their goals. They not only have the ability to do so but they have the desire to do so. They also have a need to become better than other people. Raskolnikov uses the example of Isaac Newton and how his accomplishments were so important that it would have been acceptable (in his opinion) if Newton killed tens or even hundreds of people so long as he came to his discoveries.Raskolnikov then gives his opinions on where he stands according to this idea but I won't give that away, that would ruin the novel. I definitely think this is a must read for anyone who has some free time on their hands or someone who wants to tackle a philosophical challenge. It gets five stars from me and you should give it a shot too."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'm a new fan of Russian Literature. For about five years I have owned Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, Anna Karenina, War and Peace and Doctor Zhivago. They looked good on the shelves and I joked to my friends that someday I would set down Dickens, Steinbeck and Dumas and read one of these Russian classics. Thankfully that time arrived and Crime and Punishment did not let me down. The pace is a little slower with less action and more introspective thought, but once I got used to the rhythm I was so drawn in that I couldn't stop. The characters were so colorful and three dimensional, not to mention the storyline itself, which really makes you think about the fine line between thinking about committing a crime and taking action. I'm ready for Nabokov and Tolstoy. It's always awesome to find a new source of pleasureable reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment was certainly not my favorite book--there are quite a few that would have that place above it. However, it is, without a doubt, the best book I've ever read. No other book is quite capable of taking a person with a desire (albeit one that was bound to be frustrated) for greatness coupled with an envy for the great figures of history and making them instead happy to live a mediocre life. I'd hesitate to call it a thriller, but it was certainly difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'd strongly recommend Garnett's version. This is far more intuitive than previous version -- with particular attention to the emotional undertone rather then a literal translation."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a story that causes one to think and to ponder even further the complicated yet simple ideas that it offers us, the readers.It's about an Ex-student who's driven to end two lives to ameliorate his own destitute living conditions. Throughout the book, Dostoevsky Transports the reader deep into &quot;Rodja's&quot; mind, in justifying his actions. What's great about this book is the detailed and personal development of all the characters, especially Raskolnikov who in the end does what's right. Read it for yourselves, It's definitely worth is and it's very challenging because it raises up many many questions. One warning is that the book has a very dark and pessimistic view of human nature. I would like to personally think that mankind is far better than what's described in the book, but hey!, knock on wood, sometimes i wake to a reality I would rather ignore, and this book exposed me to how cold and cruel the world we inhabit can be."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment offers the best of Dostoevsky'spre-existential existentialism, but is mired ...(by) its length and unnecessary details. Raskolnikoff's character is portrayed in the best literary tradition, as are his arguable polar sides, Sonia and Svidrigailoff. This Wordsworth version, however, is not very well put together. There is one partition that only contains one chapter. Names are spelled differently than any version my classmates read. Choose another version if you purchase this work. Thought-provoking, but slow and plodding."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"People don't write books like this anymore. Books that take evil seriously and observe the evil-doer clearly, without ghettoizing him as either a martyr or a demon or transforming the harsher elements into dark comedy. This is the depraved human soul laid bare.It's long, its serious and there's no redemption at the end. It's one of the true greats, better than the Brother's K in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A complete Crime of murder: punishment by the consumption of the guilty man to the point of confession.

The story line is so complex, and the book is do descriptivly written, I couldn't put it down. Although the Russian names were hard to keep up with, it was a great book!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I am a high school senior reading this book for my English class. Naturally, I was intimidated before approaching this world-renowned novel. It was fascinating to read about how Raskolnikov's double dilemma is worked out in terms of inwardness. The interior battle is essentially between reason as an instrument of the go's desire for power and glory, and the heart's sorrow for others. The revelation that comes to Raskolnikov through love and humility &quot;in prison, in freedom,&quot; is inevitable becase it is the obverse side, the pro, of the will-to-suffering, the contra, that has been throughout the entire novel his primary motivation. I would really like to thank Mr. Maurice Beebe and Mr. Ralph Harper in helping me to grasp as much of this outsanding novel as possible."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I went into this with an open mind. I had heard of the author, of course, but never expected to read anything of his. Someone left a copy lying around. I grabbed it to have something to read while I soaked in a hot bath. The bath turned cold and I was still reading.I'm not sophisticated enough to expound on the deeper meaning or the underlying philosophy. For me the book was simply a highly entertaining read. I couldn't put it down, as they say. I didn't want it to finish. The author created a world in which you could fully \\"immerse\\" yourself. Good reading for the bath."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I feel Alex Jennings is a very good reader. He often imitates the characters he reads as though he were several different people. This helps to imagine the personalities of the characters, lowers the general boredom of listening to an audio book, and creates much immersion. Jennings, with his slight English accent, is crystal clear in his voice. He sounds above the academic and more an intellectual--an aristocrat--who carries the story, and there is no problem in the immersion. He is interesting and perfectly-paced. He reads the text rather happily, without any drone-type sound. He reads delightfully, as though he likes the text and is willing to play the parts.I'm happy with the reader and the audio book. I should add, I have very little experience with audio books. But, Dostoevsky's book is an academic and intellectual classic, and the reading is good, very good."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Every successful writer, at the bottom of their hearts, is a scoundrel, for they capture our hearts with tricks. In Crime and Punishment, the wonderful tactic is carried out in such an unsuspected fashion. For example, if one is to very carefully examine the characters of Sonia, Dounia and Razumihin. One would find almost none of these saintly figures in our real universe. Just think, in this real life, how many girls like Sonia would not be corrupted spiritually? How many very-handsome girls like Dounia will ever be willing to sacrifice her entire life for her relatives? How many Razumihin could there be - without a homosexual tendency - buzzing his male college friend all day long? These fictional characters are rendered in the most ideal fashion. Yet the psychological states of Raskolnikov and, in certain places, Svidrigailov manage to dominate the main fictional stage with such a monstrous life force and reality, that we the readers cannot but accept the credibility of this whole \\"set\\", along with the impossible Sonia, Dounia and Razumihin, as one practical and likely existence. Now, it is the very tension and contrast between the most ideal/angelic/peripheral and the most realistic/vile/central figures, all together in one place, that makes the moral lessons of Raskolnikov stand out all the more vividly. This could even be called the \\"fourth dimension\\" of the sculpture of Raskolnikov. The more angelic these figures around Raskolnikov appear, the more hopeless and visceral the whole experience becomes. This, I think, cannot be the intentional design by Dostoevsky, but he must had somehow pulled it off unconsciously. Yet that is exactly what genius is all about, that one can never attain through conscious and industrious efforts.Those who see the novel as a detective story are grossly mistaken, for it is far more intelligent than those pure games of logic. The most important point is on the return of the sinned, the outcast and the morally depraved back to moral salvation and genuine love. The many subplots, whether they be Raskolnikov's triumphs over Luzhin, or Svidrigailov's victory over himself with Dounia at the last moment, actually all constantly toys with the temporary but fleeting possibility of the reunion of the sinned back to salvation and true love. Thus these subplots are not merely episodes but integral thematic parts of the grand plot!But the core issue, beneath all skins of the text, lies at the discord between the mind and the heart. For example, Svidrigailov's love towards Dounia can be of two opposite kinds. In the calculating, rational and theoretical mind love becomes lust (as with Luzhin), but in the instinctive, conscientious heart, love becomes true, unconditional and altruist love. This universal tension between the mind and the heart is the central dogma of Raskolnikov's phenomenon. That's what made the novel into a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment, by Fyodor Dostoevsky is packed with a complex characterization, theme, powerful voice, and many other literary devices. For example, Dostoevsky's characters complement each other in order to have a better connection to the plot. Raskolnikov, the protagonist of the novel, can be characterized as bitter and mainly separated from the society created within the book. Raskolnikov, however, is complemented by not only his friend but his love interest as well. Razumikhin and Sonya are both depicted as understanding and caring individuals who may be responsible for the small amount of sanity that is left in Raskolnikov. Not only does the characterization balance the novel, but the novels voice as well. Dostoevsky combines the characters voices alongside the subconscious thoughts of Raskolnikov, paired with the hidden voice of the narrator. The different levels of voice present in Crime and Punishment is a main contributor of the complexity and creativity witnessed in the novelSo, why then is the genuine writing that is found in the novel, absent in the epilogue? The change of the writing style within the epilogue is often regarded as Dostoevsky's superficial attempt to tie-up the novel. The novel ends with a typical conclusion that lacks creativity. The dark nature and chaos that is present the entire novel seems to be lifted up with a curtain of clarity. Dostoevsky is almost trying to push the remaining characters together for a happy finale. Or perhaps the change in style is an attempt to illustrate the ending from a more informal approach or essay-like structure. Either way the epilogue, in a way, eliminates the reader's imagination forcing us to accept his conclusion. At the end of the novel, Dostoevsky at least allows the reader to generate their own conclusions about Raskolnikov and the other characters; until the epilogue weeds off any suspense that may be left.The \\"constructive\\" feedback of the epilogue can also be seen from a clearer light. The epilogue does not possess the exciting whirl wind effect that the novel pulls off, but it does circle back to the main issues that are left dangling from the end of the novel. The two most obvious themes that are further highlighted in the epilogue are isolation from society and religious resentment. The epilogue is also set in a different setting and therefore may be one possible explanation for the unusual writing style. But should a new location change the story line?Although the epilogue does help the reader retrace issues that are demonstrated throughout the whole book (i.e. isolation from society and religious resentment) it also eliminates the reader's imagination and lacks the artistic talent that is present in the novel. The epilogue, therefore, should not be present since there is no new foundation or principle that emerges from the novel.Despite my hesitation to accept the epilogue I still recommend this novel to anyone that is interested in the psychological state of an ordinary man trying to reach a superman status. It is full with a required complexity in order to demonstrate the full scale scenario of the novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is one of the best books I have read by my opinion, it's a deep psychological analysis into a criminal yet somewhat a philosopher's mind. Dostoevsky does a great job describing Raskolnikov, the man who murders an old woman and her sister, and what goes through his mind; which to me is presented in stages. Raskolnikov's beliefs that man should be divided into two groups the superior men and the basic men, the basic men should just work and just live their lives and yet the superior ones should be above the law and do whatever they feel is good for humanity. This thought eventually overwhelms Raskolnikov and he finally decides to murder an old pawnbroker. He starts to enter certain stages of behavior from remorse to anger upon others to depression, etc.Dostoevsky, overall has brilliantly dwelled into the mind of the character and analyzed them thoroughly enough to create such an interesting tale."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A desperate, penniless student named Raskolnikov kills an old woman in her apartment for her money. Before he commits the crime, he justifies his evil plan by reasoning that she is merely a dispicable, greedy, old pawnbroker and he sees no immorality in the deed, he believes the world will be better off without her. Raskolnikov gets away with it, but he then becomes consumed with feelings of guilt which won't leave him alone. This plunges him into a hell of self-persecution, madness and terror. He goes out of his way to allow himself to be interrogated by police. Eventually, he feels a compulsive need to confess his crime, as if to ease his conscience. This classic tale will show you the depths of the criminal mind, exposing the soul of a man who is not a villain but a man possessed of both good and evil just like the rest of us, but who through poverty-stricken desperation and a selfish nihilistic personal philosophy decides to act out on his darkest impulse. Ultimately he must face the consequences of his actions. A striking and memorable morality tale.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"&quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; was my introduction to Dostoevsky, and a pleasant introduction it was. This is a very brilliant work from a master storyteller, and I can't recommend it enough.

It's a life time experience."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Amazing, heart-wrenching, and thouroughly a novel which explores the extent to which the mind can be twisted. The young student Raskolnikov is an insane mixture of hero and villain, brought down by his own brilliance and his, as it were, character flaw. This novel is the epitomy of superiority versus the inevitable, unchangable cycles of life. His theories are to be reckoned with; however, they can only remain theories, as he later learns, for no human has the capabilities to truly look past his conscious, if there is one present. That is the hero. The villain in Raskolnikov is really only his flawed concept of himself, of his deranged confusion of himself and Napoleon, of a great deed and an extremely obsolete attempt at overcoming human boundaries. Much like Heart of Darkness, by Joseph Conrad, Dostoevsky explores a depth of the human mind which he himself quite possibly cannot fully comprehend. It's worth the time to read this novel, for you soon become fully immersed in the twisted logic of such a simple, yet so very complicated story."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Definitely, this is the best book I have read so far. It is an excellent psychological analysis of the human being. If you have not read this book. Buy it, it's worth the money and time"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"One should probably read this great novel TWICE to catch all the nuances. Like his other major works, this masterpiece by Dostoevsky drives home two central, inter-related themes: (a) that ideas (and ideology) have consequences; and (b) that these can be deadlier than any other force on earth.For sheer depth and profundity, probably nothing can match the parable of The Grand Inquisitor, in THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV, but there's one line in C&amp;P that immediately struck me as one of the greatest single sentences in all the world's literature, quintessentially pregnant with meaning. The detective, Porfiry Petrovich, who knows that Raskolnikov is the murderer, doesn't arrest him, playing a sort of cat-and-mouse game. Porfiry rightly suspects that this was a political (ideological) crime, not a typical one, and knows that his triumph would be much greater if he forces Raskolnikov to ADMIT not just the error of his act, but the error of his thinking. This sentence varies considerably from translation to translation, but basically it is (Porfiry to Raskolnikov): &quot;You know, it's just as well you only killed the old woman. Because if you'd invented another THEORY, that would have been a thousand times MORE hideous.&quot; The events of our century have well borne out this prophecy.The other superb part of this novel is when Raskolnikov's friend Razmuihin is shocked to hear that Raskolnikov's journal article had suggested that &quot;superior&quot; men, like Napoleon, create their own moral codes and are not bound by traditional ones. (Woody Allen's film BULLETS OVER BROADWAY also provided a good satire of this ominous idea: an artist &quot;creates his own moral universe.&quot; And, as in C&amp;P, this led to a killing.) What shocks Razmuihin the most is that wanton killing and terror could be justified PRECISELY IN THE NAME OF MORALITY.Have we not seen enough of this already, in its most terrible aspects? The point is: such theories are still boiling in the pot, and we may not have heard the last of them."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have read all the books that Dostojevski wrote and I really do love them all. But Crime and Punishment will always be my first love. Raskolnikov is the demon and the archangel incarnated and his conversations with the police officer are a display of a total mastermind.

(And anyways, for Dostoevesky's time, the style of writing is far less elaborate than, say...Tolstoy or Dickens).You can read this as simply a thrilling crime drama, but more than that, it delivers an essay on meaning in modernity. You may scoff at its end implications ( by all means, please do), but i believe it was written by a refined artistic mind--no post-modern cynic could hope to equal such an achievement. ever... so filled with smug contempt that the Literary Snob is incapable of producing anything with sincerity and truth."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have read this book and I think its very good and a must read for everybody. It has everything, philosophy, character development, a rich language, and a very interesting story.The writer explores the psychology of a criminal mind, his feeling, the way he thinks and how later he repents about the crime.Raskolnikov a very poor law student away from school for financial reasons decides to commit a crime. Dostoyevsky does a very good job in developing his caracter. In the beggining Raskolnikov thinks that in the world are two kind of people. The ordinary people and the extraordinary. The latest are the kind of people that have the &quot;right&quot; to commit crimes in order to walk forward, grow in ther career or do something that is very good for the society, like Napoleon etc. The ordinary people dont have the right to commit crimes they are under the law. He thinks that commiting this crime will serve to the society, but later on as the story goes we see Raskolnikov change. This by several factors, his love for Sonia, his mother and Sister.We see some other characters in the novels that aren't criminals like Luzhin but we dont have any sympathy for them.In the end Raskolnikov change his mind, He starts to understand that he was not &quot;Napoleon&quot; or extraordinary and in order to be releaved and start a new life he needs to be &quot;Punished&quot;.Very good book I would suggest everybody to read it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a little bit heavy book as a size,but the expereance is unforgettable.All caracters in the book are strange and in the same time AWFULLY real.Every heroe has his own micro world.An amazing caracter gallery!!!I have seen the movie version of Hallmark.What a shame!!!One of the greatest books of all times presented like a stupid soap opera."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is one of my favorite novels. The psychological developments of the main character are rich. I think the question of the novel applies to any era governed by the rule of law: If one commits a crime that kills or utterly injures another thinking that the eventual benefits of the crime outweigh the consequences of the injuries of the crime, then one must still cope with knowing one has stepped outside the path of being a modern human; that is, the book's premise is that we are all connected and our conscience may or may not (I don't want to entirely give away the books plot) be able to cope with stepping on the roots of our common human experience. Exceptional read and well-worth buying, even if to simply say you have a penchant for Russian novels."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This books is a glorious Example of Human Psychology.It is always very difficult to depict or bring forth a human mind but Dostoevsky's illustration has been marvelous"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is incredibly well-written. Throughout the book, it was tough for me to decide whether or not I liked Raskolnikov, and I realized this was because he has two personalities. At times, Raskolnikov is kind, like Sonia and other times, he is a dark, intellectual, like Svidrigailov. It was interesting to see a part of Raskolnikov die when he committed the murders, but then come back to life with the help of Sonia. This is just like the story of Lazarus read by Sonia. Overall, this is a great novel that you have to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If there are books that are above criticism this one should be one of them. Very well written. It mesmerizes you and makes you like the main hero, the young Raskolnikov who commits the murder out of bilief in his superiority but cannot live up to his expectations afterwards. There are very deep psychological insights as well as philosophical and social comments throughout. The plot is interesting too, with many twists and turns. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Internal conflict is a key element in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment, because Raskolnikov's actions occur as results of his inner frustrations. Raskolnikov's harsh life effects his ability to think rationally. During a conversation with one of his companions he says, \\"It all went according to theory... Get to the consequences of what you've just been preaching, and it will turn out that one can go around putting a knife in people\\" (151). In this conversation, Raskolnikov misinterprets his friend's theory and clues the reader of his sickness. Most things are circled around death after Raskolnikov kills the two ladies. In his first killing he feels cornered and left with no other choice. Raskolnikov's growing sickness makes him obsessed with detail. The narrator explains his physical condition saying, \\"However, it was not that he was totally unconcious during the whole time of his illness: it was a feverish condition, with moments of delirium and semi-awareness. Afterwards he remembered a great deal\\" (117). The narrator reflects his inner sickness with his outer one in the story. It is almost as if he is in a dream, seeing what he is doing but not stopping himself. He does not realize the sverity of his actions until the process is over. Raskolnikov's life goes by in a drunken haze. What happens around you affects you in ways you do not realize. Dostoevsky's story displays how outer elements of a person's life can change their thought process and lead them to insanity."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"For those not versed in the peculiarities of Russian cultural history in juxtaposition to western European, this book is educative in one great respect: it lays bear the importance in that history of the idea in relation to actions.For those of steely nervous composition Crime and Punishment is an absolute must. For the more mousy, perhaps a little harrowing. Just as it is for the principle protaganist, who declares in the first pages that he feels as though his clothing has been caught in the wheels of a machine and he is being dragged inexorably into it, so it is for the reader. It will definately leave nobody indifferent.In it we are taken for a wrenching roller coaster ride over a complex moral landscape by its hero, Raskolnikov, who sets out to divest himself of what he sees as his own shortcomings by enacting a very simple idea. In the spirit of his pre-revolutionary times he converts confining moral tenets into a simplified mathematics. The equation is simple: if he murders one aged, miscreant and odious moneylender, he may release at least 2 virtuous people from impending or actual misery. No one will regret the passing of the old hag; it would be an almost universal shame should the virtuous not be released.The murder occurs within the first few chapters. Consequently the bulk and substance of the book is concerned with the plight of the hero after he has forced himself to conclude the deed. Will he or won't (turn himself in) he is the fevered question, which accompanies the reader from the completion of the crime up to the resolution. And it is the threads of this gruesome personal battle which provide the fabric of the book. Believe me, you empathic readers will be yearning for both conclusions in turns. It is interesting to note that the crime goes wrong and Raskolnikov murders not just the old hag. The second murder is of an 'innocent'. It is, though, hardly mentioned during the torturous journey of the murderer. The real 'trans-gression', a suitably accurate translation of the Russian word for crime used in the title - 'pre-stuplenie' - is the carrying out of an idea calculated to free the perpetrator from his wretched existence. As the great French philosopher said: nothing presents less of an obstacle than the perfecting of the the theoretical. Beware all ye who would confuse theory for practice. Existentialism is fine for the university student, but putting it into practice can prove intolerably lonesome for all but the psycopath. Psycopaths, by the way - the Napoleons referred to in the book - do not spend their time pontificating over the justifiability of what they do.I have read this book 6 times. In English, Russian, and for some reason even in German. I assume that I shall continue periodically reading it. I have visited the places in St. Petersburg in Russia where everything takes place (they are all real and concur exactly with the text). It has a heavyweight claim to being the greatest novel ever written. In my opinon this is because it functions brilliantly on any and all of its various levels. Whether examined as the patron of the 'psychological' novels, looked at in its historico-political context, or taken as a straight thriller, this book can bearly fail to exite immense empathy and emotion in any keen book reader. Read it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevksy marvelously illustrates the effect that guilt has on the human mind. Raskolnikov, an idealist and impoverished youth, finds himself committing a murder to help his people, but he is slowly transformed, along with his social theories. The unexplainable guilt gnaws at him until he changes his mind about his motives, his morals, and his faith. He realizes that social and economic change do not happen through murder, but through charity and hard work, which he learns through helping the prostitute daugher of a drunkard, as well as his own poor family. He accepts religion and God, as a way to repent and make his life more meaningful, and slowly he drives himself toward a confession..... This is a classic and outstanding book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky produced so many ground-breaking case studies of humanity's and ideology's perilous alliance. This book is one of his great fictions- not a treatise on political science as the title might suggest! Rashkolnikov, the protagonist, is a raffish, young ex-law student that commands the respect of his peers and the virtue of his family. He is arrogant, clever, self-conscious, and generous all in the midst of a moral and physical delerium that characterizes his on-the-edge existence. This \\"classic\\" is a thriller/mystery. But, what makes the story a mystery is not that Rashkolnikov is a murderer, but that he is so like us- the trademark of many a timeless classic. Rashkolnikov earns sympathy with humanity and intelligence. You'll be so much in his shoes that you'll feel the intensity and dizziness of the thoughts that pass through his head, as he weighs the fates of those around him. Part of the thrill is watching his endless rationalizations and schemes become foiled by his illness and by (yes, even in this novel- a love story or two!) the love of a young, unfortunate girl, who drives Rashkolnikov to accept the guilt that he could easily elude. The suspense virtually plugs the reader into the story, making the book one you just can't put down, for fear of losing touch with the gripping reality of Rashkolnikov's fate. I even felt like I had to question my own innocence, as Rashkolnikov dodged friends, inspectors, and a man like himself, forcing me to see things from his view, sometimes even to agree with him, and always to root for him. I liked &lt;&lt;The Idiot>> even better at the time, but this is a masterpiece on another level. My mother read it and loved the ending, and understood in her own way why R. did what he did. This is not only a fun, intellectual read, but also a feel good novel. Get it and don't let the Russian names and the silly title scare you anymore!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the novel Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov confessed to the murder in order to end his inner turmoil which alienated him from society. After committing the murders at the end of part one, the reader is led to believe that his motivation was for the good of humanity since the pawnbroker was greedy and served no positive role to anyone who knew her (and the sister's death was committed only to ensure Raskolnikov not be witnessed). It was later found out that his reasoning was to commit an extraordinary act, making him fit the characteristics of what he felt was a man above ordinary qualities. This reveals the truth to the reader about Raskolnikov's unusual behavior and struggles with guilt, since we understand why his inner-conscience was so damaged, making him physically sick. Contained within himself for a long period of time, this feeling ate him up inside until the religious and inspiring words of Sonia convinced Raskolnikov to confess. She explained to him that all of the upsetting feelings would go away, and that god would repent him of his sins. This would make him forgiven in the eyes of god, and Sonia would respect him for letting out his secret. He would live in peace and feel better about himself. As a result, Raskolnikov confessed to the murder(s) in order to cease his inner hell and feel able to face society again. He wanted to do the right thing, but it took the inspiring words of someone he admired to help aid him and go through with it. After confessing to the murders, his life could only get better, allowing him to \\"start over\\" and live his life with his mistake in the past."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I wanted to give this book 5 stars or atleast 4 1/2 stars but it was a bit lengthy for my taste. I just finished &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; and just couldn't believe that it was a 19th century book. Maybe I felt that way coz of my lack of insight about history. He lays so much emphasis on the psychology part of a crime along with the moral aspect. Dostoyevsky is unimaginably intelligent writer. At times I wondered if he himself went through that ordeal that his main character went through. Thats how vividly he described Raskolnikov's experience. Sad that it had to be translated and I am sure some of the beauty of language (as weaved by Mr. D himself) is lost. But nevertheless it is a very gripping novel. I normally am scared of epic books (this book was almost 600 pages) but I finished it in just 2 days and thats a record for me. I recommend this book to anyone who likes psychology, philosophy and literature as well as those who like character-driven or plot-driven (it is both) books."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"As Rodion Raskolnikov demarcated humanity in terms of &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;extraordinary,&quot; humanity can also be generalized in terms of those who empthasized with Rodion, and those who feel this book is simply glorifying the abnormal psychology of killers. The fact of the matter is this story is important for anyone attempting to philosophize upon humanity's darker side; sometimes it takes such an extreme example to raise the right questions. To bind one's opinion of this story by the mere confines of law and order does this story no justice as it would also limit the enlightenment one gets out of it. Especially today, as more young people strive to achieve righteousness through misinfluenced means, this book's importance is founded upon the over-intellectualization of the righteous path, and if any human can dub themselves worthy of taking it. Dostoevsky's unique way of humbling us with such journeys do more than merely increase our capacity for thought, they aide us in our travel to understand even the most outcasted mind, thus increasing our understanding of ourselves. I reccomend this classic piece of literature to anyone, both young and old, free-thinking and close-minded alike.

I am so grateful that my parents didn't allow me to use that word without a reprimand. My mother, a voracious reader,always told me &quot;David, if you're bored your're boring&quot;. I always got on the defensive when told this. As I grew older I began to understand what she meant.

Wrapped up in an exciting storyline are some of the most profound images of human nature, pride, suffering, redemption, sacrifice, and love that I have yet to read. The dualism of the ordinary man vs. the extraordinary man are convicting and force introspection. There is alot more of Razkolnikov in us than we wish to admit... both the warm hearted compassionate person and the detached monomaniac. The presence of two &quot;people&quot; within us is the source of much of our inner conflict and Razkolnikov is easy to see as an image of ourselves. The polar extremes built in to our human nature contribute to and in fact require our suffering.I will not forget this book. I found it philosophically challenging and surprisingly accessible; however, I will never &quot;understand&quot; it. I take away another bit of insight each time I think about Razkolnikov, but his character is one that can never be fully explored."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have to say that having read three different translations of this, and other Dostoevsky works, that I'm perplexed as to how people can give such high acclaim for the Pevear and Volokhonsky translations of these novels. People claim to dislike Garnett because she's too Victorian, or because she's a woman, or because she isn't entirely accurate in her rendering, well I haven't read a translation that is 100% accurate to the Russian. Something some might like to know is that Constance Garnett's translations are actually a lot more accurate than the Pevear and Volokhonsky translations. There is, however, one translation that stands out as being a pretty accurate rendering for Crime and Punishment and this is by David McDuff. On top of being very close to the Russian, his translation is also very enjoyable to read. All in all, I like Garnett's and McDuff's translations of Dostoevsky respectively. And, if you're looking for an accurate rendering, you can't go wrong with either McDuff or Garnett."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Why do people ride roller coasters? For the thrill. Why do people visit haunted houses? For the fright. Why read Crime and Punishment? For the paranoia, dread and remorse. Initially believing himself to be a superman, beyond reach of the moral constraints of ordinary men, Raskolnikov robs and murders a cheating pawnbroker. Who would miss her? She's a blight on society. Over time, he comes to regret murdering her partly because of his paranoid thoughts that people are on to him and partly because he learns that each person, no matter how seemingly low, has value and the inherent right to live. Somehow, Dostoevsky insinuates Raskolnikov's paranoia, dread and remorse into the reader's own psyche. The effect is more powerful and enduring than the temporary, cheap thrill of any roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoff , the truly marvellous creation of Dostevsky's \`Crime and Punishment ', representative of an uncontrollably intelligent mind swarming with thoughts bearing doubt, anger, chaos and extreme kindness!

The book then follows Rodion's path of self-destruction, bought about largely due to his inability to resist the incessant, yet hauntingly and brilliantly perceptive derivations of his own mind. A man lost in himself every breathing moment, unaware of his physically deteriorating body, and helpless in regards, his tumultuous mind.

That is to say, until he meets the pawnbroker whom his drinking buddies thought the town would be better off without, Rashkolnikov had no idea that she would be the person he would kill. After a fitful night of sleep where he struggled mightily with the fear that he would not be able to act, and with the inner forces warring within his head, he kills the pawnbroker and her sister (who showed up on the scene of the crime unexpectedly).And at least temporarily, Rashkolnikov is now finally relieved that he has at least exercised the ability to take his own miserable life into his own hands. It is a serious step towards his own perceived freedom and self-emancipation to a new level of autonomy and self-respect. He then attempts to proceed through life secretly living inside the profound new post-crime realities his act has created: The new reality is bracketed by the fact that he has now become both \\"a man of action,\\" and a mindless random \\"murderer.\\"Thereafter, the trajectory of the protagonist's life has been forever changed. As dense and as complicated as it was before the crime, there is now to be no peace between the warring demons inside his head, or from the unintended guilt associated with the implications and consequences of the enormity of his crime. Rashkolnikov discovers all too slowly that simply being able to rise to the level of \\"(mindless) action in the moment\\" does not alone solve his existential dilemma of living a cramped and marginal life of fear in a Socialist country, where he is cowered mostly by his own too timid ability to act in defense of his own freedom; i.e., his inability to act in defense of his psychological survival. Apparently there is more to self-respect than just being able to cross the threshold from doing nothing over to engaging in committed action?\\"In short, Rashkolnikov's discovers too late that his \\"new post-crime reality,\\" rather than freeing him and simplifying his life, it further strangled and complicated it rather dramatically. The struggle within his head no longer was just about the \\"nature\\" of the crime, but now was also about its \\"content\\" and their implications and consequences. Thus unexpectedly, Rashkolnikov found himself in the midst of a new more complex inner war that continued, unabated. And as the balance of forces within his head slowly shifted until they had tilted further and further towards his guilt, Rashkolnikov's torment compelled him to confess to the crime.Throughout the novel, Doestoyevsky puts us inside Rashkolnikov's head. We are able to see up close the Freudian dance of the build-up of tension that is going on there, a dance that rises to a crescendo as the protagonist brings himself to the point of confronting the full implications of his crime and eventually confessing to it.Existential AnalysisExcept perhaps for Freud himself and Shakespeare, Doestoyevsky sits alone at the top of the heap in his ability to strip away those layers of man's mind that get in the way of, and that get him away from, fully understanding who he is: that is to say, the inner forces and psychological dynamics that separate him away from how and why he acts. Unlike Freud and his acolytes, including most of the Existential psychologists, Doestoyevsky goes straight to the jugular bypassing the intellect in his analysis of man's will to act.His analysis through the device of novels, (and especially this one; but the formula has been set in his \\"Notes from the Underground\\") of man's will to act, is nothing less than a grand methodology for entering and understanding the psychological dialogue that man has with himself every time he makes a decision to defend what is perceived to be threats to his psychological survival. The Doestoyevsky dialogue (dialectic actually) is the very definition of what uncharted introspection is all about: the tension just below awareness in the constant struggle between the \\"inner\\" and \\"outer\\" forces shaping man's daily existence.The novel in Doestoyevsky's very able hands is only a device for entering the internal debate at eye level, bypassing the unneeded intellectual level altogether. After all, when man acts, intellect is only one of the parameters that come into play. And arguably it is seldom the most important one. Despite this, Doestoyevsky like Sartre, Camus, Otto Rank, Norman O. Brown, Arthur Koestler, and Ernest Becker, after him, gives us the road map for understanding what is going on inside man's head as he rises up on his hind legs to defend the very reason for his existence: to survive psychologically.As always (and as usual when society intervenes) the struggle is between the id and the alter ego; that is to say between the savagely primitive forces within us and those forces within society trying to place constraints on that savagery. Thus in a real sense, all of Doestoyevsky's novels are about this ultimate struggle for freedom: freedom of the mind from the shackles imposed by society. In this sense it mimicks Freud's arguments in \\"Civilization and its Discontents.\\" 10 Stars"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is an excellent reading of one of the greatest novels ever written. The reader, though never overintrusive, adds inflections that capture Raskolnikov's confusion of thought, the Detective Porfiry's Columbo-like approach to tracking his prey, Razumikhin's charm, Dunya's charisma, Luzhin's sleaziness, Svidrigailov's suicidal nihilism, Marmeladov's drunkenness, and Sonia's saintliness.Everyone reads this book in school, and I read it more than once in my youth. But I definitely encourage you to re-read a classic like this, and the audiobook format makes it easy to do so in one's spare time. What I forgot and did not remember until re-reading this book is the extraordinary cast of supporting characters Dostoyevsky creates. Svidrigailov is a precursor of Stavrogin, the great nihilistic anti-hero of Dostoyevsky's later novel \\"The Devils\\" and is a perfect foil for Raskolnikov -- taking his radical amoral philosphy to its logical conclusion via his suicide. Yet, like the other great evil heroes of Dostoyevsky's work, Svidrigailov is multidimensional, including his ability to display a surprising charm. Dostoyevsky does not lightly dismiss the lure and charm of evil, which is why his novels are great moral masterpieces and can be emotionally draining.Another great foil for Raskolnikov is his level-headed friend Razumikhin, whose ability to cut through the radical chic of the day and live sensibly provides a model for the reader, as does Raskolnikov's sister Dunya.Of course, the third and most important foil for Raskolnikov is the Christ-like Sonia. Her character has been the subject of some criticism. The prostitute with the heart of gold can strike the reader as unrealistic and overly symbolic. But on this re-reading, I was struck by her character. Raskolnikov recognizes that if Sonia continues on too much longer in her craft, she will be corrupted. And Sonia's ability to inspire others is shown in Dostooyevsky's convincing portrayals of how others react to her, particularly the other Siberian prisoners at the end of the book. That no one has ever been quite as saintly as Sonia must be conceded. But anyone with an optimistic or Christian view of human nature can see a bit of Sonia in everyone and can see that there are points in some people's lives where they do live up to her ideal. I found myself quite taken with her character; indeed, without the character, the Christian theme of redemption that is at the core of the book would be impossible.Also striking on re-reading is the great confusion of Raskolnikov's nonetheless quite brilliant thinking. In one remarkable scene, Raskolnikov gives Sonia several explanations of why he committed the crime. Each explanation has some truth in it, yet is also in a sense false as Raskolnikov himself recognizes. The episode demonstrates the author's critical point that morally and religiously unhinged thinking is inevitably confused and false.The ending of Crime and Punishment is also criticized for copping out -- for not explaining just how Raskolnikov becomes redeemed. But Dostoyevsky can hardly write a book about everything, and it suffices that he has shown quite convincingly the psychology of a man led astray who then starts his journey back to redemption by accepting the Christian philosophy of love, sacrifice, and suffering. For me, Dostoyevsky's greatest novel -- the Brothers Karamazov -- takes up the story started in Crime and Punishment. In that novel, Dostoyevsky portrays in Alyosha a saintly character more subtle than Sonia -- as well as the character that Raskolnikov at the end of novel is striving to become.For me, Dostoyevsky is the great writer of Western Civilization, and I highly recommend this novel as his most accessible -- made still more accessible by this audiobook format."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"\\"Crime and Punishment\\" is probably the most famous and most accessible of Dostoevsky's novels. Set in late Nineteenth Century Saint Petersburg, the novel contains elements of a detective story, a psychological study and metaphysical exploration.The novel is about an impoverished young law student named Raskolnikov who examines the possibility of killing his elderly landlady and stealing her money so that he can use it to assist his family. Raskolnikov soon concludes that killing the landlady constitutes a heroic and decisive act of courage. He murders her with an axe and steals her money but soon falls under suspicion and is investigated by the police. The police inspector suspects Raskolnikov of committing the crime but does not attempt to arrest him immediately. Instead, the inspector drags out the investigation in order to give Raskolnikov the opportunity to come to terms with his own conscience. Eventually the burden on Raskolnikov's conscience and the realization that his crime will not solve his family's problems compel Raskolnikov to confess. He is subsequently arrested and sentenced to a few years imprisonment in Siberia.Although \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is something of a thriller, it is largely a novel of ideas. When Raskolnikov rationalizes his right to kill his landlady, he assumes the role of the Nietzian superman: an individual whose state of mind and whose actions transcend good and evil. The police inspector symbolizes the counter argument to Raskolnikov's validation of the Nietzian superman by realigning Raskolnikov with his own conscience. Ultimately, this novel argues that no man is beyond good and evil and that any attempt to thwart one's conscience is bound to end in folly.The theme of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" takes place on an individual level, but can also be applied to the historical progress of nations as well. Dostoevsky was passionately opposed to what he felt was mankind's hubris in attempting to build a paradise on Earth-an act that he felt was symbolized by the Crystal Palace (Britain's exhibit in the World's Fair). Dostoevsky believed that creating a utopian society involved the type of deliberate human sacrifice and moral realignment performed by Raskolnikov. Dostoevsky's fears appear to have been born out in the Soviet experience, in which the entire apparatus of government from the leaders of the nation to the lowest commissars slaughtered millions of Russian citizens in the name of socialism and progress."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A friend of mine forced me to read this book over the summer (we had a bargain--I would read Dostoyevsky, she would read Richard Mitchell). I read it sporadically, without much interest, not making much progress, until I decided that I must crack down and finish it. And I found that the deeper I got into the book, the more interested I became; and not only interested, but awed by Dostoyevsky's skill. Clear-headed and sensible people who have never felt terrified and arrogant and confused will no doubt find this book pointless, as will those who dislike thinking, but the fact remains that this book is a work of art, which I heartily recommend to all."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There is no information as to which translation this is.

I called them and got my money refunded."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I don't want to split hairs here, but it just seems odd to me that the previous reviewer thought that the philosophical exploration in Crime and Punishment was somehow to be found in Rascalnikov, an obvious experimental protagonist like unto the lead revolutionary in The Devils, but by no means the philosophical key and insight into the mind and values of Dostoyevsky (the phrase, \\"Great literature, mediocre philosophy,\\" is what sticks out at me). If this comes from teaching highschool or middle school, then I truly sympathize.The police investigator, a marginal character, really, speaks a line way into the novel, after the murder of the landlord and the investigation is well under way, that pierces through the pages of the book and spells it out for us (at least it did for me): \\"Be the sun, and all will see you!\\" This line, in one sentence, spells out the author's true life-revelation and philosophy at that point, I think, if any can be said to exist in the book. It says be honest and open and loving and repenting of things you are not proud of (and eager to be something that others can be proud of?). It's one of those lines that are what make Dostoyevsky a master of philosophical fiction, like in the Grand Inquisitor's dialogue with Jesus. He takes you to a point where you are right with him and abbreviated dialogue are all that is required, if you are even paying attention. (Is this sounding too indignant?) That was just so obvious to me (even if I hadn't taken a college class on Dostoyevsky's entire oeuvre). This is born out by his many other novels and short stories. Pretty boring factoid, really, but one I thought worth pointing out to the previous reviewer. I think it is safe to say that the most poignant and revelatory utterance of the book outweighs the nervous ramblings of the protagonist, which is not a devout Russian Orthodox, as was Dostoyevsky, btw (that was such a big clue to most Literature buffs, I would imagine...).The whole \\"fighting modernism\\" thing of extreme political movements only starting to get roused in his day (like would later blow up into fullblown, black-booted isms like Communism, Nazism, and Italian Fascism) was a phenomenon that concerned their precursor, Dostoyevsky, a great deal, probably more than would be popular to speak about today, not for being a reactionary as often charged, however, but more for seeming to go against the grain of proletarian sympathies. Maybe the key here is to remember that the Cultural Revolution of Mao, and the book 1984, both come after Dostoyevsky. I think this is the kind of image of the revolutionary that Dostoyevsky may have had in mind. In this way he is something of a prophet (and I have not heard this angle frequently taken up, oddly). This comes out in The Devils, not his best, but easily his most politically insightful, where he almost spells out his distaste for politically-born, \\"above the masses\\" morality (as if that even makes any sense). Nietzschean figure though he does cut (Rascalnikov), I knew that he predated Nietzsche when I read it, and, even though I had already started reading up in my philosophy classes on Frederich by then, it never really struck me as a true likeness. Nietzsche is such a searching experimental outcast looking for his true calling (later possibly found in the quest for \\"Truth\\"), often over-committed and infrequently sold on action. This is completely unlike Dostoyevsky, who, by the time of the writing of Crime and Punishment, had long ago made more Christian and idealistic commitments that solidified in his stint as a political exile in Siberia.(Is it bad to start to feel yourself becoming the Amazon.com review police?)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the first of his string of classic novels, Fyodor Dostoyevsky delves deep into the human psyche. Using prose that is thick and penetrating, Dostoyevsky weaves a deep, stunning psychological portrait. The book is written in a very unconventional style: the murder is committed at the front of the book - as well as the interweaving of other scenes, which seem to have little or no relevance at first - without giving any motive or reason for it. It is only later, much later, in the book that the reason for the murder is revealed, and we spend the rest of the book in the mind of Raskolnikov. Slowly, piece by piece, more and more of his character is revealed, until we are aware that we have read one of the greatest character studies and psychological portraits in all of literature. The book raises several philosophical questions - as do all of Dostoyevesky's works - namely: is the intelligent human being beyond good and evil? Are they allowed to transgress moral if it will benefit humanity? Who qualifies and who doesn't? As relevant as this book still is today, it was, at the time, a deft exploration of the prevailing philosophies of the time, as well as a question into the then-just-emerging field of modern psychology. Raskolnikov shows the true fate of a Nietzschian superman, and begs the question, Is a man able to escape his own conscience? A true literary masterpiece with broad implications that hit hard to this day."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky's ending is beautiful. It brings marvelous closure to the inner struggles of the hero. When life was worthless it suddenly became meaningful. When the author is allowed to tell his story he replaces the dreary darkness with the light of hope. By laying the book to rest before it is finished, it is as if one were to judge a painting by the colors in the background before the artist had a chance to paint the bright colors of the foreground. Read the book and read it all the way through."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I love Dostoevsky, which is something of a curse. I read Crime and Punishment 13 years ago, and have spent the following years looking for something akin to this book.Dostoevsky has the rare gift of not just writing; but truly entering the mind of his subjects; every psychological nuance. Every fear; the paranoia, guilt, hatred, persecutiion, and angst of tortured souls (Maybe it was his stay in Siberia that shaped him).Everyone should read this book. It's an open letter about the human condition. Then read The Brothers Karamozov; then The Idiot.It's not happy reading. It's literature with soul. Someday I'll find a writer this good.

Although I cannot pinpoint exactly where this novel and I got off on the wrong foot, I will say that there was too much repetition, and I could not identify with or even like any of the characters.

What a monumental mistake. I normally read a book in one or two weeks. IT TOOK ME FOUR MONTHS TO SLUDGE THROUGH THIS GARBAGE!

At this price, I couldn't resist. The cover is classy-looking, no goofy picture which I appreciate."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I picked up this novel as part of the Easton's top 100 books. I have to admit that I wouldn't have read it, or finished it, if it wasn't part of this list. It follows the deterioration of Rasko, a poor student, who decides to murder a pawnbroker in an attempt to better his life. This go awry from the beginning, when in a state of panic he forgets to bolt the door. After committing the murder, he takes a handful of trinkets. Rasko is immediately wracked by guilt, and begins making mistake after mistake.The novel was probably considered a psychological thriller when it was initially published. However, I found it to be a bit dry and hard to read. Oftentimes characters would go on non-sensical rants that lasted several pages. I found the moral questions raised throughout the book to be interesting. A more modern take on this book would probably be interesting and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Being Dostoyevsky an observer of the inner world that comes out of the perceptions of the mind, this novel is about the ravings of a poor helpless University Student drop out who happens to rent a cramped one room studio in San Petersburg, Russia. He needs money desperately and one day decides to kill and old nasty lady who makes her business pawning objects and to whom he had pawned some jewelry belonging to his mother.The book can be divided in my opinion in three parts, 1) All the process that leads to the murder of the lady as seen from the inside of the mind of Raskolnikov ( this poor innocent that would never kill a fly, planning to murder someone)these few chapters are colorful, full of suspense action and very gripping indeed like in the best hard boiled novel you can find 2) Intermediate chapters that plod along describing the environment where Raskolnikov lives showing the social reality of the Tzarist Russia of that time and 3) How Raskolnikov reveals his crime to the outside, gets convicted, put on trial and sentenced. In every case Dostoyevsky does not focus on the story but in the feelings and emotions that go through the mind and soul of the characters as they interact among themselves like in the best psycho fiction novel and this carries along the action unfolding the story. In order to understand and properly follow this author one must reflect himself on every sentence one read so as not to lose the thread. So do it slowly.

My plans fell apart because I didn't have enough time and the beginning couldn't hold my attention.However, I kept it, still meaning to give it another go, especially after gaining a deep appreciation and love for anything Russian. In my honors english class we read it this year and I found it an immensely stirring physcoanalysis of the criminal mind. While slow in the beginning Dosoevsky quickly made up for it with his riveting character developments. You quickly grew a strange compassion for Raskolnikov, despite the fact that he was a murderer. This is the skill of the writer.While many would argue Raskolnikov did not recieve proper punishment, I think his mental anguish and agony was almost enough. Dostoevsky painted a rather disturbing picture of the mindset that a murder can set you into.This translation surprised me. Before I read this book in class, I read a poorly translated version of the Death of Ivan Ilyich. By comparing this translation to that I was easily sucked into the book.Get through the first 50 pages and the book is simply riveting, take my word for it. I can't wait to read it a second and a third time."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Despite other reviews that comment on the poor translation of this book. I found it to be fairly good and not affect the reading at all, and it has a great introduction (that I suggest reading after you finish the book because it has great ideas, but gives away the ending). As for the book itself, it isn't to deep and almost anyone should be able to understand it fully. It is almost more of a character study but the plot does move along quite nicely and the book is hard to put down once you get into it, and like all Russian authors there is some philosoph yin this book, but it is laid out for you very simply. As for only giving it 4 stars, I just felt that it wasn't as great as it could have been (since he was writing it for money above anything else)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'll be very brief with a fresh idea. First off, the book is a great work of literature and a very good read. I needn't say more in that department as the other 5 star reviews here cover it well.But my theory is that publishers wanted long novels as being more marketable rather than novellas or short stories. I think that influenced the writing of Dostoyevsky, Joseph Conrad and others. Although extremely well written, my view is that there is some padding in the story here as there also was to an even greater extent in the Brothers Karamazov.I would be more in favor of \\"tight story telling\\"."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have heard of this book for years but did not think I would like it. I got it in a lot of books I bought cheap and decided to give it a try. It is the translation by Magarshack and is highly readable. What a great story! It has a little of everything: crime, social commentary, feminism, romance, intrigue, comedy, ethnicism, class wars and religion. I could not put it down! The main character murders a couple obnoxious women for their money, believing at first that he is doing society a favor, and later is tortured by guilt. Throughout several subplots, many different types of people are drawn into his life with varying degrees of intrigue and he tries desperately to hide what he has done in the midst of all of this. There is a lot of dialogue in this book but it is interesting and engaging; one is drawn into the lives of the characters and feels like they are in the room with them.Please don't bypass this one because of its age and being a \\"classic\\". How refreshing to read an intellectual, well-written book!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I liked this slightly better than The Brothers Karamozov which is also one of the best books ever!

You murdered her, and then you murdered her sister. What were you thinking?Raskolnikov: (Making a violent effort to understand what it all means) I murdered myself, not them! It was the Devil that killed them. Enough, enough! I killed a noxious insect of no use to anyone, so what is the object of these senseless sufferings?Dr. Phil: You need to get a grip on yourself, and you need to take some responsibility and make healthier choices.(Applause from studio audience.)Raskolnikov: (Breathing heavily, his upper lip twitching.)

The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some mysterious process to bring into the world at last one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence.Dr. Phil: Let's talk about the independence thing, since you brought it up.

And recently you've embarked on a life of crime?Raskolnikov: The extraordinary man has the right to find in his own conscience a sanction for murder, if it is essential to the practical fulfillment of his idea.

(Laughs insanely.) Perhaps I am really mad, and all this happens only in my imagination.Dr. Phil: Nope, you ain't getting you off the hook that easy. Fact is, you are accountable for your actions.

The story focuses on Raskolnikov, a former student who is separated from his society beacuase of his pride. Raskolnikov killed Ivanovna for certain reasons and also her sister who witnessed the crime.The novel focuses more on the psychological state of Raskolnikov after the crime including his doubt, guilt and despair. the novel also shows how raskolnikov is a nihilist and a utilitarian in nature. He kept pushing help from other people. His guilt is haunting him even in his dreams. and the police officers are having an idea that he's the murderer.St. Petersburg is the setting. It actually helped me a lot to guess what will happen next. It also creates the mood of the story. The city somewhat contributed to the excitement of the story.The novel was good. It shows that no one can live alone. And eventhough Raskolnikov kept pushing away the help of his family and friends, Sonya eventually breaks the barrier through her love between Raskolnikov and the society.The novel is a requirement in some schools &lt;like ours> and we are forced to read this kind of thing. But through a lot of readings i eventually understand what the book is all about. How pride separated him from the society. how nihilism developed in Raskolnikov's personality and how he accepts to be part of the society again. Now this book is a very worthwhile book for me. and i guess this is the start of my reading of other books of this kind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The sensation this book may give you is that of a nightmare. True to nightmares both the reader and the protagonist eventually wake up. I guess there are many different things that people can take away from such a classic piece, not least of which is the concept of redemption. Although not religious, Raskolinov reaches the point where he can either melt down completely or come clean and pay for his sins.Still, the greatest accomplishment in my opinion was in creating a mood so successfully it almost seemed to affect my physical surroundings."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky writes a fine book about killing and the consequences of it (not societal, but moral). The main character Raskolnikov becomes the perfect abstraction of the neurotic man, who suffers from a malady whose source he knows not, grappling in the darkness, searching, amidst a void without clarity, without purpose and whose only redemption lies in confession, in humility.Thus Dostoyevsky blends Existentialism with Christianity in this novel, and makes a fine book. Although, I still prefer the Nietzschean interpretation to the problem of life, in that, the problem of morality lies not in our actions, but in our conscience.Also recommended: Toilet: The Novel by Michael Szymczyk (A tribute to the Literary Works of Franz Kafka)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment was an excellent book and I recommend it for any high school level reader (11th and 12th grade) or higher. It is great literature, but is confusing at some points. If the reader tries to understand the book page by page, it is sometimes hard to put the book down. The book also helps you learn a little about the history of Russia during the 19th century after Napolean and his troops froze to death trying to defeat the Russians.Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikoy lives a life of poverty. He seems to be crazy to the reader because he murders two sisters. His reasoning was based on the theory he wrote. Rodion feels uncomfortable whenever the subject of murder is brought up in a conversation. Although he believes his reasoning for killing the two girls was correct, he seems to still be uncomfortable about it showing he is partially innocent.As the story moves on, tension builds because the reader does not know what will happen next.This book is great to read if you are a high school level reader or higher.

Dostoevsky, through his telling of Raskolnikov's inner struggle and his first encounter with love and compassion, is clearly rejecting nihilism. The murder committed by Raskolnikov might be an act related to utilitarianism, but the great agony and guilt that the main character suffers is Dostoevsky's idea of real punishment that leads the final conclusions that good beats evil, religion beats atheism, and right overpowers wrong.Granted, Crime and Punishment is considered great literature devoted to the psychology of criminals and their imprisonments within their own guilt. However, the novel is an immature way of stereotyping criminals and simplifying a very complex human puzzle. Dostoevsky attempts to show us that only love, redemption and righteousness will rule, but he over simplifies and generalizes.Crime and Punishment is another way that Dostoevsky tried to resolve his feelings about chaos and corruption in his society, and solve all dilemmas and conflicts by turning to God, or accepting Christ as Dostoevsky did in reality."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You can read everything you need to about the book from the other reviews, so I'll examine an interesting aspect of this book a little further.I agree with one (perhaps many) of the reviewers that Crime and Punishment should not be read purely as a philisophical treatise. The concepts are not planted and gone to seed in this book; Dostoevsky seems to be showing the result of an idea like this (hence the name Crime and Punishment rather than The Greater Man) rather than the conceptual processes of the idea itself.Raskolnikov (the so-called perpetrator) never accepted redemption because he never believed that he had commited a crime. Society (as he thought) was persuing him to exact justice. Supposing that his reasoning (that the difference between social acceptance and even greatness and PUNISHMENT is success or defeat) is correct, why does his family and friends continue to accept him? He failed; \\"society\\" was against him, but he had friends the whole time. Even Porfiry (I forget his full name) said that he \\"liked\\" him, and the man that was after Dounia (lol) said that they were \\"the same type of person.\\" Evem Razmuzihin, who lives, it appears, simply for justice did not prosecute his friend. Who is the greater man? These people let him off; the Explosive Lieutenant was agreeable even though he had once submitted to the suspicions surrounding Rodya: Is there such a thing as a great crime? Is the crime defined in the eyes of the people or the eyes of the criminal? I guess, in that case he's right!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book in about 12 days, which is rare for me. I really liked the characters and the flow of the story.

He is a young man living in St.Petersburg, Russia who is struggly financially. He lives in run down apartments in a bad part of town. Raskolnikov believes that his natural superiority places him above the moral law of common men. With that, he finds good reason for murdering two men. All through the novel, each reason is found to be insupportable. Raskolnikov starts to feel a lot of guilt for what he has done and cannot even spend the money obtained by the crime. Finally he turns himself in and is sentenced to hard labor in Siberia. Siberia is a very cold part of Russia. Raskolnikov soon begins to discover that what he did was wrong and he tries very hard to make up for it.I would recommend this book, but you really have to know how to understand that way it's written. There are a lot of hard words and complicating phrases. You also have to push yourself to read this because some parts can begin to get very boring at times but don't let that stop you because this is a great book!!!!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Whoa! Look out, this one's scary!! Just kidding. Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is a dark or noirish story of Rodian Raskolnikov's journalist life.

However, since he lives in bleak times and is under pressure (he's the early form of manic depression) Rodya takes out his aggression on his old pawnbroker and her sister so to speak. The story takes form as Rodya attempts to hide the truth about his ax-murdering tendencies through his good deeds. Functionally, Dostoevsky's piece is very long winded. Many scenes are drawn out to the point of monotony and yet others go by almost too fast as the reader gets involved in the story. My views of this piece would go as far as to say, &quot;It's a dark film noir thriller of the 19th Century...&quot; and I emphasize the 19th Century.Thematically, the piece is very melodious, bits and pieces coming together slowly. Metaphor and imagery are used extensively to show a dark side of life in the late 1800s Russia. Symbolism is rich but story line lacks any great coherence.But enough of that, What is it? You might ask... Well, simply put, Crime and Punishment is a story about a man on a mission of redemption through his acts and the way he treats people. Rodya is truly sorry for the things he's done but at the same time isn't very remorseful of the deaths. It's a hard read, no doubt, but is it worth it? I should say, if you like thriller novels and don't think you'd have a hard time with this one, go for it! Dostoevsky very readily set about to write a story with his biblical-bashing background and did indeed manage to pull it off again. His characters are very proud and very emotional, and even though its and older piece, its worthy of a little more scrutiny."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I don't have time to go into the intricate level of detail and character development that Dostoevsky himself did when writing this novel. All that is left to say is that there is a distinction between whether you \\"like\\" this book and whether this book is \\"good/well written.\\" You are more than welcome to not enjoy this book, but don't think for a second that you can blame your dislike on Dostoevsky. He wasn't writing it for you, and that's okay. This book a pure literary genius, and to confuse subjective dislike with objective quality is a mistake that Dostoevsky himself would never make."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The first 50 pages of this novel are as gripping as anything Stephen King writes."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you are a Japanese reader, I recommend Ikuo Kameyama's recent translation (2008).

I do not believe that to be the case. This seems more like a tract against the excesses of individualism. This Garnett translation seems to capture Dostoevsky's language adequately.Short of reading it in the original this is a very good edition. The endnotes are pretty sparse and hard to access in the electronic version. My only real criticism would be that some of the text is misformatted in the electronic version. Amazing author, one of his masterpieces."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The physical book itself: It arrived on time in new condition as stated. Just a book, no surprises.The story: I have not finished the book, but I am well enough along to say that it lives up to its reputation. Do not be intimidated by the complicated Russian names, you can eventually identify the characters. For me, the first chapter was a little hard to get into, but as I plugged along, I quickly grew into it and it is indeed a fascinating page-turner, a story where you can really get into the characters mind. A great read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In reviewing Rodian Rasloknikov's character, I am surprised for someone so smart and a generally okay guy can murder with such resolve and then agonize slowly over it.He was a narcissist with exhibited signs of schizophrenia. His sickness was fighting with the rational and righteous man in him. It was an amazing journey into the mind of a tortured soul in these days of Prozac and Paxil....I was told I should read it in the original Russian. I think I'll pass. I already know how depressing it is."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Interesting, first Dostoyevsky novel for me. Human nature...it's all in there, the good, the bad, and the ugly. Depends on your point of view as to which you ascribe to each character. It was a good read, although a little difficult for me, as my son comitted suicide in January."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The book I ordered was in the exact condition as described and item was shipped to me promptly!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov, Crime and Punishment's protagonist, is a divided man (his name literally means \\"split\\" in Russian). On the one hand, he is an uber-Mensch, an intelluctual who feels entitled to take life into his own hands without regard for the consequences. On the other, he is a compassionate and caring man, trying to protect his sister Dounia and offering a helping hand to an impoverished drunk. Raskolnikov is always at odds with himself, and the two facets of his character are highlighted through Sonia, the moral prostitute, and Svidrigailov, the despicable intellectual. Usually, crime is the most fascinating aspect of a story. Here, the crime is over with rather quickly. Dostoyevsky's true genius is how he paints the character of Raskolnikov post-crime: a tortured soul wrestling with the concept of guilt and what it means to be redeemed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book really puts me on the edge as I sympathize with the main character over his misfortune, agonize with him over his actions, fearful of his punishment that seems inevitable, despairing over the repercussion it will have on his family and loved ones, all the while, hopeful that things will workout somehow and that all is not lost. It's like watching a disaster happen slowly before my eyes without the power or the will to stop it.The writing style, character and plot development are all perfect. The only thing I'd complain about would be that the book started off with an interesting moral debate over \\"If you can kill one bad person but save many innocent, should you do it?\\", but that was left hanging as the main character no longer concerns himself with this philosophical debate. But then again, it maybe better left to a different book as it was more of a catalyst for the plot and not meant to be a center piece."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Book ReviewI don't feel I have the authority to make judgment on such a classic. But I can say that I loved Crime and Punishment, and that it has earned a spot as one of my all time favorites. Constance Garnett's translation was a nice, smooth read. Also I really liked the illustrations in this copy.Dostoevsky borrows some interesting and possibly dangerous philosophies, and personalizes them through a smart young student, Raskolnikov. Like most in Petersburg, Raskolnikov is stuck in the stranglehold of poverty, and also suffers from delusions of self-superiority.I grew to love Raskolnikov and without realizing, I began to root for and sympathize with a cold blooded murderer, whom any normal person wouldn't hesitate to condemn. By the time you have finished the book, you will have gained a unique view of what crime and punishment is, and what it can be.I could recommend this book to anyone and be confident that they will like it if they give it a fair chance. The first 90 pages or so are kind of slow, but after that you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I struggled at times with this book.

This was my first novel by Dostoevsky but it won't be my last. Crime and Punishment may be the most gripping novel I've ever read, and I didn't just read the story... I consumed it voraciously. I was mesmerized, enthralled, anxious, and confounded at times. Even that was good and a part of the reading experience.It's true that it takes some work to read Dostoevsky, but it's worth the effort. He has a style all his own. I had to re-read certain passages multiple times to understand fully the scope of a particular conversation or event, as the author intended. However, the process for me was never tiresome; I wanted to soak in every detail.I won't rattle on about the story itself -- others have already done that here, and probably more effectively than I could do anyway. Let me just say that the premise of the novel is compelling, the characters are first-rate, and the ever-crumbling dynamics between Raskolnikov and his friends and family are painfully realistic. The reader gets a bird's-eye view into the innermost workings of an agonizingly conflicted mind.For me, Crime and Punishment was a profound and satisfying reading experience, one that will stay with me forever. This isn't so much because of the subject matter or the \\"moral of the story\\", which warns against over-intellectualizing and getting swept up in the social thinking of the day. No, what I liked best was how the author got me to care intensely about almost every character in the story.I know now why author Michael D. O'Brien (Sofia House, Father Elijah) was influenced by Dostoevsky, and why he is often compared favorably to the Russian storyteller."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Almost painful in it&#8216;s account of human self examination and the loathing of finding out who we might or might not be."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This took me a long time to read. I stopped and started. There are three or four brain searing scenes where the madness of the central character comes to the fore. For these, the book is worth reading. I found the rest a bit tedious - perhaps a modern translation would increase connection with the material. Also, I didn't like any of the characters enough to care about the eventual outcome, which made it more difficult to wade through the slow bits.I feel like a philistine for saying so, but losing track of the names probably didn't help either - given names, patronymics and nicknames for everyone, so sometimes I'd get halfway through a scene before connecting some of the participants to their back stories. Perhaps that wouldn't have been so bad had I finished it quicker.In the end, everyone is flawed, no-one escapes tragedy, and we define our own punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have not read this book as of yet . I got this book because someone recommended it as a very good read ."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is one of the few celebrated classics that I have been able to get into and actually enjoy.

What a great moral lesson this is for all of us today."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The text seems delivered well to the reading device.The book itself seem dense, slow and repetitive to the 21st Century reader. Worth the time, however."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There's no denying the fact that the novels of Dostoevsky are quite difficult to read especially when it comes to the names of the characters. But I certainly admit that his works are veritable masterpieces.It took me six weeks to finish Crime & Punishment but the whole reading experience was gratifying.Dostoevsky's belief in God is very evident in his writings - amid the communism and atheism prevalent in Russia during those days.In this novel, the Dostoevsky once again explored the mind of a criminal- the darkness that lurks, the fear and paranoia, the perennial battle between the good and the bad, the hope for moral redemption and the quest for spiritual salvation.Not every body will appreciate this novel, Dostoevsky may not be that popular in this time and age but his works turned me wet on classical literature forever."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Before picking up Crime and Punishment, I could count on one hand the number of classics I'd read - Jane Eyre, Frankenstein, and a good deal of short stories and poetry. I saw the brilliance in them, to be sure, but was never really able to connect with them. Crime and Punishment was different. In addition to being an amazingly powerful piece of literature, it also happens to be vastly entertaining. If you'd like to get into reading the classics, but haven't been engaged by those you've tried, this is definitely recommended reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Most summaries of this book viciously oversimplify it, saying something like &quot;The main character is driven by guilt to confess a murder&quot; or some such. Actually, in true Dostoyevskyan (to coin a phrase) form, the motives for the confession are understandable yet curiously undefinable. For the entire book, one can understand why Raskolnikov thinks and feels as he does, yet one can never quite explain it (in that sense, he is very true-to-life) Deeply Christian, this book is essentially about rebirth. Raskolnikov is redeemed by the relentless goodness of Sofya, the patience of Razumikhin and, in an odd way, even by the police inspector, Porfiry, who maneuvres Raskolnikov into confessing. Everything is so seemlessly woven together, that this book has almost the beauty of form of a great poem."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'll admit I had to read this for school but I ended up loving it in a way I'd never imagined! For its length, it's actually very fast moving, with most of the action/dialogue taking place within a few days. The characters are amazing and moved me to deep feelings of pity, understanding, hatred or concern. The imagery was also uniquely fascinating and will certainly remain with me for a long time to come. This book had an atmosphere that was almost tangible. Dostoyevsky and his host of characters with names a unpronounceable as his own have definitely made an impact on me. I heartily encourage you to give Crime and Punishment a trial of your own!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You can debate the philosophical and spiritual implications of this book until the cows come home, but that leaves you with a tendency to neglect the amazing entertainment value of this exquisite novel.It manages to have the deep and powerful sweep of Dickens or Hugo, but without ever becoming dull or slowing its pace in the slightest. The dialogue is witty, sharp, emotionally powerful and very revealing of the characters' personality, and the characters...oh, the characters!You have the unequalled honest, warm charm and amazing wit of Razumikhin. You've got the fascinating loathsome Peter Luzhin, and that devious, pervasive, terrifying embodiment of retribution Porfiry Petrovich. You've got Luzhin's hilarious communist roommate, whose name is absurdly long and complex even by Russian standards, and the tragic alcoholic clerk Marmeladov. You've got poor, tragic, half-crazed Svidrigailov (my single favorite character in the entire book), the deep, pious, passionate prostitute Sonia...and of course, Raskolnikov himself, the quintessential human being. He's a bit comparable of Hugo's Valjean, except more flawed and far more realistic.The book is one of the very best I've ever been exposed to. For those of you afraid of getting into so heavy and powerful a novel, let me tell you that for something this deep and rewarding, it is an amazingly easy and gripping read. Don't be afraid...just get the book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have always been a huge Dostoyevsky fan and I think that this book is his finest in a long line of good books. It is a dark novel of that will haunt you for days after you have read the epilogue. Raskolnikov is a fascinating main character that you can't help but like even if he is a petty criminal. It is a good read that has some literary weight and will keep you interested until the very end. I recommend it to everyone who wants to read a good book that is more than just fluff."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book of my own accord during the summer before I started college. Honestly, there could have been no better book for me to read. With the bigheadedness and desire to prove something that often come hand in hand with higher education, a student must always check himself so as not to start down the wrong path towards egotism. Egotism will surely lead to thoughts of one's own superiority. This is where the main character in 'Crime and Punishment' goes wrong. He fancies himself a genius and an anomoly among the 'idiots' in St. Petersburg. Therefore, if he were to exceed the law in order to further his own genius for the betterment of humanity (like, for instance, Napolean) it would be perfectly legitimate. One problem: Rodya is a bigheaded student with a thirst to prove something and, unfortunately, is not a genius nor does he offer anything to justify a crime by way of societal betterment.Along his psychological journey through guilt, self-righteousness, egotism, arrogance, intolerance, and frustration; he finds simplicity and relentless care through some of the most absurdly 'un-genius' and 'common' of folk. Rodya finds a student unwilling to accept the bitterness of men even beyond the most brutal verbal assualts, a woman unreasonably devoted to a hopeless family and a non-existent God (at least in Rodya's mind), and a sister who does not need to ponder the complexities of life and take into account her tribulations in order to love her exsitence without reservation.'Crime and Punishment' is thought-provoking, powerful, sometimes tragic, oftentimes absurdly funny and witty, and ultimately uplifting. Here's an except of the book that clearly shows its message: \\"[Rodya] dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a terrible new strangle plague...Some new sorts of microbes were attackning the bodies of men, but these microbes were endowed with intelligence and will...Never had men considered themselves so intellectual and so completely in possession of truth as these sufferers, never had they considered their decisions...so infallible...Each thought that he alone had the truth...Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite.\\" Sorry, long excerpt, but Dosteovsky's intent was to say that if every man took the time to dissected the complexities of life and form their own opinions on every topic; then firstly, no one would have time for happiness; secondly, those opinions would evolve into forceful convictions causing everyone to argue and later kill everyone else in the name of some ridiculous opinion; thridly, nothing would be making the world turn if there were no working class; and finally, every man would be imprisoned by the ferocity and supposed 'infallibility' of his own independent thought. I love Dosteovsky...bloody genius!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a complex, rich, and deeply satisfying work. Indeed, the story is far too complex to relate it in this space. What you need to know is that the story centers around the consequences of one man's horrible action, committing a murder. Much of the story is spent exploring the psychology of guilt and what happens to this man when he breaks so thoroughly with the his own human nature.The author shows, in detail, what becomes of men and society when intellectualism, individualism, and all of the many other 'isms that affected Russia at the time this story was written are taken to their logical conclusion. Humans are more than the sum of their thoughts, and tradgedy is sure to ensue when we shut off the rest of our nature.Ultimately, Crime and Punishment is a morality tale. What happens when men refuse the mores of a society to prove that they are unneeded? What happens when men convince themselves that they are special and above the law?This story is long, complex, and rich. Do not try to rush through it. Read this in the quiet times of your day and absorb each part slowly. You'll find it to be the literary equivalent of an extremely fine wine."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov's moral dilemma, the beautiful Russian person and place names -- the marvelous way they roll around on the tongue, and the vivid historical setting - czarist Russia, make Crime and Punishment a classic of 19th Century world literature.Dostoevsky's masterpiece should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves well educated, as it carefully and artfully melds together a classic philosophical quandary with fantastic literary craftsmanship. Particular attention obviously should be directed towards Raskolnikov's wrestling with his own mind and ethical precepts. Most readers can assuredly relate to similar questions of value in their own lives.Homicide's never been analyzed in such depth from the perspective of the perpetrator who of course happens to be the protaganist. It's this angle that Dostoevsky takes particular advantage of and makes the book hard to put down."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is perhaps the original psychological thriller and suspense novel. A young, disaffected student, Raskolnikov, ruminates over the nature of his own miserable poverty, drops out of school and is consumed with his romantic condition of ennui. (Today- a clinical depression.) In a stupor, and supposing himself to be merely reviewing the possibilities, he murders an old moneylender and then, to save his skin, he murders her sister. Although he feels no 'conscious' remorse, he swoons in halluncinatory fever and betrays himself by his shaking hands, hypervigilant questions and sleep talk. The rest of the novel is a sort of \\"Tell Tale Heart\\" of suspicion, strange accusers and sudden dream walks which take him to the crime scene and thus alert his would-be captors. The inner torment and the outer pursuit merge together- he cannot tell what is real and what is a dream. Neither can the reader.C&P; is Dowstoyevski's most accessible novel and the only one that can be enjoyed for the story alone. Except for the end, which drags on too much for my patience, the tale moves briskly with edge of the seat tension, swerves and turns in the plot and not a little vice. Of the latter there is drunkenness, prostitution, rape and shameless misuse of money and trust. There is constant uncertainty and characters who are not what they appear. Raskolnikov, and other ambiguously moral characters suddenly arise as generous, selfless and sympathetic. Similary they are enormously cold and cruel, often to their beloveds and dependents. Typical for his age and status our hero is full of weak theories and flabby nihilism. The author takes aim at those upper class Marixist apologists prophetically imagining the blood and anarchy that would soon envelop Russian destiny. He pokes fun as well at the pompous adherents of the \\"new\\" science of psychology. Seeing into the future, no wonder, he was dreary and reactionary. There are a handful of those comic asides- not nearly as many as in Karamazov and his shorter novels, but a fairly good stab is taken at the latest literary artists- at himself.His struggle and the manic extremes in the nation and his individual soul is, the bare force that burnt away creatively and timelessly.Great book- for the story and then for the cross-section of that time and unique place, Petersburg, post- Napoleon and pre-Revolution."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky at his best. The author manages to capture the mind of a killer like no other. Although the book is long I read it in only a couple of weeks because I just couldn't set it down. The story is very riveting.

He combates rationalism and nihilism and demonstrates the Orthodox Christian ideal in the character of Sophia."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is my all time favorite book.

It is an intense Russian Classic without the 4-digit page numbers."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"What's most fascinating about Crime and Punishment that I have not read in the other reviews here is that Dostoyevski has the incredible ability to make the reader feel true empathy for the main character while simultaneously experiencing disgust, pitty and at times extreme frustration. The setting is bleak beyond reality, yet the author creates a a world in which the reader can smell the the dank, desperation of alcoholics, lost souls, and those who have completely given up hope, yet accept their lot in life without taking recourse against their oppressors, except,of course, R. The late 1800s in Russia was a very harsh, lonely and fearful place to live. In light of the tragic life that Dostoyevski himself lived, this work of art all the more important. In many ways he's been in R.'s shoes."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Only after the dust settled did my psyche follow suit. This masterpiece delves into every sentient sphere: at once prompting laughter, commiseration, and angst.

As a Napoleon, a superior to those &quot;ordinary fools&quot;, he feels he has the right and motive to kill an old woman money-lender and free himself from poverty. The hideous guilt that builds up and somewhat destroys the young man's soul creats a web of intimacy and tension. This novel haunts and disturbs. How can a murder be justifiable? This one is.If you're a sensitive and easily frustrated person, I do no recommend this book to you. Dostoyevesky's depiction of this murder from the opening pages thrills the reader to a somewhat unbearable degree."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In this book Dostoyefsky actually mananges to get into the mind of a man who is slowly going mad. As he examines his personal philosophies and how they clash with his conscience, you are given such an astonishing view of this mans tormented thoughts---sometimes it makes you want to scream out loud as you suffer with him in his indecision.

The quality of the audio is also top notch. While listening to this story I found myself feeling like I was right there as this version does a great job of immersing the listener in 18th Century Russia. I would highly recommend this version of the classic for anyone looking to explore the world of Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"When I first picked up this book, I assumed the title defined the story in the \\"classic\\" sense - a criminal committed some henious act and was sent to prison, where the bulk of the tale would be told. I expected a look at a Russian prison in the 19th century, but I was surprised by the content.Dostoevesky, who was sent into exile in Siberia, wrote a pyschological thriller - long before the genre of 'thriller' was ever invented. Rather than focusing on the criminal's time in prison, he focused on the criminal's mindset and the intellectual torture that he put himself through. Rodion Raskolnikov, a young man, was a murderer; he killed two women; one intentionally, the other only a victim of circumstance. Raskolnikov then struggles with the crime he has committed and tries to explain to himself why he should (or should not) confess to the crime. During his neurotic episodes, we meet unforgettable characters such as Porfiry Petrovich of the police department, who (in my opinion) probably was the basis for the modern day Detective Columbo of television fame. Porfiry has a way of asking questions that force Raskolnikov to think about his crime and nearly leads him to break down. Even though Raskolnikov never confesses to Porfiry, the two men develop quite an intriguing relationship, one that fascinates the reader for many pages.I think I could go on & on about with praise and quips from this book, but if I did my review would be a hundred pages long and might dissuade people from reading it. Don't read this just because it has been tagged with the label \\"classic\\" by every modern publisher. Read it becuase it is a thrilling, page turning, escape into 19th century Russia and the psychological thoughts of a killer who believes he has killed because he is \\"above the law\\". Great book - wish I'd read it many years ago!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The first 100 pages and the last 100 pages are impeccable. But whats in between is un-needed informtion pretaining to the story."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is a good high school read and I'm still enjoying reading this novel! Thanks to betterbooks I got a great price on this book.Getting this book for a cent was not a crime and reading it is defiantly not a Punishment, it is an engaging selection to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is, at surface and in heart, a psychological investigation into the mind of a man who commits a crime - a crime he feels justified in doing - but ultimately, a crime he fails to reconcile. As a student, the protagonist (a man named Raskolnikov) is well versed in the philosophical theories of his day, and has even written a published paper - specifically on the idea of the 'extraordinary' man. Raskolnikov's 'extraordinary man' is tantamount to Nietzsche's 'superman,' in that both represent a man of the modern era: The godless man, the man who suffers not from pangs of morality or conscience but is able to shape his will and coerce the world into supplication. There are other factors that fuel Raskolnikov's motives; he is impoverished, he is indebted to his family to be their savior...but still, he seems to cite his 'theory' most of all - and indeed, the novel, to a great extent, deals with the incompatibility between his theory on paper and its practical application. More obtusely, what happens when the incalculable nature and conscience of a man is entered into an otherwise elegant equation or theory? Dostoyevsky portrays the protagonist as not only a typical man, but an overly generous one...someone who partially justifies his act as not only beneficial to himself, but also, to the good of humanity. This is where the idea of the 'extraordinary man' and the main character diverge, as the protagonist observes the affects of his action on his surroundings, friends, and loved ones. Perhaps if Raskolnikov were more rational, cold, or calculating, he would have been able to murder without conscience, succeed in his theory and plan - the author seems to suggest - at the same time proposing that such men are, if not impossible, very unlikely. There is much to the book besides this idea however, and often the narrative focuses on other characters or strays into sub-plots to further illustrate minor points or arguments...or just to tell an interesting story, for this work is nothing if not entertaining. It is also interesting to note that, at the end of the novel, and be warned this is something of a spoiler, the protagonist reaps inadvertent benefits that otherwise would not have come to pass...as beauty from ugliness, light from darkness, ect. This is a very good novel, and Dostoyevesky is adept at obscuring his point, so much so that the novel lends itself to a wide variety of interpretations (some of which are cited at the end of the Pocket Books edition.) As far as the translation and notes go, they serve their purpose and the narrative remains clear to the English reader. There are however, a few phrases in German and French that receive no notes, but you can ascertain their meaning from the context."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is a must read for them who love literature and to find out why he was called the writer of the writers.This piece of work proves it again as well as his other master works do.Its a work which creates a reflection so clear and yet so sophisticated that it stays with you as long as you are travelling in the world of art.Its so detail and its every inch depicts so much.Dont just read it, try to absorb it.you will find the glory."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"My interest in this volume was initially piqued by the fact that Sidney Monas was my \\"Russian Intellectual History\\" professor at UT-Austin in Spring 1982. Seeing his translation of Dostoyevsky's famous book on the shelf at the University Co-op, I had to swoop it up.And the result? Ultimately, it affected my life enormously. Without that chance occurrence, I likely wouldn't have become Orthodox, learned classical Greek, or made Russian History my outside field in grad. school at UVA, or Eastern Christianity my non-history field.This great book -- and unlike most readers, I consider it Dostoyevsky's (my favorite author's) greatest book -- is worthy of reading on several different levels. It is simply a great crime story. It is a wonderful philosophical statement. It has amazing theological insight. It takes William Gilmore Simms' invention -- the narrative told from inside the protagonist's head -- about as far as that 19th-century discovery can be taken.Read this book for the fun of it. Read it for the art of it. Read it for the insight it offers. Read it to find out what Christian salvation means; no other work of fiction does a better job of explaining that."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fantastic work of russian literature that truly delved solely into the minds of a criminal and got me to love Russian authors such as Turngev and others of the sort.

I marvel at how anyone can not give this book a 5 out of 5, or how anyone can call Shakespeare the greatest writer of all time. My only answer would be that some people are simply not ready to tackle some of the ideas presented in Crime and Punishment."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This novel is a psychological profile of a normal youth who becomes a murderer through convincing himself that he is above morality and social standards that apply to everyone else. He manages this by creating his own morality-the morality of a mentally disturbed individual.And the enviroment of a large city is most conducive to such a dark transformation;in fact, Dostoevsky recognizes the pernicious and assidious dangers that lurk in vast cities where individuals become faceless and are only noticed when they snap.I got the impression that Raskolnikov was merely searching for attention in a city that disregarded the poor and downtrodden, thereby intensifying his rage against those whom he despised already. The concept of this novel is not too original, but the way that concept is handled certainly proves that Dostoevsky was able to look into the human mind, as it underwent a transformation from normal to demented. He intelligently and artistically captures the smallest biological changes that accopanied his anti-heroes metamorphises.The side characters, I think, are left intentionally underdeveloped so as to allow maximum space for Raskolnikov's change. The profound observastion and artistic incompareability of this novel prove that Dostoevsky truly does deserve his place as the greatest writer of all time. The theme is not uncommon, but the masterful handling of it is. Anyone who likes whodunnits written by a true literary genius should read this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"An outstanding example of Russian Literature.

Both men have a searing intensity &amp; unflinching honesty that will leave you gasping. Dostoyevsky's greatness comes from the fact that he gives philosophical ideas a human face that we can empathise with (or rocoil in horror from). The question here is: can there be redemption from unspeakable acts. Roskolnikov murders for no reason, trying to rationalize his action saying it is for the common good &amp; later insisting he is beyond morality (shades of Nietsche). To the possibilty of redemption, Dostoyevsky answers yes, via Christianity. I say no. Read the book. Make up you own mind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"It is about the crimes which are affected by societies.If you have some problems or some disagreements in your life ,it can't prevent your hearth from love..."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book for the first and only time when I was sixteen-I have since bought a new translation and I am waiting for the perfect time to reread it. This is one of the first major novels that I have ever read and Dostoyevsky has never let me down since. The book is a painting, and F.D. is a master-that is not disputed- but he is an uncommon master. This book is personal and intense, so early on there is a long letter from Raskolnikov's family-this man lives outside of himself, and within others, what a strange man. The book is like a piece by Mozart- not too long, not too short, with just the right amount of notes/words, and if just one piece is taken away, it is lost."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"My name is Robert Engelberts from Voerendaal, The Netherlands, mailing from Sittard. I'm a young writer and warm admirer of Fyodor M. Dostoyewski. Since I still haven't read &quot;Brat'ja Karamazovy&quot; I won't rate this book ten... But it's awfully close to it... Who read Dostojewski's biography will know he wasa man imprisoned in the deadcell, waiting forexecution by a firepeloton... At the last moment(the riflemen were loading their guns) he wasgranted life... He wasn't executed, butsend him to a prisonerscamp no where elsethan in the midle of Siberia... So close was theworld to lose one of his greatest literarygeniuses... Who knows this, Dostoyewski'sbackground, will certainly want to knowwhat a man with this kind of life will write...Allthough with a dark look on the world,Dostoyewski is not without hope. Raskolnikov,suffering from guilt because of what he did,is being read from the Bible by his girlfriend:Jezus' resurrection of Lazarus... RaskolnikovCAN get a better man, there WILL be a wayfor him to live with the horrible thing he did...Just like in &quot;Poor People&quot; Dostyewsky's excently cappable of painting the misery and seemlingly hopeless lives of the poor... Of Rascolnikov who KNOWS he can do more, but isn't alloud by the society... The diabolic logic he uses to justify his crime.. And the akward loads of guilt he sufferes of after it...After reading this you should think C&amp;P is aboring, dark book about a man constantlytalking to himself about the &quot;bad things&quot; hedid... Far from it! Oh yes, Raskolniv does talkto himself - a lot as a matter of fact - but thebest Russian writer ever (couldn't we leavethat &quot;Russian&quot;?) knows very well thatstory = conflict: the protagonist intense wrestlingwith his infernal antagonist...

If you can get past some minor mispronunciations, it is a great way to read the book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Anthony Heald's reading of \\"Crime and Punishment\\" is a marvel. Any reading of a book of this intricacy, with all of the voices, intonations, and length, is a tall task. What's more, the reader must have an outstanding grasp of the material, especially considering the psychology and philosophy that are so deeply embedded in Dostoevsky's texts. Given all of these considerations, Heald pulls off what is, in my mind, one of the best readings of a book ever. As someone categorically opposed to audiobooks, I find myself having relented on this one, because of how enjoyable this reading is!In addition, Heald does not make any of the errors in pronunciation that one might come to expect from a Westerner's reading of \\"Crime and Punishment.\\" The only thing more irritating than a mispronunciation of names is having to decipher the translated text through a thick Russian accent. I am pleased to report that neither of these concerns are an issue in Heald's reading.Finally, I must make some comment about the wonderful theatrical ability that Anthony Heald demonstrates. Many book readers fail to understand just how important it is to perform the book while reading it. Actors, like Heald, know the importance of different techniques and gestures, even though they are giving a presentation in audio format. Traditional book readers miss this all together, but anyone who watches a Hollywood audio recording for an animated film has seen that the actors perform while recording audio. The effect of this, sometimes subtle, sometimes very notable, is an aesthetic that really gets the listener into and feeling what the book is trying to convey. Also, this challenges the quality of the recording itself, which, I must say, stands the test, as all Blackstone audiobooks do.This reading of Crime and Punishment is an absolute joy, so I hope you partake!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"After reading a number of the new and celebrated Russian translators, I came back to this old version of Crime and Punishment and realized what I had been missing. The newer translators may be technically more accurate. And from time to time the may seem more colloquial. But they never capture the verve and the passion that epitomizes the great Russians. This novel especially flourishes under the hand of Garnett, who got not just the language and the culture but the essential frenzy of Dostoyevsky."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"My reading of Crime and Punishment was the start of what I hope to be a revisiting of numerous Russian classics. I read all the big guns (barring War and Peace) many years ago and, quite frankly, got NOTHING out of them. I was confused, bored, confused, unable to wade through the thick writing, confused and, lastly, confused.I should probably address my confusion. I am, in real life as well as in art, an absolute clod at handling peoples' names. And it is common in the writing of many languages for characters to be referred to with various handles. In Russian you have the complete name, the last name, and the familiar name all interchanged willy nilly. So your main character will be Raskolnikov for the first ten pages and then suddenly someone named Rodya will be addressed. And you're supposed to know with zero instruction that this is Raskolnikov's nickname, or familiar address. Which is fine. I shorten Elizabeth to Liz or Thomas to Tom or Richard to Dick (though I've never understood that last one). But when it's a nickname for a giant name in a foreign language that I hadn't grasped much to begin with and has very little to do with the original name and there is zero hand-holding given...well I get lost. Combine three names per character with 12 or 13 main characters and for me it's a complete cluster-f**k of proper nouns that I have a hard time keeping straight.Ten years ago I was lost, now I managed to keep my head in the game and sort out what name referred to whom with, for me, shocking accuracy.I know that seems like a terribly superficial thing to dwell on, but nothing has effected my ability to enjoy Russian literature more than this. And I'm not saying it should change, again, this is standard fare for many languages, but man does it make for some rough going.Okay, that's out of the way, now onto the book. The book is awesome. Somehow I missed this ten years ago. It's a brilliantly gripping story of murder told mainly through the eyes of the murderer. Raskolnikov's madness and rambling thoughts are beautifully painted as well as his struggles during lucid moments to come to terms with what he actually believes. This struggle takes place amid tons of philosophical ramblings from all the characters. But the philosophies discussed were only barely overwritten (I generally have little patience for authors who let a character take ten pages to pontificate on their personal philosophy...a few sentences, sure, but I've never been out drinking and heard anyone talk for twenty minutes straight about the nature of man. It just doesn't happen and whenever I catch an author doing this it pulls me out of the story). The cast of characters were interesting, the numerous subplots of blackmail, coercion, love and desperate attempts to cling to the past were all fascinating. Not to mention you get a very interesting twist on the classic Who-Done-It here where...well you *know* \\"Who Did It.\\" You watch him do it. And yet the book manages to keep the police investigation interesting and believable as well as cast just enough doubt on what on earth actually happened due to Raskolnikov's somewhat unreliable viewpoint.And then, after all of this, at the end, you are suddenly given just a stunningly beautiful affirmation of humanity and love that came so out of nowhere yet had a perfect foundation under it that I got chills up and down.I can't wait to read this again in ten years...maybe even less...depends on how long War and Peace takes me."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I remembered reading this back in High school, and hating it! I thought the plan was completely dull and lacked any excitement that I guess I was used to seeing on TV. Reading now, about a decade later, feels like reading through completely different eyes and definately more meaningful to me now. I guess its more about how much I can relate to how he thinks when faced with such adversity and misery while goingn through the \\"lows\\" in his life. The feeling of sinking lower and lower I think its captured perfectly and I guess its a classic for a reason. Great read but not for everyone."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Book is compact, beautifully bound, gilt-edged with gilded letters on cover. 735 pages.

To others, it may be just another grim Russian novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment is the first classic detective story. But that is not even where it excels. With the Brothers Karamazov, it elevated Dostoyevsky to a mega writer when it comes to dissecting the mind and soul of characters for the readers. It is a great book of psychology. While it competes with Anna Karenina as the most widely read 19th century Russian novel in the English-speaking world, it is judged by many to be superior in its depth and lessons. The book's hero exemplifies all young ideologues who are wrestling with a new idea which they think can elevate them to the levels of great historic figures in their initial steps towards greatness. Often, a barrier has to be crossed which takes the potential legendary figure into an irreversible course. In Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov who is the hero is a poor, intelligent and thoughtful student who is convinced that he has a mission for the advancement of mankind. He convinces himself that the mission has to start with him crossing over to greatness by robbing and killing an old woman, a pawnbroker, whose death, he had convinced himself would do the world more good than harm. This conviction is based on his judgment that she cheats her clients and holds money that could be used for humanity. He then commits the murder, but is forced to kill the pitiful Elizabetha, the landlady's sister. The novel begins its twists and turns after these murders, with the introduction of the cunning detective who gets to investigate the murder and makes Raskolnikov his principal suspect. Raskolnikov gets to meet the destitute Marmeladovs through the alcoholic father, and is distraught by the plight of his consumptive mother, her three young children, and Sonya-Marmeladov's eighteen-year old daughter who is forced into prostitution in order to support the family.By doing a rich psychology development of his characters, Dostoyevsky made his characters more complexly human, yet reachable. Sonya emerges as a saintly figure who sins for the sakes of those she loves , and who is the mirror through which the so-called devilish characters are redeemed. The plot is rich, deep, enjoyable and action-packed; and the pace is fast and engaging. The overriding strength of the story is the conflict in Raskolnikov's soul, a conflict which began in his quest to be the \\"Extraordinary Man\\" like Napoleon, by stepping over the basic bounds of morality by committing murder. Conflict in the soul is a rich theme which I also saw in the story The Union Muzhik. That conflict in his soul brought out the rich ideas, discussions and emotions from the characters that interacted with him."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The price is pretty steep for a book you can dl for free -- even from Amazon for free.

If you do the \\"Look Inside\\" thing on this book, you'll see the inside of another version of the book, NOT the one you will receive.To give you a few quotes from the publishers website: \\"We created your book using OCR software ..... with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....

When you look at the (paperback) edition of Crime and Punishment translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, it says right below it, \\"Start reading Crime and Punishment on your Kindle...\\" and also lists the different versions available - paperback, hardcover, etc. - and includes a Kindle Edition. But when you click on either, you get this, which is a completely different translation. Pevear and Volokhonsky have been widely praised, their translations now considered far and away the best English versions available of various classic works of Russian Literature. But Amazon lumps everything with the same title as if it were the same product. Some of the customer-uploaded images of the book's cover even say that it is the Pevear and Volokhonsky version, but it is not. It's a 1914 translation by Constance Garnett.This is the reason people started to hate big box and online bookstores when they first started putting neighborhood bookstores out of business -- because they don't seem to care about books, just making money. But what's funny here is that they could actually charge money for the better translation, since it's new, but instead they choose to give away an inferior version and pretend it's the same thing. (They do offer the Pevear and Volokhonsky version of Demons for a price - a version easier to distinguish because the newer translation even changes the title from the less-accurate The Possessed - versions with that title are available for free.) Also, because they don't distinguish between different translations, there is no button available under the Pevear and Volokhonsky version to request that the publisher make it available for Kindle.It's also difficult to know what version of a book is being reviewed sometimes. I'll be reading reviews on the Kindle Edition page, and the reviewer will describe the fine leather binding. This is especially frustrating now that I realize the actual content - the language - of the book I'm buying could be different from the one I read about online.Since getting my Kindle, I've been impressed by the machine itself, but thoroughly unimpressed by Amazon's handling of content. They should focus less exclusively on getting people to buy the device, and work harder at improving the way they sell books and other content for it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I initially approached this book with a great deal of trepidation. I had never read Dostoyevsky, and was concerned that I would get bogged down in some lengthy, mind-numbingly boring, nineteenth-century treatise on the bestial nature of man or something. I am happy to report this is not the case. Instead, and to my delight, it is a smoothly flowing and fascinating story of a young man who succumbs to the most base desire, and the impact this has both psychologically and otherwise on himself and those around him.To be sure, the book seems wordy in places, but I suspect this has to do with the translation. And what translator in his right mind would be bold enough to edit the great Dostoyevsky? But this is a very minor problem.What we get with Dostoyevsky is dramatic tension, detailed and believable human characters, and brilliant insight into human nature. Early in the novel our hero meets and has a lengthy conversation with Marmeladov, a drunkard. This conversation is never uninteresting and ultimately becomes pathetic and heartbreaking, but I kept wondering why so much time was spent on it. As I got deeper into the book, I understood why this conversation was so important, and realized that I was in the hands of a master storyteller. This is also indicative of the way in which the story reveals itself. Nothing is hurried. These people speak the way we actually speak to one another in real life, and more importantly, Dostoyevsky is able to flesh out his characters into whole, three-dimensional human beings.And what a diverse group of characters! Each is fleshed out, each is marvelously complex. Razujmikhin, the talkative, gregarious, good-hearted, insecure and destitute student; Sonia, the tragic child-prostitute, with a sense of rightness in the world; Petrovich, the self-important, self-made man, completely out of touch with his own humanity; Dunia, the honorable, wronged sister: we feel like we know these people because we've met people like them. They fit within our understanding of the way human beings are.Dostoyevsky also displays great insight into human nature. Svidrigailov, for example, talks of his wife as liking to be offended. &quot;We all like to be offended,&quot; he says, &quot;but she in particular loved to be offended.&quot; It suddenly struck me how true this is. It gives us a chance to act indignantly, to lash out at our enemies, to gain favor with our allies. I don't believe I've ever seen this thought expressed in literature before. In fact, it never occurred to me in real life! Petrovich, Dunia's suitor, not only expects to be loved, but because of his money, and her destitution, he expects to be adored! To be worshipped! He intentionally sought out a woman from whome he expected to get this, and is comletely flummoxed when she rejects him. His is an unusual character, but completely realized.There is so much more to talk about: the character of Raskolnikov, which is meticulously and carefully revealed; the sense of isolation which descends on him after committing his crime; the cat and mouse game played on him by the police detective. I could go on and on. I haven't even mentioned the historical and social context in which this takes place. Suffice to say this is a very rich book.Do not expect it to be a rip-roaring page turner. Sit down, relax, take your time, and savor it. It will be a very rewarding experience. And thank you SL, for recommending it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you read one murder novel in the rest of your life, read \\"Crime and Punishment\\" by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It's only 500 pages but it speaks volumes.I discovered Dostoyevsky a few months ago while I was deployed to Iraq and my literary world will never been the same.I found a copy of \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" in a pile of miscellenious books that had been dedicated to troops to boost morale and took it to a literary savvy Lt. Col. I knew. When I showed him my find, he insisted I read Crime and Punishment first. I'm certainly glad I decided to take his advice.Crime and Punishment tells the story of a brutal murder in pre- revolutionary Russa and the emotional torment of the eccentric murderer, Raskolnikov. The book is as dark and suspenseful as anything I've ever read, but it also manages to convey things on the opposite end of the emotional spectrum like redemption and love. My favorite passage of the book (a hard pick, for sure) is when Porfiry, a jovial but formitable detective, interrogates Raskolnikov.The deployment is over, but my infatuation with Dostoyevsky's books has just begun. I'm now reading \\"The Idiot\\" and enjoying it, though it's too early to see if it matches \\"Crime and Punishment.\\"Whether you are deployed to the farthest reaches of the world or sitting comfortably at home, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" promises to be an exhilerating read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I chose to read this book in my quest to read all those books I was supposed to read in school and never did.

The book had a lot more action than I expected, an amazing story line, great characters, and some of the best writing I've read. I started this book expecting to dislike it, and now it's my second favorite book I've ever read.If you have a kindle and are looking for a new book to read, there is absolutely NO reason you shouldn't get this book.

There are many books that stay with a person, days or weeks after reading them, but Crime and Punishment is one of the few that live on forever. After reading the book, my eyes have been opened to the light of the human soul. Raskolnikov, the central character, is an unmotivated, destitute man. He is symbolic of the so called &quot;dirt&quot;, that the world tries so desperately to rid. The novels plot is tight as they come, but it is Dostoevsky's supreme insight and reality into the mind of a killer, Raskolnikov, that makes this novel a testament to genius. Some may read this novel to be &quot;well-read&quot;, I say read this novel to gain the foothold to the bottom of your own soul. It will help you gain the realization of self, with a better understanding of the society that can bring men down and subsequently lift them up.

This is a deep book with a lot of philosophical and practical insights into the human condition. I don't like to sound cliched, but truly, the stories and ideas it tells is timeless, and as such, relevant even until today. It engaged me to read and reflect on my own life and thoughts; among other things, it made me realize how wonderfully, wonderfully lucky I am in my circumstances despite my everyday complaints. It is a tale of life told through the lens of a man, much like you and me, full of conviction, ambition, and inner conflict. It is a story of possibility, irony, tragedy, and hope."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is Dostoevski's greatest masterpiece.

If your favorite author is John Grisham or Stephen King, you should skip it, because the ideas presented are so deep and masterful, you must peel the layers off each character slowly and painfully to fully understand and comprehend the vision Dostoevski was trying to convey.Crime and Punishment is the one book of Dostoevski's which is different from his other four big novels. In the Possessed, Brothers Karamozov, Idiot, and Raw Youth, Dostoevski usually presents his structure very much like a play. He introduces his characters and like the end of a first act, he has them come together in one room and something dramatic happens, whether it is Natasha throwing money in the fire, or Stavrogin getting slapped in the face. Crime and Punishment does not follow his usual form. The drama occurs in the very first chapters and the rest unfolds itself through that one act. This is a book of religious affirmation, don't forget that when reading, and Dostoevski makes a personal statement at the end which should not be brushed off. The story is thrilling and intellectual, but it's up to you, the reader, to make it so, because the book itself can't do it. It's you actively thinking about the various ideas presented that will create the images needed to absorb the brilliance you keep hearing about."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"When I was a literature student in college, Ray Malbone, the professor who taught the English Novel said to us on the first day of class \\"You are here to save your souls.\\" What he meant was, that great novelists are always aiming to persuade you to enter into and adopt their worldview. Dostoevsky was literally out to 'save the soul' of Russia from the corruption of alien thinking that had invaded her intellectual life and dragged her people away from simple orthodoxy.One generally reads this novel as a young person, when one is, like Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, experimenting with extreme ideas. Don't be even momentarily deceived by all the excursions into Neitsche-like ideas of freedom from restraint. Instead, recognize that Dostoevsky was not just a religious conservative but an outright reactionary, and you won't lose your way in any of the tangled thoughts and specious arguments that tangle young Rodya's literally and figuratively fever-tortured brain. Make no mistake about it, Rodya has sinned against God and his neighbor, and he must be 'born again' to get out of the dreadful mess he's wandered into.So what makes this novel not a tract that would bore us, but a deeply moving psychic journey that draws us with its tension and distress?First, this isn't really a story about what a murderer is like. For that, go and read \\"The Devils\\" or \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" in which you will see the disgusting and horrifying spectacles of lost souls working out their foul destinies. Rodion is NOT like a murderer. That is the most striking thing about him. Indeed, almost any reader will admit to having identified with him and feeling great sympathy for his anguish at almost all times during the novel. He deeply loves his mother and sister. We learn that he has done heroic actions in saving children from a fire. He finds himself again and again unable to restrain impulses of the deepest generosity--saving an abandoned and drunken waif from a predatory man, listening with compassion to a drunkard, carrying that same drunkard home when he is broken and dying, emptying his pockets to the last kopeck to help his family, treating the man's young, prostituted daughter with respect and honor. To Dostoevsky, Rodya represents the finest among young Russian intellectuals.What happens to him then? He becomes possessed or obsessed with those French-German ideas that have invaded the motherland. It's not so much that he THINKS his way to this murder, as that the depraved philosophies of the west get into him like a bacterium or a virus and possess his will, until he is compelled to carry out an action he knows beforehand (as he realizes afterward) will make him know that he is 'no better than a louse.'The true greatness of the novel is in Dostoevsky's astonishingly acute observation of every thought, grimace, and piece of behavior produced by Raskolnikov when he is in this sick state of mind and soul. Hard to remember that the novel was written well before modern psychiatric theory was propounded--so precisely does Dostoevsky distinguish each outward and visible sign of the unconscious drive toward truth, confession, and atonement that possesses Raskolnikov's whole being the moment the compulsion to do murder has its denouement in ghastly action.I give this novel four stars not because it isn't great--it is--but because Dostoevsky went on to write far greater things. This is best read first among Dostoevsky's novels, because later ones are darker and more difficult to decipher. Readers won't be a bit lost in this straightforward wtory, as long as they hold fast to the knowledge that Christianity--specifically Russian Orthodox Christianity as opposed to Roman Catholicism--is where Dostoevsky keeps his moral center firmly fixed."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the second book I have read by Dostoyevsky, although I wish I had read it before &#34;Notes From The Underground.&#34; If you are a fan of Russian Literature then this is essential reading.The struggle that exists on the plane of life between guilt, remorse, and murder is unfathomable. Dostoyevsky clearly and fundamentally points out the struggle between distinguishing genius and madness.Before reading &#34;Crime and Punishment&#34; I was convinced it couldnt get any better than Leo Tolstoy's &#34;War and Peace&#34; and &#34;Anna Karenina&#34;, and I was wrong. Dostoyevsky proves to be oneof the greatest novelists of all time."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read the translation by McDuff. I thought the story was described at an extremely detailed pace, which I didn't like at first. I actually stopped reading after the murder scene, but finished the book two years later. I do think it is not an easy book to read for people who lack exposure to classical books or desire to be well read. For one thing, the book is filled with many conversations and speeches that seem to be long and boring ramblings.But I give five stars for one reason only. The stunning ending and conclusion of the book makes it worth every pain of reading this book. I also thought Sonia's reading of Lazarus story was absolutely powerful to the point of shaking as I was reading the book. McDuff notes that it was the climax of the book. I certainly agree, while same can be said about the confession scene.There are only few books which you will read and NOT forget. Crime and Punishment is an absolutely rare book. I guess a book dealing with the theme of conscience must be written in absolute mastery."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Ex-student Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov has a theory, and one that will change more than one life forever. He believes, with great conviction, that a genius has the moral right to commit murder, theft, and other crimes - just because he is intellectually \\"above\\" others. He believes this so thoroughly that he, believing himself something of a genius, murders a pawnbroker and her sister with an axe and steals the money they have accrued over the years. Just managing to escape, Raskolnikov sinks into a war with his conscience and a delerium that causes others to doubt him. After meeting a drunkard named Semion Marmeladov, Raskolnikov has bouts of generosity and conviction, helping their family with their debts, and then paying for Marmeladov's funeral when he is crushed by a wagon, all the while trying to justify his moral degradation. Then he meets Sonia, Marmeladov's oldest daughter, a young woman who has turned to prostitution to keep her family from sinking further into hunger and destitution. Raskolnikov befriends her, fascinated by the oxymoron she has created: a poor prostitute, sunk so low, who believes in the saving grace of Jesus Christ. In the end it is this, and his own raging conscience that bring him to justice.This is my second Dostoevsky novel, and I cannot say how much I enjoyed it. I don't even know where to start, I have so much to say - there's so much to mention, to bring to the table. However, I think I'll start Dostoevsky's incredible (almost super human) ability to create characters.Having read Dostoevsky before, I knew I was going to enjoy the characters. The characters in The Idiot stuck with me for a long time. In fact, as I write this, I can very clearly picture each character, what he/she was intended for in the story, and their personalities that are so impressioned into my mind. It is the same with Crime and Punishment. Raskolnikov's character alone is a masterpiece. His strange thought processes, his convictions, his awareness of all going on around him, his dilerium after he murders Lizaveta, and the new convictions that come about because of it all make up who he is and where he's going. As I started the book I wasn't as taken with him as I was Prince Myshkin in The Idiot, but as the story progressed and he changed, I felt a great attachment to him. While Myshkin was on the more talkative side, Raskolnikov was quiet, one who observes and reflects rather than speaks his mind. I felt sorrow for Raskolnikov because of the choices he made, but I loved him all the same as he tried his hardest to come to grips with the horrors of what he had done.Sonia's character is the more simple type, and a hard one to read about. After becoming a child prostitute at her step-mother's insistence, Sonia hates her life but continues living that way because her family needs the money. However, her simple and wonderful faith in Jesus Christ as a wretched sinner affects Raskolnikov in ways he cannot foresee at the time. Other characters in this story include Porfiry Petrovich, the police inspector, who, one word at a time, tries to squeeze the truth from Raskolnikov; Peter Petrovich, the fiance of Raskolnikov's sister Dunia; Marmeladov, Sonia's father; the mad Katerina Ivanovna, Marmeladov's wife; and Razmukhin, Raskolnikov's closest friend who wants to help and has a very innocent love for Dunia.Dostoevsky's writing is the next aspect that just gets me, in every way: his sentence structure, the way he describes scenes and objects, how he introduces characters...the purity of it all should be recognized for as long as books are in print. I felt this way about The Idiot and I feel it now. Dostoevsky's writing makes you feel as though you're reading a dream. If you've ever wondered what a dream would be like if you could read it, I'm convinced this is it. It's perfectly smooth, like you're floating; and yet his topics are real, his characters are lively and relatable, and above all his stories pierce you deeply with their symbolism and their cunning. If only every author used a bit of Dostoevsky's methods in their works... If only the stories spoke of real and often dreadful things but still permeated with the kind of hope and love we see here, this world would cease to exist as we know it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This should be on your reading list; it will make all of your other picks look not just thin but insignificant."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevsky plunges us deeply into the psyche of Raskolnikov, a 23-year-old detached law student, to demonstrate the moral underpinnings of human conscience, implicitly rejecting the anti-humanist philosophy of 19th century nihilists. Smitten by his own published yet untried nihilistic theories of the human condition, Raskolnikov premeditates the murder of a miserly elderly pawnbroker, who causes more suffering in the lives of common people than is justifiable by Raskolnikov's arithmetic reasoning (\\"one death, and a hundred lives in exchange\\"). In a sophomoric attempt to mimic the violent though celebrated deeds of heroes such as Napoleon, who courageously rose above the law in the name of social change, Raskolnikov bluntly murders the pawnbroker and her sister with an axe, fortuitously leaving behind no physical evidence linking him to the crime scene. However, haunted by a lingering psychosomatic delirium and feverish emotional turmoil in the aftermath of his otherwise \\"perfect\\" murder, Raskolnikov succumbs to internal psychological stress in the days following his crime. Soon enough, his stained conscience forces confession, setting the stage for \\"the gradual renewal of a man,\\" a Lazarusian revival of the soul.I read Crime and Punishment following its citation by a teacher during a recent discussion of Akutagawa's Rashomon, a 1915 short story set in 11th century Japan, brought to public attention again in 1950 by Kurosawa's film of like title. In the short story, a starving, unemployed man of low social rank implusively steals the kimono of a similarly impoverished old woman, exhibiting amoral behavior paralleling hers--the old woman has been stealing hair from corpses to make wigs to survive, and she explains her appalling thievery to the man by remarking that the dead woman, whose shriveled scalp the old woman is disgustingly plucking hairs from, also cheated people when she was living, by selling snake meat as fish, in order to eek a living in hard times. In essence, according to Akutagawa (who incidentally committed suicide at the early age of 35), morality is fraught with ambiguity, and one's own need to survive can justify deliberate, lowly, even amoral means.For Dostoevsky, the answer to moral ambiguity lies in personal choice. To resolve his psychological struggle with his own conscience, Raskolnikov faces a choice between a) the immediate path of suicide, as chosen, for example, by the enigmatically generous Svidrigailov, who takes his own life by gunshot after failing to win the affection of Dounia, Raskolnikov's sister, and b) gradual regeneration of the soul, by suffering through the humiliation of an extended public criminal trial and the ensuing drudgery of years in a Siberian labor prison. Encouraged by the compassion of Sonia, the 18-year-old harlot-by-circumstance daughter of a clerk-turned-drunkard whom Raskolnikov encounters in a tavern days prior to the murder, Raskolnikov's moral awakening enables him to admit his blunders, focus beyond his present suffering, and, together with Sonia, patiently await \\"the dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life.\\"Apparently, then, Dostoevsky's message--reflective of his own life experiences, which included a period of incarceration and exile in Siberia (1849-1854) for membership in a liberal intellectual circle in autocratic mid-19th century Russia, and subsequent marriage to the wife of an acquaintance in Siberia after her husband's death--is that, not only do morals exist, but we also may choose to follow a moral path leading to eventual happiness and fulfillment, if we accept the interim punishment required to overcome our earlier moral missteps. Certainly, Akutagawa's cheating of customers, plucking hair from corpses, and stealing clothing are not so heinous crimes as Dostoevsky's premeditated double-murder, but both masterful literary creations disturbingly unsettle our emotions because, ultimately, like Raskolnikov, we humans cannot escape the inherent morality of our souls, even when our intellectual theories suggest otherwise."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky has crafted a monolithic work of literature in every respect here. This book contains all the elements of vintage Dostoevsky--unforgettable characters, a gripping plot, layers of meaning, captivating style and poignant sprinkles of humor. The book is broad in its scope, exploring numerous themes--alienation from society, criminal psychology, poverty, benevolence, confession, spirituality, redemption, love and more. As typical of Dostoevsky, however, it is the spiritual journey of one character that provides the central focus of the narrative. If you don't know much about Dostoevsky, I advise reading some about his life before beginning this novel (a good starting point is wikipedia.org/wiki/Dostoevsky). This novel will take you on a thought-provoking journey about the human heart and experience that you will not forget. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This review is a spoiler, so don't read it if you don't know how the book ends! But I want to focus on the ending--Tolstoy famously remarked of it that \\"once you start it, you immediately know how it will end.\\" And he was serious. And this sheds a great deal of light on this work and how it fits in with some of Dostoevsky's other masterpieces, such as the more restrained and better crafted Brothers Karamazov.Understanding Dostoevsky without Tolstoy is like understanding Levi-Strauss without Sartre. They were the two poles between which Russian literature was arraigned. They are treated as a binary opposition: the abstract vs. the concrete, the philosophical vs. the historical, the intellect vs. the soul, the symbolic vs. the sentimental.So how did Tolstoy know how it would end? Because the core of C&P;, as Tolstoy understood, was a Slavophilic call for a \\"return\\"--perhaps not a return to the land, but a return to orthodox Christian concepts and basic moral orderings. Since there is a cross-roads, one might as well kneel there. There is nothing else.So Tolstoy understood that once a crime has been committed, it ineluctably pushes the plot towards discovery, recognition and repentance. To have a plot break away from this would be either grasping for cheap effects or the grossest immorality, and no truly great Russian writer, no matter how philosophically inclined, could follow either of these paths.And yes, that does necessarily imply something sentimental. Because we are--as Dostoevsky beautifully says in The Brothers Karamazov--simple. (\\"As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naive and simple-hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.\\") Getting to the core of the matter will unveil simplicity--philosophy can get us to the point of throwing away false complications, but it cannot forever distract us from the fundamental simplicity of the opposition: right/sin.And yet, that is what most of us do--we use abstraction and symbolism to hold these simple truths at bay. When, like Raskolnikov, we find ourselves alone with our thoughts too much, these thoughts can seem more important than the simple issues of human life. Dwelling in a room in which he could reach out and touch opposite walls with each hand, the only expanse in which his soul could dwell was that of abstraction. (I know this feeling well, from living in a tent [see my review!] that was just about the size of his room, and with a substantially lower ceiling.) But no matter how you let your fancy fly, the chickens of violence always come home to roost.Perhaps because Dostoevsky was the one prone to symbolism, to craftiness as opposed to the rude directness that sometimes was the guiding impulse of Tolstoy's almost histrionic philosophizing, this admission of the fundamental Christian simplicity is truly moving. Dostoevsky is often considered a precursor of the existentialists but for very trivial reasons (e.g., serious mood swing issues). But one must see him as pursuing themes very similar to those of his rough contemporary Kierkegaard--can we free ourselves of excessive formal thinking and focus on the core issues of sin and repentance?I think the answer in both cases is actually no. Kierkegaard himself certainly couldn't [see my review!], and Dostoevsky was in some ways more of a ethnocentrist than Tolstoy. But more importantly, his characters only become in harmony with the world when they have some sort of lobotomy, not an enlightenment. He lacks the true sense of the emotional nature of repentance--something that occurs in humans who are by nature limited in their capacity to feel and comprehend--that we see in Tolstoy.I admit to being unusually interested in these themes. I've spent a long time repenting for a crime, even though it was, in the scheme of things, a minor one. No old ladies chopped, just some stretched--okay, false--testimony. But the reason for the crime was even more immoral than the crime itself. Too cowardly to just leave someone who loved me, I thought of an elaborate scheme to get her to reject me as too bothersome to put up with. Just the kind of thing Kierkegaard would do.Instead I found her, like Sonya in C&P;, clinging to me all the harder and shaming me with her decency, loyalty, and simplicity. And it is the character of Sonya that I find most perplexing. Her dogged insistence and her \\"sancta simplicitas\\" sometimes make her seem foolish (in contrast to the \\"wonderfulness\\" of Alyosha in the Brothers Karamazov, to whom she is often compared). She is friends with one of Raskolnikov's victims, Lizaveta, who is borderline retarded. (Here is also helps to compare to the Lizaveta in the Brothers Karamazov to get insight on what Dostoevsky is thinking.) It seems that there aren't too many viable options between stupid and bad. It's too Groucho Marx, but Raskolnikov on his way to Siberia must have wondered, \\"OK, I love you and you love me and that can be a form of redemption, or, maybe, it just means you are irredeemably stupid.\\" [45]"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The protagonist of this famous tale, Raskolnikov, has fallen to the depths of emotional and physical despair. Is there a way out of his abject poverty; a mind that will not shut off; his alcoholism; his fantasies of evil-acts, his utter Resentment of existence? In his mind, finally, there is hope, to bring his soul out from the gutter, an act of pure Will, that can lift him to a place where he is \\"meant\\" to be...and that is, pre-meditative Murder.It can be dangerous reading Dostoevsky because, as a writer, he has that uncanny ability to put the reader's mind into the mind of his characters.Reading Crime and Punishment, for me at least, had me agreeing with Raskolnikov, at times pushing him along to commit the act: commit murder because the writing had me truly believing that this most hidious act would bring him at least a glimmer of redemption. But, of course, after the 'act' (with an axe of all weapons), the guilt sets in and his life becomes even more a living hell. (Guilt is hell.)The paranoia of getting caught reaches mammoth levels, and he cannot live in his own skin anymore; in his mind he now IS in living hell.The protagonist finally admits to the crime and, comedically, (Dostoevsky's hate of any type of Russian bureaucracy) do not believe him!The most horrific scenes in literature of all time, for me, is the beating, on a busy street in St. Petersburg, of a horse by its sadistic owner to its slow and painful death. A beating that would turn anyone into a rage...This terrible image, so graphically written in detail, will remain with me forever.Does Raskolnikov finally attain his sought after redemption?There is something that changes within the man, but it is up to the individual reader to decide...one of the greatest books written in the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is regarded as one of the best books of all time by many, but few people have actually read it. While I read it, I didn't let the hype that surrounded it cloud my thoughts about it. It is one of the most interesting books that I have read, going into the mind of its protagonist far deeper than any other novel. However, I found some of Dosteyevsky's themes and beliefs offensive, especially his stereotypical view of Germans as fools with thick accents. His knowlege of the human mind is amazing, though, as he writes about multiple personalities and the subconscious many years before they were first suggested by Freud. This book is definitely not for the casual reader, and is tough going for about 100 pgs in the middle, but readers who make it through will be rewarded with some of the best writing ever. Don't read it because of the hype, read it for its fascinating and completely unique view of the criminal mind and a look into the thoughts and beliefs of a very complicated author."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is a moving story about sin, remorse, and partial redemption. Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was a master at character development and getting inside the souls of those he wrote about. This is the story of Raskolnikov, a destitute young student who decides to kill an old woman pawnbroker. The world would be better off without this old cheat, Raskolnikov decides in his self-appointed position as judge, jury and executioner. Of course, things don't go according to plan, and Raskolnikov ends up killing another person as well. The story then proceeds to Raskolnikov's conscience, the investigation, and the entry of other people into his life - including Sonya, a young woman forced into prostitution by economic necessity. Readers get a feel for city life in Czarist Russia circa 1866, plus its dire poverty and other problems.Russian literature can be difficult for English speakers, but this book is probably one of the easier works by Dostoyevsky (or other Russian novelist). This powerful tale of sin and redemption is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book when I was 13. I did not know nothing about russian literature and obviously never heard about Dostoevsky. Luckily, one day I found the book submerged in a sea of books in the bookseller, and the title &quot;crime and punishment&quot; impressed me. I read it without knowing I had in my hands one of the greatest and most profound novels ever. At the end I was so impressed by the clarity, depth and beauty of the characters, their monologues, the plot, everything, that I remember I said &quot;I won't find something like this again in my life&quot;, And could do nothing but admiring the author although didn't know nothing of him. Now three years later I've have already read this novel four times and I'm still marveled for the perfection Dostoevsky achieved in describing human pain, and divine hearts. Happily, I was wrong in what I had thought, because then, I discovered that this was not the only novel written by Dostoevsky."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You can tell a lot about a person by asking them what their favorite book is. I think most of us choose a book in which the protaganist reminds us of ourselves. Raskolnikov's experience of life was so similar to mine that I was swept away completely the first time I read Crime and Punishment. Intellectual vanity, alienation and isolation, do lead to a kind of madness. Although I cannot ascribe to Dostoevsky's political conservatism, his ideas regarding the necessity of suffering for salvation are totally convincing. The sweetness of Raskolnikov's eventual salvation through Sonya is in my opinion the pinnacle of literary romance."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the world in which we live, it is nearly impossibleto not reach a time in our lives when we feel that there isnothing. A time when we feel that all we have done inour lives was in vain and now we do not know what to do withourselves. In the novel Crime and Punishment by FyodorDostoevsky, a man by the name of Roskolnikov goes throughjust this type of phase.Roskolnikov finds himself lost. He feels that his lifeis leading him nowhere and he wants to do something about it.The measures he takes to acquire a state of peace are whatmakes this novel a masterpiece. He goes to such an extremeas to take another person's life just so he can feelimportant once again. That is the crime. The punishment,though, is not as clear. Almost the entire novel is hispunishment. Roskolnikov's punishment is the torture heundergoes as his mind slowly reaches insanity. The noveldelves deep into the mind of Roskolnikov as he reaches outfor others in the physical world to heal what he is feelinginside himself. From the moment he commits the crime he isstruck with a feeling of regret, and this feeling growsuntil it reaches the point of complete take-over of hisbody and mind.As in every Russian text, it can get confusing attimes because of the many names given to characters, andthe questionable points in the interpretation of the novel.Looking beyond this, though, one can see the genius of it asthe plot unravels and connections are made. The greatappreciation I have for this book comes from the fact thatit is simplicity at its finest.

I probably would have given this production/translation/work 3-1/2 stars if Amazon allowed, and the somewhat stilted Garnett translation is the primary reason I do not give it 4 stars.First, the translation: Usually a translator has to find some place between delivering accuracy of the meaning of the words with providing a sense of the artistry of the text in its original language. Garnett leans pretty far to the accuracy side, at the expense of the artistry of the language. Thus, one gets a very clear rendering of the story, but somewhat less of an idea of how it would 'sound' in the original Russian. There is a somewhat stilted feel to the language in this translation, but not enough to outweigh the value of an accurate rendering.Second, the narrator: Guidall does an excellent job of rendering the voices so many characters, and also delivering a complex and detailed narrative clearly and distinctly, at a pace that helps the listener stay with the story.I will not try to add to the large body of reviews of this work available on Amazon and elsewhere, except to challenge the reader to identify the point in the novel where the punishment in \\"Crime and Punishment\\" begins."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I had my doubts when I started this book.

The one common bond they have is they see through the BS of the world, well at least some of the main ones do. Razumikhin and Raskolnikov are both young men who although students at the university choose to hang around everyday people and involve themselves with the passions, misgivings, and pain of the everyday man while also living for the moment to the point of extreme danger. How many of us that relate to Raskolnikov have the courage to admit we relate to him. I have never physically hurt someone badly, just some fights throughout my younger years most of which I was on the receiving end, let alone come close to murder but still I relate to his frustration with the world. I relate to the feeling of not one thing making it all hurt less. I also relate to being around people who debate, philosiphise and discuss everything under the sun while most are working or doing whatever the masses at that particular time in the world are doing. Art has the ability to play out scenes of the mind and see where they end up, this book does this all over the place. Art has the ability to do the things one would not have the courage to do but wonders about and wants to release that wonder in some way. Dostoevsky is timeless. I am not the type of person who likes putting people on any kind of pedastel and I feel like good old Fyodor sees the pitiful creatures we really are. Honesty is not always pleasant and his writings are that brutal honesty that makes one understand it all for a while at least. Evertime I am reading him someone asks me if I am reading it for class (I have not been in a class in many years). I would love to take a class where Dostoevsky is read. Reading someone who is a rebel straight up and down and speaks of drunkeness, murder, philosiphy, WHY, violence, hatred, mankind and on and on. Lucky people."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this book because it is a classic, and I'm very glad I read it. At first I didn't like the book that much; the story is not that captivating. But wait until the last chapter -- it will truly knock you on your bottom! The book is a translation from Russian, so I often times found the language a little dull (or perhaps it was just straightfoward). I would recommend reading the last chapter of the book at least several times. It is here that Dostoevsky drives home an important point for humanity -- Jesus died for our sins, no matter how great they are. If we accept him in our hearts and repent, then we are cleansed and made new again. This is what Raskolnikov realizes at the end of the story, and thus the &quot;subject of a new story&quot; can imply his rebirth in Christianity. Looking back on that lesson, the book is worth the read, even if you have to trudge through it at times like I did."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If God is dead, or does not exist, then everything is permitted; but if he exists, we are not free and we are responsible for our actions. Raskolnokiv's convictions made him to murder an old woman for the betterment of the welfare of the society. Is killing someone really wrong, if at the end will benefit the society that we live in? Those who agree on this, they are utilitarinists. On the other hand however, te Kantian ethics resides, deontological ethhics which claim that killing is wrong because the act itself, by its very nature is wrong, hence, the conseuquence is not relevant.In Crime and Punishment, Dostoyevsky explored the inner instincts of the human mind and actions. With the figure of such a character (Raskolnikov) he investigated the potential of man to ve innately vicious and cruel and the only way to step beyond the limits of morality, Dostoyevsky argued that one must be like a Napoleon, a superman-like figure who questions the validity of such morality. This novel will, in future, in turn, will effect Nietzsche and he will write Thus Spoke Zarathustra, claiming that God is Dead and the idea of the Superman.One of the most significant themes of the novel rests on the idea that we must live life, regarless of the fact that everything is not for the best purpose, we must love it no matter how hopeless it maybe, in short, \\"we must love it more than its meaning\\". The following quote from Raskolnikov briefly summaries this theory: \\"Where is it I've read that some one condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he'd only room to stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to liveso than to die at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!... How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!.. (Crime and Punishment, page 149)So, those of you who are interested in subjects like morality, ethics, god, \\"the meaning of life\\", ideology, illness and the unconscious, religion, humanity, and of course, Suffering - this is one of the best books on these issues and one of the masterpieces of world literature. Great book, placing characters in extreme situtations and testing their ability to use their freedom and choice in a given situation."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky is renowned for his brilliant depictions of the dark side of the psyche, and this book delivers that in spades. But there is just too much narrative contrivance and reliance on formulas and coincidence for this to be considered a masterwork of literature. You start to see Dostoevsky's tricks coming from a distance: \\"Aha, do I see another surprise appearance by the policeman to provide a round of gut-wrenching suspense in the next chapter\\", \\"oh, I guess that this suicide is foreshadowing another more significant one later\\", \\"yes, it's time for another character to break down to add some drama\\", etc. The \\"philosophical\\" question in the book, about the moral ramifications of the \\"Great Man\\", is utterly contrived and not convincingly developed. And much of the book is delivered in long-winded monologues by the characters.Add it all up and you have a book that can be a real chore to get through. If you can get past all this, you'll be treated to some excellent deep psychology, but is it worth the effort?"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Little is known about the reclusive author of this fine book.

It's really an interesting read. (And if you read it carefully, you'll notice that the word \\"yellow\\" is used to describe something dirty, unclean, or polluted)This will be a short overview ^-^. Raskonikov wanted to help a lot of people by killing the old pawnbroker, Alyona. He wanted to help the number of people she was cheating, his sister Dunia by not having to marry Luzhin, and Lizaveta b/c she was beating her. So he kills the Alyona, but he carelessly leaves the door open and Lizaveta (step-sister of Alyona) walks sees everything. In haste he kills her too. He takes what he can but he is trapped whne Alyona's other appointments go to see her. He gets away and hides the loot under a rock. He visits his old friend Razumikhin and they talk, but he is becoming sick/dilerious.His mother and sister arrive to get married. He meets Luzhin and doesnt like him and visa versa. Raskolnikov later tells Dunia that it is either him or Luzhin. She picks him when her mother learns that Svidrigailov (friends husband who tried to seduce Dunia), or rather his late wife, leaves them 3,000 roubles.Raskolnikov goes into delirum again and ends up going for a walk. He finds his old friend, Marmelodov (whom he met in a bar), lying in the street. He was trampled by horses. He takes him back to his lodgings and he dies there. Raskolnikov says he'll pay for everything.....Making a long story short. He falls for Sonia, Marmelodov's daughter. He goes to prision for 8 years, Razumkhin marries Sonia, the mom dies, Svidrigailov....well, you'll just have to read about him.

Since then, I read almost all the rest of his work and it seems to me that together they form one big universe of thought and feelings. It is so wide, I find it almost impossible for a reader to fully penetrate his universe. When a reader gets there through his works, there is one thing to be seen: unlimited sincerety.

The book is typical of the excellent 19th Century Russian abilty to create interesting, larger than life characters and a good plot. To me, this book was a look at Napoleon, another 19th Century Russian obsession. Raskolnikov is the Russian Napoleon. He is not the average man, but a young demi-god who has the right to take his just desserts. However, unlike Napoleon he cannot bring the moral reality into line with the intellectual superiority. In classic Russian fashion he second guesses his actions and questions his right to take action at all (after having committed the act, naturally). The subject matter and the writing all come together to make this book what it is recognized to be - a classic"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is THE BEST book I've ever read.

Suspenseful and exhausting, the reader will find Raskolnikov's sins and redemption to be overwhelming and awe-inspiring in this must-read-classic"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read this right after Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone;the two are quite different, as you can imagine. Crime and Punishment is a very good study of human psychology, as well as a wonderful peek into the social castes of 19th century Russia. I did not study this book in a literature class, and enjoyed it as a straight work of fiction that was very compelling in its own right, without the attendant analyses, etc. Each character is brought vividly to life, almost none are perfect, but all have stories and histories worth reading about.In addition, the underlying &quot;new&quot; theory suggested in the book cannot be more provocative: Are some people so &quot;extraordinary&quot; (enlightened) that it is alright for them to kill if this brings more general benefit to society? The answer was obvious to me, but it is an interesting question nevertheless."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I'm 4/5 the way through this book, and haven't been able to put it down. It's a page turner. I agree with all the wonderful positive things stated prior to my review, but I have to point out that I find the translation confusing, or sloppy. (Not that I could do any better). But here's my points:* Some characters seem to have alternative names. For example, In one moment, you may see a character referred to as \\"Luzhin\\", and later as \\"Pytor Petrovitch\\". (Page 151 and other places) This doesn't happen in conversation with other characters which might make some sense, but from the third person narrative. There are, I think, at least two other characters I encountered with the \\"alternative name\\" issue. In addition, there is an easy one : \\"Sonia\\" vs \\"Sofya\\". Unless you happen to know that Sonia is familiar for Sofya, you might be lost for a bit.EDIT: Finally, at page 376 I saw \\"Pytor Petrovitch Luzhin\\", which identified this characters full name, at last.* Some completely different and unrelated characters have the same last name! This led to a lot of confusion too. Katerina Ivanovna is the name of a ill woman, Alyona Ivanovna is the murdered pawnbroker, Amalia Ivanovna is Katerina's landlady. Amalia Ivanovna also is referred to by the author as Ludwignovna.There is another, too, I believe.Where does this confusion come from? Is it me? or the author? or the translator? Did I miss some familial connection between all those Ivanovna's?; or does this name reoccur with that kind of frequency in Russia? Or was the translator sloppy? EDIT: Could \\"Ivanovna\\" be some kind of commonly used address?* During an interview between the Hero, and the detective, (and this scene and so many others are terrific btw!) the detective seems to have a nervous laugh which comes out as \\"he-he-he\\"--- a lot. Annoying as such a laugh is, it's forgivable and not really disconcerting because I just figured this character has a nervous little silly laugh. However, later on, the stern, mean old Luzhin who has never laughed until this late point in the book has a conversation wherein he laughs several times. \\"he-he-he\\". Is \\"he-he-he\\" a good translation of whatever Doestoevsky used to denote laughing? If not, then the translator has maligned the characters by giving them a ridiculous laugh.But I am VERY impressed with the book. The characters are indeed 3d, as has been said. They all seem real to me. The suspense is wonderful. The several story lines going on at once is well done! Multi-faceted story and multi-faceted characters. I love this book, because I never know where it's going to. At one point, I said, \\"aha! Luzhin's probably going to try to kill Raskolnikov. Now I'll watch that unfold!\\" and something else totally happened, which was even better. Of course, he may yet! (I've only read 4/5ths so far, you know.)If you're in the mood for this book--i highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"ITS RELEVANCEHow can a story written in 1860's Russia about a student who slays an old spinster with an axe be relevant today? Can we not easily dismiss the story itself and especially the ending as being just a facile and vacuous fantasy of a hopeless ninteenth century romantic? It depends a little on whether one is more interested in questions well asked or in getting simple answers.What is Man? What motivates him? What is the basis of right action? These are central motivating questions in Crime and Punishment. One hypothesis is that a person can define his own life and live entirely on those terms. The alternative hypothesis is that this strategy isolates by successively cutting off one relationship after another until nothing is left, not even sanity. Dostoevsky suggests in this novel that action can only be viewed in a social context, not a purely individualistic one. And that action is rightly motivated by care and personal connection instead of by theory, fear, or desparation.In Dostoevsky's view of the world relationships are horizontal, familial, almost communal. It's a point of view he shares with several of his contemporary countrymen. In this view of the world, relationships are not part of life; they are not essential to life; they are life. They define it. Outside of relationships there is no life.This idea is, perhaps, more deeply embedded in the Russian psyche than that of any other group of Europeans because in the vast and unforgiving land that is Russia such a viewpoint is necessary for survival. Life as an individual is a meaningless idea because it will likely not outlast an open bottle of good champagne in a thirsty crowd.Individualism has been ensconced in most of western philosophy, political thought, and law for more than two millenia. It has revolved around the idea of the solitary individual as an isolatable entity. Not just isolatable for the purposes of analysis but actually as an entity that lives beyond society, without connection to other social beings. The trajectory of Anglophone society since WWII has been toward the increasingly individualistic. Society grows more efficient every day at transforming its individuals from social beings into Skinner's girl in the closet or Dostoevsky's Raskolnikov.The kind of isolation suffered by Raskolnikov is endemic to today's sprawling suburban deserts, crumbling small towns, and dysfunctional urban areas. And the dysfunction caused by this isolation makes possible the explanation of a collection notorious antisocial acts from bombings to handgun massacres. At first blush we might imagine Raskolnikov's more immediate motivation to be different; but it is fear and hatred that drive him. So again, Raskolnikov's motivations are profoundly similar to the fear, hatred and isolation that drive today's seemingly random acts of violence and far too many of its political machinations.THE STORYIn ninteenth century St. Petersburg, there lives a young university student named Raskolnikov who has run out of money, He has been separated from his family for three years. His impulsive sensibility to help others has left him in penury and unable to persue his studies, His miserable material condition, his idleness, and his and isolation begin to take a toll on him.Just as things reach a critical point he learns that his sister has become engaged to a rich politician who, he discerns, wishes to marry her for despicable psychological reasons. He determines that although his sister would live in a wealthy household, her husband's attitude would make her miserable for every minute they both might live. He imagines she is throwing away her life and happiness so he might complete his studies. And he cannot endure the thought of it.He must rescue her. To do so requires capital. He has few choices. But for some time he has been considering a plan. There is a wretched old shrewish woman, a pawnbroker, a foreigner, who lives with her niece. She is mean and spiteful. All the people who live in the neighborhood believe so. Raskolnikov wonders whether he should kill her and make off with her small fortune.In studying history he has learned that all great men get to be so through bold and unconventional action - usually involvong the spilling of blood. New systems of government are always built upon dead bodies. New enterprises launched on the backs of the oppressed. If a man must kill one person to save a hundred, he reasons, would he not do it? And, he imagines, this old woman is not a person. And, anyway she is old and might expire any day.Raskolnikov rehearses. He has bad dreams. In a fit of fever and pique he does the deed, goes home and collapses on his couch. The book really begins as he wakes up out of a three day fit of delerium. The central conflict quickly becomes when and how Raskolnikov will come to grips with his actions.But before this can happen, the fortunes of half a dozen central characters must be resolved in ways that frame Raskolnikov's actions and attitudes. His sister must be successfully separated from her manipulative fiance, his friend must be rewarded for the goodness of his very being. The sad fate of the orphaned Marmeladov family must be resolved, and so on.Dostoevsky is quite masterful in drawing us into the thoughts, attitudes, and psychological states of Raskolnikov. It was interesting to read this novel immediately after reading Conrad's Heart of Darkness, The commentator for that book was convinced that Conrad must have been profoundly influenced by this one; it's an inescapable conclusion. Both authors are very interested in psychology as a motive force in storytelling. Both care much about presenting a coherent and cohesive psychological portrait of their characters. Dostoevsky is more open about it, creating a prosecutor named Porfiry who plays a psychological game of cat and mouse with Raskolnikov, carefully explaining to him the psycology of each move.Throughout the book Dostoevsky implicitly asks \\"What motivates us? Is it fear? Is it love? Is it superstition? Desire? Hatred? Duty? The desire to win, to have the upper hand? The will to power? Want of money?\\" and by extension, \\"What ought to motivate us?\\" And each character shows us a little bit about what his creator believes the consequence of his own motivation might be. Whether we find Dostoevsky's conclusions convincing or not, the questions are well asked and his point of view well illustrated. We stand to learn much from his point of view."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"if you expect this to be of the same caliber as 'the brothers karamazov', then you would be disappointed. it doesn't come close. the story is slow. it took the whole book to brew and reaping only takes place on the last chapter (ch.2 of epilogue). this is where you get what idea, in its entirety, dostoevsky is trying to convey. until you get to the final chapter, you'll keep reading and waiting. when you finish reading the final chapter you'll say 'it's a GOOD book.' then you close the book and lay back and think and reflect on what dostoevsky is trying to imply...then you'd say 'what a GREAT book!' i give it 4/5 in general and 2.5/5 relative to 'the brothers karamazov'."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"'Crime and Punishment' has it all...murder, betrayal, perversion, a tortured protagonist, love, rebirth, and passion. It tells the tale of a man who commits spiritual suicide through a heinous act, and his agonizing journey towards redemption. It is masterfully crafted, every seemingly insignificant detail has untold repercussions on the story and its characters. For example, the contrast between Raskolnikov and his love interest, the beautiful Sonya. While he is an arrogant yet respected student, she is a spiritual woman forced into prostitution by circumstance. The world shuns her for her outward sin, while it is Raskolnikov they should cast out...while he is seemingly respectable, his soul is as vile as Sonya's sheets. The greatest difficulty I had reading this book was keeping track of the names. Each character has at least three different names, and they're all used randomly and without warning. Once you get the hang of it, however, it is not an obstacle. While 'Crime and Punishment' is an incredibly difficult read, it is the most satisfying book I have ever experienced. Its brilliant look into the interplay of humans and their failings combined with its subtle and often disturbing message of hope makes this a thorougly remarkable work, one not to be passed up. This has become my favorite book, I hope it becomes yours as well."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I first started reading this novel when I was 12 years old. I only got through the first 50 or so pages before putting the book down. Now, another 12 years down the line, I picked it up again, and this time I didn't let go.Fyodor Dostoevsky's &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; is simply one of - if not *the* best novel I have ever read. Dostoevsky is the master of portraying characters in a believable way; when you're reading the book you feel as though you are in the room with Rodja, Dunja, Razumichin and Luzjin. It's like stepping into a time-machine set for pre-revolution Russia.The plot revolves around Rodion &quot;Rodja&quot; Romanovitj Raskolnikov, a poor ex-student who murders an old woman in the belief that he's doing it for the good of man. This happens in the first part of the book; in the rest of the book we follow Rodja in his feverish nightmare, walking the streets of Petersburg.The book is interesting not only because of it's great entertainment value, but even more so because of the philosophical questions it asks. The late great Ayn Rand was also a master of this type of novel. With the exception of &quot;Crime and Punsihment,&quot; the only novel I have read where you really feel that the characters are so real is Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged.&quot;"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Editorial reviews on the current page (Crime and Punishment [Kindle Edition]) indicate that it's the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation. In fact, it's a translation by Constance Garnett."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In the story of Raskolnikov , a young student in Petersburg who commits a double murder,Dostoevsky explores the themes of guilt and redemption. Raskolnikov is driven to the point of madness by his awareness of what he's done and his expectation that he will be exposed at any moment.As he falls deeper into his delusional state the novel's suspense is created by the anticipation of his being caught. He is suspected by a detective who uses very subtle techniques(think - Columbo) to slowly confirm his suspicion and the interaction between the two of them provide some of the more tense and poignant moments in the book.There are many other well realized characters in the novel including Raskonikov's mother and sister, his close friend and a young poverty stricken girl who turns to prostitution out of desperation.Crime and Punishment is a challenging novel and as with much 19th century literature it is extraordinarily detailed in Dostoevsky's descriptions of both characters and settings. I was drawn in and wanted to finish this but I must admit there were a few sections where I almost set it aside.Persistance paid off because I consider this a very rewarding read and time well spent."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I am 17 and for a first time reader of this book, I was surprised byt the alteration in vocabulary that has taken place sine the 1880's. I enjoyed the story very much and it was only dull if you have a lazy mind. The intensity of the thought process that Fyodor D. goes into depth with is so amazing and I just love it. This novel is helpful also in the understanding of your own conscience and reminds you how you need to listen to it or you will start a punishment that can lead one to insanity."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky's magnum opus is filled with literary gold. It abounds with deep philosophy and insightful psychology. Really, he only seems existentialist, and spends most of the novel disproving his protagonist's motivating theory. The philosophy is interesting, but moreso the way he refutes it. He has a way of hitting his readers over the head with Jesus--he was devoutly religious--yet he never offends even the most questioning atheists, although the ending is a bit of a let-down. His protagonist is a murderer, his Christ figure is a whore, and his descriptions are so vivid that one can literally smell the putrescence of St. Petersburg leaking from the pages. Or perhaps I had an overused copy."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The central figure of this expansive work, Raskolnikov, is an impoverished student - largely of his own making. As the book opens we find him occupied with a thought - an &quot;idea&quot;. During the development we realize that the idea is a murder of an old woman who Raskolnikov sees as evil.The plot is very simple. Raskolnikov murders the woman, and her step-daughter who has the misfortune to walk in at the wrong time, he makes a botched search for money and escapes without anyone seeing him. The remainder of the book involves his attempts, or lack thereof, to prevent the truth from being discovered.This novel is not about plot, though. It is about Raskolnikov's mind - specifically why he committed the murder and his nagging conscience that won't seem to let him get away with it. As with other 19th century Russian novels we also get a commentary on the times, political arguments and many sub-plots intertwined. All of this is handled masterfully.The characters are what gives this novel such depth. At first glance some of the characters may appear to be too pat - the lazy student, the alcoholic, the prostitute, the bumbling policeman, etc. But all of Dostoevsky's characters are imbued with such life, such vigor that they leap off the page and stay in their minds.And Raskolnikov's thoughts stay with us too - we really do wonder about whether murder can ever be right, whether people can be above the law and so on. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Truly one of the greatest stories ever told, Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment is a testament to the flaws of human nature. Crime and Punishment follows one of the most accurately human characters I have ever read of, Rodion Raskolnikov, through his trials and tribulations after committing a murder. Nearly everything about this novel is intriguing and the book has very few flaws.Rodion Raskolnikov is a character I can absolutely relate to. His character is so natural, so real, more so than characters in the books I read. Raskolnikov commits his murder in hopes of becoming something greater, which is a flaw that he may never overcome. His reasoning in the murder is flawed and his hopes for the future are flawed as well. In his desire to become a more powerful human, such as his hero Napoleon, he damns himself to the wretched wasteland of Siberia. He never repents for killing the old woman, who is agreeably a shady character. Raskolnikov does fear he went to far in killing the kindly, yet gullible, Lizeveta, whom he never meant to attack. The emotions described in the story by all of the characters, but especially Raskolnikov, are all feelings I myself have felt. His desire for forgiveness, understanding, vindication, and power are genuine human emotions. His desire to share his pain with another, while at the same time trying to not cause anyone close to him pain, causes him to fall deeper into insanity and sickness. In the end, Raskolnikov realizes that he could never be a Napoleon, but a rather ordinary man.The only fault of this book, in my eyes, is the long-winded thought processes of the characters. Perhaps it is only the translation, but the book goes into the deepest details in explaining the most trivial actions. It is not boring, per say, but it does make the book move much more slowly. Also, possibly again due to the translation, people seem to stare at each other for quite a while. I do not profess to have a great knowledge of nineteenth century Russia, but I find it hard to believe people would just stare at each other for four, five, and ten minutes at a time without speaking, then go on as if it never happened.The psychology in this book is also very captivating. The paranoia experienced by Raskolnikov at the hands of Porfiry Petrovich, Razumihin knowing his friend so well, yet never realizing the truth until much later on in the book, Svidrigailov's apparent monomania over Avdotya Raskolnikov, and the unexpected psychological attack on Zametov by Raskolnikov are only a few of the great instances where thought, rather than action, tell the story.Crime and Punishment, overall, is one of the best literary classics I have ever read. The characters are some of the easiest to relate to and the experiences they are forced to encounter force the reader to reflect on human nature and the flaws therein."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Nietzsche, a man who was always first to annihilate other writers and thinkers, bestowed lavish praise on Dostoevsky, &quot;that profound human being.&quot; But seemingly contrary to Nietzsche, Crime and Punishment illustrates the fallacies of nihilism. The main character Raskolnikov is obsessed with Nietzsche's &quot;Superman&quot; theory, that he is beyond all morals like great men, a la Napoleon. To prove this, he sets out to murder an old, disgusting pawnbroker who is &quot;past all usefullness and should have died long ago.&quot; After he accomplishes the grisly deed the novel illustrates his conflict between his rationalizations and his conscience, and the corresponding madness that results. Finally, Raskolnikov is redeemed by love and faith, evincing the Russian Christianity that pervades Russian literature. He realized that his murder was just the disgusting attempt to prove his superiority, when in reality he wasn't such a man. His rational and nihilistic viewpoints at the beginning allowed him to rationalize the murder. The redemption of faith illustrates the point &quot;If God doesn't exist then everything is permitted.&quot; To be fair to Nietzsche, he was looking for life-affirmation after removing all certainty of morality and truth, a near impossible task. He was hardly settling for nihilism, even if some of his work appears to be just that. And his Superman theory was probably more in response to someone like Jesus, who besides annihilating the corrupt values and beliefs of his time, creates something that is superior. Dostoevsky is responding to someone who interprets Nietzsche's writings falsely. On the novel, the writing is absolutely superb and clearly reflects the troubled and frantic state of a madman or someone undergoing physchological trauma. The themes are, of course, profound. A thoroughly brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I've lived some 40+ years successfully avoiding all the lengthy Russian novels because I feared they'd either put me to sleep, or generate headaches. Upon completing Crime and Punishment, given to me by a colleague, I'm really annoyed for depriving myself from enjoying such a literary classic.Crime and Punishment is, as you would expect, a long-ish and wordy novel. And the character's names, and nicknames, are confusing to me (a non-Russian). But the overall murder story is very absorbing, as are the tangential subplots. This is NOT a murder mystery; the reader knows who committed the crime central to the story. However its deep psychological analysis as to why the crime was committed and how it affects the criminal afterwards is extremely well done (without being preachy).Crime and Punishment, while somewhat cumbersome, is NOT a difficult read. I heartily recommend those who are fans of popular crime novels (eg, John Grisham novels) should &quot;move up&quot; and give it a try. It's a very rich read. ...and you'll be able to impress your friends on telling them you read it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You plan a crime. It is solely of your design.

Every aspect of the crime belongs to you. It is very much a part of who you are. Your identity. Your past. Your future.Do you not deserve credit for its brilliance? For its success? But also for its failure? For its punishment? And the suffering that follows?These are the existential questions facing the protagonist Raskolnikov in Dostoyevsky's classic work. Set against 18th Century St. Petersburg -- a time when poverty and blind religious faith created a recipe for scandalous social acceptance of depraved living conditions and suffering of many. All of this accentuates Raskolnikov's own condition. A brilliant law student, he himself is very poor. Living in shabby quarters, he rarely eats. In this setting, Raskolnikov comes to a final decision (or delusion?) -- to prove his superiority through a heinous and horrible crime.This is not your typical crime novel thriller. Not in the least. The suspense comes not through the cliched question of \\"Whodunnit?\\", but through Dostoyevsky's own brilliant grasp of human psychology. Once the deed is done (early on) the story shifts to the events following the bloody crime. Slowly, Raskolnikov's motives, desires and philosophical views become clear. We see him challenge the cynical and hollow Looshin for the benefit of his sister. We see him confront the police and magistrates directly with his alleged guilt. But all the while, the depravity of Raskolnikov's living condition and unpredictable emotions and actions render all of these \\"conscious\\" intentions suspect. Like Gregor Samsa in Kafka's Metamorphosis, our privileged access to Raskolnikov's thoughts perhaps betray a diseased mind. A confused consciousness. A man no longer the agent of his actions.These circumstances both consciously and subconsciously drive Raskolnikov to question his own actions and state of mind. In a sense, he grasps for straws as his past actions becomes blurred. And this becomes his struggle -- the existential anxiety of losing control over the ability to shape his destiny. Dostoyevsky responds with a powerful challenge, with Raskolnikov trading freedom for responsibility and suffering and, ultimately, salvation."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevsky will forever cause high school children to groan in discomfort. I did, until I was older and picked this book up on my own. The style is difficult to trudge through at first, I think mostly because it does not translate too easily into comfortable American slang. But you do get used to it, and the story and theme are well worth the effort. Now, I have been told by friends that Crime and Punishment is not Dostoevsky's best work. If this is true, I will be delighted to read his others. This story, like The Bell Jar and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, may appeal to those who have difficulty in social situations. I identified with the character's distaste for company, even though he knew that he was not healthy. I should caution, however, that this book was so well written, that I actually felt my mood turn dour as soon as I picked it up. It isn't for bedtime reading, unless you like dark, shadowy dreams of loneliness and despair. Read on a dark stormy night with a fire going and leave the rest of the room plunged in shadows. Indulge your less comfortable side!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Are some people superior to other people? Dostoevsky's protagonist, Raskolnikov, believes so. In fact, Raskolnikov believes that he is one of these superior people, and he further believes that his superiority frees him from the laws that govern his weak and inferior fellows. Raskolnikov tests the strength of his belief by relieving an &quot;inferior&quot; human being of her life and money.This is the point where the real story begins.Crime and Punishment is a brilliant story of choices and consequences, of taking an idea to its extreme and seeing what happens on the other side. People who believe they are superior to others would do well to read this book and explore the ultimate meaning of such a position.I read Crime and Punishment once every five years just to balance my heart and mind. I heartily recommend it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"If you aren't in for a long cognitive adventure, then don't read this book. I wouldn't reccomend reading it by the pool or lying on the beach with a boombox at your back. Chances are though, if you are even looking up this review, that isn't the type of reader you are. If you are willing to advance the effort, you will be duly rewarded with this novel. True, I found some parts to be slow and a little over done, but for a book written in the late 1800's to still be appreciated in 2002?! That is truly amazing. It transends time, culture, race, religion, sex... despite the fact that it was written so long ago, if you try to read it, you will enjoy this novel. I promise.It starts in the sity of St. Petersburg, it starts with our young protragonist with a Napolean complex, hungry, alone and ashamed. He comes up with a scenerio he doesn't think himself capable of, and though it may not be necessary for his survival, it certainly could potentially help him, and his family. More than anything, to prove himself to himself he commits the crime, despite the fact that he doesn't really want to in the first place. Then, like a slap in the face of his own geniusness, he finds himself betrayed by his own worst enemy, his conscience. It is ironic that it is so easy for our young hero to accept the fact that he is a good person that made mistakes, when it is so easy for him to accept this trait in others (enter the drunk that prostitues his daughter). Unlike most of society (then or now) Rasko (my pet name for him as the names in this novel got a bit out of hand) held the amazing characteristic of being able to see through people and realize that some of us who look bad to others, are really good at heart and some that look good to society, are real harmful people underneath.Too bad he couldn't apply this logic to the mirror.This is a psychological thriller that doesn't have a thrilling plot, a romance novel with no love, a soliliquy with no song. This book basicallly encompasses everything it wasn't. It explores the mind of a criminal and demonstrates the philosophy that every man is inherently good, even those that do bad things. These bad things are fed with some sort of explanation, we just have to listen for it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Having just read the autobiographical A Moveable Feast in which Hemingway discusses Dostoevsky(I wish they would decide upon a definite spelling) and notes how Dostoevsky is undeniably great, however one can only read his works once due to the utterly grave and morose manner in which they inevitably are written. I am in concurrence with this having just finished Crime and Punishment. While I highly recommend this seminal and profound work to all, as Raskolnikov would say, extraordinary individuals outside of the lowly laboring class of the abysmally inept proletariat, I must say that I do not plan on rereading it anytime in the near future.The dark and morbid cover of the book omniously more than sets the foreboding tone of this deep look into the morose psyche of a tainted and morally depraved intellectual. The ubiquitous gloom and pervading despair permeate throughout Crime and Punishment as we witness the pestilence endured in St. Petersburg in the 19th Century. The continuous coughing of blood by the perpetually sick, the heavy vodka drinking, the gloom of poverty, the virtual starvation of many, the using of \\"the yellow passport\\" by Sonia solely in order to maintain sustenance for her family, as well as the remorseless murder of the pawnbroker and Lizveta all contribute to the dissolute debauchery and moral depravity exuded by Dostoevsky.Is it jusifiable to commit heinous acts on morally corrpt individuals for the betterment of society? Does the despicable means of murder of the dirty, old pawnbroker justify the taking of rubles and jewelry to distribute to those less fortunate who are of good moral standing? Raskolnikov adheres to this belief using reason over conscience thinking great men such as Napoleon are allowed to overstep the laws of man for the betterment of society. After the murders, Raskolnikov finds himself \\"trapped in dreary solitude from which there was no escape.\\" It is refreshingly profound, and altogether surprising, when Raskolnikov undergoes an epiphany of sorts and finally feels genuine and unadulterated remorse while banished in Siberia. While very dark and macabre, Crime and Punishment comes as a highly recommended, albeit a highly provocative and involving work. Be prepared to put on your proverbial thinking cap, so to speak. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"What can I add to 635 reviews (as I write)? I think this book is fascinating because of all the topic it covers. Like the OJ trial, it is about many important interconnected things and those things remain important today, even though this book was originally published in 1865.Sure, it has a lot about crime and punishment. But also insanity and temporary insanity, the latter a legal plea that could be entered in Russia of the mid-1800's. It's about guilt and conscience, long before Freud. In fact, this book was written at a time when psychological theories were coming into vogue. It's about false confessions. It's about poverty and social class and people who rise above their class and people who fall from the class they were born into. It's about the wild dreams and the follies of youth.There is also mention of many social theories that were in vogue at that time, so, for example, if you want to, you can click on Wikipedia to find out about \\"Fourier's system\\" and his phalansteres. There is attempted rape, blackmail, child labor, child prostitution, child marriage and child molestation. There is discussion of marrying for money. There are ethnic tensions between Russians and the Germans of St. Petersburg. Should you give to charity or should you give to change the conditions that caused the poverty? Like me, you may have thought that was a modern idea, but here it is, laid out in 1865. There's a lot about alcoholism. Stir in a cat-and-mouse detective and a bit of Christian redemption. No wonder this is a classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Amazon says this Blackstone Audio version, available on CD and from Audible, is the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation. It is not. If you go to the Blackstone Audio site, it clearly states that the unabridged version narrated by Anthony Heald is the Constance Gardner translation from 100 years ago. The cover art on the Blackstone site even shows that Garnett is the translator but not when seen on Amazon or Audible. Very misleading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Not wanting to be considered an \\"ignorant American,\\" I read this book. I've read books by Jane Austen, Bronte sisters, Homer... Some were harder to get through then others. Whether it be due to language, word choice, 1800's speech... I tend to take awhile reading most books considered classics. But this book, even with it's sometimes difficult speech, was one of the easiest and most interesting books I've read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Though the translation is odd at times, the general flow isn't too broken up. I was surprised by how quickly the story came to the crime act, as the summary suggested there was a lot of planning of the \\"perfect crime\\", when in actuality he spent much more time agonizing over the crime than planning the crime. I found the police chief's character to be especially interesting, and the repartee between the two at the end really sealed the story as delightful."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Those who read CRIME AND PUNISHMENT by Dostoevsky often approach it thinking that it is standard detective story, sort of a Russian Sherlock Holmes. What they discover almost from the first is that the identity of the criminal is revealed, so this is not a novel of suspense or of a brilliant police detective. The focus they further learn is not on the \\"crime\\" of the title, nor is is very much on the \\"punishment\\" either. Instead, in the endless self-rationalizations of the murderer-protagonist Raskolnikov, they learn Dostoevski squarely places dramatic interest on an uneasy stasis between Raskolnikov's motive for the killing of two women and his need to suffer as atonement for those killings.In order to draw the reader into the mind and plot, Dostoevski needed to ensure the primacy of his theme of the need for obsessive suffering. He accomplishes this by centering the story on the murder of the two women. Everything in the story either leads up to or follows it. The reader quickly learns a great deal of information so that by the end of the first few chapters, he has placed himself in the shoes and the mind of Raskolnikov. Ironically, although Raskolnikov tells the reader that his motivation was no more than to see if he could place himself so godlike above the law that he not fear the consequences of that law, the reader learns, slowly and painfully as does Raskolnikov, that the real motivation is not what he tells himself so bluntly. Does Raskolnikov kill for the money? To eliminate what he sees as social parasites that society would benefit from in their removal? Or can there be other reasons, hidden even from him? Complicating his constant self-examination as to motive lay Dostoevski himself. As a writer, Dostoevski was concerned for the salvation of the Russian soul, one that he saw as threatened by a western reliance on rational pragmatism that, in criminal matters in any case, required a convincing and single rationale that could totally explain and explicate any crime. Such an approach might work in Western democracies, but the Russian soul needed a call for order and justice that transcended logic and reason. This call was historically rooted in \\"rodina,\\" an almost mystical love for the Russian motherland. And for one to gain this heightened sense of unity with Russian soil and Russian values, one had to suffer to expiate crime. Thus the need for Raskolnikov not only to suffer, but first he had to earn the right to suffer. The crime is then seen as less important than the punishment, both of which are ultimately weighed as still less important than any needed suffering. When Raskolnikov can endure no further suffering, he confesses, and his confession is proper expiation for his crime. His punishment of a lengthy prison term in Siberia is almost anti-climactic. He will emerge from prison a man who has learned that the act of sin can lead the way to redemption for that sin but only if one pays the price before the jury returns with a verdict. In CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, Dostoevski makes this point as starkly as anyone else has."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is not for everyone. If you are into a book that analyzes a murder and the psychology of the man after he committs the murder then there is no better book in the world, but if you want to read an action packed entertainment novel then this is not for you. I suggest picking up a Tom Clancy novel. My overall review is that this is a mind boggling journey through a murderers inner deamons and the final peace that he finds in the end."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I think it's one of the most usefull books in the world, because it is about the cost of one's life it is about the humanity. Raskolnikov is just an unhappy person, he's unhappy because of his idea, because he IS ABLE TO KILL, because he is mistaken thinking that the world is divided into two parts: the part of slavers and the part of owners and rulers, because he believes in Napoleon and do not in God. All people who allow theirselves to decide who will be alive and who won't are also unhappy persons, like Raskolnikov. Dostoyevsky gave his hero a chance to revival by Sonya, by love, by God, and Raskolnikov used this chance. I hope all unhappy and cruel people will have one..."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation, as Thoureau would say. The reviewer who can give a work of Dostoevsky's one star is no better than the Nazi's who burn books because they cannot stand the sight of it. I've not only grown up with this book, but rereading it (the Pevear, Volokhonsky version is the best) again 14 years later, has revealed to me the true power and insight in it which I did not detect before. The book is indeed about the strong man, one who can say he is sorry and pick up the pieces from there.

Sublime, unflinching, deep characters."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I read the book Crime and Punishment. I found it to be a very interesting book. Although I didn't like how they paid so much attention to detail, I could have gone with out knowing what clothes people wore. Aside from that it was very well written. I enjoyed the whole psychiatric view of the murder. It really fascinated me how Raskolnikov's mind worked, how he thought he was an &quot;extraordinary man&quot;. In a way I agreed with him, he was doing well in some sense, but how he did it was all wrong. No one is extraordinary enough to get away with murder, I can't believe that he thought he would. I knew as soon as I started reading the book that Raskolnikov was not right in the head. The book also had some little side stories like Marmeladov's family, I couldn't find the connection. I guess the death of Marmeladov was supposed to make Raskolnikov think. But overall I really enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A masterful view into the mind of one who strongly feels that he is justified by committing murder. Is Raskolnikov aware that the clever detective knows about his crime? Raskolnikov quickly becomes plagued by his unrelenting guilty conscience. The suspense was wonderful as the detective persistently hounded Rasknolikov and finally pushed him to the breaking point. I guess that confession is truly good for the soul as the main character experiences tremendous relief following his admission. It is then a life of grief and misery for Rasknolikov living in prison with what he has done. One must be prepared to deal with the consequences of one's own actions. This is Russian literature at it's very best and I thoroughly enjoyed this enduring classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"no one talks of money better tha Dostoevsky.

Nothing like this story has been the high standards that this one has set."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostovevsky's analysis of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov is brilliant-every last tinge of emotion is captured and portrayed in such a way as we can relate to the intricately detailed workings of the criminal mind and reach an understanding of the character.....absolutely brilliant, to be read on both a literal level, and to be studied on a deeper one."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This review is specific to the Garnett English translation, State Street Press audio edition (1991), narrated by George Guidall. I probably would have given this production/translation/work 3-1/2 stars if Amazon allowed, and the somewhat stilted Garnett translation is the primary reason I do not give it 4 stars.First, the translation: Usually a translator has to find some place between delivering accuracy of the meaning of the words with providing a sense of the artistry of the text in its original language. Garnett leans pretty far to the accuracy side, at the expense of the artistry of the language. Thus, one gets a very clear rendering of the story, but somewhat less of an idea of how it would 'sound' in the original Russian. There is a somewhat stilted feel to the language in this translation, but not enough to outweigh the value of an accurate rendering.Second, the narrator: Guidall does an excellent job of rendering the voices so many characters, and also delivering a complex and detailed narrative clearly and distinctly, at a pace that helps the listener stay with the story.I will not try to add to the large body of reviews of this work available on Amazon and elsewhere, except to challenge the reader to identify the point in the novel where the punishment in \\"Crime and Punishment\\" begins."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment ReviewThere is a hero and villain in all of us. But is there a \\"Superman\\" effect. Fyodor Dostoyevky's book, Crime and Punishment, proves this. The theme of this story has to do with a man named Raskolnikov and how he thinks he murdered somebody for the right reason. He doubts his actions after this murder and consoles G-d in doing so. Raskolnikov needs an answer to this question and in this is the theme of the book: are we heros or villains in the actions that we take to save others or ourselves?At the beginning of the novel, Raskolnikov sees himself as a \\"superman,\\" a person who is extraordinary and thus above the moral rules that govern the rest of humanity. His exaggerated estimation of himself compels him to separate himself from society. His murder of the pawnbroker is a consequence of his belief that he is above the law. Raskolnikov's inability to calm his additional feelings of guilt proves to him that he is not a \\"superman.\\" Although he realizes his failure to live up to what he has envisioned for himself, he is nevertheless unwilling to accept the total creation of this identity. He continues to resist the idea that he is as average as the rest of humanity by maintaining to himself that the murder was justified. It is only in his final surrender to his love for Sonya, and his realization of the joys in such surrender, that he can finally escape his conception of himself as a superman and the terrible isolation such a belief brought upon him.In this Raskolnikov also looks to G-d for assistance. He calls upon G-d to see if he can lead him to the right conclusion. Along with this G-d is leading him to confess his sins to Sonya the niece of the pawnbroker and to the police to be a free man. He also looks upon his friend for guidance, and his friend listens, unknowing of the murder, and tries to lean him toward the path of redemption.At the end of the novel Raskolnikov confesses his sins to Sonya. She in turn tells him he must tell these things to the police, and is merciful to him. As he goes he kisses the ground one last time because this will be the last time for a while that he will be on the outside. And in jail he finds love with Sonya and soon after in a few years he is released from prison and is happy with Sonya his new love. Raskolnikov and Sonya show that society is merciful on some who are this hopeless and have a clouded mind."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"While reading Fyodor Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment again, I realized that the book was actually pretty good.Dostoyevsky does a good job of bringing the characters to life, whether it be the crazed psychopath Rodion Raskolnikov, the incorrigible prick Svidrigailov, or the prostitute Sonia.Dostoyevsky also brings the setting to life, putting them in St. Petersburg during a time when an intellectual \\"revival\\" was taking place- a \\"revival\\" that the young tragic hero, Raskolnikov,finds himself in.All in all, a good book and a real classic for the ages. A 5/5."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"i first read this book in russian and then carried on to read it in english. dostoyevky's style is naturally rather slow but meaningful and that is how the novel progresses. not much happens but the theme you absorb is incredible. the themes of rejection of human nature and isolation from society and the \\"superhuman\\" prospect make the book so interesting. the story is depressing, as are most russian novels, but so captivating! dostoyevsky is brilliant!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"From everything I had ever heard about Crime and Punishment, I thought it was either going to be incredibly slow and plodding, or utterly fascinating and deep.Interestingly, I thought it was both.Dostoesvsky's writing is intense. It is almost exactly what you expect a \\"classic\\" to be. It is brilliant, insightful and precise. More than that, it is *real*--it forces you to reflect on yourself, and the world, and can teach you things about both. It really is the psychological masterpiece everyone says it is, as it dives deeply into the mind of a murderer.Also, however, it is wordy--because it is so precise, it sometimes takes a long time to say what it is trying to say. This can be dull on occasion, and makes it a hard book to read late into the night. When you read Crime and Punishment, you will *feel* as though you're reading a classic, unlike experiences I've had reading authors like Tolstoy, Dumas, Dickens, Twain and others where eventually I just felt like I was reading a story.And so, your experience reading Crime and Punishment will largely depend on what features of a novel are most important to you. If you are drawn to novels because of their fast paced, exciting plots and energetic characters, give this one a pass. If, however, you read novels for their illuminations of human nature, then this might just be the book for you. Like I say, it is certainly a classic novel... but not everyone will enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Usually, I am skeptical about the classics. They typically bore me with a lack of plot or boring imagery. Not this book. Dostoevsky masterfully draws you into each and every character in the book, providing uncanny detail in every interaction that takes place. In reading this, before I knew it, I was immersed in a web of philosophical and psychological interchange that can excite any reader. Everything bad I heard about this book was not true at all."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is moving on many levels: fantastic writing, interesting insight into the human psyche and the effect of our actions on our lives. The character moves through many transitions and it is fascinating to watch. I re-read this book every few years. Historically, we can see into the bleakness of many lives in a repressed Russia, and the characters all looking over their shoulders with paranoia and cynicism. The human condition is well highlighted here. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is generally acknowledged as one of the great works of Literature and perhaps after 'The Brothers Karamazov ' Dosteovsky's second best work. I did not like the work, and not because I did not find parts of it absorbing and moving. I do not like crime. I do not like murder and violence. I found it difficult to sympathize with Raskolnikov and understand why I should give somuch of my attention to such a person. The murder of the old woman is in my perhaps simplistic mind, an evil for which one should be silenced. Instead we get hundreds of pages of the hero's remorse. If I were asked what I really remember about the work it is the confession of the drunken character who tells his whole life story and suffering to a total stranger. The dialogue of Dostoevsky is always one of his strong points, and in this speech too one feels great power. The suffering of the child, the single child which stands out against the Heavens as evidence of an unjust world and God also moved me deeply. I admit I am far from the best reader of this work. Dostoevsky has always repelled me a bit even before I knew of his anti- Semitism. The fascination with the morbid and the criminal has never been mine. But the power of the work and the word and the comprehension of character and experience are very great indeed. I suggest the reader turn to far other reviews for more full and more objective informatiion."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I, personally, found the Brothers Karamazov better in many ways, but the themes in Crime and Punishment come out more loudly than in the BK which come out extremely loudly in themselves. A university student justifies the murder of an old woman who is a cold and cruel pawn shop owner. For the next few days the student, Raskolnikov, struggles with his feelings of remorse, guilt, doubt, etc. until he gives in for the sake of others, though he doesnt consciously recognize it and some might disagree. It is a marvelous work on the human psychy and a must read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I won't spend time praising this amazing novel as much has already been said. But British actor Jennings does a superb job reading (or should I say recreating) Dostoyevsky's classic. Now that I've heard this version I can't imagine anyone else narrating it. As audiobook enthusiasts know, the reader can make or break a good book. This is one not to miss."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Half way through this book I was still uncertain if I liked it or not. Then I realized how all the groundwork had been laid and I was intimately involved in these flawed characters. I could hardly put down this book from that point, and it never fizzled out."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment has to be one of the greatest novels ever written, and which is an outstanding, supreme example of fine literature at its very best. This English version still manages to capture the forcefulness and frightening intimacy as the Russian Dostoevsky's version, bringing it to a wider readership for the modern day. Fresh, contemporary and current this wonderful book is a delight to behold and which should be cherished for all-time, as a powerful piece of prose and stirring narrative that is profoundly affecting. Fyodor Dostoevsky s tale is brought realistically to life with such exactness that one cannot help but connect to it, by means of memorable characters and meaningful storytelling.For those who have vision and the courage to follow it, there is no law and no crime and no punishment, only a revaluation of all values.\\" So declares Rodya Raskolnikov the young Russian intellectual living in ugly poverty. In order to eat, he is forced to pawn precious possessions for a few roubles to the greedy \\"cockroach\\", Alyona. If he kills her, Rodya argues, he commits no crime: rather he will rid the world of a \\"filthy insect\\", just like one of the cockroaches you are able to envisage being crushed beneath his boots. As Alyona examines Rodya's silver cigarette case, he brings his axe down upon her with the horrifying sound of steel hitting human flesh. Despite this not being a crime, Rodya suffers fearful guilt and inevitable punishment. It is Sonya, the abused young woman forced into prostitution by her drunken father, who holds the power of Rodya's redemption.Dramatization is a superb vehicle for this tense psychological masterpiece and the performances are powerful (such as the baiting of Rodya by Jim Norton as Petrovich), the police officer who suspects Rodya's guilt, is chilling. Whilst Barnaby Kay skillfully conveys Rodya's duality as his human conscience, breathless with panic, argues with his controlled and truculent intellect transpire.Dramatic, intense and emotionally moving this noteworthy, inspiring tale in which you can feel such darkness and such passion is truly remarkable. I cannot stress enough the importance of having a good translator, and Constance Garnett has done a most credible job in making this as readable as a modern-day novel in the twentieth century that one is able to understand with decipherable language. Complete with an introduction by Joseph Frank, this has to be the stand-out edition of this masterful work of writing and which I highly recommend above all others (including those published by Penguin). This really is an epic story and one that should be revered and celebrated, for the value and worth of such great classics is beyond measure."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I posted a one star review in hopes that it gets read.I urge you to seek out the Norton's Critical edition of this book, ISBN: 0393956237That edition has portions of Dostoevsky's notebooks, many essays in criticism, and a list of all characters so that you can keep their different name iterations in order.In other words, Norton's Critical edition is the most thorough available, and if you value this book you should seek it out."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Would not download into my Kindle app in spite of repeated efforts. Done with Kindle for now. I will continue to use hardcopy books."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"No book in the history of books (that I've read) can swallow you whole like Crime and Punishment. When I was finally done reading this novel, I was a whole new person.I swear, from the first words on the first page I was already engulfed in the world of Raskolnikov. I had this horrible feeling int he pit of my stomach, I was uncomfortable, I was sad and depressed, I felt lonely and isolated... I felt everything he felt for the entirety of the novel. It was awful... but it was amazing! Who else can write like that? I'm telling you, in all the years that I have been reading (unassisted), I have never read a book like this, a book a would consider Dostoevsky's masterpiece.I know that Notes from Underground was a work of art, really, it was. I know that it takes years of studying and much knowledge to appreciate a said novel. I have also read The Brothers Karamazov, which, I gotta tell you, is also one of my favorite books of all time. But, just because The Brothers Karamazov has made it into my list of favorites, doesn't mean that it was Dostoevsky's best work.Crime and Punishment is dark and eerie. It's a horrible story that no one on Earth wants to identify with, yet you can't help feeling these uncanny similarities between you and this foreign character with whom you try to convince yourself you have nothing in common.At the beginning of this novel, the main character is torn and tormented. He is about to commit a crime. He must commit the crime, or so he has convinced himself. So, he successfully does what he has set out to do. This all happens in the first few chapters. While reading the first little bit, I remember thinking, 'This book is going to open my eyes to my own moral barometer. It's really gonna make me think about things I never really thought about.'The first few chapters brought me to that place where I was forced to think about what I would do, how I would feel, and so on. The most important question I struggled with was the same one Raskolnikov was plagued with: Had he changed his very nature permanently? If so, was there a way to undo it, or was he going to punish himself forever? Well, without giving too much away, he spent the next 900 pages in punishment. But the dialogue, the description, the emotion - it was all so other worldly, yet so close to home.I read this book at a pinnacle time in my life, and I think before I ever completed it, I had picked it up more than 3 times. It is a book that must be read in one's lifetime. However, when you read it is up to you. Pick it up, read the first little bit, see what gives. If the book doesn't strike you right away, put it down. Walk away. You'll be back. You'll be ready eventually, and when you are, this book will do for you what it did for me and so many before me: swallow you whole and spit you out new.Read more reviews at: www.projectzoug.blogspot.ca"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"An idea possessed Raskolnikov. He believed there are supermen, Newton's and Napoleon's, who transcend ordinary men and women, who could act without moral constraint to judge evil and levy punishment, and to determine whether he belonged to this superior race, he killed the greedy and usurious pawn-broker. But unlike Napoleon in Austerlitz he didn't execute his plan coldly and tactically. Rather, he nauseatingly dreamed his way into a double murder, the pawnbroker's sister had returned because he had tarried, and, at the sight of blood, was so terrified that his hands could not stop trembling. He discovered that he wasn't upright or courageous, that he could not transcend the law, and that he was just a louse, a member of the inferior class.As psychological fiction, Crime and Punishment showcases Raskolnikov's contradictory actions and emotions that revealed a split psyche fighting for wholeness. He despised others but was preoccupied with bringing about good. After reading his mother's letter about his sister's misfortune, he shed sympathetic tears but also donned an evil spiteful smile. He gave the little he had to help the Marmeladovs but immediately regretted helping them. He killed the pawnbroker to prove an idea but took her money and valuables. He was detached in the first interview with the head detective Porfiry but in the second was angry and spiteful toward him.His punishment did not begin in Siberia after the verdict but immediately after killing the pawnbroker, his irritability, nervousness, suspiciousness, delusion, and mania tormenting an already fragile psyche, not allowing him to eat, drink, sleep, work or socialize, and pressing him to hide in his coffin-like apartment trying escaping from reality and to curl up under his blanket, feverish and delusional. His conscience was tormenting and implicating him even before the law did so. Only through Sonya's help and guidance was he able to find strength to confess his crime.Through this novel's outcome, Dostoyevsky rejected any social system that tried to replace the jagged path of life with linear reason to save people from their predicament. Although the author's moral heavy-handedness in Raskolnikov's repentance and redemption seemed to scar the artistry of the mental battle, Crime and Punishment is psychological novel at its best."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel analyzes the idea of justice and those who seek it. The novel's main character, Rodion Raskolnikov has a skewed idea of the purpose of justice and loses his sanity in his application of this. The evolution of what justice is in Raskolnikov and his search to figure out his own role of justice shape the statement that Dostoevsky is making about the application of personal justice in real life; it is not a man's place to decide he is more important than others.Raskolnikov adapts a personal opinion of justice that some men are better than others. He plays off of Nietzsche's super man theory. Raskolnikov feels that some men are extraordinary and that their actions are exempt from moral standards. This novel is greatly making a statement about this theory since Raskolnikov's downfall was in its application. The search for justice and what justice truly is forms a large part of this novel. Raskolnikov forms and tests out his own theory. When he does test it he realizes his ideology is horrifically wrong and is pushed past the point of sanity because of it. He eventually finds redemption in accepting his guilt and justice. Life in this novel is the search for justice and the way justice can effect every part of life.This novel was an enjoyable read. Once you get past the Russian names, it is not difficult either. The mixture of crime and the emotions that go along with crimes is greatly intriguing. I highly recommend this novel, especially to those who love great literature and murder stories."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The freebie is the Constance Garrett translation, which is well regarded by many.

Because I had had bad experiences with required high school reading, I was really dreading reading this book. Though it begins slowly, I soon became very interested and I couldn't stop reading. It was as if I was inside the mind of someone who was actually insane. It was unlike anything I had ever read before and I found it strangely enjoyable. I finally understood why this book is a classic. For anyone taking a course on literature, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is only the second book I've read on my Kindle, and it was amazing. I stayed up until two o'clock in the morning reading this masterpiece. Only the best authors can talk about a character's thoughts and feelings and still get the reader hooked. Needless to say, Dostoyevsky does this better than anyone. Onto The Idiot!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the first Dostoevsky book I have read, and I liked it immensely. I decided to read it because of the intriguing plot, as well as Dostoevsky's reputation. Something interesting about this novel is that Dostoevsky used a very &quot;backwards&quot; sort of character development. He had Raskolnikov commit a murder- with no apparent motive- and then spent the rest of the book exploring the character, rather than the other way around. So first we watch this character commit a horrible, terrible crime, one that we should denounce him for, and then we begin to get to know him, and he is revealed to have an astoundingly good character after all. I found myself liking Raskolnikov greatly, and I was able to identify with him as well. However, this book does not seem to fall under the guidelines of a &quot;crime novel&quot; nor a &quot;psychological thriller&quot;. Yes, there is a crime, as well as a study of the protoganist's psyche, but it is not exactly thrilling. This is not the sort of story where you have to keep reading and reading to find out who committed the crime. You already know. Therefore, there is no mystery to keep you interested. Despite all these obstacles, Dostoevsky does what might be impossible for most writers. He makes you care about what happens to Raskolnikov. I was not thrilled, but engrossed. What kept me reading here was the desire to see if Raskolnikov would defeat his inner demons and turn himself in, or be arrested. I'd rather not reveal the ending but I would like to say that I found it extremely satisfying. The subplot, that of Luzhin trying to gain control over Dounia, might have only gotten in the way of another writer, but Dostoevsky was able to inspire such hate in me for Luzhin that I wanted to keep reading just to see him get what he deserved in the end. After reading this, I have decided to read Dostoevky's other works as well, and hopefully they will all be of the same high quality."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Just magnificent.

Compare the scene in Crime and Punishment, where Raskolnikov is telling Sonia he committed the murder (around pages 320-330). &quot;I wanted to have the daring,&quot; he says, as his motive. Or in the Brothers Karamazov, where Father Zosima (spelling?) tells about his older brother's death (page 302 or so in the Garnett hardcover translation). &quot;Run along now. Enjoy life for me too.&quot; So much more beautiful than the other translators. If you are not going to read it in Russian, Garnett is the next best thing."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is greater than almost any other I have read.

HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!!!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskolnikov was looking for the proof of the moral law, but he couldn't understand that the moral law DIDN'T NEED any proof. This is the law of consience. This is the law of God."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In Crime and Punishment, Dostoevsky takes human consciousness into the realm of murderous action, a masterful vision told with a richness of language that has no equal in all of literature. As in his other work, he expounds upon the contemplation of his characters; however, the reader is now presented with a man who acts upon his convictions. Like Joseph Conrad's Colonel Kurtz, Raskolnikov's soul is plunged into darkness, a mental anguish that serves as his true punishment. But the most striking theme is one of redemption, brought about through the grace and compassion of a prostitute, an earthly angel. It is here that the genius of the novel lies, in the mystic realism that finds salvation in the depths of depravity.It is disturbing that such a prolific novel should be looked down upon simply because it is seen as boring or \\"fit only for the intellectual.\\" The length of the book serves to expand upon the thoughts of the character. We live in a world where sound bytes have become our sense of the world. If something can't be read in a night or compressed into a downloadable file, we quickly disregard it. True, Crime and Punishment is both long and dense, but every word is necessary. This book was not written for the intellectual classes, but rather for the masses of nineteenth century Russia. During his lifetime, Dostoevsky was not only a great writer, but a successful one as well. His most vital characters come from the lower classes of his society. Prostitutes, servants, and drunkards all make up his mysticism, representing every aspect of the human condition."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I expected this novel to be dense and hard to understand, but it wasn't. I got into it from the first sentence, and it was quite easy to read. Dostoevsky creates an actual human being in Raskolnikov. The reader is transported into his mind; he sees the motivations for the &quot;Crime&quot; and feels the torture of the &quot;Punishment.&quot; The novel NEVER becomes boring. Dostoevsky even includes plot twists which I shall not reveal. Even in this great novel, he pays attention to plot, a compelling plot. The NBC movie was horrible in comparison, so please do not judge the novel on that basis. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have read this novel three times, the last upon my return from St. Petersburg, Russia where I was able to trace the steps of Raskonikov, the novel's main protagonist. Each time it has captivated me even more, the subtlety, the Russian nuances, the statement, all uniquely Russian. Dostoyevsky was a product of his times, his culture, and his beloved city, not to be compared to other European authors of his era because Russia and it's artists were like no others in the world, the history completely seperate from much which is considered European. His prose is timeless. To learn of the Russia of today read its authors of yesterday."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"It's probably me, since this is a classic but I just could not get through it. I even had my Kindle read it to me on my way to and from work but it was just so boring and hard to get into."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A proposed measuring stick for evaluating a novel's importance: a great novel should do something that other novels do not.Crime and Punishment, measured by that standard, distinguishes itself by integrating astonishing psychological insight, suspense, and philosophical reflection, presenting them through characters that are memorable and largely believable, even if the way in which they weave into and out of the narrative are often not.It's too bad that you have to read beyond this novel to appreciate Dostoevsky's full power as a novelist. This novel, could have been a masterpiece. I don't believe it is.Its defining flaw, which partially eclipses its many perfections, lies in the author's inability of to do for Raskalnikov what Tolstoy did for Anna Karenina: to arouse sympathy for him as the fallen perpetrator of an act that naturally arouses disgust. Given the touching innocence of Lizaveta, one of Raskalnikov's victims, this would have been a forbidding task for any writer. But this writer, at his very best, is up to it. Thomas Mann referred to Dostoevsky's \\"criminal, saintly face.\\" The aptness of that description lies in the fact that this author uniquely possesses a profound appreciation of sin, of pure, unbridled human perversity, that rivals an equally compelling appreciation of grace.This novel does not reflect that balance. For it to do so, Raskalnikov would have to have a moment of moral recognition as compelling as his sin. He never does. His redemption, his acknowledgement that the people he slaughtered were more than insects comes, finally, as an afterthought -- literally -- it appears in the novel's Epilogue. So what you end up with is a quarter-saved Christian, an errant who, like Moll Flanders, makes a more compelling sinner than acolyte.I'll read it again, though. For Marmeladov, who, completely defeated by his drunkenness, stops just short of the \\"sin unto death\\" -- despair. For Svidrigalov, who, able finally to restrain himself, becomes nonetheless, the very embodiment of the failure that Marmeladov avoids. For Sonia, whose frank horror and compassion for Raskalnikov's soul is so compelling that you forget -- as you should -- what she does for a living. And of course, for the police inspector, who is like the voice of God.What a talent."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"C & P is Dostoyevsky's most acclaimed work, both in Russia and abroad. Quite frankly, I'm not sure why. Although I am not (yet) an expert on Dostoyevsky, I compare this work unfavorably to The Insulted and Humiliated, my introduction to Dostoyevsky. Although a relatively unheralded novel, I & H is much more emotionally charged, and involves the reader in its story almost intimately. I must say that C & P is bland by comparison. The weighty issues associated with C & P are really a side story to the love angle, which resonated with me only somewhat. Russian literature is the literature of pain and hardship (dont look for happy endings). I just did not feel as emotionally or intellectually engaged in these elements reading C & R as much as I expected to, considering the novel's reputation. I would not recommend it as an introduction to Dostoyevsky... However, it is Dostoyevsky, and it is a world classic, and thus must be read. C & P is certainly readable and moderately enjoyable. Many will find it thought-provoking. It has numerous well-developed characters and side-stories that engage the reader and catch him/her by surprise (perhaps too many, ergo the lack of an emotional bond to a specific story or character). The four stars represent the respect for the author and the work's cultural significance more then anything else. Read it once you've established a taste for Dostoyevsky (start with The Brothers Karamazov or The Insulted and Humiliated -- you wont be able to tare yourself away)."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I don't really have much to say about this book other than the fact that it was &quot;good.&quot; It's a classic and that says a lot about the nature of the writing, which most people try to avoid.

The police detective just assumes that he will confess sooner or later because he's a gentleman, not a poverty-stricken crook. What's that about? Why the hell would you assume that a murderer would confess? Must we suspend our disbelief and our common sense before opening the book? Raskolnikov is an annoying person to read about, and I don't find him terribly realistic either. If he is such an idealist, why doesn't he regret, most of all, killing the shy lady?

Raskolnikov afterward tortures himself in his thoughts, thinking about what other people should be thinking, therefore, it is him who is punishing himself. I loved the plot, and the reality in all of it, even the drunkard's conversations where lengthy and boring, just as if you were sitting with the drunkard and thinking to yourself \\"just shut up, or get to your point already!\\"The novel is very realistic, and ahead of his time.

It's an intelligent, refreshing classic.Also recommeded: The House of the Dead by Dostoyevsky"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"this is a book full of amazing charachters"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment, as a work of interpretive fiction, contains excellent writing, attention to detail, character development, and theme. That said, my review remains only mildly approbational, for the reasons which I shall enumerate forthwith. Hopelessly flaccid, the work reads more like an enervated documentary or stereo instructions than a fictional examination of mental disturbance. Furthermore, the works lacks the virtue of subtlety; i.e., does the reader have to be informed in the conclusion in the most direct and blatant manner possible of one of the author's principle ideas, revealed thoroughly in the rest of the novel.One of the most disappointing features of the novel is its lack of visual artisty or profundity. As an alleged epitome of 19th-century literature, it lacks every endearing facet of the period. The poetic majesty of Romanticism, not here. The profound significance and introspection of anti-transcendentalism, no vacancy in the pages of this novel. How about sweeping social commentary of novels of the incipient century (A Tale of Two Cities or Howards End), sorry, but that must be on back order.Much richer prose can be read in the writings of Hawthorne, Melville, and Wilde. Hawthorne's symbolism and imagery (a word Dostoyevsky must not know) detail his works with something akin to aesthetic decadence. Melville relishes in the epic and profound mysteries of existence, imparting his philosophy to the reader in a superlatively engaging fashion. Wilde's sardonic tone in The Picture of Dorian Gray and his intimated wry amusement with his protagonist works far better than Dostoyevsky's harassment of the reader with his psychotic protagonist.In short, the work is a dismal representative of classical literature. Independently, however, it has merit, but not in the context of a classic. It demeans the classical genre almost as badly as the superficial novel To Kill A Mockingbird does. To conclude, it succeeds in conveying its message to the reader, but little else."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Over the weekend, I saw a fresh copy of this book on my nephew's desk and asked if he had read it yet. He had not and I subsequently gave him a short summary so as to prepare him for the long haul. Is this book really a good choice for a high school AP literature class? It will very likely turn most students off Russian novels forever. The classics are classic because they give you some kind of new or profound insight into the human condition. This book may do that, but in a very laborious way. I did not enjoy reading this book. Perhaps it's better in the original Russian.I am certainly in the minority here, but to illustrate my point, look at some of the comments from Amazon's most helpful, 5-star reviews: \\"the book seems wordy in places, nothing is hurried, do not expect it to be a rip-roaring page turner, the story develops slowly, with many detours, this is no beach-read thriller, Dostoyevsky manages to be both dense and long-winded.\\" Yes, I know these comments are taken out of context from some balanced, very thoughtful reviews. But despite a relatively simple narrative, this book is too long and the writing is very mundane.Raskolnikov kills an old pawn broker. His conscience is bothering him. Ok, fine, let's explore that subject in all its dimensions. I only wish that Steinbeck or Bronte had written the long version. I would have preferred if The Great Gatsby was another 100 pages. But this stuff... no thanks. Dostoevsky's punishment extends well beyond poor Raskolnikov, as my nephew will soon discover when he begins his long, hard slog through this overblown classic.Follow-up Comments, April 13, 2010:I have already received three \\"not helpful\\" votes on Amazon. That's fairly common with negative reviews for a literary classic. Roast a sacred cow, then start racking up the \\"not helpful\\" votes. In any case, I asked my nephew how Crime and Punishment was coming along. \\"I finished it,\\" he said. He later added that it was \\"not too bad.\\" He also pointed out that perhaps the book was \\"not too bad\\" because it was being discussed in his high school literature class. Maybe that's the key to Crime and Punishment. It's like a frog in formaldehyde. There's not much life in it, but you can learn a lot by careful dissection."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The \\"idea\\" behind this book surrounded the debate between intellectuals in the 1860's about whether Russia should mondernize and adopt Western ideas, gov't, culture, etc. Dostoevsky was adamantly, nay, zealously, opposed to westernization of russian life. Instead, he had this quasi-religious idea of Russia turning away from the rest of Europe and returning to its Russian Orthodox roots. This is why he has this obsession with \\"suffering\\", which, evidently, is a basic idea in the older, mystical forms of Christianity. It's also why his \\"good\\" characters - the ones who represent what traditional Russians are - like Marmeladov, Katerina Ivanovna, Sonya, Porfiry, all share his obsession and preach its virtues. The \\"bad\\" characters - Luzhin, Svidrigailov, and Lebezyatnikov (actually a muddle-headed good guy) - all represent westernized Russians, and in D's eyes have been corrupted by non-Russian ideas. Are all satirical figures. Only Raskolnikov is not thoroughly condemned. He's a bit of both Old Russia and New Europe. He's westernized on the surface - full of the new ideas, a fact fantastically illustrated by his delusion about being another \\"Napoleon\\", an obvious representative of the west. But deep down he's a \\"good\\" Russian, as his decision to turn himself in and accept the 'necessity' of suffering makes clear. Hence his name which comes from Russian \\"raskolnik\\" which means 'schism' or \\"divided\\". So the central figure embodies the struggle between East and West, and his interactions with other characters are the dramatizations of the so-called \\"arguments\\" surrounding the debate.That's the \\"big idea\\". Whether it ever made any sense - and I doubt it ever did - makes no difference now since it's obviously way out of date. So no-one in his right mind can say that C&P; is a \\"great book\\" because of its \\"ideas\\". In fact, I'm not even sure it's a great book. I've never liked D as a novelist: he's third rate. What he really is is a dramatist and polemicist. He has an ear for dialogue, and a wonderful eye for drama and suspence. But he's a mediocre writer. The main difference between a play and a novel is all that stuff between the dialogue - the descriptive narrative. This is where a novelist shows what kind of writer he is. D is no Dickens, or Tolstoy, or even Eliot. He can tell a good story, but there's nothing in the writing itself that I couldn't pen myself. \\"All\\" I lack his talent for dialogue and drama. Of course, that makes all the difference, but you see the point: he has no style as a novelist. He might have made a better playwright.One last comment on this idea that Dostoevsky is some kind of \\"philosopher\\". I've never heard a philosopher make this claim. A real philosopher is a creative thinker, a person who produces original ideas. There are no original and profound philosophical \\"ideas\\" in D's writing. There is a half-baked religious notion that Russian people needed to \\"get back to their Orthodox roots\\" to escape the fate of godless Western societies. This isn't \\"philosophy\\"; it's sophistry.In fact, as a rule, literature is a bad place to look for new ideas. In the past year I've read most of Dickens and Shakespeare, two of the most original and creative writers in any language, and neither ever expressed an idea that someone else hadn't already uttered. What they did do was express old ideas in wonderfully new ways. It's how they phrased thoughts that made them worth reading, not the thoughts themselves, which were often quite banal (\\"to be or not to be...\\"!). Dostoevsky is no different. It isn't what he wrote that was important, but how he wrote it - not the ideas themselves, but how he dramatised those ideas.So if you want philosophy, then go read philosophy. But if you want nice stories, then read literature. C&P; is a good, but not great, story. It's definitely not philososphy, though. Not even bad philosphy."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The unsettling story of a sultry young man with unbridled passion fell into his own state of deprivation."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Rodia, the main character of the book, divides humans into two groups- 1) those that must obey the laws and 2) those that are laws unto themselves, to which to other law is applicable. Using this idea, he rationalizes the murder of a pawn broker, which led to the incidental murder of the pawn broker's sister. He saw the first woman as a parasite on humanity, so rationalized her killing, then rationalized killing the other woman because she walked in on the first murder.I found Rodia to be a dispicable person and didn't really like anybody else in the book. The only person I found somewhat likeable was the cop that solved the crime. The cop understood man's (and Rodia's) many faults, yet still liked him.Dostoyevsky likes to find and dwell on the faults of people, which, as mentioned above, doesn't make any character sympathetic. The book is depressing, so it took me over a month to finish, but is an excellent book, looking at the dark side of men."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is one of the great books on human nature of all time. The book centers on the question of ethical caste systems in human affairs. Is it (as Nieztsche and Machivelli would have it) the case that humans find themselves operating under different ethical laws which depend on such things as birthright, intelligence and social status? Or is the situation that (as Kant and Cicero would have it) all men are equal before the law? And what, exactly, is it which decides this?The story centers around a poor Russian peasant named Raskolnikov who believes himself to be the calibre of person that Alexander of Macedon and Napoleon were &amp; therefore is exempt from the &quot;normal&quot; everyday ethics of the rest of us. He contrives to murder a wealthy old woman and then use her money for noble purposes. The plan turns into a debacle, however, when a second person shows up &amp; he is forced to kill her, too.From there, Raskolnikov's mental deterioration begins. The police know he did it, but cannot prove it. Can Raskolnikov deal with his conscience? Shouldn't &quot;superior&quot; me be apt to cope with the sacrifice of a little messy bloodshed when higher purposes are aimed for? Read this book, and find out."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I've read 4 Fyodor books and discuss him often, so I know a bit more than the average reader unfamiliar with him. I must say I was disappointed. I read it through, and kept waiting to get that rush of intellectual stimulation feeling, but it never came. I didn't get a feeling that I was missing something; it was more a sense of &quot;come on fyodor, I know you're capable of more than this.&quot; The dualistic personality of Rasko was interesting, the superman theory &amp; putting it into practice w/utilitarianism was interesting, and the epilogue was great. Great, that is, until the last page. The standard Hollywood ending of &quot;give yourself to love and life will be eternal bliss&quot; was extremely weak, and seemed to undermine the whole character of Raskolnikov, which got me thinking about Fyodor himself. I'm guessing that Rasko is very similar to Dost as a young student. I would also guess that these superman theories and the desire to kill the old lady was probably also taken from Dost's real life experiences. But from here the novel splits from real life. Dostoevsky didn't actually kill anyone in his life, for he didn't have the courage/evil/whatever you want to call it. It seems like he wrote an entire novel to prove that &quot;well, even if I had killed her, I just would've gone nuts anyways and messed up my life and everyone else's&quot;. It's like he's trying to make excuses for a crime that he wanted to commit but didn't. I also don't like his advocation of leaving reason behind and turning your back on your convictions in order to do whatever feels right. Dostoevsky has such brilliant thoughts, but then he makes these conclusions that just disappoint me greatly. It's like he's too scared to follow his mind, so he just turns away out of weakness. But anyways, I think the novel would've been better if Dost. stuck to his life experiences, rather than getting so fictional. I think his psychology of Rasko after the crime was a bit off. Some killers do feel intense guilt and confess, but the very vast majority of them don't. They rationalize and blame other people and in the end feel no guilt at all. It seems like a case of wishful thinking. But anyways I was just very disappointed with it. Too much boring pointless plot. Not enough development of the philosophies. Rasko fainting whenever he heard someone talk about the murder seemed a bit exaggerated. I did like when Rasko commented that he's not a Napoleon (it just would've been more realistic if he figured this out before the murder). If someone has the strength to murder someone else, chances are they're going to have the strength to deal with the resulting emotions. And I liked when Rasko was in prison and said that his beliefs were all still valid. But then he falls to his knees and gives himself to love and walks off into the sunset to live in neverending happiness. Please. Ally McBeal is more realistic than that. Read The Brothers Karamazov or Notes From Underground. They're more mature &amp; deeper."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment, while at times a bit boggled down by the affairs of minor characters, is a powerful novel. The character, a murderer, is incredibly three-dimensional and true to life. His personal suffering makes you feel sorry for him, to the point in which you wish him free from jail. Fyodor's personal philosophies are sprinked all throughout the novel as well, and are a bonus to the already masterful work.A deep novel that remains one of the greatest works of prose ever written."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This book is one of the best existential pieces that I have read. Dostoevsky enhances the reader's understanding of the human psyche at the edge of it wits. But as you read you start to indeed wonder if this is a time of abnormality for young Raskolnikov or is it a possibility that all of us have the capability of thinking and acting in a like-minded fashion? As time breathes an air of consistency, Raskolnikov is dependent on his wits, but as externalities seize his attention he begins to meander into the abyss of social ingratitude."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is one of the most amazing books that I have ever read. It is slightly different from the original Russian version, however, it's the best book of all time. It is envigorating and fascinating. It makes you cry and laugh. It lets you into Raskolnikov's head and lets you see the flow of his thoughts. You feel like you are Raskolnikov, and those thoughts are yours. It's amazingly real and moving. Strongly recommend it to anyone. It's an amazing book. Have fun reading it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Just because it's long and all the names are hard to read, don't skip this book. I finished it about a week ago, and stopped by this site to see what others had to say about it. What I realize now is that I miss reading it. I picked it up to gain a little background on Petersburg before my upcoming trip there and enjoyed the book thoroughly. But Raskolnikov, more than a week old in my memory (and a murderer, to boot) still enchants me. I feel profound understanding and respect for Rodya, in spite of his actions, and I would characterize this as a longing for his company. By this standard, as well as the egotistic philosophy that the book preaches, I give it five thumbs up."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoevski has a great ability to describe passion, fear and all unstable states of mind. The way he described the passion of winning in &quot;Gambler&quot; , fear of facing the truth that he, Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, was unable to exist without the common man, and is not superior is just awesome. Crime and Punishment provides very colorful depiction of Russia and takes one to a journey into realm of conflict and fear in one's self. A definite classic."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"This is the epitome of Existential literature. Never before has there been such a detailed and accurate account of the human psyche and the burdens of life. Raskolnikov is a man plagued with choices, who battles himself to try to find the best solution to his problem. Influenced Nietzsche and Freud. Incredible read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment is a great book that must be read by everyone that loves the philosophical and social themes that drive great books. Philosophically and socially this book is pure genius. Especially when you consider when this book was written, Dostoyevsky has made an impactful and lasting mark on literature and philosophy with this novel. This book was written in Russia when nihilism was the prevalent philosophy and social doctrine. At a time when morality was moving towards being seen as almost non-tangible, this book makes a bold statement. That statement is that you cannot deny the basic, intrinsic morality that is linked to humanity. Without things like remorse, guilt, and most importantly love, one ceases to be human. Dostoyevsky makes a point that there is something deep in all of us that is tangible...a morality that is not linked to laws but is linked to humanity and in the capacity to love. And that humanity overrides everything. Laws change, philosophies are debated, society evolves...but one must remain human...above all else. An all encompassing theme, delivered by a skilled writer."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Here's a book that intimidates the less hard-core reader. It's thick, bulky, and chock full of text. Get past your fear and you'll find a story so human, so real, you'll never forget it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Crime and Punishment was my first exposure to Dostoyevsky and I must say that I am amazed at his writing talent. I became so immersed in this book that I found myself crying at several important points of the book. Dostoyevsky did an incredible job developing the main characters of the book and bringing out their human side. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read...it will be worth it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Having tried to repeadetly to read this book, I found it somewhat hard to get into at first. However, after I trudged my way into it, I found it very intriguing and facinating."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"When I started to read Crime and Punishment about a quarter through it I decided to stop...or so I thought. As it turned out, I picked it up again. This book can be gory and even boring, and the main character is a murderer, and yet something about the depth of emotion in it kept me reading it.In most modern novels I've read the author tries too hard to show the characters emotions by spelling it out for you. And it comes across mediocre. Dostoevsky doesn't make that mistake, the raw emotion is mostly implied by physical reactions and leaves you to fill in the feeling yourself, almost like a good movie, I think that's one of the things that held my interest."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"It would be easy to dissect the plot of this timeless classic, to go into teh writers prison time and gambling habits and addcition to excess and misery. That would be simple. Instead I will talk about the craft of writing itself. This book excels not so much based upon form in the plot structure. The story is simple and even when examined rather sad and simplistic. Instead it is the craft of writing. Nearly 500 pages of true poetic writing. Writing that sustains even as to some points it bores. By bores I mean in length and depth of personal introspection. Through American fiction we are used to action, action, action, dialogue explaining what the action was. In Russian literature there is a focus on history in relationship to the main characters and their circumstances. Russian literature is concerned with the political forces that shape lives, in America we are concerned with how fame shapes the body politic. Take Dreiser's Sister Carrie as an example of the desire for fame at the cost of morals in comparison to the theft of money for survival, from a despicable person.What I often do with &quot;heavy&quot; books like this is I get the Cliffnotes to accompany the book as I read it, to in a sense have both a discussion internally and a map so that I don't miss any of the rich fields along the way. That is how the classics should be taught, with an eye to the brains that have yet to be initiated into such heavy patience reading."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Second only to &quot;Catcher In the Rye&quot; in my list of all time favorites, this novel could be considered a textbook on the sociopathic mind. Admittedly, after finishing the story, I felt tempted to try and invent my own system of morality... but that would have taken effort. &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; exeplifies the danger of existentialism. This danger lies in the fact that if each individual were permitted to define his or her own morality, than distinguishing what man is a better man than another would be more an acount of the amount of change, period, that he brings to the world than of the values of &quot;benign&quot; or&quot;good&quot; change. Although Raskolnikov's actions changed only a handful of lives it is clear that his motives were less driven by the desire for financial gain and more of a product to validate his own existence and his above average intelligence. It is a common fallacy that all sociopaths do what they do in order to gain someting. In fact, the vast majority of psycho-pathic serial killers murder not only for the &quot;thrill&quot; of their actions, but also in order to prove their intellect. &quot;I can get away with this because I am smarter than they are.&quot; This is the attitude which Raskolnikov keeps to himself, in a most deft manner, I might add, througout at least two-thirds of the novel. The circumstances which he encounters at the end represent his humbling as a human being. Most non-violent sociopaths do outgrow their anti-social behaviors as they age. In parallel, this humbling of Raskolnikov's personality is an example of emotional, and possibly spiritual growth."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I think that this book is one of the best books that I've ever read in all of my life!!! Yah, it's kind of depressing but it's still written absolutely one hundred percent awesome!!!! The plot is completely interesting with twists and turns the whole time that you're reading...I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Well, I did it. After approximately 8-9 months of on and off again reading, I finally finished the magnum opus that is &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;. Overall I found the book fascinating and more detailed than any other book I've read. I think this is what left me most disappointed. After so many plot elements twisting and characters faltering, the ending seemed somewhat unfulfilling. Seeing as I don't wish to spoil the ending for anyone, I'll leave most of my criticism unsaid.Dostoevsky has created a book solid in social criticism and quite heavy in the psychological aspect of the human condition. Raskolnikov is a socially distant character fed up with the world of immorality he sees developing around him. His family sees him as their only hope and those around him love him to death, while Raskolnikov takes all of these envious gestures as &quot;plagues acquired from Asia&quot;. After committing his crime, Raskolnikov is forced to live in cowardice and fear. It is in this state of distress that Raskolnikov realizes he needs love and compassion as much as anybody. Unfortunately it takes him a couple murders and many many peoples shambled lives to find this out.Considering this is a classic and should be read by anybody remotely interested in literature, I'll not say anymore.Well, on to a nice leisurely stroll into &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot;.4.75/5 stars"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Simply excellent! However, I especially liked the beginning more the end. The character of Roskolnikov is excellent built and described. Can be an excellent case study for psychology students."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I only bought this book because I was 3 hours early for a tuition class and it was cheapest book in the bookstore, but it's by far one of the best books that I've ever bought.The story is rather simple - a Russian man robs a woman and he tries to evade the police - but under Dostoyevsky's masterful pen, it gets transformed into a mesmerizing journey into a criminal mind. It also looks at a couple of interesting issues regarding the human brain, crime and punishment.This book does take a bit of patience to read, and some parts are rather boring and longwinded, but overall, the book will leave you feeling....blown away (not the most likely word to describe a classic I know, but true)Read it!"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"In &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, Dostoyevsky poses several questions. Is murder ever justifiable? Can a man think himself exempt from moral law and commit murder because the victim's death will benefit society? Does a human life hold any intrinsic value, or does a person have to prove himself worthy of living? In the end, Dostoyevsky proposes answers to these complex questions, answers rooted in surprisingly simple logic. This novel is a superb rendition of a man's struggles with his demons, his suffering, retribution, punishment and eventual triumph."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Dostoyevsky does it again, well I guess he did it quite a while ago, but this is my first reading. This book is a great look into the soul of a man who though he may be a murderer has a great love and passion for life. The plot held me with every turn of the page and had me questioning what was going on in my own mind several times. It is definitely more focused than Brothers Karamzov and is a more powerful story in some ways. This translation is wonderfully rendered and only seems stilted a couple of times at most. Overall this is truly a great book."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"The book, Crime and Punishment, is truly a classic. The story revolves around an intelligent young man by the name of Rodion Raskolnikov. The author, Fyodor Dostoevsky, explores the young man's mind as he contemplates the idea of murder and the aftermath of committing the horrendous crime. Although I was a bit intimidated by the size of the book, it was worth the read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I loved this novel. I have never read anything quite so brilliant in my life and I read a lot of books! I recommend this to everyone. A must read for sure."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I have a read a lot of books, but I have to say that Crime and Punishment is by far the best book I have ever read. Although the style of Dostoyevsky himself is lost in the translation, the language is still completely amazing. It is mind boggling to think that anyone could think the way Dostoyevsky writes in Crime and Punishment. This is my favorite book of all time and I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Raskoinkov, a student that thinks himself a superman &amp; smarter then everyone else. Is really a lazy, do nothing, want-to be. In Old St. Peterburg, To prove his theory that violence purifies, murders an old women, a money-lender &amp; her sister with a ax. No sooner is the deed done than remorse lays siege to his resolve. What follows is one of the GREATEST psychological studies in world literature. A masterpiece of Insight that calls into question the very nature of good &amp; evil. Some parts of this book may put you to sleep. But, those parts build on the parts that will keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"Here is the conclusion of a paper I wrote, entitled &quot;Theme and Symbolism in Crime and Punishment&quot;. It conveys how I feel about this amazing book. Symbolism and imagery in Crime and Punishment are used to a well-executed and imaginitive extent. Dostoevksy is able to do with words what Picasso did with a brush. Through a couple of different means Dostoevsky is able to convey a powerful theme, and draw the reader into the story. Dostoevsky's means of communicating the theme of &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; add depth to the story,a nd help make his point against rationalists stronger. As Gibian states, &quot;Dostoevsky did not rely solely on the weapons of his opponenet, but used the whole gamut of his artistic resources, among which oblique reference and symbolic devices played an important part&quot; (543). Dostoevsky's masterful use of language and symbolism add potency and effectiveness to this timeless tale.&quot; In short, this book is one of the best books I have ever read (and I've read a LOT of books in my day!)"},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"A look at murder through the eyes of a killer.

As far as the content, I like this translation for readability. Other translations may be more \\"true\\" to the Russian, but that doesn't necessarily make them any more enjoyable. And of course, the price is right. I'd encourage anyone to pick this book up.

This classic will not disappoint, but it is not quite as good as &#34;The Brothers Karamazov.&#34; It is a bit long, but engaging. Dostoyevsky addresses big questions, ones which will always be asked, though this postmodern age discourages self examination which dares to moralize. Dostoyevsky takes you inside the mind of his characters (which seems to be common to the Russian authors of the period), and you begin to compare your own thoughts. One does well to use such a book as an occasion for reflection on motives and values. A little self judgment can be good for us, and if you read it seriously, Crime and Punishment will help."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"It's very easy to read. Interesting as well.

But this book is what Literature is at its best. Dostoyevsky is truly an artist. I used to be a big reader but it died out with me. After reading this book I am hooked again. This book offers everything one could ask for. There are scenes that you refuse to put the book down and the airs on your arm stand up from excitement. You feel for Raskolnikov and want him to get away for his crime. This book offers a total change in a persons humanity. Only Dostoyevsky could make his readers care for an ax murderer who killed in cold blood. The only negative to this novel are the confusing Russian names and sometimes there are lulls in the action.

A very real life take on human conscience and our inability to escape our immoral actions. We are truly our own undoing according to this book. While the reading is slow and bogged down at certain points, the overall psychological effect is worth the read.This book loses 1 star because the author went in later and added a last chapter that doesn't fit at all with the tone and theme of the main character and overall book flow. The chapter attempts to address redemption in a very Christian type of way, but simply reads as a square peg in a round hole. This was the first time I ever read a book and got visibly mad because of the forced and artificial ending.Read this book, skip the last chapter.A Clockwork Orange has a similar problem also."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"I first started this novel during my senior year of high school. I only now, over a decade later, picked it up again and finally finished it. I am glad I waited. Dostoyevsky's classic novel is worth the more serious treatment of a voluntary read. Dostoyevsky uses a young, nave protagonist to explore the nature of conscience and morality and take a rusty axe head repeatedly to the skull of the nihilism sweeping Russia at the time.Raskolnikov is an impoverished, depression-prone college dropout living in Petersburg. Crime and Punishment was published in 1866 and takes place contemporaneously. Desperate for money and convinced that some people (including Napoleon and, not surprisingly, himself) are above moral prohibitions on harming others, Raskolnikov decides to kill a miserly pawnbroker. He rationalizes that the benefit to the world from the good the money will allow him to do more than outweighs the harm to the world from the death of the old woman.The bulk of the novel focuses on Raskolnikov's inner turmoil and tortured emotional journey after the murder. Raskolnikov's sister, his friend, and the daughter of a man he met by chance see him through his despair. It has to be incredibly difficult to write a novel without action to use as a crutch, but Dostoyevsky does so masterfully. This novel will leave you thinking long after you put it down and has made it on to the short list of novels that I can point to as forming an important part of my personal philosophy (The Orchard Keeper by Cormac McCarthy is another).One word of warning: the English translation produced a readable prose, but Russian naming conventions remain and a single character will be referred to by several different names at different times.My edition was translated by Constance Garnett and includes an introduction by Joseph Frank that discusses Dostoyevsky's process in writing it and tries to give it a context within the Russia of that time."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"There has been so much review of Crime and Punishment, my thoughts hardly count - nonetheless, I'll throw my tidbits into the stew. No spoiler information.I'll also add that I read this on Kindle. (I've found that I still prefer paper books, but this download was free). The venerable Constance Garnett translation. With the exception of one or two repeated words, and an instance of a gibberish sentence, I found the version flawless.The story is about a mentally unbalanced young man, who plans and commits a robbery/murder (that's the crime, and yes, he is eventually punished). If Camus' story of \\"The Stranger\\", rates an \\"F\\" (which is what I awarded it), then this cousin on the same theme with many similarities earns a glowing \\"A\\".The tale is complexly woven with a head-spinning network of characters, design, and happenstance. The Russian names were a bit confusing at first. I learned to deal with them. I also dealt well with the complex little world around Rodion, the villain/protagonist (choose your title) of the story. The insights into the thoughts of people is remarkable.I am not formally trained in how to appreciate literature, but I know what I like. After a little effort in getting used to this Russian classic, it turned into a page turner for me. I looked forward to picking it up each sitting. Trying to examine it deeper, I saw that beyond the obvious issue of the crime and punishment concerning Rodion and the murder - there was demonstration of deed and results for most of the characters in the book: drunks, child molesters, diligent poice officers, loving family and friends, greedy misers, et al. Much of the time, they seemed to \\"get what they deserved\\".Not as long as some of Tolstoy's epics, \\"Crime and Punishment\\" seems a good entry choice into Dostoyevsky and great Russian literature."},{"Title":"Crime and Punishment","review":"You're probably looking at this for a class assignment.

The story details his mental and physical anguish of his secret and his attempts to justify his actions.The novel unravels slowly but surely as the idea of noble suffering makes its way to the fore and Rodion has to make some tough decisions that will impact many of the characters in his life.The story unravels slowly but surely as the idea of noble suffering makes its way to the fore and Rodion has to make some tough decisions that will impact many of the characters in his life.I like to draw an analogy between Rodion's anguish and mine at reading the book. It is long -- very long -- and thoroughly enjoyable, but at points I didn't want to put it down and felt compelled to read for very long stretches. Alas, the size of the book make this impossible and the anguish of the story and its weight on me drew on for over a week.In the end, the closing words referring to \\"another story\\" could refer as much to Crime and Punishment itself as to my story of reading the novel."},{"Title":"Soulic Journeys: A Visionary Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment","review":"This is not just a book with words, it is a journey through an art gallery or rather a series of dream-like landscapes. I would recommend it to people who want to try lucid dreaming or creative visualization. A word of caution though: this is first and foremost a catalogue of the artist's paintings. The accompanying text contains very little that is original, being mostly a patchwork of quotes from famous people, personal anecdotes and transcripts of talks given by the author.

But as Anna Meseure's study demonstrates, Macke went through more and quicker changes of style than Picasso, moving every few months from Symbolism to Impressionism to Post-Impressionism to Fauvism to Cubism to the Blaue Reiter Group to Futurism to Orphism to Expressionism. In this intense metamorphosing over about six years, Macke is an index to the extraordinary modernist activity that exploded in the decade prior to World War 1. but whereas Picasso's need for change was driven by intense personal need, it is difficult to overcome the suspicion of dilettantism in Macke's work, this amiable son of the bourgeoisie; a painter who never faced the economic anguish of many artists, thanks to the generosity of his industrialist uncle-in-law; a man happiest in family life and provincial towns: a kind of gentleman amateur, someone blissfully unaware of a world hurtling towards an apocalyptic war. Even an epochal trip to Tunisia with Paul Klee, which resulted in his most celebrated work, only lasted a fortnight. Meseure encourages this conception by emphasising how Macke's encounters with radical cultural currents were always transformed by him in a reactionary way - so his urban scenes inspired by the visual fractures of Futurism become passive and contemplative, leaked of tension. although he contibuted to the first Blaue Reiter exhibition and its 'Almanac', he fundamentally disagreed with its figurehead Kandinsky.There is some continuity in all this stylistic leap-frogging - the subject matter of the Impressionists (streets, cafes, parks etc.), the geometrical compositions of Cezanne, and, above all, the blazing colours of the Fauves. Because it is as a colourist that Macke is treasured today - even his most derivative paintings are lit with a luminous, Degas-like glow. Meseure defines Macke's life-work as an attempt to reconcile 'abstraction' with 'empathy', to paint the found world with severe formalism, pushing the representation towards abstraction without ever abandoning the former. Inevitably, dead at the age of 27, Macke cannot but seem (Meseure concludes) an artist of unfulfilled promise.Macke's text is serviceable as a biographical introduction to the artist, and as a guide to the formal properties of his work, his use of colour and his compositional method. In overempahsising his interest in form over content, however, she tends to under-estimate the latter, which leads to some dubious interpretation of the paintings. For instance, the major 'Girls Under Trees' of 1914 is considered a 'utopian vision', despite the fact that one girl is isolated from two groups, separated from the one nearest by a phallic tree which might explain why. Meseure quotes Macke - 'Even in the games of children, even in the hat of a cocotte, in our joy at a sunny day, invisible ideas gently assume material form' - but doesn't seem to grasp the darker implications of this credo. the solitude, the inertia and the facelessness of his figures certainly allow for a more negative, perhaps deeper appreciation.In any case, the magnificent, generous, full-colour reproductions allow us to make up our own minds. which begs one question - how can Taschen produce such high-quality reproductions in such cheaply priced books, when many of its competitors offer dull photocopies?"},{"Title":"Coyotes of Creek Crossing","review":"It's difficult to find a book that stands on it's own without excess sex, violence, etc. This is one where all the neccessary elements are there to tell the story.I felt for every character, both good and bad.

Romance, adventure, sorrow, and happiness, to the fullest extent that the mind allows, with unabashed shedding of tears."},{"Title":"Coyotes of Creek Crossing","review":"\\"Coyotes of Creek Crossing\\" is the second in what is to date the three-part Mockingbird Hill series by author Dorothy K. Morris. Most of the first novel, \\"Secret Sins of the Mothers,\\" was set in rural South Carolina during the Civil War, although the story was not really about the war, and part of the mystery-drama took place in the present as a young woman tried to uncover the truth about her ancestors. My expectation for the next book in the Mockingbird Hill saga was that we would find out what happened to the characters in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War as the Johnny Rebs came marching home, and that \\"Coyotes of Creek Crossing\\" would tell the story of what life was like in the South after the fall of the Confederacy. In other words I was expecting something akin to what I have read in novels covering this time frame by Margaret Mitchell and Charles Frazier. Instead, I found myself thinking more of the works of John Jakes.I am hard pressed at the moment to think of a second novel in a series that is more different from the first than \\"Coytoes of Creek Crossing\\" is to \\"Secret Sins of the Mothers.\\" The title should serve as an indication that the primary setting for the novel is not the South of Reconstruction but the American West. More of the book takes place in Boston, Massachusetts than it does in Tally's Nook, South Carolina, and Morris abandons entirely the jumps back and forth in time. Most importantly, she jettisons virtually all of her original characters to focus on one and introduce new characters, most of which will be not be continuing on to her third novel, \\"The Eighth Evil.\\"That pivotal character is Charlie O'Donnell, the half-Cherokee and half-Black Irish turpentine maker who went off to fight for the Confederacy and left behind his shrewish wife Sylvie along with their young daughter Margaret, whose tragic fate is the centerpiece of the first novel. After the war Charlie makes his way back to Tally's Nook only to discover before he gets there that his wife is dead and his daughter is now a young widow. So he decides to keep on walking through the Deep South and on to Texas. Charlie does not know it, because characters are seldom aware of the title of the book they are in, but by the whims of Fate he is going to end up at Creek Crossing, a stagecoach station where a coyote and her three youngsters watch with interesting what is happening. The coyotes provide an allegorical counterpart to the humans, but Morris hardly forces the symbolism. More importantly, Charlie is not the only one who is going to end up at Creek Crossing.The other major thread of the novel is that of a new character, Sarah Truesdale, forced into a marriage with her father's business associate only to discover the war hero and upcoming politician is a bastard who beats his wife. When we meet Sarah she is literally picking herself up off of the floor from just such a beating and implementing a plan to get out of Boston and as far away from her husband's reach as she can manage. After reading the first two chapters of this book about Charlie and Sarah it should be clear that their paths will cross and our assumption is that they will find in each other what was so sadly missing in their spouses.As Morris herself tells us in her note of thanks to her readers, \\"Coyotes of Creek Crossing\\" can be considered a stand-alone book, which is certainly true enough. But those of us who read \\"Secret Sins of the Mothers\\" have a vested interest in what happens to Charlie O'Donnell that newcomers cannot hope to equal. My main thought at the end of Morris' first novel was that I wanted Charlie to come back from the war, so \\"Coyotes\\" is certainly satisfying in that regard. Morris remains a brisk storyteller, focusing on what her characters say and think to drive her stories, but I think she has contrived an unnecessarily small world in this one. I find the main characters completely compelling (the same can be said for that of Henry Torbeaux) without the intrigue that follows Sarah on her journey West. I also wish that Morris had played out the scene she sets up in those first two chapters on stage instead of hearing about it after the fact, because it certainly matches the simple dignity of her characters. .Readers of the first novel might be surprised by the seemingly new direction Morris takes in this second book, but they will not be disappointed by the results. If you understand that Morris was a native of Charleston, South Carolina who was transplanted to a small ranch in the California desert then you can understand in part why she has changed her settings. In the third book in the series Morris will return her readers to Mockingbird Hill plantation and continue her saga of reconciliation."},{"Title":"Coyotes of Creek Crossing","review":"\\"Coyotes of Creek Crossing\\" is the second of four in the Mockingbird Hill Series by author Dorothy K. Morris. It is yet another delightful, beautifully written saga that takes place at the end of the Civil War. It is history in fiction, with wonderfully drawn characters, a post-war landscape that draws the reader right into each scene, and an action-filled plot guaranteed to keep the reader turning the pages. Beyond the fictional plot and characters, Morris so realistically depicts the brutal aftermath of the War--from roving bandits, to greedy carpetbaggers, to the numbing poverty and hardships of those times. Throughout the pages, she has threaded the story of a family of coyotes--the pups First, Fight and Eat, and their mother Coyote, thus giving title to her novel and a new face to a species most of us fear. I was entranced from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Church, State, and Jew in the Middle Ages (Library of Jewish Studies)","review":"Robert Chazan has compiled a wonderful collection of documents which illustrate the attitudes held by the Roman Catholic Church and the secular authorities toward Jews during the Middle Ages.

Evans himself began the decipherment process. He discovered that the tablets were palace records and deciphered their numbering system. Since there were about 90 different symbols, he noted, correctly, that the symbols represented syllables rather than alphabetic characters (too many symbols) or ideograms (too few symbols). Beyond these observations, little progress was made until, in 1952, half a century after Linear B was discovered, Michael Ventris announced that he had discovered the means to translate it.John Chadwick tells the story of Linear B. Not to denigrate the achievement of Champollion's success with Egyption heiroglyphs, Linear B had no Rosetta Stone. It had to be understood soley from the internal evidence of the tablets. The book describes early &quot;solutions&quot; that were guesswork based on untenable analogies or theories. Ventris proceeded differently. The reader becomes amazed at his abilities (he memorized complete texts of symbols before understanding what they meant), his insights, and his thoroughly analytical methodology. The book tells in loving detail the steps leading to the solution. You almost feel you are taking those steps yourself and a sense of excitement grows as you see pieces falling into place. He builds a grid of vowels and consonants and painstakingly fills the symbols into their places. He finds words, and you share in the process of discovering they are an early form of Homeric Greek used in Mycenaen times at the end of the Bronze Age.Beyond the decipherment, the book tells what we have learned from the tablets about life, economy, trade, agriculture, and armies of Mycenaen Greece.This book is not only for people interested in the Greek language and history, it is also a fascinating detective story of the solution of an incredibly complex puzzle."},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"This book is one which has an extremely interesting description of the methods used in and the results of deciphering clay tablets which contained what was finally determined to be ancient Greek. I have gone back to reread large parts of it several times, because it is concisely packed with so much information about the development of the Greek language. It contains facts which tell much about Greek history. Did you ever wonder why, compared with other ancient cultures, there are very few Greek Linear B tablets from which to glean information? This scarcity of source material is one of the reasons that Linear B was so hard to translate. This book has the simple but very significant answer, along with glimpses into other cultural traits of the times. It is not a thick book, but what John Chadwick has written speaks volumes. Well worth reading for someone interested in the Greek language and culture."},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"I really liked this book as an outline of the method used to decipher the Linear B script found at Crete and a few locations on mainland Greece. The author is very well qualified to comment on the decipherment given that he was a key collaborator with Michael Ventris.

Defeated the nazis, he started his very own personal &quot;war&quot; against a new &quot;enemy&quot;. The &quot;encripted dispatches&quot; were now the incribed clay tablets of the Mycenean civilization, in &quot;prehistoric&quot; Greece. After a few years, Ventris eventually announced to the word that he &quot;cracked&quot; the ancient Linear B script contained in the Mycenean tablets: they were accounting records, and the language contained in them was an archaic form of Greek!John Chadwick was the first scholar who believed in this discover and, with his help, Ventris won the skepticism and prejudice of the academic world.Thanks to Ventris' decipherment, the beginnig of European written &quot;history&quot; has now moved backwards by nearly one millennium!"},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"Michael Ventris was an architect whose knack for languages, both oral training and excellent visual memory, provided the foundation for his avocation, decoding the Cretan script. Archaeology of the pre-hellinic age supplied the material. Among many scholars in Athens in the 1890's to see the Schliemann treasures was Arthur Evans. Based on evidence of the wealth of the civilization, Evans was led to search for prehistoric writing. In excavation at Knossos, Crete he found that the civilization was in his estimation incomparably older than that of Greece.Early Greek was composed of Greek dialects. Evans found Minoan writing. It is now possible to see that Linear B resulted from adapting the Minoan script to Greek writing. Classical Cypriot writing was seemingly related to Linear B; but the signs can stand for different things and it was too readily assumed that Linear B followed the spelling conventions of Cypriot. Evans concluded that the Minoan language was totally different from that of Mycenaen Greek. The influence of Evans was immense.Ventris's proof that the people of Knossos spoke Greek was electrifying. Decipherment requires adequate material. From 1950-1952 Ventris was fixated by the idea of Etruscan as the language of Linear B. The code is designed to fool the investigator in cryptography. The script derived from ancient material is only baffling by accident. The Minoan script was a case of an unknown script in an unknown language. In theory any code can be broken. The idea is to grasp the underlying pattern. Classical Greek in general is the dialect of Attica. Ventris pursued the matter by comparing similar signs and coming to the realization variances represented word endings of an inflected language. He saw some Greek solutions for names and eventually came to see a Greek solution was inevitable. Initially he did not understand how archaic the language was that he was dealing with in Linear B.Cryptography is a science of deduction and controlled experiment. After Ventris did a radio broadcast and mentioned his supposition that the language of Linear B was Greek, the author arranged to be put into touch with Ventris. He, a specialist in Greek dialects, became convinced after a few days that the identifictions were sound. Ventris indicated he did need the assistance of a philologist. Chadwick and Ventris formed a partnership that lasted for four years. The first paper was a joint work, Ventris felt it would have more chance of being published that way, and was termed \\"Evidence for Greek Dialect in the Mycenaen Archive.\\" In other words, claims of decoding the text were avoided purposely. Linear B is no Domesday Book. It does not yield riches of detail of Mycenaen life."},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"I was so glad to see this work, first published 1958, available in the Kindle format, as most Kindle books seem to be either very new (published within a decade) or very old (Dickens' novels, for example). As with other linguistic works offered by Kindle, I downloaded a sample to see if the non-Latin scripts and Latin diacritics show well, but unfortunately the sample, which includes only the preface and the first few pages of Chapter One, doesn't contain any of them so I couldn't judge. I bought it anyway, since I had wanted to read this little classic for some time. The decision proves not a good one: neither the Greek letters, nor the more exotic (from the point of view of an English speaker) diacritics, including the macron, breve and caron, show properly. Instead they appear as disproportionately big images sitting amidst the lines. I think Kindle is actually capable of showing all these diacritics well, as demonstrated in the built-in OED (although it may still take some time for Kindle to display non-Latin scripts properly), so I'm a bit disappointed with this edition, which leaves a lot to be desired typographically. As a big Kindle fan, I realize that sometimes I expect too much from it. I'll be patient, though. Looking forward to an improved rendering of this work, and to the day when I can peruse linguistic works on my Kindle, with the same kind of pleasure derived from my reading novels and history works on it now."},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"Chadwick was the man who believed in Ventris and his method before everyone else did. Being a Classicist and knowing Greek better than Ventris, whose knowledge was only sketchy and very elementary, he helped tremendously in the decipherment of the language of the Achaean Greeks and their fascinating script, the Linear B.

Another archaeologist digs up another treasure trove of tablets (Carl Blegen at Pylos). Many scholars try to break the code, but no one succeeds. An enterprising high school student tries his hand. .... (It only takes him 17+ years. ...) And the revelation is broadcast on the BBC's evening service (national & international) radio in 1952!"},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"This is a near firsthand account of how Michael Ventris, a British architect, deciphered Linear B and showed it to be a dialect of Greek from well before even Homer. One of the first things the author, Chadwick, reveals about Ventris is his astonishing humility, even as he was untangling the riddle of what the tablets said. And Chadwick has taken this as a trait to follow, leading to an account that focuses on how the language was deciphered, not just who deciphered it. It shows a similar humility about things that Ventris and Chadwick got wrong as they worked together, showing that these things - like most science - are not just a matter of a genius having a flash of inspiration, but require a lot of painstaking work and going down blind alleys at every step of the way.For a picture of how Linear B was deciphered and what we were able to learn about the people who wrote in it (up to 1994, in Chadwick's follow-up to the original editions), this is a splendid introduction, not too simple but still within the grasp of the reader who enjoys puzzles and enigmas. But as a picture of humble spirits working to find a scientific approach to understanding ancient tables, it is magnificent."},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"I like ancient worlds, criptography, lost civilizations, history of writing, arqueology, secrets and spies and all of this are in this book."},{"Title":"The Decipherment of Linear B","review":"How can you understand writings when you don't know the language used, you don't know the writing system, and there is no multilingual text (like the Rosetta Stone)? It hardly seems possible. Yet, making use of the insights of a number of other investigators about the form of the writing, Michael Ventris finally put all the clues together and succeeded.The number of distinct symbols suggested the script was syllabic -- there were too many different symbols for an alphabet and too few for a logographic system (like that of ancient Egyptian). The words could be classified into sets, with every word in each set starting the same way, and with the endings differing. Does that remind you of a language you know? Not modern English, not Chinese, but many Indo-European languages and many other languages have case systems, where the nouns have suffixes indicating their grammatical function. For instance, Yawelmani, an American Indian language of California, surely completely unrelated to Latin or Greek, also has a case system, as do many other languages of the world. This is one of a few ways in which the forms of human languages are structured: there is a root or stem at the beginning of the word followed at the end by a case suffix, showing, typically, whether the word is a subject, direct object, indirect object, and so on.And now you have in hand the main pieces of the puzzle that Ventris managed to assemble for his decipherment. The language has a script where each symbol stands for a syllable (typically a consonant plus a vowel), and it has a case system for its nouns. Suppose we look at the first symbol that differs in the writing of the various case forms of a given noun. We can deduce something about the pronunciations of these symbols, which is ...Well, I don't want to spoil it for you, so I'd better stop here.

His experiences, his insights and his confusion as a member of CSA creates a sensitive account of a devout man struggling with both himself and the toxic dogma of an insular and isolated society. As a writer who has researched the racial right for over five years, I find that Noble does an excellent job of articulating the conversion experiences of the radicalized religious right. It is indeed a short step sometimes from moral dissension to dangerous alienation, from a spiritual retreat to an armed camp.Tabernacle of Hate again illustrates the dangers of blind faith in any leader, the twilight zone reality of isolated individuals whose only truth is the truth from within the movements, the odd &quot;Catch-22's&quot; of revelation and prophecy as practiced by the Identists, and the uncompromising racial and political positions that faith demands.But perhaps more than the examination of the radical movements, Noble's ruthless examination of himself and his beliefs add a dimension to his work that is missing from other works of this nature. Noble provides a clear understanding of how a good-hearted and well-intentioned man can lose himself in a world of fear, hatred and dark religious zeal.Howard L.

In &quot;Tabernacle of Hate,&quot; Noble's remarkably candid first-person account offers the reader an inside view of how a small survivalist, religion-based private community in rural Arkansas devolved into one of the most dangerous extremists groups of the 1980s. At the same time, Noble describes his own personal descent into extremism and his ultimate redemption.Noble's insights into the mind and motivations of the Covenant, the Sword, and the Arm of God's leader, Jim Ellison, are also fascinating as he shows us how Ellison cleverly manipulated himself to godhood status within CSA. Once achieved, any act of terrorism became justifiable.We also learn that the genesis of the Oklahoma City federal building bombing germinated from within CSA and had the 'blessings' of Robert Millar, the leader of Elohim City - a Christian Identity commune in eastern Oklahoma where Ellison has lived since his 1995 release from prison.One of the most interesting passages in the book concerns how, years before Ruby Ridge and Waco, the FBI successfully negotiated with Ellison through Noble to achieve a peaceful and bloodless resolution to the inevitable standoff at the CSA compoundRarely do students of right-wing extremist groups and law enforcement have the opportunity to read an insider's account. For that reason, &quot;Tabernacle of Hate&quot; is an invaluable addition to my library."},{"Title":"Tabernacle of Hate: Why They Bombed Oklahoma City","review":"Kerry Noble has laid bare the inside workings of the Christian Identity Movement, not only from the various groups throughout the country, but from the deeply personal level. For anyone in the area of Law Enforcement to the curious citizen, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Tabernacle of Hate: Why They Bombed Oklahoma City","review":"As a police officer who lost several friends in the bombing of the Murrah Building in Okla City, Kerry Noble's book answered some of the aggravating questions I had about the types of people who are able to kill in the name of some twisted belief, and how they came to be so full of hate. Mr. Noble is able to give readers first hand experiences, as the number two man in the C.S.A. (Covenant Sword and Arm of the Lord). I want to thank Kerry for writing this book, and want him to know I consider him a friend."},{"Title":"Tabernacle of Hate: Why They Bombed Oklahoma City","review":"This book is a wonderful read. It is a fascinating chronicle of how a closed community, founded on religious principles, slowly goes off the rails as its members fall under the spell of extremist ideas."},{"Title":"Tabernacle of Hate: Why They Bombed Oklahoma City","review":"This is an important book for those trying to understand a social movement having a number of different labels: patriots, freemen, militias, Christian extremists, etc. The most noteable characteristic of the book is that it is an insider's account of how ideology and the policy of hatred and violence associated with it are linked with elements of the everyday world. Mr. Kerry describes for us, for example, how notions embedded in a conventional religion like Christianity become distorted and stretched to &quot;explain&quot; and &quot;justify&quot; acts of incredible violence against an apparent ubiquitous &quot;enemy.&quot; In addition, Mr. Kerry details the role scriptures and religion play in both encouraging and facilitating violence against both individuals and groups identified by their associations with the devil. In sketching this link to the &quot;respectable world&quot; and the world of hatred, Mr. Kerry has done a valuable service for us all. For Mr. Kerry's observations suggest that &quot;evil&quot; may not be limited to the different, the bizarre, or the unknown, rather evil may be a simple exaggeration of the known, the obvious or the visible elements of the world in which we live.The book is also quite helpful in identifying the central values, ideas, notions and concepts fueling the movement in general and Christian Identity in particular. It is a particularly sensitive account of how seemingly rational people can &quot;normalize&quot; extremist views and come to view life associated with other belief systems as worthless and expendable. Individuals beginning to understand aspects of the movement as well as those well-versed in its literature will find the book informative and riveting.While painting the extremist landscape as &quot;darkness,&quot; Mr. Kerry offers some hope. We learn from him that it is possible to conclude that ideas, policies, goals, etc. associated with Identity may mask common human vanities, preferences, or objectives and thus are in essence a fraud! . As a result, it may be that in time individuals in groups of this type may ultimately conclude that the ideologies may be suspect and that it is possible to extricate themselves from their influence. The caveat is, however, is that Mr. Kerry is a very inquisitive person seeking to continually understand while persons lacking these attributes may be more inclined to be overwhelmed by group influences and continue to embrace the ideology.This book should be widely read. In fact, this book would be an excellent introduction to the ideologies of the extremist right for a variety of people including college students and citizens seeking to understand the changing political landscape in this country."},{"Title":"Tabernacle of Hate: Why They Bombed Oklahoma City","review":"A must read for anyone who has ever wondered how an obviously intelligent, G-d fearing, compassionate person could end up part of an organization that shoots/bombs innocent men, women and children. Mr. Noble takes us along on his dark journey as he goes from being a concerned friend trying to rescue a couple from what looks like it might be a cult, into the number two man in an organization dedicated to the violent, white, racial overthrow of America - by any means necessary. The book reads like a good novel, riveting the reader as the author takes part in an armed standoff with government agents (long before Waco or the Freemen standoff), contemplates blowing up the Federal Building in Oklahoma (long before Tim McVeigh does the job), or sits in a gay church with a bomb at his feet visualizing the potential for human destruction literally at his fingertips. That every word is true only serves to further engross the reader.What is scary is the almost logical pr! ogression into the abyss of racism and violence. The reader comes to understand the allure of the individual, small steps which lead one inevitably to that which would have previously been found reprehensible. The militia movement, Identity Church, and various separatist organizations all look different from inside and Kerry Noble takes us there. We should all thank him."},{"Title":"Tabernacle of Hate: Why They Bombed Oklahoma City","review":"I was one of the reporters forced to confront Kerry Noble and the heavily armed thugs he commanded at Bull Shoals Lake. It was 1984 and the fascist fringe Noble represented was on the rise: talk radio host Alan Berg had been assassinated in Denver because he was Jewish, an extremist named Gordon Kahl had gunned down two federal marshalls come to arrest him on a minor a tax beef. State troopers in Missouri and Arkansas were about to be slaughtered by Noble's friends. I can tell you when I stood before him, I saw no glint of insight, compassion or self-doubt in his eyes. He liked carrying guns, playing camouflage-clad warrior, and kowtowing to the petty and perverse Hitler who commanded CSA. I find it ironic that after all the horror Noble and his spiritual disciples, including Timothy McVeigh visited upon our country, he writes a tell-all book about his supposed &quot;conversion&quot; from the dark side. Another ignoble scam: this one about money rather than sex and power. Perhaps we'll give Osama bin Ladn a book contract too."},{"Title":"Tabernacle of Hate: Why They Bombed Oklahoma City","review":"Tabernacle of Hate by Kerry Noble is the definitive work about the Christian right wing extremist movement in the US and Canada today. Noble imparts an understandable and pointed look inside the extremist-religionist mentality in the US and even insight into the fanatic religionist movement around the world.Tabernacle of Hate is must reading for politicians, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists and anyone who cares about fanaticism in action and its effects on the very foundations of the nation. The book is well written by Noble and very well edited by Sean Fordyce. It should be the basis for documentaries and even a feature film. It is worthy of the attention of Speilberg. Only a film maker of that caliber can do justice to the importance and ramifications of the revelations of Kerry Noble."},{"Title":"Father for Life: A Journey of Joy, Challenge, and Change (New Father)","review":"I saw a couple of reviews on this book, in a newspaper in Mexico City, and decided to pick up a copy because both reviews were very positive. Besides, I recently became a father so this could be helpful.In general, the book is enjoyable to read but it has one shortcoming in my opinion.As a father of a one year old boy, I thoroughly enjoyed the pertinent chapters and could relate to what I read. The other chapters (puberty, teens, leaving home.....) were not very interesting, for me at least.I now think that if you want to read about being a father, you should look for a book dedicated to fathers with kids the age of yours. In other words, the book is way too ambitious.It has to be very difficult to describe what it is to be a father, of children of absolutely any age, and have people relate to the reading.The book makes a few good points about kids the same age as mine and I enjoyed it, but it tries to summarize too much in just a few pages.Still, an OK book."},{"Title":"Father for Life: A Journey of Joy, Challenge, and Change (New Father)","review":"I purchased a hard-cover copy of Mr. Brott's book from my local library sale, intending to see the recommendations for the male partner (or partners) who face parenting. For the most part, it is an engaging and enjoyable read. However, rest assured that this book mainly addresses the audience as a heterosexual unit or pair. Some of the cartoons skew toward that demographic, which I find limiting. Granted, I am female but I feel that it would behoove the author to acknowledge the different types of parents in today's modern world.Additionally, the following passage from page thirty-four almost led me to stop reading entirely:\\"In most cases, miscarriages--most of which happen within the first three months of pregnancy--are a blessing in disguise, the body's way of eliminating a fetus or embryo that would be better off not surviving. If your partner has a miscarriage, neither of you is likely to find that particularly reassuring. But remember that over 90 percent of couples who experience a single miscarriage are able to conceive again and have a healthy baby later.\\"Both of those statments are insulting and misleading."},{"Title":"Father for Life: A Journey of Joy, Challenge, and Change (New Father)","review":"I bought this book over 6 years ago and find myself going back and reading it every 6 months or so.

Braunbehrens' is not the first Mozart biography I have read that explores these aspects of Mozart, nor is this book as lavishly illustrated as others. However, for my amatuer self, it the best written and most accessible; scholarly, but not academically dry or pedantic.Braunbehrens dispelled for me the myth which has come down to amateurs since his death that Mozart was an unrelentingly tragic, Romantic and impoverished figure. Certainly that myth is not descernible in his music. Braunbehrens erudite insights have enhanced my listening experience, and have given me greater appreciation of this man of the Enlightenment."},{"Title":"Mozart in Vienna 1781-1791","review":"Most composers are victims of myth-makers. The myths surrounding Mozart--his debts, his unsympathetic wife, and the grinding poverty that led to a pauper's grave--have pretty well been enshrined. Even such a musical savant as Karl Gerienger (or perhaps his equally knowledgeable wife) give credence to some of these myths in their work on Haydn. Mayard Solomon, who focuses on the psychological aspects of Mozart's problems, recognizes that Braunbehrens specializes in areas that other biographers have overlooked--finances, patronage, and friendships during the last ten years of Mozart's short life. So we can expect a far less sentimentalized account than the one engendered by the romantics.And our expectations are not in vain. Compared to his depiction by some romantics, Mozart appears as almost a philistine. A true son of the 18th century, he was primarily interested in making money. His dispute with the Archbishop of Salzburg was not about the freedom of the artist, but about the miserable salary and lack of opportunity to make extra cash that the court of Salzburg represented. It's true that while in Vienna, Mozart was often broke, but his problem was a matter of cash flow. The author provides credible evidence that Mozart earned a very good living, spent a lot, but in the main was not even close to abject poverty. The image of a pauper's grave--burnished anew by the movie Amadeus--is erased by the author's explanation of Joseph II's regulations about burials in Vienna. Even though the regulations were rescinded before Joseph's death those, like Mozart, who were \\"Josephines\\" complied with the extremely rational approach that Joseph took towards Viennese funeral rites. So far as his wife being another Mrs. Haydn, Braunbehrens provides ample evidence that Constanze was not only a dutiful, but a loving wife. And Mozart was more uxorious than philandering. So, the book destroys a number of old myths. This book is not for someone who wants a blow-by-blow description of how Mozart's works came into existence, nor an even cursory musicological approach. Rather the author focus on the man--really an enlightened bourgeois of his times.The problem of why the romantic myth took such hold is pretty well answered by the author, who has done a very close analysis of the source material. Simply, it is that when Mozart moved to Vienna, the rich correspondence between Mozart family members began to dry up. And after Leopold's death, it ended completely. As most of his friends and acquaintances were in Vienna, there was no need for an extensive correspondence. Further, any records dealing with Mozart's association with the Free Masons were evidently destroyed, as the lodges attempted to escape secret police scrutiny after the death of the liberal Joseph. However, the author has extracted the most from the surviving sources to dispute the romantic legend. A most useful book that should be used in conjunction with Solomon's biography."},{"Title":"Mozart in Vienna 1781-1791","review":"Like most music/piano teachers, I was taught all the common myths of Mozart, including many of the fanciful myths enshrined in the film Amadeus. I was stunned to learn that Mozart's middle name is not, was not, Amadeus (I'll leave it to the reader to learn the truth for himself). I was likewise amazed to learn that Mozart enjoyed what would be today, a near upper class annual income in the $150,000 range and above (with significantly lower taxes back then). That he lived \\"pay check to pay check\\" is not surprising, but that had he not died, his expected income in the next 12 months would have easily covered all his outstanding debts and given him $10,000/mo or more living expenses. His death and the medical causes are covered, and not what we've been taught. The pauper grave issue has already been covered, so I will only add that for public sanitation reasons, the near-in city cemeteries had been closed, and everyone, everyone, was being buried at outlying cemeteries, way too distant for walkers to reach in funeral processions. And there was a different attitude about marking graves back then as well. There is also quite a bit of debunking of some of the nonsense about his operas, how they were received, etc.The book is a wonderful read, a real page turner. I could barely wait for lessons to be over each day, so I could pick up where I had left off the day before. I suggest that anyone engaged in educating young musicians obtain a copy and learn the truth, then stop teaching the nonsense we learned in school."},{"Title":"Mozart in Vienna 1781-1791","review":"I love this book about Mozart's last ten years! The extensive research and details about Mozart's life are a testimony to how much the author desires to have the REAL facts about Mozart revealed. I have read Maynard Solomon's book on Mozart too, and with V. B.'s outstanding source, Mozart lovers will find out everything you want to know about the incredible and tragic life of the superstar from Salzburg."},{"Title":"Taking Comfort","review":"\\"Rob Saunders just wants to feel safe, but the world is a dangerous place.\\"Rob Saunders is the lead character in this stylish novel by Roger Morris. After witnessing a suicide one morning, Saunders impulsively picks up the notebook the girl dropped, and is strangely comforted by the presence of this souvenir in his briefcase. But as we read further into the book, we learn that Saunders is not the only character who finds comfort in routine, in physical objects, in hopes and dreams that may never be realized (yet are always on the horizon).Every character in this book is affected by--and witness to--Saunders' movements in his daily life, and in fact, through use of different POVs, we know what they are thinking and feeling, know how they react to Saunders' increasingly obsessive actions as he seeks out more and more tragedies (and souvenirs), and know what their own quirks and \\"comforts\\" are. People crave their routines, while also yearning to break out of their ruts and do something exciting or spontaneous. Conversely, if their routine is upset, they feel lost. But how can one feel safe and comforted in this increasingly unsafe new world of terrorism, climate change, and suicide bombers anyway? That's the question Morris poses.As the story progresses, Saunders' desire for more and more comfort drives him (ironically) into more and more dangerous situations. In the end, something has to give. Morris' use of short chapters and different character POVs really keep the pace of this novel fast, as each chapter flows perfectly into the next. If you are looking for a quick, engrossing, different book to read, I highly recommend Roger Morris' Taking Comfort."},{"Title":"Taking Comfort","review":"It's been a day since I've finished Taking Comfort, by Roger Morris, and I'm still not quite sure what to write here. It's not an easy book to sum up, nor is it easy to review.I don't review books I can't consider five-star reads, and I have no reservations about reviewing Taking Comfort. It's just... Well.The writing, to begin with, takes a huge chance. It's in present tense; it's full of Product Placement; it holds its characters at arm's length even as it assumes their points of view. Done badly, this could provide a great example of style over substance. However, Morris does it very well. So all this--at least in my readerly eyes--underlines the book's message: We live in a fearful world, in fearful times. We fear. To assuage this fear, to survive in this world, we find comfort where we must. We create our own talismans: be they &uuml;ber-designed products that ease and decorate our day, the routines we tread, or even--as Morris' protagonist, marketing man Rob Saunders, knows too well--the souvenirs we collect from disasters that occur on our turf.Or, sometimes, disasters on turf we have to make a special effort to reach.This is Saunders' dilemma. He begins his collection almost accidentally, picking up the plastic notebook of a Japanese teenager who commits suicide in the London Tube. Yes, this is creepy; Saunders knows it. He acknowledges it to himself, even as he realizes that it brings him some strange measure of comfort. Doing such a thing once is creepy, but perhaps forgiveable. But then, there's the napkin with the tears of a jilted lover, the bloody handkerchief...and then, the disasters he must go out of his way to witness. And a \\"normal\\" man, a businessman in a suit, becomes a furtive obsessive with a suitcase (\\"The Di Beradino Classic...crafted in beautiful vegetable tanned leather...\\") full of secrets.How Morris plays with this, and with the fears and creepiness of others, and with all those marketing-copy-descriptions of the products of Saunders' sterile, disaster-filled world, keeps the pages turning.This book, I might add, is not for everyone. It's not your average read. It's outrageous; it will provoke debate and, no doubt, some derision. Some will think it's trickery; some might even think it's shallow. I think it's neither; I think it's altogether too appropriate to our times. I think it's very good.Susan O'Neill, author,Don't Mean Nothing: Short Stories of Vietnam(of course, there's a product link..which rather reinforces Morris' point...)"},{"Title":"The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics","review":"\\"The Beatles Lyrics\\" is exactly that, the words of all the Beatles songs written from 1962-1970, give or take a track. There's the #1 chart toppers, the B-sides, the album tracks, even the words for the songs the Beatles wrote for other people (like The Fourmost, Cilla Black, Pete & Gordon, Badfinger, etc). Considering most of the current Beatle album CDs don't have lyrics inside them, this book is actually a pretty handy thing to have.Rather than being divided up by album, this book is divided into three sections: \\"Beatlemania\\" (1962-1965) \\"The Sargeants' Mystery Tour\\" (1965-1968) and \\"The Apple Years\\" (1968-1970). My favourite of the three would have to be the 1965-1968 section. Just like the music behind it, the lyrics are brilliant. I love the storytelling of tracks like \\"Norwegian Wood\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\", and the characters of \\"Nowhere Man\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\". It is this section (and the Apple Years too) that could really stand out by itself as poetry. There's the odd lyric in the Beatlemania section too that would make really good stand alone poetry, but hardly as much. Still, it's all good.The version I have (the 1976 revised edition) has some artwork of what appears to be George Harrison standing against a crumbling red brick wall with a green apple in front of his face. Kind of strange, actually. It also contains an introduction by Jimmy Saville (the 1974 editions onward) where he recalls an early encounter with the Fab Four just before they performed on \\"Thank Your Lucky Stars\\".If you can get it, it'd compliment your Beatles CD collection really well, I think."},{"Title":"The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics","review":"It's wonderful that book like this exists.

This means that such indispensible songs such as &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;Old Brown Shoe&quot;, and &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; (among others) are conspicously absent from this collection. Why? Instead, we get at least a dozen Lennon/McCartney compositions that were never actually recorded by the Fab Four, as well as Lennon's three most famous songs from his early solo career.Another drawback is that the lyrics are presented in a seemingly random, haphazard order as opposed to any kind of a chronological or even thematic one.A wonderful concept well-executed, but must be docked points for incompleteness because of the missing Harrison and Starr songs."},{"Title":"The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics","review":"No reviews, no bios, just great lyrics and good art.

I found the illustration for \\"She's Leaving Home\\" - a comic strip of the story told in the song to be ecceptionally neat.

Also featured throughout the book is a selection of fan art - all of it pretty good.In conclusion, if you are a die-hard Beatles fan, you shouldn't be without this book.

I received the book today and I wanted to check it out bvefore giving it to him and never seeing it again and as I was flipping thru the pages I was surprised by the nudity in the book. There is both animated nudity and nude photos as well as a nude photo of a young boy and girl standing side by side which in some states people have been locked up for child pornography over similar \\"art\\" photos.I guess I will wait a few years until I let him see it if at all. Otherwise the book is a good source of song lyrics and does have alot of nice Beatles related images. definitely a book that a adult Beatles fan will like."},{"Title":"The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics","review":"I've actually owned this book for years and was suprised to see it is still available. This is one of my favorites in my entire Beatles collection. It is filled with psychadelic paintings and artwork from well known artists such as Peter Max as well as quick Lennon sketches. It displays some nudity and is not for every Beatles fan, but captures the spirit of the era beautifully. It's colorful, fun, and filled with page after page of Beatles lyrics. How can you go wrong???"},{"Title":"The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics","review":"This book is utterly inspiring. The music of the Beatles is legendary, and the way the artists re-create the songs into art is visionary and fascinating. Plus, it's not bad having the lyrics handy, too. A must-have for all Beatlemaniacs!"},{"Title":"The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics","review":"It's very interesting to see how artists from around the world envisioned Beatles songs in their minds. Many of the songs seem to take on new meaning when you look at the accompanying illustrations.As a former Fulbright Scholar teaching high school English in Korea, I also used this book whenever I taught pop songs. I would copy a set of lyrics and illustrations and then distribute them to the class. The students loved it! It made the song lessons much more interesting."},{"Title":"American Basses: An Illustrated History and Player's Guide to the Bass Guitar","review":"The book presented very well with good information supplied.

There are plenty of color photos to balance the detailed biographical and product line descriptions for a wide range of US bass manufacturers. Cover to cover, the reading gets tedious because the writer follows similar patterns for presenting the narratives. Toward the end, the founders' quotations begin to sound like a broken record, and many of the product line descriptions read like press releases.From reading this book, I get the feeling that the author sent out a bunch of survey forms to all big US bass builders and a handful of favored one-person shops in the early 2000s, compiled their responses; then added a few defunct builders that he thought were important enough to merit inclusion. What struck me most was the omission of a number of early, defunct builders who were very much part of bass history - the Renaissance Plexiglas bass and the Bartell Black Widow bass come to mind right away. I am sure there are others.That said, aside from a database type publication such as Blue Book, this book profiles more bass manufactures more thoroughly than any other bass reference that I have seen, the production quality is good, and it passes as an interesting read for the gearheads who read this type of stuff for enjoyment."},{"Title":"American Basses: An Illustrated History and Player's Guide to the Bass Guitar","review":"This is an interesting book about the history of the different American Bass companies.

Each instance of the latter gives its author's pedagogy. And indeed most texts are fairly adequate at teaching.Dorier tries to logically discern which methods might be more effective. Kudos for trying. You might not necessarily agree with all that the text suggests.

Throughout this book, Ashanti discusses dates with her friends, jealously, cheating, embarrassments, and falling in love. Although this is Ashanti's first book, she does a job well done with her writing style. Her writing style isn't very complex and her rhyme patterns are easy to read and relate too. Some people would think Ashanti's writing style is to elementary and not in depth enough. But, I like the book for what it is. Ashanti is being true to her and has her own style. I found this book to be very interesting and informative about her life. \\"There's really only one thing that made me want to publish a book of my writings-my fans!\\" In that statement Ashanti is reaching out in a response to all her fans that encouraged her to write a book about her life and past experiences as well as thoughts. Most of these poems imitate some of the lyrics to the song tracks on her self-titled album. As I read this book I caught myself smiling because some of her reflections are funny and easy to relate too. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it was short in length. Considering the length factor I would rate this book 4 stars. This is definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I purchased this book at a recent book signing in CT. Ashanti autographed it personally, and her laid-back, down-to-earth personality in echoed in the sweet poems and personal stories in this suprisingly well-written book. Ashanti discusses proms, being stood up, kissing, cheating, jealousy, hope, and falling in love. For such a young girl (she is only 22), her stories and poems are very well written and easy to read and relate to. They reflect her smooth, catchy, and real lyrics to the tracks on her smash album. The poems lack much irony or incredible depth, but they don't sink--they swim. Ashanti's poems follow the common A-B rhyme scheme, which makes them easy to read. You'll find yourself smiling as you read through it (which will only take a few hours, considering its short length). Many people have been bashing this book because Ashanti's poems aren't incredible--but this is Ashanti. She's not Walt Whitman or Emily Dickinson--and she doesn't try to be. Ashanti writes what she means and means what she writes, she doesn't try to be anything she isn't. For content, this book deserves 5 stars, but it lacked in length, bringing it down to 4. Still a recommendation, and worth the money."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"A reviewer of my book referred to Ashanti's and so I was compelled to read it. In her introduction, Ashanti states that she released this book in response to fans who wrote to her and asked her for more insight into her life. The book is conversational in nature, much like listening to a young person speaking their mind to someone about episodes from their past. It takes a lot of courage to reveal yourself to all for public scrutiny. Ashanti states that she understands what she calls &quot;fancy schmancy&quot; poetry, but chose to be true to herself and write in her own style. I can certainly relate to that. Ashanti is not trying to write like Maya Angelou. She is writing like Ashanti. I liked the book for what it is. Others seem to dislike it for what it's not. I thought that it was interesting. I learned a little more about the young lady, and that was the goal of her book. As Ashanti matures, her words and works will mature with her. If you think that you can do better, write a book, and we'll review you."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"singing. Ashanti does a very good job in expressing her feelings about the various relationships she has been in. Her poems show she is very creative in organizing and expressing her thoughts.

In &quot;No Words&quot; she describes the feelings that she has for her new fling,while riding on a hot summer night. Spirited, moving and often filled with humor, Ashanti's poetry and reflections will entertain and surprise as he offer an intimate look into the life of one of today's most popular performers. These are works that are both lyrical and raw,and tell the truth about love. Ashanti presents her poems about love, along with stories about what (or who)moved her to write them."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"It seem like Ashanti tried to do the same thing that T-BOZ did with &quot;Thoughts&quot; and Tupac with &quot;Rose in the concrete&quot;.

How can such a great song writer be such a terrible poet? It didnt make sense to me because I equate both those processes to be one and the same. I found her skill at writing these poems minimal, most of her content childish and amateurish. They lacked not only alot of emotional depth, but maturity.Granted Ashanti is no Maya Angelou, but she's not an elementary school kid either, that is, it is the level her work can be compared to. I felt like I was reading the work of a fourth grader, if it wasnt for the content.I love Ashanti, but I dont love this work. It just seems like people in her PR dept thought it was a good idea to put out something like this to capitalize on her popularity. Nothing but a ploy to make more bucks! Don't waste your money or better yet, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I could think of only one explanation for why Ashanti thinks she's written a book: she probably hasn't read one before. This is a scam, to put it mildly. There are no \\"poems\\" here, and I think it prudent to note that there are no REFLECTIONS either. Yeah, Ashanti remembers a bunch of ludicrious high school crap, but she seems to have learned only one lesson, which could have easily been brought across in one sentence: \\"Damn, I had a lot of boyfriends!\\"In addition to the inane anecdotes, there are her horrendous \\"lyrics,\\" characterized by her marked inability to rhyme. I think this book would be fine if it was a prom magazine insert, but as it stands it is a rip-off."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I bought this book because I am a poet and a hip hop efficianado and was dissapointed by it.

Here is a quote: \\"When I look into your eyes I still get butterflies / I know this love will grow that's why I'm letting you know / Baby, you always seem to make me feel that this love is real\\" (SEEM to?). Then it goes into an analysis of the relationship that inspired this love she seemed to be made to feel. Little poems on teen loves is nice to read if you are the person who wrote them and want to go down memory lane (and laugh), but it is not worth publishing in a book. Ashanti can sing, act, dance, and model, but writing doesn't seem to be her thing."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"This book is a good and quick read.

I enjoyed the creativity expressed by Ashanti in sharing her story and opinions. Although I was able to read the entire book in a little over 1 hour because of the amount of pages I must say that too the book was filled with interest and diversity that allowed me to want to read more. Because it is a book entitled, &quot;Foolish/Unfoolish...Reflections of Love&quot; I can definitely see myself reflecting back on the many inspiring pages on many occassions. I must say that I did disagree with one small section of the book whereas Ashanti's opinion suggest that if you are in a relationship that does not seem to be healthy for you that it would be okay to stick with it if we saw some sought of happiness if we knew this would be the only small happiness we could get or we ever experienced thus far. I felt that she contradicted herself because throughout the rest of the book she spoke of not settling and being strong. We should never settle and believe that sacrificing our happiness in a unhealthy relationship is worth salvaging. This is her opinion in this one section and overall I believe that the book is a must read and must buy. Loved it Ashanti!!"},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I just wanna say that Ashanti is daring and she's not scared to show the world that although she's a huge singer/songwriter that she had a childhood also.This album reflect her childhood feeling and I love it."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I really liked this book. I wished I had bought it sooner. But once I got into writing poetry, I felt that I needed to buy this book so I could get into reading poetry. I really admire Ashanti's writing skills. She is very good with rhymes. I wish that I could flow as easily as she does. You can tell that she's a good writer because she writes her own music and she writes poems, too. This book was really worth every dollar and penny spent to buy it."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I enjoyed the opportunity to take a peek into a small chapter in Ashanti's world. Poetry comes from the heart of one's life experience. No two people are exactly alike, so who are we to judge the words. Her poetry shows that she is human. She is able to express herself and must be very secure to share this snapshot of life's experience with the world."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"This was a EXELLENT book wriiten by the beautiful singer/song writter.

Don't be mad because she got it going on."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I checked out this book because I was searching for the hidden talent to back up the tremendous hype Ashanti has been receiving. Perhaps I could find it in her &quot;phenomenal&quot; writing skills. Yet, just like her songs, her poems lack sophistication and depth. They are always about the same old topic: &quot;ups and downs of love.&quot; She might as well put her song lyrics (from her debut album) in the book and called it poetry. The grammar and the structure of the stanzas seem to reflect &quot;elementary school&quot; level poetry. Despite my negative comments, I must give her credit though for having the courage to publish her poetry. All she needs is a bit more inspiration and maturity in order to become the true artist she was meant to be. She has wonderful potential, unfortunately, its being channeled in the wrong direction."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"This book was the worst thing I have ever read in my life. Ashanti is a horrible singer to begin with and now I find out how terrible of a writer she is. As a poet myself, I was deeply upset by this book's contents. Ashanti needs to promise the world that she will never dabble in writing again."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections on Love is a very short book only 100 pages. I was surprised when I reached the last page of the book so suddenly. The book looks well over 200 pages because of the thick sheets of paper, the text didn't even feel up most of the pages. This book lacked a lot of details, Ashanti only mentioned her situations such as the way she felt when her prom date stood her up and she had to go alone with her girl friends; and the time she went on a date with her boyfriend and kissed in the restaurant after dinner and didn't care who was looking because she was in love, or the time she got into a very bad argument with another boyfriend in a car. If I wanted to hear experiences girls have with relationships I could asked any girl, not worth the price of this book. Your better off listening to Ashanti's album of the same name. Each chapter starts with lyrics from her album. Ashanti never delved into any sexual situations which was a disappointment. Lets hope Ashanti comes out with an autobiography someday."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"In no way do i consider myself an amazing poet, but i do know what i like, and Ashanti's book is not that! Every single poem sounded the exact same. in fact, i think it would have been quicker, and more enjoyable to open up one of her c.d cases and reading her lyrics...as they could very well be considered her best poems. There were basically no mechanical devices, no hidden meanings so it was very easy to read, but in the same sense her poems have no point to them. Her lack of substance makes me wonder how her writting is even considered poetry. In my opinion they are just lines of emotional nonsense that could have been written by anyone.I read this book as a poetry assignment at school, and found it VERY hard to even find poetry characteristics within it! Even the rhyming scheme is not constant or even understandable. sure it may sound great when made into a song, but for straight poems, it sounds horrible! Ashanti has an amazing voice, and i pride her for her courage...but please, no more books! Her writting hurts my brain."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"\\"Foolish/Unfoolish\\" is very much like T-Boz's \\"Thoughts\\" in terms of structure: poetry is intertwined with antedotes and somewhat misguided advice for the consumer. Unlike \\"Thoughts,\\" which dealt with T-Boz's ideas about things she didn't understand (like Marilyn Manson, in my opinion) and things she did (like her troubles with sickle-cell disease), this book deals with 1) Ashanti's poems, 2) what Ashanti thinks about love and 3) Ashanti's love life in high school, especially her proms. I have to admit to liking some of the poems--\\"Watch Me Glisten\\" and \\"To the Club\\" are my favorites--but one has to remember that she wrote all these poems in high school, meaning that they lack maturity and possibly a few good edits that professional poets would do before releasing poetry books. Every poem in Ashanti's book could be written by any junior high/high school girl in America (whether they're in a honors English class learning about \\"fancy-smancy\\" poets like Ashanti brags about or not); when I think of Ashanti's poems, I think of the girls in my 10th grade honors English class that still wrote sappy poems about love (and I wasn't one of them). There's nothing extremely special about most of these poems (unless you include the fact that parts of \\"Gotta Get Out\\" and \\"Us\\" were used as interludes on \\"Chapter II\\" and \\"Concrete Rose,\\" respectfully). As for the antedotes, my favorite is when Ashanti forgets to pick up her sister to take her to a dance...to reveal the rest would be a spoiler. Otherwise Ashanti is either trying to provide good advice for teenagers in love or talking about her boyfriends. I couldn't care less about her boyfriends--she comes off as this preppy, popular, lovestricken teenager with fairly mundane adventures. If I grew up with her, I probably would be an outsider watching Ashanti maneuver her way through the popular crowd, not giving a damn about whether she would be homecoming queen or not. And since I am four years younger than Ashanti, practically her peer, I can't really take her ideas about romance seriously since I feel she lacks the romantic experience and confidence to give good relationship advice. (I also feel that she has some hang-up about sex, since she never delves into the topic fully in this book or in several of her romantic songs.) I feel that Ashanti could possibly be a good writer (and, sadly, for you people hoping she should never write a book again, she's inked deals to write more books for children) if she were a bit wiser and confident in love."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I happen to like Ashanti CD but I do not like her book at all. It talks about love but it's nothing really deep all she talks about is how she used to talk on the phone with her boyfriend all the time. This book is not at all what I expected.

This is a scam, to put it mildly. There is no poetry here, and I think it prudent to note that there are no reflections, either. So, Ashanti remembers a bunch of ludicrous high school [stuff]; she seems to have come away with virtually no insight apart from \\"Damn, I had a lot of boyfriends!\\" Did you know, or rather, do you care that she would have gone to four proms in four years of high school, if only her boyfriend's lungs hadn't collapsed?In addition to the worthless anecdotes, this slim volume contains some of her horrendous \\"lyrics,\\" characterized by her marked inability to rhyme. \\"Foolish/Unfoolish\\" would be fine as an insert in Teen People, but as a thirteen-dollar hardcover book targeted at kids who can neither afford it or know better, it is a sin.... Please, please don't buy it."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I don't think Ashanti really put this out to show that she was some great poet, I think she was told by her handlers to put out one more thing for fans to buy. Strike while the iron is hot. This books is for die-hard fans only because they'll be the only ones to really get something out of this. I found the entries to be redundant and wishy washy. In one &quot;reflection&quot; Ashanti is trying to tell young ladies they don't need a man, love yourself, and play hard to get. Then in the next &quot;reflection&quot; she's saying that she wants to be with her boyfriend constantly, it's ok to have a little jealousy in your relationship, she's sneaking out of the house and from school for a guy. Which examples do you want young ladies to follow? It's one thing for Ashanti to write about her experiences but if she's trying to pass on lessons at least lead by example. It sounds like she was doing big girl things at an early age, some girls are mature enough for that but many are not. I give this book 2 stars instead of 1 solely based on the strength of her fans. They'll love anything she does like a true fan would, so I can see how they'll eat this up. Maybe with a little more time and proper editing this would have been much better."},{"Title":"Foolish/Unfoolish: Reflections On Love","review":"I really dixliked this book. When you start reading it you are expecting something dramatic to happen. But to me it all seems like elementary school stuff. She doesn't know exactly how to make her stories come alive. In order for you to have a great book, it has to come alive. Whether it be drama or adventure! I really expected more from Ashanti but it turns out that she isn't that much of a great writer at all.

However, the item arrangement takes some getting used to and anyone purchasing this book should read the introductory text in each chapter to better understand how Inglis has organized this volume before using it in the field. His text is very readable and the explanations useful for anyone who doesn't want to get immersed in a lot of technical detail.One drawback for me is that Inglis mixes Northern and Southern Hemisphere objects in his lists. I intend to add some sort of notation to indicate this. Adding the common name of the constellation in which the object is located would be another worthy addition for those of us who are truly &quot;amateurs&quot;.If Inglis ever revises this book, I would humbly suggest that the chapters be arranged in halves -- one for northern hemisphere objects and one for the southern hemisphere.Another feature of this book that could be either an advantage or a disadvantage (depending on one's perspective) is that grouping similar objects (eg. variable stars) together makes it really difficult to use this volume in the field if you want to observe many different types of objects. On the other hand, I have never done any field observation that consisted of looking at only one type of object (to compare and contrast etc.) and this book has motivated me to try this technique."},{"Title":"Field Guide to the Deep Sky Objects (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"This is one book which I will make sure is with me when I am with my telescope at a dark site.

Objects are grouped as stars, clusters, nebulae, galaxies, and faint/far away/invisible. This text goes beyond the Messier objects and has objects from various sources with descriptions as they would appear in most amatuer telescopes or binoculars.This book does seem to be targeted at Northern hemisphere observers, as I do not believe any of the objects listed are south of 42 deg S, with the exception of stars."},{"Title":"Field Guide to the Deep Sky Objects (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"I'll make this quick... I'm an ATM and an avid astro-buff.. I've always wondered what I *should* be seeing. This book clears up many questions and puts forth a practical collection of data describing what to expect to see with moderate telescopes up to 10 inches (dia) or so. - excellent format and very well organized - great detail - gives human description of objects in text - no false impressions by giving fancy color photos - feels like reading my own notes. If you like the title... you will like this book. Definetely a guide worth having!"},{"Title":"Field Guide to the Deep Sky Objects (Patrick Moore's Practical Astronomy Series)","review":"I have never read an astronomical book that contains so much duplicated information. Many facts appear several times in different places in the book for reasons that are far from clear.

The maps are well designed, printed on semi-gloss paper and spiral bound to make them lie flat. Highways and distance between points are clearly marked, making navigation easy and convenient for those who are GPS deprived. The inset maps for major cities are adequate for those driving through, however separate maps are advisable for finding local addresses. An index of counties, cities and towns is provided which provides map grid coordinates and population data.A separate travel guide highlights major tourist attractions, however it is far from exhaustive. Separate travel guides and/or Internet research is recommended for serious sightseeing. Also included are travel advice by country, hotel resources and emergency numbers.In short, the Rand McNally Road Atlas & Travel Guide provides a lot of travel information in a fairly compact and easy-to-use format, and at a reasonable price.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Rand McNally 2007 The Road Atlas & Travel Guide: U.S. / Canada / Mexico (Rand Mcnally Road Atlas and Festival Guide)","review":"I wanted map detail and a spiral bound book.

As a matter of fact, there are roads shown in the Atlas which are not shown on other maps or even on the AAA Trip-Tiks. I actually contacted Rand McNally to make sure that the road shown on the map actually existed and was passable, and the lady I spoke with gave me details about what the street name was, and how that street name changed 3 times when you travel the road. I certainly didn't expect that kind of excellent service, but I got it. And knowing about the road, cuts about 50 miles off my trip.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I feel there is too much information in the Atlas, other than road maps. So, it is a larger document than I feel it needs to be.The ring binding is a real plus too, as it makes the Atlas simpler to use."},{"Title":"Rand McNally 2007 The Road Atlas & Travel Guide: U.S. / Canada / Mexico (Rand Mcnally Road Atlas and Festival Guide)","review":"Great atlas.

When Babe (Louise Herreshoff) and Dol Reeve's collection of decorative arts and the collector's own paintings dropped into the lap of Washington and Lee University director Jim Whitehead, he graciously investigated the alum's odd offer of giving his entire life-long collection of porcelain to W and L. The story of the mysterious donor and his wife, an American artist whose work and art paralleled that of Mary Cassatt, is captured in the fascinating writing style of the novice writer Jim Whitehead. Tom Wolfe has said that this story should be a movie. I agree! Don't miss this story."},{"Title":"C","review":"John Diamond is just amazing.

It's always terrible when someone has an awful illness and dies, but wonderful to get some small insight into it and the real suffering encountered. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a book they simply cannot put down- as strange as it seems! Extraordinarily written and full of integrity."},{"Title":"C","review":"This is one of the first books that I read when I was diagnosed with the same cancer as Mr. Diamond. It's an incredible book and I have recommended it to everyone I know, not just family and friends but health care professionals who treat cancer patients. It will take you inside what it is like to have cancer but at the same time it is also a really funny book. Somehow in the midst of the horror that is head & neck cancer Mr. Diamond is able to see the absurdity, irony and humor and show it to us. The same book is also available with the titleBecause Cowards Get Cancer Too: A Hypochondriac Confronts His Nemesis."},{"Title":"Family Interaction: A Multigenerational Developmental Perspective (2nd Edition)","review":"I first knew of Anderson and Sabatelli's works through the professional journals in family studies and family therapy. I used the instrument &quot;Differentiation in the Family Systems Scale (DIFS)&quot; developed by them in my master's thesis research. Their approach is mostly influenced by Murray Bowen's family system theory. In this text, they again use the Bowenian theory as a grounding framework, combined with structural family theories (i.e. Salvador Minuchin, David Olson's circumplex model..etc.). The authors did an excellent job of integrating existing family science literature. For example, in chapter II--family strategies, they propose six universal strategies families employ to meet developmental tasks during the family life cycle: developing identity, regulating boundary, maintaining resources, managing emotions, and coping with stress. Then, these strategies were used to illustrate family interaction patterns in different family developmental stages throughout the chapters in Part III. The last part disscusses four alternative family developmental pathways. I find the chapter on death, loss, and bereavement is especially insightful. Unfortunately, gay and lesbian relationships were not included here (nor in the &quot;family diversity&quot; chapter). That makes the book somewhat incomplete. However, I find the text is very suitable for introductory family courses, especially for those who prefer psychological approach rather than traditional sociological approach. This book is also recommended for family therapy students as the foundamental knowledge base. Though I left the graduate school few years ago and am a counselor now, I still find some concepts in the book very refreshing and useful for clinical conceptualization. I give this book a very high praise!"},{"Title":"Family Interaction: A Multigenerational Developmental Perspective (2nd Edition)","review":"This book is probably the worst textbook I've used in my college career. Not only is the layout extraordinarily simple and uninteresting, but the writing is a pain to read. I found this text very stuffy and repetitive, with many sentences based on formulaic constructions as, \\"Implicit in our discussion of 'x', we shall introduce topic 'y,'\\" and \\"'x' delineates 'y.'\\"As for the content, it seemed to me to be a presentation of many theories without any supporting evidence. The authors present many psychoanalytic-like theories using hypothetical examples, but few real world examples. If you have to use this book, good luck, if not, there are much, much better texts on family psych."},{"Title":"Family Interaction: A Multigenerational Developmental Perspective (2nd Edition)","review":"So far this book is killing me.Hopefully it will get better.

I love books about personal growth and the power of God in our lives and this has both."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"At first I tried checking it out of the library but found I'd have to renew in person! However, that copy was read by my husband before our vacation. I couldn't renew from Hawaii! So I ordered a used copy from Amazon. Best money I've ever spent. It's full of adventure and real life spiritual experiences from a devout member of my Church. I have loved reading this book and did not want it to end. I read it on the plane, on Waikiki beaches and finished it waiting for an appointment after vacation. It's my kind of book. I even added it to my blog."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"It's true that the author does not have alot of verbal finesse amd that his writing style lacks fluidity & artistic imagery. Still, the story is compelling and what's more, it's true. I cried and I remembered my own mission in so many of his stories even though I served in Honduras. The story is so inspirational. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"This was a wonderful book! In this autobiographical story, Elder Groberg shares his experiences as an LDS missionary in the 1960s in the small islands of Tonga. There are lots of exciting near-death adventures and amazing miracles and other interesting page-turning stories that made it hard for me to put the book down. But more than that was the story of a boy who, through determination and help from his father in heaven, learns to love the gospel and the people with all his heart and grows to be a man. This book is a must have for every personal library."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"I bought this book because I am intrigued by the Tongan people. It is certainly an amazing and courageous story, and I admire the author for his work and faith. I would have given this book five stars, if the author had kept his interpretation of the message to himself. I feel there is so much more that could be learned from the book, if we had been given the freedom to listen and think on our own."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"John Groberg tells an amazing story of his mission to Tonga and his experiences with the Tongan people. In Tonga he gains great insight into human nature, his own mortality, and his concepts of faith, God, and what it means to be good. This book is a great, fast read and very uplifting considering all that has been happening around the world. This book reminded me that the only important thing in life is other people and how you treat them. I love this book and know that I will read it again and again. I've even suggested it for my book club and think we will have a great discussion about it."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"I enjoyed this book! When all the trappings of daily modern life are stripped away, we can focus on what is really important in the eternal perspective, living and loving. Mr. Groberg shares his experiences and love for the Tongan people and culture and relates them to me personally. I was sorry when his mission was over, I would have liked to have learned more. I felt like a child sitting at the feet of a master story teller/teacher."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"This is a wonderful true story about a Mormon Missionary and his experiences on a remote Tongan island during the early 1950's. It is an honest, heart-felt collection of sort chapters each describing a significant event, each with some sort of moral conclusion or lesson learned. It is refreshing to read a story about people and a culture that is totally removed from the hubbub of western culture. While they are \\"deprived\\" of the coviences of \\"civilization,\\" the book makes it perfectly clear that the same issues of society are just as complex."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"Really enjoyed this book. It was interesting and inspirational. Also, Groberg has a very understated, matter-of-fact style which works well because the story is so amazing. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"I borrowed this from the library at the church and once I started reading it I knew I wanted my own copy! I wanted to start underlining and writing notes in the margins (which I don't generally do in books) so I bought my own copy. I bought one for a friend too. John H. Groberg shares his story in a way that the lesson fit right into your life. You want to be a better person, you want to improve your life. It was written beautifully and I enjoyed every chapter. I will read this again and again."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"I got this book for Christmas and love it. Each chapter is short and teaches a great lesson.

Good one to own, and pick up and read a chapter or two on a lazy afternoon.The film was good, yet not totally accurate, but close enough. The book, in my opinion, is better!"},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"This is a book that explains a great deal about the Tongan culture and missionary work within that culture. I was very impressed to learn about the simplicity of the Tongans but also very amazed at the depth of the people.In addition to explaining about the culture, you learn a great deal about missionary work in general. Specifically, you learn about missionary life in teaching individuals, in disappointment, in trying to follow the spirit, and in learning to love the people.All in all, I was very impressed with the message and insights of this book. You can read this book strictly for learning about the culture, but you can also gain a number of insights about missionary work (in some ways, this would be great reading for a prospective missionary) as well as good core concepts of kindness and not judging."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"An excellent movie about what we can do with the help of God. Mormons will enjoy the whole missionary aspect of the film, and non-Mormons will not be put off by any \\"preaching\\". Though this is a film about a Mormon missionary if you don't pay attention you may not even realize he is Mormon. He's just a guy trying to do God's work. LOVED IT."},{"Title":"The Other Side of Heaven","review":"Ok so the reason this got a 4 rather than a 5 star review is because of the product description.

Why?"},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of Die-Cast Vehicles: Identification and Values","review":"Only the publisher could call this book the \\"standard\\" of die-cast vehicle price guides, since it only covers 16 of the nearly 800 documented brands of die-cast vehicles produced in the last century. What it does cover is comprehensive - 624 pages devoted to an extensive listing of automotive as well as aviation toys and models from Corgi, Dinky, Eagle, Ertl, Exact Detail, GMP, Hot Wheels, Husky, Johnny Lightning (Topper and Playing Mantis), Kyosho, Lledo, Maisto, Matchbox, Minichamps (Paul's Model Art), Racing Champions/NASCAR, and Tootsietoys.Among the missing are such well-known diecast brands as Anson, Bburago, Majorette, Siku, Solido, Tomica and Vitesse.The most glaring error is the connection the author makes between Zee Toys and Maisto, an affiliation that never existed. It was M C Toys (May Cheong) that eventually became Maisto, not Zee Toys.Zee Toys / Zylmex, originally a product of Zyll Enterprise, was eventually purchased by Red Box International. Latest Red Box offerings are now designated as Motormax, yet another brand neglected by this book.Still, this book manages to provide a wealth of information, enhanced by a 32-page center section of color plates. The rest is in black and white.To its credit, it is also the first commercially-published price guide that provides a detailed accounting of the complete NASCAR line from Racing Champions.An additional bonus is an index of models by automotive brand, from Acura to Zephyr.My own \\"Toy Car Collector's Guide\\" remains the real standard for collectors."},{"Title":"Standard Catalog of Die-Cast Vehicles: Identification and Values","review":"This is a good book but it was not as comprehensive as I was thinking it would be.

It does give a good over view, though, so I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Handbook for Biblical Studies","review":"Includes useful information for biblical study, most notably a substantial glossary of technical terms, foreign words and expressions, and summaries of sources and authors. The book also incorporates chronologies, lists of rulers, and the Hebrew and Greek alphabets.

Lewis to Arthur Greeves, 1914-1963","review":"C.S. Lewis believed that letters should be about a person's readings, thinkings, and doings, and this nearly half century of correspondence between Lewis and his friend Arthur Greeves richly fulfils all three of these areas. Only a few letters are by Greeves, the rest being Lewis's correspondence to him. Walter Hooper has done a fine job in ordering these letters and writing a fine introduction to fill in the background for these two. The letters are often funny, sometimes pensive, and usually insightful, but they are never dull. I enjoyed them greatly."},{"Title":"The Letters of C.S. Lewis to Arthur Greeves, 1914-1963","review":"How many of us can write a decent letter, by hand, in this day and age? Lewis wrote a bookful of letters that are not only decent, but fascinating, revealing his genius from the age of 15 to shortly before his death at 62. How this prolific writer, full time student and then professor, while also caring for the cantankerous mother of a friend killed in the war, managed to find the time for this is beyond amazing. Particularly useful to the bibliophile are his running commentaries on the books he is reading. There is an excellent index. Highly recommended, needs reprinting."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"This book is a great combination of Flint and Drake.

Thanks guys!"},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"A good conclusion to &#34;The Heretic&#34; tale. Flint and Drake do a nice job of creating a consistent cultural milieu in which to set the story, but it does seem to end just a bit abruptly. Still, I enjoyed reading it and felt it was worth my time. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing how things play out for the characters over the next 20 years or so."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"The Raj series is, for the most part, an undiscovered pleasure. David Drake, a master of military SF, has created a fabulous scenario where an (initially) young Raj Whitehall receives the benefits of a computer intelligence from a previous age to assist him (and it!) in restoring humanity's lost glory. The first 5 or 6 books in the series are wonderful examples of using SF as a framework for examining real-life military history in an enjoyable and exciting (if not captivating) manner.The last 3, not so much. The last one, not very much at all. I had the feeling that Drake was mailing it in. Not much new, and evidently tired.Those of us Type A's who read the first 7 volumes will probably read #8. While it's not aweful, it fails to measure up to its predecessors."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Justicar Demansk knows that the ancient Confederation of Vanbert is rotten. Too many aristocrats cling to the privileges of their office, oppress the people their ancestors conquered, and battle for power. Yet, what alternative exists. To the north, a pirate kingdom threatens mayhem. To the south, barbarian tribes often raid but have never been able to stand up to the Vanbert legions. Now, though, the southern tribes are aided by Adrian Gellert--the father of Demansk's grandson and sworn enemy to Vanbert. Still, a barbarian invasion, even one with weapons from the stars, offers little help for a better life. Demansk decides that the only solution is to become a traitor to his own country--to destroy the ancient democracy/plutocracy and install himself as Tyrant.Closely echoing the last days of the Roman Republic, THE TYRANT follows the paths of these two leaders as they bring their forces to bear on the aging Vanbert confederation. Modern gunpowder-based weapons give them an advantage, and Gellert's implanted intelligences give him insights into thousands of civilizations beyond the stars, yet can two men, however powerful and advantages, overthrow thousands of years of inertia?Authors Eric Flint and David Drake deliver an exciting retelling of the last days of ancient Rome--with just enough twists to keep the reader interested. The battle sequences are well detailed and give an interesting view of how Republican-era Roman-style legions might have fared had they faced gunpowder-based weapons, or been equipped with them.From a plot perspective, the inevitable alliance between Gellert and Demansk eliminated much of the uncertainty in the outcome. Armed with modern weapons, granted insight into social sciences far beyond those in their primative planet (or in Rome) and with a completely modern sense of Economics, Demansk and Gellert are virtually unstoppable. In contrast, Caesar had to face Pompey, a general as well equipped and with as great a reputation as Caesar's. Still, although the outcome is perhaps inevitable, Flint's writing keeps the reader glued to the page to see not what will happen, but how."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"My original review was because Amazon had listed this book as being part of the Belisaurius series; this error has since been corrected. I have read the entire Raj Whitehall series (including this book) and the Belisaurius series; both are good and worth reading but you can definitely tell that the Raj Whitehall series was written first. Personally, I prefer the Belisaurius series but your mileage may vary.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Despite having the same authors, this book is NOT a continuation of the Belisaurius series, but of a completely different series (the General series, with Raj Whitehall). Perhaps there is a minor tie-in to the Belisaurius books, and this is where the confusions stems from? Personally, I can hardly wait for the next installment in the Belisurius series - but this is not it."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"\\"The Tyrant\\", by David Drake and Eric Flint, is the sequel to \\"The Reformer\\" by David Drake and S.M. Stirling and is set in \\"The General/Raj Whitehall\\" Universe.If you read \\"The Reformer\\" and liked it, you will probably think the sequel is even better. If you're minded to try this one, I advise you to read \\"The Reformer\\" first. However, this volume is an excellent example of the old proverb never to judge a book by its cover.The cover art shows a sword-wielding female facing off against a soldier in vaguely roman fighting kit. This creates two possible areas of confusion. First, although this scene does appear in the book it is not typical of the plot. If you're looking for a story with one or more female warriors at the centre of the action, this is not the book for you. Both Drake and Flint have created interesting women warriors in other books. Examples include Adele Mundy who is Lt Leary's partner in Drake's Cinnabar navy series (\\"With the Lightnings\\" et seq.) and three of the five main characters in the \\"Lord of the Isles\\" series. However, that's not what the authors are doing here. I can't say too much without spoiling the story, but one of the minor faults with this book is the treatment of Helga, the character on the cover. Despite having had a sympathetic and reasonably meaty role in \\"The Reformer,\\" Helga ends up in \\"The Tyrant\\" as something dangerously close to comic relief.The other potential confusion caused by having a female warrior facing off against a Roman solder on the cover is that it adds to the risk, already present because David Drake has swapped his co-authors around, that potential purchasers might make a mistake about which series this book belongs to. This book is definately not part of the alternate history series by Drake and Flint which begins with \\"An Oblique Approach\\" and in which the historical general Belisarius is the most important character, under his real name.(In the universe in which this book is set Belisarius was the inspiration for the character Raj Whitehall, who is a very minor character in \\"The Tyrant\\".)Nominally \\"The Reformer\\" and \\"The Tyrant\\" are set in the far future on a planet called \\"Hafardine\\" where mankind is trying to rebuild civilisation after the collapse of a galactic empire. However, except for some changes of names, the economic, historical, and military sitution in the books is a close parallel with what existed in Italy and surrounding countries during the middle of the first century B.C. In reality these books are an alternative history of the fall of the Roman Republic and the schemes of various leaders of that time to found an Empire.Generally, if you enjoy reading military novels with a good link to how economic, political and social factors both cause wars and influence their outcomes, and with characters who are reasonably developed but not so much so that you are focussing on them rather than the action, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Along the same format as the General and Chosen series with a Roman Flavor.

This latest book certainly adds weight to that impression.This is the second in a pair of books plotted by David Drake involving the battle computer, Center, its guide to things human, Raj Whitehall, and their chosen instrument to save a planet which otherwise has no future, Adrian Gellert. The first book was \\"The Reformer\\", and it was fairly readable, but S. M. Stirling is only a fair writer.*THIS* book, on the other hand, blazes with drama, comedy, political intrigue, hatred and revenge, love and laughter. Just about everything, in fact, that makes being alive so intriguing. I came to care deeply about all of the characters, and all of them brought perspective on what it might be like to live in a time when the old must die that the new may be born, and each player must decide for him- or herself whether to attempt midwifery or murder, or both. I found in this book two paragraphs filled with such insight that I deem the cost of this book, in both money and time reading, amply repaid by them.

The General Series. It has nothing to do with the Belisarius Series Universe. So please don't get the 2 mixed :-)Shadow"},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"What is it about the covers of the Drake/Flint books? After the absolutely stupid and misleading cover of the latest installment of the Bellisarius-series the people at Baen Books have done it again: putting a Xena-style (lightly clad) female warrior on front. So what about the content?Eric Flint has achieved an almost complete break with the storyline of \\"The Reformer\\", but has it improved the book? But compared with S.M. Stirling's handling of the same scenario Eric Flint's novel just bombs!The theme developed in The General-series by Drake/Stirling was the salvation of the remaining civilization on an isolated world by a computer and its chosen man.In the original series this was on a world with a situation like the Mediterranean in 500AD, so the main hero was the Byzantine general Belliasrius a.k.a. Raj Whitehall. In the first follow-on novel \\"The Chosen\\" it was a new world with an early 20th century setting and in the second it was first century BC Rome. The computer's chosen man was a (Greek) philosopher and his mission the prevention of imperial decline.Apparently Eric Flint had other ideas about what kind of story he wanted to tell: his main character is now a Roman who wants to seize absolute power to destroy the existing corrupt order. The \\"Reformer\\" from the latest book is just one of his instruments (with the voices of the computer and Whitehall in his brain), like all other members of his family.The real problem with the book is that it apparently wants to achieve so much - explain Rome's decline and offer an alternative like jump-starting to the middle ages and industrial revolution at the same time - but looses sight of a readable story. Sometimes it seems as if the characters are reduced to their sex life ... . So it may well be that the artist creating the cover was not so far of ...It is a sad ending for a great series. I must admit that after \\"1632\\" I had some high expectations of this novel. Well I guess after it I'll skip the hardcover and wait for the pocket edition of \\"1633\\"."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"A really great sequel that is, perhaps, even better than the first in the series. Fabulous. No more need be said."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"In this eighth book in David Drake's universe of shattered human worlds struggling to regain civilization, something has gone off track. The series has been following the formula of repeating historical battles in the far future, on exotic worlds inhabited by the struggling remnants of humanity. All the previous books were full of battles and sheer grit, with strongly drawn characters smacking the heck out of each other. The details of weaponry and battles were told in an engaging, almost educational , style and the politics were almost always more vicious and dangerous than the scenes of open warfare.Then, in \\"The Reformer\\", the Gellert brothers were introduced. Both characters were men of action but in totally different ways, both from each other and from the \\"Roman\\" types of the earlier books. The series promised to introduce the reader to the clash of Roman with Greek cultures, as the previous books had dealt with Roman vs Arab. This is pretty exotic stuff in an age long past the days of \\"classical\\" education. The reformer was ridiculously short but layed the groundwork for another worthy series.So what happened? I can't help wondering if Mr. Flint based this book on Mr. Drake's outline, a blured memory of Mr. Stirling's penchant for Amazon warrior women, and gallons of cheap scotch. The politics are trivial, the literary illusions are so obscure as to distract, the exposition drags on and on, the few battles have none of the energy typical of the series, and the men are idiots.Worst of all, Adrian Gellert is transformed from an intelligent man with an amazing gift into a henpecked bit player who marries into the Kennedys.The afterword makes some of the changes understandable. I hope the new direction of the series appeals to some demographic, somewhere, because the series is no longer good \\"military science fiction\\".Longtime fans of the series should wait and check this one out of the library. I'm donating my copy tomarrow."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"I love the premis for this series, and I really like the authors, but this particular book just wasn't very good. The storyline shifted away from the main character so much that he couldn't even be considered the main character any longer. The &quot;Raj/Center&quot; characters, which are the basis for everything in this series hardly even make an appearance. The story was very predictable as were the little events that were used to fill pages."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Ok, I waited for the paperback on this one, but would not have been unhappy if I had bought it hardcover. David Drake had Eric Flint rather than S.M. Stirling as co-author, and it represents an interesting departure from the tone of the rest of the series. While it had it's fair share of blody battles, they were not the primary foccus. Rather the book followed the politics and fealings of the the main character and his family as they try to aviod the fall of Rome and skip the dark ages.This plot basis is fully in line with the idea of Center trying to create an industrial base to rebuild the old federation that created it, so I was not thrown by it's placement in the series. It also had some nicely done historical events thrown in that fit neatly into the story.I have to agree with other reviewers that there is never any doubt of the outcome of any of the events, so it is hard to be as engrossed in the battles as one usually would be, but I could not put the book down, so I have to recomend it. I don't think fans of 1633 will be disapointed in the charecter and plot development, and there is enough action to keep the 1632 crowd involved.This is a great business travel book to pick up at the gift shop, start on the plane, and use to wind down in the evening. It may keep you up reading later than planned, but that's what a good read does."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"David Drake is perhaps my favorite author. Having said this, it truly pains me to see anything this bad bear his name. The General series that is the basis for this book, is a masterpiece of military sci-fi. The Reformer, the first book in this pair, is pretty good as well.This book on the other hand is crap. Unmitigated, inexcusable crap. Eric Flint managed suck any life the new characters had out of them while at the same time destroying the essences of the old favorites, Raj and Center.While this may bear the caption (book 8) of the series it truly doesn't belong. Flint is most deffinatly not Stirling. Read this book if you need proof. As a better suggestion however, I'd say skip it all together and re-read 1-6 because simply put; I found nothing redeaming about this book."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Eric Flint and David Drake's \\"The Tyrant\\" is an interesting concept. The book takes a stab at portraying the fall of the Roman Empire. But instead of Rome, the scene is the distant planet of Hafardine, and instead of Caesar and Brutus, the cast include Verice Demansk, a lunky bloke with a flair for the officious, and his network of friends, family and foul-smelling enemies. I don't mean to belittle the plot. My main problem with this book is that it's sci-fi by committee. The characters are introduced and forgotten as quickly as last year's reality show. And the stilted language of our heroes - by the gods! - is enough to give anyone a punishing headache. Perhaps \\"The Tyrant\\" would have been less tyrannical had the book been about 200 pages shorter. But the authors, despite their heroic efforts, deliver just a little too much of a good thing."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Flint jumped into the series after the last book also set in the world of the Tyrant. Same characters. I suspect Drake outlined the book a little and 'peaced out' leaving Flint to write whatever he felt like.Totally out of left field all the characters get revamped, with the hero turning into a henpecked loverboy of 'that rich girl', and the characters having Weber style talkfests.Flint, I think, didn't bother to read the prior series book. Drake sure as heck didn't proof Flint's draft. No editor bothered to read both books. They were not just different in tone and characters and plot, they changed key facts.Just off the top of my head:The Rome city standin in prior book (PB) is so huge that the characters are riding through densely packed suburbs for at least 1/2 hour approaching the center city. In this book? Traditional walled city that can be seiged by 4 brigades and with clear walls in the open that guns can be used on. Perfect chance to show a new style of battle, stuffed down the memory hole for easy writings sake.The executions in PB are by a varient of the cross, this book by impaling.The hero uses computer aided echolocation in PB quite a bit in the middle of the book, then forgets about it until the end of this book when it is a total shock to him.The PB no computer trance hazes, here they happen every five minutes.In addition, the key battle scene with the circled wagons and muzzle loaded guns against 6 brigades of Roman Legion standins made no sense, where Flint let the Legion get within 10 meters and some troops get under the wagons. Kill the muzzle loading troops for that sections, tip the wagon out of line, battle over. Instead Flint played it for cheap sex laughs with the hero's girl."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"I read this sucker in 1.5 days, and for me, that's fast...A real page turner, with some nice surprises, and really nice changes in the same series...I have all of their books (mostly), and I actually enjoyed this one much more than the REFORMER, the 1st book in the series.The characters are human , in the sense we see them in many ways, not jusy military.the story is very good, in the sense of surprises, and a really big mix of different events and inluences.It's not as good as the Belisarius series (what is?), but better than the latter books of that series.Also the Center/Raj conversations are in another character, not the main one, a nice change.I enjoyed the new \\"companions/council\\" players that the General creates, a la Raj, on this world; a bit different , for sure.I heartily recommend this Book, it's a really good read in the military sci-fi, ancients tradition. Honestly, a 3rd book would be possible, as now that the continent is \\"pacified\\", they could encounter the other continents in more developped or more \\"evil\\" states that the one they are on.The CHOSEN was good, but pretty Final; not this one.I hope Eric Flint writes it, I love his workThat's allJean"},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Flint and Drake tell a tale that has some interesting technical and historical elements. What it lacks, however, is character and texture. The Rome-like empire of this book is kick-started into feudalism and industrialism by the machinations of one of its highest ranking members. The people doing so, however, are mere props to the tale; interchangeable cogs with little to distinguish them from each other. The lead character's daughter appears to be nothing more than her father in drag, apart from a few remembrances which appear to be flashbacks to earlier books in the series. The villains of the book are rarely seen at all, often appearing as no more than severed heads that appear from &quot;off stage&quot; after they have been vanquished, or making short speeches before they are summarily dispatched a few pages later. The authors are reasonably clever in their work (I particularly like the homages to Shakespeare) and very good at describing the new technology introduced to this Rome-like setting. They simply have not provided interesting characters to carry out the action of the novel."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Finishing the story of the Gellert brothers begun in &quot;The Reformer&quot;, the book develops the character of Verice Demansk, the father of Adrian Gellert's lover and commander of the opposing Vanbert army. Gellert is guided by &quot;Center&quot;, a computer, and the disembodied Raj Whitehall, a general from another time and planet. The introduction of technology by Adrian brings victories, but the end results depend on man's strengths and weaknesses. Eric Flint and David Drake succeed in closing a story begun by Drake and S. M. Stirling, and the transition is very well done. Another fine novel of military SF by this pair."},{"Title":"The Tyrant (The Raj Whitehall Series, Book 8)","review":"Well worth a read. Nice way to fill up your kindle.It has good charcters and a very easy style."},{"Title":"The Mississippi (Campaigns of the civil war)","review":"This book is part of a series of 12 short volumes on the land war published in 1882-3. It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evening there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

It will be bloody, but he wants all losses immediately replaced to his army remains at full strength during the long bloody grind to Richmond.IIB- Western Theatre(2) From Fort Henry to Corinth; The Confederacy hoped to fortify the upper Mississippi in Missouri and Kentucky as a jumping off point to invade the north. Grant wrests the initiative, and with the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson. After Grant's decisive victory at Shiloh, the Union never loses the initiative in the west.(8) The Mississippi; the struggle for Vicksburg, which puts the entire Mississippi in Union hands.(7) The Army of the Cumberland; the struggle for Chattanooga; Union defeat at Chickamauga, besieged at Chattanooga, final breakout of the siege.(9) Atlanta; Union drive down the critical rail line through hard country from Chattanooga to Atlanta.(10) March to the Sea & Franklin/Nashville; after Atlanta, Sherman's famed march to the sea, after which he very nearly links up with Grant driving down on Petersburg.CAUTION:This series is public domain. Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work. Here is the DSI edition:[...]The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such.

I highly recommend this book for anyone approaching advanced studies in any behavioral or neuroscientific field.This textbook covers human neuropsychology from a more scientific, as opposed to clinical, viewpoint than many other graduate-level textbooks. Perhaps this is due to the authors' own research experiences, which have been conducted primarily with animal models. Personally, I think that this is a great strength, since the authors very effectively tie together the findings from human and animal work, and fill in the gaps which would remain speculative if one had to rely solely upon research with human subjects and clinical cases.What this means is that there is very limited discussion of assessment and diagnosis, but a thorough review of the anatomical and neurochemical organization of the brain, and well as a thorough review of brain function broken down by behavioral domain (sensory, motor, language, memory, etc.) and by cortical region (frontal, temporal, parietal etc.).Although published in 1996, this book still remains fundamentally state of the art, and a fine textbook in the field."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology","review":"I used this text in its 4th edition in graduate school and I found it to be one of the clearest, concise, and best-illustrated textbooks on brain and behavior I'd ever read.

This year is the 100th Anniversary of the actual notorious event. The book is an excellent example of the dangers of doing research on past history based on what is reported by the press and the \\"winners of a conflict\\". The sadest part of the story is that, in comparison to \\"the native american old one's\\" version of the story, much of the 3rd generation native american locals now believe the movie's version of the story. From a historical point of view, this book should be read in concert with \\"Willie Boy: Indian-Hating and Popular Culture\\". Then perhaps you should use all the footnotes and go to the original resources. You still will never know what really happened, but you will have a really good look at an embarrassing side of the human species. \\"Love is hard\\"."},{"Title":"Babies! (Sesame Street(R) Elmos World(TM))","review":"You can't tell from the description, but this is a lift-the-flap book. It took my 18 month old less than 48 hours to rip out most of the flaps. The photos are clear and the pictures of Elmo are cute, of course. But there aren't a lot of other things in the pictures to use to help build vocabulary. As much as my daughter loves everything Elmo, I can't recommend this very highly."},{"Title":"Babies! (Sesame Street(R) Elmos World(TM))","review":"My toddler, a devoted Elmo fan, adores turning the pages and lifting the flaps and seeing familiar images like Elmo, Dorothy the goldfish, and other habitues of Elmo's crayon-rendered domain. The narrative is pretty much what you would hear Elmo say on a segment of Sesame Street.As a previous reviewer noted, there are very few actual babies pictured in this book, which is too bad b/c my son LOVES looking at photographs of babies, which is one of the reasons I purchased this title specifically.And, like all the books in the Elmo's World series, this one is pretty flimsy, much lighter cardboard than most board books or even other lift-the-flap books, so despite my best efforts at supervision and gentle guidance, my son has ripped off most of the flaps in this book and the other Elmo's World books we have. So the book is now not so much fun and the small pieces of cardboard present a pretty serious choking hazard. I have tried repairing them, but glue doesn't work very well and tape presents an even worse choking risk.At the price, I consider the books in this series semi-disposable and haven't minded that they only last a month or two. I won't be buying any more, though, simply because there are so many better board books out there -- superior in construction/durability, tactile experiences, illustration, and story/language development."},{"Title":"Babies!

And here as usual Ian Reader never misses the forest for the trees nor the trees for the forest, but gets the balance just right.The book has a sort of tripartite structure overall. The first three chapters discuss in general terms the specifics of the 88 Temple Pilgrimage route: What are its basic elements and common characteristics? Who does it and why? How does the geography of Shikoku (the natural AND human environment) shape the pilgrimage? What are the legends surrounding it, and what are the multiple understandings of its significance? Questions like these are explored first. The middle two chapters take a historical approach, tracing the Shikoku pilgrimage's development from its shadowy origins until the present day. Lots and lots of cool, fascinating details here.Finally the last three chapters are the most personal in tone, as Ian Reader shares with us the fruit of his many years of fieldwork, first as a walking pilgrim on the route and second as a pilgrim on a chartered bus tour. One really gets a concrete feel for the dynamics of these two most common methods of performing the pilgrimage here (others include taxi, bike, and even helicopter (!)). In the last chapter he takes on aspects of this subject most anthropologists of religion ignore, like the aftereffects of the pilgrimage experience on those who have finished it as well as the phenomenon of those who never finish--who in one way or another remain seriously engaged with the pilgrimage on a lifelong basis.A nice feature of this book too are the many photographs, which gives one a vivid image of what the pilgrimage looks like. There are lots of helpful glossaries, indexes, and appendices in the back too, including a very helpful list of the 88 Temples, the kanji (Chinese characters) for their names, the main image of worship, and the sect to which the temple belongs--interestingly enough, the pilgrimage is dedicated to the great monk Kukai/Kobo Daishi, the founder of the Shingon sect, but the temples themselves are not necessarily limited to this one sect.In general, I can recommend this fine book both to the scholar and the general reader, and both to those whose interest is focused on Japan and to those who are more concerned with understanding the earthwide human practice of religious pilgrimage as a whole. And for sure anyone who's into Japanese religion and Buddhism should absolutely not do without it."},{"Title":"Making Pilgrimages: Meaning and Practice in Shikoku","review":"I walked the Shikoku Henro Pilgrimage in 1989. It was the experience of a lifetime and Reader captures the history and experience of the Pilgrimage in very readable detail.Reading this book brought back so many memories. Spectacular views of rice fields, sea coasts, mountain ridges. Long discussions with temple priests. Meeting kids and their grandparents who had never seen a 'gaijin' (foreigner)outside of TV or photos. The trucks zooming past me in long dark tunnels. Meeting other walkers along misty mountain paths. Waiting for an hour behind the tourist bus pilgrims to get my temple stamps. The overwhelming generosity of the people of Shikoku Island and others as they gave me gifts of tangerines, sweets and cups of tea, and more.I met and spent time with several of the people he wrote about, and Reader captures them and their experiences along the Pilgrim trail and temples. Through this fine book I was able to link my experiences others across a thousand years of making the pilgrimage. Thank you Ian Reader, fellow Henro!"},{"Title":"Making Pilgrimages: Meaning and Practice in Shikoku","review":"This is the fourth book I've read about the pilgrimage: Statler's Japanese Pilgrimage, The 1918 Shikoku Pilgrimage of Takamure Itsue, and Lisa Dempster's Neon Pilgrim. This is easily the most comprehensive.The book presents many points of view. How do the residents of Shikoku view the pilgrimage (and pilgrims)? How do the temple priests view the bus and walking pilgrims ? The tour companies and tour guides? The bus pilgrims? The walkers? And how does the pilgrimage today fit into the history of Shikoku, and Japanese pilgrimages, and pilgrimages in general? Maybe its a slight exaggeration, but I would say \\"its all here.\\" It gives you a pretty concrete sense of what it is like to either walk the route, or take the bus. Almost everything - except its not a guide book.This is obviously a book written by an academic, a lot of thoroughly reasoned statements carefully qualified, footnotes, obviously a lot of primary and secondary research. Yet easy to read, fun to read, and informative. One of the appendices even gives estimated costs for doing the pilgimage!Strongly recommended for people looking for anything more than a first person account of doing the pilgrimage."},{"Title":"Making Pilgrimages: Meaning and Practice in Shikoku","review":"I have started reading the book and have only just completed the first chapter.

The text is very well written and I have found the narration very interesting even though this book or its subject would not arouse much enthusiam among many if judged only by its title.

Fiction [no. 73])","review":"Although for some reason forgotten by the US public, &quot;The History of Henry Esmond&quot; is one of the finest books ever written in English language. May be it has lost its luster because it offers no excess of blood-spilling and sexual adventures, but instead finds its way to describe the deepest and most vulnerable chambers of the human heart. I have read a handful of books, be it in English, French, German or Russian, that described the human strengths and weaknesses while tying them to a character one can relate to with such skill. People who do not like it, it seems, are just shamed by the morals offered in such a book, and are quick to forget it. I read &quot;Henry Esmond&quot; when I was a young boy, and now, half a century later, it hasn't lost a beat."},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond (Everyman's library. Fiction [no. 73])","review":"The History of Henry Esmond begins with the sweet Lady Castlewood stumbling upon the lonely abandoned Henry as she tours her new home. Her husband has inherited the estate and his illegitimate 11-year old cousin Henry, is fearful of the reception he will receive from the new owners. Will they throw him out? Treat him like a servant? When they instead embrace him into their family (which includes their daughter Beatrix and son Frank) he is overjoyed. What he slowly begins to realize (as he first becomes their almost-son, and later the de facto head of the household) is that this blessing is more complex than it first appears.Throughout the book, Henry longs for a family, and although he is a part of the Castlewood's, he is also always an outsider. They come to rely on him because they know he will sacrifice more for them then any real son or brother ever would. With every page, the Castlewood family becomes increasingly complex - some relationships are strengthened and some are slowly destroyed in such subtle ways that when a catastrophe comes, it seems inevitable, and at the same time, surprising. True motives are hidden and twisted and everybody longs for a kind of love not given. Through it all, we have Henry's narration (although he speaks of himself in the third person), which casts a lonely and reflective tone over all the events. A beautiful book."},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond (Everyman's library. Fiction [no. 73])","review":"In the minds of some, justifiably the finest novel in the English language.

Fiction [no. 73])","review":"This is a rich, complex, but ultimately unsatisfying novel about a young man of principle making his way in the corrupt and luxurious world of the 1700's English aristocracy.Henry Esmond narrates the story of his own life, and the thing that sinks the novel is that he's always just a little too aware of his own virtue. He shows how venal, corrupt, and selfish all the other characters are, while refusing to admit he's secretly very impressed with his own demure Victorian primness. He's really Thackeray, the moralist with a guilty conscience, pretending to be shocked by the salacious 18th century, but all the time pandering to his own prurient desires.The other characters in this novel all exist merely as foils for Esmond's virtues. His cousin Beatrice, as witty and seductive as Becky Sharp, is never given a fair break. Thackeray's man Esmond, while pretending to sing her praisies, actually hits her with every cliche known to man. Because she's clever, she must be evil. Because she's beautiful, she must be vain, and because she's vain she must be cruel. Because she has ambitions, she must be selfish. Never once does Esmond say anything good about her -- but supposedly he's heart broken when she rejects him time and again. It's more like, he hates her guts and revels in snitching her out behind her back. Esmond is supposed to be like loyal and loving Gatsby, and Trixie is his unattainable Daisy. But he writes about her like he's Nick Carraway sneering at Myrtle Wilson. It's not pretty.Meanwhile, Esmond is debating whether to remain loyal to his family's heritage, and support the claim of exiled prince James Stuart to the English throne, or choose the winning side and support King George I. It would be a good dilemna, but Thackeray cops out by presenting the doomed and royal Stuart prince (who in real life was brave, generous, religious, and fair-minded) as some sort of creepy sexual pervert. Again, the Victorian Thackeray thinks he's being heroic by finding dirtiness in everyone and everything.This book would have been so much better if it had been written by Sir Walter Scott fifty years before. Then Trixie would have been a real damsel, Esmond would have been a noble knight, and James Stuart would have been doomed but noble and good. Thackeray subverts the romance of Sir Walter Scott's historical fictions, but only in the meanest, most cynical way. HENRY ESMOND has less in common with IVANHOE and more in common with LESS THAN ZERO."},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond (Everyman's library. Fiction [no. 73])","review":"This book has been called the greatest historical novel ever and I would agree that it is a really good book. The writing is clear, lively and beautiful, full of color. This is the first time I've read Thackeray and I really admire his prose. Like all novels that are close to 515 pages, the novel has some slow points, such as during some of the the military battles Esmond is involved in; or in the last part of the conflict between Francis Esmond the edler and Lord Mohun which is rather melodramatic. Sometimes the prose does get slightly unclear. The first few pages of the novel are rather unintelligible; I think Thackeray here was trying to make fun of the vapidly pompous storytelling of other writers of his age. Thackeray then indulges in some very confusing discussion of the family tree of Henry Esmond, but after this the story overall is pretty easy to follow and is full of some very interesting characters, Henry Esmond most of all. Don't worry about trying to grasp the particulars about who is related to who.Thackeray throws at the reader a great deal of names and aristocratic titles and it might be hard for the reader to understand exactly who is who. Perhaps an introduction attached to the book would be useful for the reader to give a basic history of the noblemen and kings and princes whom this story portrays from late seventeenth and early eighteenth century Englund. This would have made the reading for me a little bit easier. The central event driving the turmoil described in this book was the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when one Dutch Protestant faction of the British royal family invaded and overthrew James II who had given legal equality to the Catholic religion (or something).But overall the story of this book flows very nicely and gives the reader a more realistic look than others might of British aristocrats during the period. A great many of the aristocrats portrayed here are dissolute, irresponsible and even brutish. John Churchill AKA the Duke of Marlborough is portrayed as somebody who while very brave in battle, will screw anyone high and low to advance his own material resources and has ever changing loyalty to anyone who will give him such resources, no matter what different political party or even enemy of Britain that might be. Esmond while engaging in pious rhetoric about military valor, mentions his disgust and alienation from the jingoist spirit in that that the battles in France and Germany he was involved in, usually ended with British troops engaging in rape and pillage, burning whole villages and crops, terrorizing helpless women and children, etc. One of the elector princes hanging out in France, was in line to become James III (or whatever number it was) if his sister Queen Anne would make peace with him and designate him as her successor. The whole Esmond family piously worships this elector but finds out when they smuggle him back into England that he is really a rather disgusting, vapid fellow.Esmond's young lord Frank Esmond like his father is also a rather dissolute character. I enjoyed the blatant irony Esmond used in describing Frank telling his mother that he was very busy with harsh military engagements on the European mainland, thus he could not visit her back home in Englund. Frank was indeed trying to nock down fortifications in France and Belguim, but only the fortifications of hot young aristocratic ladies.One can pick at little things in the novel--lack of clarity in some places, the lack of clarity of and the amount of time it takes the narrator to inform the reader of the exact nature of the secret told by the elder Lord Frank Esmond on his death bed to Henry--but I finished it with a great feeling of satisfaction."},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond (Everyman's library. Fiction [no. 73])","review":"I believe that penchant for the moralistic (and add here more than a snipett of post-modern political corectness)from English-speaking readers has slighted judgements about this novel, which is a novel about people with sloppy morals in a time of sloppy political intrigue and sloppy moral standards offering a contrast with the philistine ambience of Thackeray's own age. I found the novel simply _lush_, and think that Hollywood has in it a treat in store for any filmmaker of genius who wants to emulate Kubrick's Barry Lyndon.

Where &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; seems untidy (a typically Thackerayan weakness) but inspired -- a great sprawl that demands its readers to indulge in a right good wallow -- &quot;The History of Henry Esmond&quot; is simply untidy, encouraging readers instead to wallow in self-pity for being compelled to read all the way through to the end. In its capacity as bildungsroman, &quot;Esmond&quot; has its moments -- particularly in the relatively compelling opening sections, which chronicle the title character's childhood and struggle to come to terms with his illegitimate birth. In its capacity as historical novel, however, the novel falters with Thackeray's spectacular failure to inspire any readerly interest in the political intrigues surrounding the succession of the Hanoverian line to the throne of England. One can only hope that the novel goes back out of print, where, consigned to the dustbin of history, it may make room for novels more deserving of publication and general critical attention, like Mrs. Gaskell's &quot;Wives and Daughters.&quot; Yes.

The first book in this series, The Skysone, is a good historical novel. The series exploits an imaginative premise - the fall of the Roman Empire in England and the roots of the Arthurian legends. The Skystone develops some great characters, and adds a good foundation of historical background. Unfortunately, The Singing Sword, singularly fails to exploit the potential of the plot line developed in The Skystone. Instead of describing and developing the Celts and the merging of the Roman and Celtic cultures, it dwells primarily on a one-dimensional struggle of good and evil (interlaced with pointless sexual digressions). The resurrected bad guy is a pale imitation of Hannibal Lecter. Publius (the hero) is alternatively wise and bumbling, and willingly participates in completely senseless actions. The carefully developed supporting characters are also wasted. Too bad. The potential for a great historical/fantasy fiction blend is enormous for this series.

I can't wait to get into the third book and see what happens next."},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"I'm so glad Jack Whyte has picked Publius Varrus as our narrator again. I grew quite fond of Varrus in the Skystone. Varrus'journal picks up where we left off in the first book.Rome is pulling out of Briton just as Caius predicted. The colony is growing along with Caius and Varrus'private,illegal army and fort. Caius' son, Picus, is advancing in rank in the Roman army.The Seneca family is still looking for Varrus to punish him for his crimes against them. The Celts and the Romans are coming together for the birth of the first true Britons.Excalibur is born.If you enjoyed all the battles,weapons,politics and religion in the first of the Camulod Chronicles, you won't be disappointed here. The story remains &quot;real&quot; while blending the myth of the Authurian legend within these pages."},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"While not the &quot;Grabber&quot; that The Skysone was, Whyte has managed a solid second book in what must now be considered an ongoing series leading up to, and including, the Arthurian period. Traditionally, second books in a series seem to fall short of the first, but Whyte's The Singing Sword does not miss by much. He is historically accurate, bringing in actual events like the Pelagian heresy, the final withdrawal of the legions from Britain in the early Fifth century, and the tangled succession crisis of a divided empire. Whyte's long suit is character development and his ability to create flawed human beings with which the reader can identify. Also, the book moves along with plenty of action to propel the story forward. Critics may argue that Whyte places the genesis of the Arthurian period too early, but there is no solid historical basis to the contrary. Whether neo-Roman, Celt, tribal Briton, or some combination of all, we can only speculate about whom Arthur's ancestors may have been. Whyte's explanation is plausible. The Singing Sword is an excellent &quot;bridge&quot; to The Eagle's Brood.

Jack Whyte's writing style is unmatched by most modern writers. He could write an entire novel about jelly donughts and make it read like a charm. I cannot put it into words exactly how Jack Whyte writes. All I can say is that his words are a pleasure. I ripped through all 547 pages of this paperback in a few days. What an ease and joy. Very relaxing. Very gratifying. It just cements my opinion about all the garbage that is being published today. People making millions on books that are horrible reads. Jack Whyte is the exception!Jack is obviously well schooled in the history of very ancient England. The Celts, Picts, Scots and Romans are all represented with stunning clarity and picturesque description.My father had this book laying around in his den. I picked it up and breezed right through it. I hadn't read anything by Jack Whyte prior. I was an instant fan from page one. I hadn't even read the first book &quot;The Skystone&quot; either.I guess one might want to read the books in order, but I know from experience that this isn't necessary! If you, too, have been put off by modern authors - give Jack a chance to reclaim your &quot;gosh wow!&quot;GaryFlorida"},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Jack Whyte continues his tale of Publius Varrus and Caius Brittanicus and their formation of the \\"colony\\" of Camaloud. In this, the second novel in the series, the Legions have departed and Arthur's Great Grandparents are struggling for their survival.Whyte's strong suit is his faithfulness to historical detail. From the departure of the Legions to the Pelagian Heresy, from life in a divided and crumbling Empire to the invasion of post Roman Britain by the Saxons and other \\"barbarians.\\"Once again, as in the first installment, Whyte's description and detail of adult sexual situations makes it a novel not for the young or those who easily blush. However, this isn't a condemnation of Whyte or his novel. It is simply more \\"adult\\" oriented than the average fantasy novel.Another strong suite for Whyte is his character development. Each character grows and expands as the story evolves. Furthermore, Whyte doesn't make his characters caricatures so common to most fantasy novels. For example, Publius is certainly a flawed hero and we are shown his more \\"human\\" side.You like Action? There is plenty of action moving the story along. Before you know it, the novel is done and you are dying to read the next installment.This series does an amazing job bringing the world King Arthur would be born into to life. It may not be what really happened, but it is certainly possible.

Jack Whyte is an incredible storyteller and this book is one of the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"I love these books! The Camulod Chronicles are, by far, my favorite version of the King Arthur legends. Jack Whyte gives us a beautifully illustrated vision of Briton shortly before the departure of Rome's legions. His characters are a pleasure to follow. I am particularly impressed with the historical accuracy of these novels. There is no magic in these tales, only the strength and courage of people seeking to survive the dissolution of the Pax Romana. I cannot recommend these novels highly enough.Why then only 4 stars? Because despite Mr. Whyte's wonderful writing, he has a habit that drives me crazy. His villians are 1) unkillable, and 2) ALWAYS sure to return and cause maximum damage. Over and over in these novels (most glaringly in The Singing Sword) a protagonist has an oppurtunity to dispatch a truly horrid villian. Inevitably, the villian escapes or survives to then return and wreak havoc on our incompetant heroes. Worse, our heroes are always ruthless and intellegent EXCEPT when dealing with their greatest enemies! It's a bit frustrating.Anyway, my rant notwithstanding, all of the Camulod Chronicles are worth reading by anyone interested in Arthurian legend or Briton's fate after the departure of Rome."},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Jack Whyte changes the focus of the Camulod Chronicles in The Singing Sword. Readers of The Skystone witnessed the results of years of research into the livestyles and military tactics of the Roman occupants of fifth century Britain. For those expecting more of the same, Whyte's second novel may disapoint. This feeling shouldn't last, however, as the reader realizes just what The Singing Sword is: an exposition and analysis of the trials and tribulations of the occupants of the colony of a dying empire. The characters of Publius Varrus and Caius Brittanicus will strike many as being ancient equivilants of America's own forefathers. This observation only comes to mind in the second novel, because the withdrawal of Rome's forces is so much closer to occuring. The happy-go-lucky soldiering of Book I is gone. It is replaced by familial responsibilty, political jostling for the sake of the new colony, and the introduction of the next generation of characters. Readers are able to witness firsthand the many temptations of Varrus which result in failures and victories both unabashedly. The Singing Sword does not provide the startling discoveries that Varrus and Brittanicus found in The Skystone, but the view into their psyches is a worthwhile device for bringing us the tranisition into the anarchy which should follow"},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"I'm a person who loves books about King Arthur and that period of time.

I found it pretty slow moving with weak and unconvincing characters and it was a definite struggle to finish. It would have to rate as just about the least interesting \\"Arthur\\" story that I have ever read.I was also irritated by the historical inaccuracies. Some examples: the battle of Adrianople took place in 378AD and not 376AD, the macedonian phalanx was an infantry formation, not a cavalry one, the Roman short sword was a gladius, not a gladium.Having said all this, I will probably read at least one more of this series but this is no longer a high priority."},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"I really loved the Skystone and that is what lead me to decide to read the next. The singing sword I was glad to see was still narrated by Publius Varrus. Some of the events in the book were not needed (Cylla Titens). But for the most part the plot was good enough to keep me reading late at night. When the colony was going to be inspected by Claudius Seneca (who Varrus thought was dead). It kept me reading on to find out exactly what happened. Jack Whyte shaped all of his characters very nicely. I found myself involved with most all of them. I thought the book had a very fast and sad ending that I think could have been stretched some more. The book got its title from something that happened in the last 50 pages or so.

Expecting a solid historical novel set in the declining days of Roman Britain, I found that it started off smartly enough . . . lots of action tautly presented (apparently essential in today's market if you want to see your stuff published). But the tale just didn't catch fire. Told from the protagtonist Publius Varrus' point of view, the story sputters along as our hero leads an expedition into the British hinterlands to trade for iron (becoming ever scarcer as the Roman occupation winds down), stops to slaughter some invading Celts and burn their ship, rushes back to sit by the fire with his superior Caius Britannicus (of solid, old Roman stock and an old friend) to decry the aging process, etc., then dallying gratuitously with the lascivious wife of another friend (who finally kills her in a rage, along with everyone else in his household and himself), and listening to his own fine upstanding mate bemoan the moral deterioration in their little Roman colony as a harbinger of terrible things to come! All in the first 70 pages or so -- I couldn't take much more of it and shut the book, rushing it back to the store to reclaim my cash.

On top of this the writing comes from the &quot;one damn thing after another school&quot;; there is no organic plot flow, but only happenstance strung together hamfistedly, with occaisional perverse sex scenes to spice matters up.

There are other books or groups of books that have attempted this, most notably Mary Stewart's Merlin Chronicles - but Stewart never painted her picture with as big a brush as Jack Whyte does, and (so far at least) Whyte has done it without a hint of magic or any other type of fantasy.This is not intended as a slap at Stewart; I think her series is fantastic. It's just that I never thought it was possible to tell the story of Arthur and Merlin from a &quot;human&quot; point of view, until now. Whyte has proved that it's possible. So far I've only read the first two books in the series (&quot;The Skystone&quot; and this one), and if the rest of Whyte's novels are as superbly intelligent and well-written as these two I believe that Mary Stewart has some serious competition on her hands."},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"When promised a history of King Arthur, some readers may expect the story in one book.

I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!The narrator of this story is Publius Varrus, and is the first of two books he narrates.

While I didn't enjoy this one quite as much as I did the first installment, it's still a very addicting and enjoyable read. At times it seemed a little overly verbose in the discussion of Roman military tactics, which to me killed the pacing a little bit. In the end I understand why Jack Whyte did this. This book primarily focusses on the development of the colony set up towards the end of the Skystone. In order to give the reader the true breadth of changes that Caius and Publius set in motion for the colony, the explanation of the improvement of roman military tactics in order to keep up with the ever evolving world around their little colony was necessary. While it was a little drawn out at times, it gives the reader a sense of epic wheels of change the founders set in motion.I don't want to spoil anything, but the book brings back all the characters from the first book as well as a few new characters, some of which are easily recognizeable. That's all I'll say on that!I can't wait to get my hands on the next chapter to see where Whyte goes with this epic tale next!"},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"The Singing Sword is a really excellent beginning to a 9 volume saga of historic fiction (merging with mythology) which attempts to set the Arthur legend into what we can realistically know about Britain starting in the 5th century of the common era.The author has done his homework; there is great verisimiltude in the details of how the Roman legions (where we start) were organized and how they operated in the far reaches of the Empire. He obviously has closely studied much of the historical record regarding how the fall of the Empire impacted the complex nature of the polity in Britain at the time.But like good historical fiction, he interplays his research and narrative with interesting characters, each of whom have a political outlook which seems to represent major factions of the time.It's fast-paced, compelling, and a page turner.

It's 360's A.D. and Publius Varrus, the co-leader of the Colony in the western part of what is now England, faces new challenges as ever-bolder Saxon (and other!) raiders threaten his peaceful home. Together with Caius Britannicus, his brother-in-law, who leads the self-sufficient group with him, he steps up to meet those challenges, which include strengthening their defenses and learning a new way to fight with heavy cavalry.Publius, a blacksmith by trade, begins to attempt to forge a new type of weapon that will serve as sword and spear to soldiers mounted on large warhorses. And always at the back of his mind is the sword he wants to forge, made of the special 'skystone' that fell from the sky in the previous book, the perfect weapon that would be his life's work. Meanwhile, his daughters are growing up and their friend and neighbor to the north, Ullic Pendragon, comes calling asking for an unheard-of allegiance between his Celts and the Roman Britons, forged in a marriage between Veronica, Publius' daughter, and Uric, Ullic's son.Throughout this time, the Colony sets out building a large hill fort to keep their people safe in the face of increasing raids and violence, which is completed and christened Camulod. Spanning several years, this book in the series sets things up for the actual time of Arthur--at the end of this book, Uther Pendragon (Veronica and Uric's son) and Caius Merlyn Brittanicus (son of Ullic's sister Enid and Picus Britannicus, Caius' son) are mere infants, having been born at exactly the same time.Wonderful book, enjoyable story--not all pleasant as there is plenty of violence and death which was appropriate for the times--and with interesting historical detail.

This novel as the second in the series just reaffirmed what a great series this was and I bought every book in the series as a result. It isn't just another Camalot novel but gives you a good impression of the history of the region at the time when King Arthur would have lived and creates a wonderful basis for what would become the legend of King Arthur, the knights of the roundtable and Camalot."},{"Title":"The Singing Sword (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 2)","review":"Jack Whyte continues to reveal the depths of the characters fans of The Skystone have come to love.

One of the biggest disappointments is the essential premise of the book: &quot;we need a sword for use from horse back.&quot; The protagonist spends an entire volume &quot;inventing&quot; something the Roman cavalry alae had been using for centuries. Just as the Roman infantry had adopted the short gladius or &quot;spanish&quot; sword during the conquest of Spain. The &quot;spatha&quot; or long sword, adopted from the Gauls, had been adopted as a standard cavalry weapon by Rome long before. So the protagonist had but to ask his Celt friends for a sword to model his upon.

Lots of action and almost too graphic detail of battles - heads cleaved open, brains spilling out and blood everywhere.

Although the main charater is still Publius Varrus, the retired Roman legionaire turned blacksmith, the story is fresh and different as we are treated to his continuing life story. The Roman presence in Britain is weaker now and raiding parties from the north and south are threatening the Camulod Colony. Varrus and the other leaders have to strengthen the colony defenses. They accomplish this by starting their own cavalry unit. With accurate historical research Jack Whyte shows the reader how Excalibur was crafted as a need to have a weapon to use on horseback.The first person narative is still one of the best parts of the book as it gives an intimate feel to the main character. However there are a few disappointments with &quot;The Singing Sword&quot;. The first is the ressurection of the villian from the first story. The second and less obvious point is this: the first book told a story about a group a men and women in Britain, and the Arthurian elements seemed to fall in place around them easily. In this book the story seems to be bent and twisted in order to meet up with the Arthurian concepts.Still, considering the great characters and quick paced story telling these points can be over looked. It still deserves a four star rating."},{"Title":"Rookie cookie cookbook: Everyday recipes for kids","review":"This book is super-duper coolness!!

It is particulary good at explaining anima and animus dynamics and would be a great read for men trying to understand different types of women. It will also serve as an excellent model for a woman doing her own inner work.I work in the psychology field and I'm very picky about books in this genre. I have absolutely no reservations about giving this book my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Way of All Women","review":"I read this book in my mid twenties, when I was first truly beginning my search for a mate. (It took me until 39, but it worked). I truly wanted to understand women on a deeper level than I did at the time. I'd read alot of Herman Hesse, which got me in touch with my deeper self, but a a man searching for himself, not much there to learn about women. So at the time I read it, I was VERY open to what she had to say. And she broke things down into distinct groups. The types who I was never going to be good enough for, the ones waiting for a fairytale prince, The angry and lost, the kindly but weak, the strong but overbearing, etc. I was amazed at how well she categorized this fairer sex and it helped me focus in on the attributes I was looking for as well as focus in on a bit about myself.While she didn't help me decide the nature vs. nurture argument, she did help me understand the many traits that usually run together as a core group of each type she mentioned. I not only read the book a second time, highlighting certain portions of text to share with my friends I felt wanted to understand women, but I wound up buying many used copies to give as gifts. (It was not in print at that time.)But by understanding the type of women I was with, it allowed me to prosecute my relationships on a healthier, less dramatic level and to take time to discover things at my own rate, yet to have a better understanding of what I was taking in. This allowed me to forgive many poor behaviors and even to help a few women friends to understand themselves a little better.I'm married ten years now and it's been the most content period of my life thus far. I truly believe this book has something to do with this level of success I've experienced. The book has not only served me, but it has helped me to better serve the women in my life.The book sits on my shelf, where I take it out from time to time to re read a section or two to understand one of the women in my life, not just on a romantic level, but on all levels!, just a little bit better. And as I get older, and in some ways I grow away from my very emotional younger man I once was, it reminds ME to allow a little bit more emotion into my life and my marriage than I'd otherwise be likely to do. This is a marvelous read for men and women both. And it is as prescient today, if not perhaps more so, than it was when it was written all those decades ago. Five stars. No question."},{"Title":"The Uses of the Old Testament in the New","review":"This book is now in reprint by Wipf and Stock (originally by Moody Press). This book is an excellent book that engages hermeneutics, intertextuality, typology, ethics, dispensationalism, and covenant theology. He engages key ideas like \\"rest\\" in Hebrews and disputed passages such as Acts 15:15-16. The core thesis of this book is that all of the NT writers cited the OT with due regard to the original author's intention. Each passage has one sense and he rejects any attempts at supporting a hermeneutic of dual or deeper meaning.Kaiser expounds his own middle way between dispensationalism and covenant theology called \\"promise theology\\" or epangelical theology.Part 1: The Apologetic Use of the Old Testament in the NewPart 2: The Prophetic Use of the Old Testament in the NewPart 3: The Typological Use of the Old Testament in the NewPart 4: The Theological Use of the Old Testament in the NewPart 5: The Practical Use of the Old Testament in the NewBook reviews can be found here:Bock, D.

This text mainly deals with nonlinear time series and helps the reader understand the basic results of nonlinear stochastic equations. Several common nonlinear models are presented and dealt with, and an extention of the linear concept of integration is provided. The main problems in this book are the lack of a full dynamical system approach that makes some results rather difficult to be understood for the reader and therefore the loss of generality in the explanation of the concepts. It's anyway a good book that studies in a deep way bilinear and smooth transition autoregressive models from a theoretical point of view. I also found it extremely clear, which is a common characteristic of Granger's texts, and I would recommend it to all the econometricians who already have a good knowledge of nonlinear deterministic systems and want to understand stochastic nonlinear models better."},{"Title":"Modelling Nonlinear Economic Relationships (Advanced Texts in Econometrics)","review":"This book is highly influential. Many works on nonlinear modelling have cited this book. Written by one of the Noble econometricians, this book is surprisingly not hard to follow.The explanations are clear and concise.

BOOK COVER IMAGE. I have no objection to you inviting people to offer their own pictures to enhance sales.

When I buy a book, I expect the original printed book (or a facsimile reprint) with its original or facsimile of the cover.B. PRINTING AND BINDING. Books are generally printed with the leading pages (ie. Title page, Dedication, Contents, Index etc) on the right-hand open page, often leaving the previous left-hand page blank. Similarly, with many books, each Chapter commences on a fresh right-hand page, leaving the previous left-hand page blank or only partially printed.C. PAGE NUMBERING.

I was pleased to find it for the Kindle; BUT this particular version isn't very useful. There are several problems with it.1) There are quite a few type-O's. Appears that the document was scanned and never proof read.2) There are words dropped from the text too.3) While the author has meticulously footnoted his script, there are no hyper links attached in this electronic version so it makes the footnotes much less useful.Of the three problems noted above I find number 3 the most disadvantageous. A text of this nature requires review of the footnotes at the precise instant one comes to it. Having to page forward to locate it and then try to return to the previous stopping point is too tedious a process. Hyper links are necessary if this is to be use as an actual study tool.That said, the information contained herein is valuable and worth study.

This litte Dover edition, titled Favorite Poems, is a good introduction to much of Wordsworth's greatest poetry.Wordworth's poetry is quite accessible to the modern reader. There is no need for extensive familiarity with Greek and Roman mythology, nor for knowledge of archaic poetic terms. Footnotes and a glossary are not required.I have read these 39 poems comprising the Dover collection three or four times over the last few years. With each reading I find Wordsworth's questioning of man's relationship to nature and \\"what man has made of man\\" to be as relevant today as it was two centuries ago.My favorites in this collection include:Composed Upon Westminister Bridge Sept. 3, 1802 - Elegiac Stanzas - I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud - In London, September 1802 - Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey - Lines Written in Early Spring - London, 1802 - Mutability - My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold - Nuns Fret Not at Their Convent's Narrow Room - Nutting - Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood - On the Extinction of the Venetian Republic - Resolution and Independence - Scorn Not the Sonnet - She Dwelt Along the Untrodden Ways - The World is Too Much with Us, Late and Soon.The other poems in this collection are:The Affliction of Margaret - Anecdote for Fathers - Character of the Happy Warrior - Expostulation and Reply - Extempore Effusion upon the Death of James Hogg - I Traveled Among Unknown Men - The Idiot Boy - Inside of King's College Chapel, Cambridge - Lucy Gray - November 1806 - Ode to Duty - The Pet Lamb - She Was a Phantom of Delight - A Slumber Did My Spirit Seal - The Solitary Reaper - Strange Fits of Passion I Have Known - Thought of a Briton on the Subjugation of Switzerland - Three Years She Grew in Sun and Shower - To Sleep - To Toussaint L'Ouverture - We Are Seven.For the reader looking for a more extensive collection of Wordsworth's poetry, explanatory notes, and some poetic criticism, I recommend the hardbound Everyman's Library \\"Selected Poems\\", edited by Damian Davies. ISBN 1-85715-245-X"},{"Title":"Favorite Poems (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"This is not an edition for scholars, nor for the reader who wishes to know the great body of Wordsworth's poetry. It contains most of the great poems so frequently anthologized, including the two longer Odes, the Intimations Ode, and Tintern Abbey. It also includes much of the most memorable shorter work.Wordsworth is one of my favorite poets. His simple clear language, his quiet reflectiveness, his direct and arresting descriptions of nature, his deeply moral relation to life, his sublime metaphysical reflectiveness, his tranquility, his presentation of recollecting self at the heart of his work, his philosophical sublimity and clarity, his sympathetic relation to ' common people' his nobility of utterance, his capacity for creating great and memorable lines are all evidenced here."},{"Title":"Favorite Poems (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"Plenty of literary works to refer to. Great index. Great book for thrift shopping."},{"Title":"Favorite Poems (Dover Thrift Editions)","review":"I am always interested in reading poetry, I have loved it since childhood. However I do not find the wonder many attribute to Wordsworth and some of the other past poetic icons professors and/or instructors at many colleges and universities attempt to push down their students throats.Yes, I grew up with English teachers rambling off a list of names they felt were the great poets of the past (lists I am sure they were given, fed, or forced to accept, by their professors and instructors who themselves were force to accept too. I have always wondered who it was that originally decided that these few poets and their poetry were any better than anyone elses. I find the common man or women in society can spill forth just as majestic and just as meaningful lines of poetry as any of these so called greats.To date I still wonder who those mysterious deciders of what is or is not good poetry are, and why they missed the mark so badly.Don't get me wrong I enjoy reading anyones poems and I try my best to find something in every poem that inspires my soul or makes me think. I have done so in the poems of this book as well. But I do not find the greatness that some seem to find or are told they should find, in all of these works. A few of them are just tedious nonthinness.As a matter of fact I can pick up a copy of the American Poetry Anthology published by Robert Nelson every year or so, that has page after page, after page of average everyday citizen's poems in them and find works that far surpass the works (as far as touching my very soul with meaning and insight) found in this book of Wordsworth.And I hardly think anyone trying to make the case that only a sophisticate (here place the word elitist if it suits you) can find the greatness of the works here presented. That is an valid argument and would be quite egotistical and condensending now wouldn't it?I in fact liked this book, but it did not move me like Frost and many others have. I have found in my life hundreds of poems and dozens of poets who relay their artistic prowess far better than Wrodsworth ever did. now I know why the book is priced as it is.

Two individuals made my life bearable: Mickey Mantle and Bob Hoffman! From the late fifties through the late sixties I was a welterweight lifter out of Oakland, California. I enjoyed a small measure of success. I can recall being at the newsstand each month on the appropriate day to search the racks for the latest Strength and Health. I would read those magazines from cover to cover, every word, and would do so several times before the next issue was released. And throughout those years I certainly bought more than my share of York equipment.Someone once said something to the effect that if you have an idol look a little closer and you will see that you are selling yourself short. The author, Mr. Fair, looks a little closer, but not unfairly, in my opinion. Growing up with Strength and Health I was not aware of many of Mr. Hoffman's shortcomings. And now that I know them, nothing has changed. For Hoffman is still number one in my book. In my view the character flaws only serve to humanize him. Something wrong with that? How many of you who've submitted critical reviews regarding Hoffman have lived steller lives? How many of you have built sucessful businesses from the ground up? And most importantly, How many of you have MADE A DIFFERENCE in the lives of so many? The silence is deafening. Regarding the book, I find it well written. Also of great interest to me are the photos of the luminaries of that era. I am thankful that this book was written, and I am pleased to have read it. Mr. Fair, how about bios on some of the high profile people of the \\"weight game\\", Grimek, Reeves, etc?"},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"Once, when I was working out in the weight room at UCLA in the early 70's, someone called out, &quot;The weight room is Mother!&quot; And so it was, for those of us for whom working out had become a way of life. And if the weight room was &quot;Mother&quot;, then Father was Bob Hoffman, who more than anyone else in my generation, popularized weight training for both athletes and the general public. Having been a disciple of Hoffman through his magazine, I had been thinking that a bio of him needed to be written (about 14 years after his death) when coincidentally Fair produced just such a book. The extent of Dr. Fair's research is impressive, especially about the era from the sixties onward, and his story of the degeneration of the US Olympic weightlifting team due to steroids and recreational drugs is particluarly compelling. Additionally, his debunking of the myth of Hoffman as a person was an eye-opener for me. The story of the Hoffman-Weieder wars is also interesting.With regard to Hoffman however, the balance of the book may be a little off. While the details of Hoffman's sexual activity and his promotional quackery are interesting, I was disapponted not to see more about how Hoffman was as a coach. I have been told by a member of the York team that Hoffman was very good as a coach, but this did not come through for me in the book. Fair attributes the greatness of the post-war team to the socialization at York and the fact that the weightlifters were from immigrant families. He should have gotten more material from the lifters of that era and stuck more to history and biography; his psychologically-based simplifications detract from the book because he puts too much credence in them. All in all, it's a good book; it's not the last word on Hoffman, however."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"This book by John Fair makes a good account on how the sport of weightlifting got going in the 40's, where it was. It accounts many of the characters involved in the sport, although not all of them. It does reveal some nasty things about Bob Hoffman that his fans didn't know or didn't want to admit.I think that some of the recent reviews have been inspired by articles written by Bill Starr in Iron Man. Starr was a former associate editor of Strength & Health as well as a competitive weightlifter and powerlifter. He has been revealing a lot about where York Barbell was back in the 60's.Likewise, Bob Kennedy's magazine MuscleMag International has a feature on Dan Lurie in their new issue. Lurie also makes some revealing statements about how Hoffman \\"handpicked\\" winners in the early AAU contests and those \\"handpicked\\" winners were members of York BBC like Jules Bacon, Frank Leight and Steve Stanko. Lurie then goes on to say that he was banned from the AAU after winning the most muscular man award in both the AAU Jr. Mr. America and AAU Mr. Contests as well as being a runnerup in the AAU Mr. America contests three years in row.I am curious as to why this information was not in Mr. Fairs book!One of the reviewers in support of Hoffman said he was strong and indicated that he saw one of Hoffmans stregth exhibitions where he lifted 200 lbs. with one hand. Perhaps this fan missed the part that Hoffman used to use aluminium weights! Had this fan gone on stage he would have found that he too could have lifted this supposedly 200 + lbs. of weight. So could his mother!This book by Fair is revealing, but not totally revealing. A lot is left out. In all fairness to Hoffman, despite his intentions, he did get the Iron Game started and even inspired Joe Weider with his Strength & Health magazine. Now there is something that Fair missed and so did the Hoffman supporters and even his bashers. If it hadn't been for Bob Hoffman, perhaps there never would have been a Joe Weider! Think about that you Tiger Tough Weider boys who follow those Super Bomb&Blitz; programs. Beef up with Crash Weight Formula 7, then supplement with Super Pro 101 and get cut up with Crash Cut RX7 and raise your energy with Enertol, yeah a ripoff of Hoffmans Energol!Joe Weider was inspired by Hoffmans magazine.Those early contests were great though and offered great variety with hand balancing, juggling, muscle control, acrobatics plus posing along with the weightlifting events. In a way I miss that. And Hoffman through his magazine Strength & Health and control of the AAU did do a lot to start weightlifting and bodybuilding. Some of Hoffmans actions were not popular, nor were Weiders in the 1970's when the IFBB became the \\"governing body\\" for bodybuilding and Weider started issuing suspensions to bodybuilders for competing in non sanctioned events, something that Weider repeatedly attacked Hoffman for anytime a bodybuilder was suspended from the AAU for one reason or another.There is a saying; don't bite the hand that feeds you or in this case that feed you. Hoffman, York Barbell and the AAU did a lot to pioneer the sport and deserve credit for that. If it wasn't for this early pioneering work, the iron game may be be around at all today.Think about that you muscle pumpers!"},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"Thoroughly exhaustive research and a placing into context of the iron game in this most useful of historic tomes dedicated to the history of physical culture. This is an invaluable 20th century artefact that describes the development of physical culture and the huge influnce on it of Bob Hoffman and York Barbell. An essential record of a one of the last centuries enduring sporting trends. Incredible if not for the fact that it completely undermines the Weider view of the world of 20th century body building/physical culture."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I have to admit that I was not aware of Hoffmans health problems untill I read this book, although on seeing him in person at shows in York in the 1960's and early 1970's it was very obvious that his physical and mental faculties were declining fast.I also wasn't aware of his problems with Charles Atlas. And while I am not a fan of the Atlas \\"Dynamic Tension\\" program, it certaintly couldn't have been any worse for muscular development than the York Simplified Barbell and Dumbell courses or Hoffmans Daily dozen.Hoffmans war with Weider, on the other hand, was well known and obvious. Most of us felt that Weider was just a con man and self promoter. Weider was, in fact, bodybuildings number 1 fan and promoter.The contests promoted by Hoffman were always in the worst venues and under the worst conditions. No air conditioning on a hot summer weekend, uncomfortable seating and disorganization. Some of the bodybuilding shows were held in gymnasiums with a flood light clamped onto a basketball net and the audience sat in the bleachers.The olympic weightlifters didn't fare much better having to compete in auditoriums or gyms in national competitions in 85 to 90 degree temperatures with competitions running all day and untill 2am.The Bodybuilders would get the worse end of the deal. The Mr. America contest would be held in a high school auditorium and contestants would stand on a band leaders pedestal and frequently, the best developed men would lose. In some cases, it would after midnite before the contest (which were always held after weightlfting contests) would start. Smaller contests were held in YMCA gyms or community centers.Of course the biggest losers were the fans who to pay for this nonsense and the sport, which failed to attract any real audience.In the 50's and 60's, bodybuilding lost a lot of good champions who quit in disgust. Some went overseas to compete in and win the NABBA Mr. Universe like Earl Clark, Mickey Hargitay, Enrico Thomas and Elmo Santiago while others just left the sport.Black bodybuilders like George Paine, Arthur Harris, Leroy Colbert. Leon Burke, Bob Walker and Harold Poole and non olympic weightlifter types like Bud Counts, Lynn Lyman, Jerry Ross and Lou Degni would frequently lose to lesser developed olympic lifters with a partial interest in bodybuilding.In the late 50's, American bodybuilders had an alternative with the IFBB and the Weider/Hoffman battles really heated up.Hoffman made a big deal about Chuck Sipes winning the IFBB Mr. America after placing 18th in the AAU Mr. America. The following year, Sipes would defeat Ray Schaeffer, a AAU Mr. America and Amateur NABBA Mr. Universe for the Pro Mr. Universe title.Weider would also sponsor bodybuilders like Clancy Ross, Jack Delinger (who beat Bill Pearl sponsored by York) Doug Strohl and Reg Lewis and others to the NABBA Mr. Universe in London competing directly with Hoffman and giving the great champions of the day, slighted by York Barbell an opportunity to go for the Gold.Hoffman would sponsor the current AAU Mr. America to the NABBA Mr. Universe.Hoffman was also a self promoter of sorts. In the 60's, Hoffman was trying to promote a new \\"secret\\" strength and muscle building system using a power rack doing isometrics and isometronics (partial limited range movements in the power rack) offered by York and endorsed by top AAU National Weightlifters and AAU Mr. America winners. In reality, their secret was anabolic steriods and the York people were among the first, if not the first to use steriods.The power rack \\"secret\\" system went the way of the hoola hoop once the truth came out.The last AAU show I attended was the 1971 AAU Mr. America. What a thrill it was to see Sergio Oliva, Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Ken Waller in the audience. How disgusting it was to see world class bodybuilders like Ed Corney and Mike Mentzer finish 4th and 10th respectively when both should have been in the top four at least and then losing to York man/Olympic lifter Bill St. John was a joke. The organization was typical York chaos and on a hot June night, the fans and contestants sweltered in 80-degree+ temperatures because the promoters told the school maintenance staff not to turn on the air conditioners.Corney and Mentzer never competed in the AAU again after that.I also recall Hoffmans energy bars having more sugar than nutrition and the Hi Proteen powder had a lot less protein than we thought and was hard to digest. Ditto for the Protein of the Sea, Energol, powdered Lecithin and Papaya Juice that Hoffman peddled.Strength & Health was mainly an olympic lifting news magazine and a catalog for Hoffman products with bodybuilding, fitness and health as a side interest.Hoffman did help some olympic weightlifters like Bob Bednarski, giving both an apartment and a salary (I thought these guys were supposed to be amateurs???) and then tossed him aside after he passed his peak. The best thing that I can say is that I enjoyed the articles in Hoffmans magazines by John McCollum, Bill Starr and Ernie Picket. Muscular Developent was at least initially, a good, quality magazine under York rule that deteriated badly in later years. Some of those AAU contests had some great champions: Olympic lifers-Tony Garcy, Phil Gripaldi, Bill MARCH and Bob Bednarski. Bodybuilders-Harold Poole, Hugo Labra, Don Howorth, Joe Nistam Jr., Frank Zane, Chet Yorton, John Corvello, Eric Pederson, Bob Hinds, Zabo Kosiewski, Jim Haislop, Boyer Coe, Chris Dickerson, Casey Viator, Ken Waller, Ed Corney and Mike Mentzer.Strength & Health and Muscular Development were both catalogs and commercials for York products primarily with some useful information as an afterthought.This book covers a lot about Hoffman, but it misses a lot as well and is not the final word on Hoffman and York Barbell. Bob Hoffman was no saint."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"Finally we know the truth about Bob Hoffman. That he didn't work out. Didn't eat right and was nowhere near as healthy (actually pretty unhealthy) as he pretended to be.We also discover that Hoffman was not as well liked even among the weightlifters as we had thought.In fact, the whole thing was probably just used by Hoffman as a tax writeoff to offset his successful oil burner business. And in the end, Hoffman did writeoff a lot of the people that he used in his magazines to promote his ridiculously over rated products.Yeah, John D. Fair is correct, Hoffman did it for his ego alone."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"This book has much information in it about York Barbell and Hoffman, its founder. The author has done much reading in the source materials. He was given access by Alda Ketterman(Hoffman's widow) and John Terpak, his associate, to additional Hoffman writings and Terpak's records. I reckon at the Stark centre in Austin, which contains the Ottley Coulter collection(as well as much more), collected by Jan and Terry Todd(both former world champion powerlifters in their respective heavyweight classes) as well as the work of many others he got help too. The book may be augmented by the author, John Fair's writings for Iron Game History, put out by the above mentioned centre. He also interviewed many of the individuals that he writes about. Some of them may demur from his interpretations of what they meant, but he did interview the available principals at York and those who formerly were at York in the course of his research into the \\"Iron Game\\".Fair reports on Hoffman's time and performance as a soldier in France in WWI, in which he was highly decorated by France, as well as telling us about Hoffman's youth.This is a notable contribution to our understanding of the 20th century Iron Game, weight lifting, powerlifting and bodybuilding, as particularly regards York Barbell and its founder, Bob Hoffman, and the principals with him, giving us a few views of Mark Berry, John Grimek, Terlazzo, Terpak, Harry Paschall, Tommy Kono, and many others. George Jowett is mentioned a few times, Alan Calvert, Mark Berry and Jowett should be covered more. Did Hoffman, in learning from Jowett, also absorb Jowett's fondness for claiming fine accomplishments for himself?Speaking of those who were before Hoffman, the second chapter, about the earlier history of physical culture and weight resistance exercise, is one that I would like to have seen much more developed. I understand that it was larger, but the book was much edited down by order of the publisher. We should see more about Alan Calvert, the originator of Milo Barbell, which Hoffman purchased, and Jowett's part and Berry, too. Calvert started Strength magazine. He should have a title that goes something like the grandfather of weight training in America. Fair does note that Jowett had a lot to do with wanting and starting a national body that regulated the sport(ACWLA, or American Weight Lifters ASsociation, which provided reliable judging and authentication of lifting records as well as regulating competitions. This is more gone into in the Iron Game History at Austin TX.Fair spends a good deal of time talking about Hoffman and his ego. Fair does acknowledge on many pages the contribution that Hoffman made in promoting Olympic lifting and a life of fitness and strength, through weight lifting and training, as embodied in the magazine Strength and Health and its articles. Hoffman extolled the virtues of weights and nutrition, (especially York/Hoffman products such as Energol, Hi Proteen, and Super Hi Proteen, and vitamins) for health, for all of life, for all sports, and for country. This was an important thing he pressed for, and should be credited with, is the value of weight training and strengthening for all sports.I found Fair's critique of so much that Hoffman did as being self serving to be somewhat tiring, as most every charitable gift, of which there were many, property, money, help in education seemed, in Fair's analysis, to have a Hoffman glorifying motive. That may be so, but 'there is more to the man' as one York employee said, and one of the best points Fair makes is that wealth did not seem to matter greatly to Hoffman, except in that it enabled him to do things, to further American weightlifting(esp. Olympic lifting) and his York team. Hoffman paid for the employment(not real well paid), training, and transportation of lifters to world meets, travelling being paid for by Hoffman for the American team. He quotes one lifter who said \\"I could not compete if it were not for Hoffman's help.\\" And as another, who became an editor at S&H; said \\"Overall, he did more good than harm.\\" Speaking of what hypocrisy he saw in Hoffman's conduct. So this was probably a 'fair' assessment, so to speak, as well as the many other less complimentary things that are included. Bill Starr has given a number of inputs about York and Hoffman, not complimentary.One interesting part of the story had to do with the under the table selling of weights by employees, like Starr, who admits it. He said that he learned from Hoffman how to profit. Starr had taken orders, which were paid for, but he pocketed the money and entered it in the books as paid. He said that he learned to do these things from Hoffman's example, and that Hoffman did not mind if someone found a way to supplement their income. I had to chuckle. Still illegal, but an interesting portion of human life. Thanks for sharing that, Mr. Fair.Fair speaks of the comraderie that the Olympic lifting team had, especially when Hoffman was lifting with them, and the community and fellowship that was had at York in the gym. The reviewer Bobby K. has a good point, that the book says not much about Hoffman as a coach. I think Bobby must have meant an individual's experience of Hoffman as a coach. Fair has been a lifting competitive athlete, and has done coaching. This probably shows in his critique of Hoffman via Starr and others, who said that when the team won it was Bob, but when we lost it was the team's fault, and that you got left behind if you did not produce. Hoffman did promote, fund and encourage winning American teams. It is a good question Bobby has asked, what was the individual experience that people had of Hoffman as a coach, who called himself the father of weightlifting?The book goes through the decades, up to Hoffman's death and afterward, attempting a comprehensive look at York, and said before, gives up much information, including sales totals for years and months.I thought there could have been more personal anecdotes, it would have made more interesting reading. There are, however, a number of anecdotes, such as Harry Paschall's lines on Joe Weider's appearance at the 1951 Mr. Universe contest, and a foot race that Paul Anderson and Tommy Kono had up the stairways at York.There are portions on the Hoffman Weider feud. For myself, I looked at magazines from both, and as one young man, I got encouragement and instruction from the Hoffman magazines, many articles oriented toward beginners and intermediates, and I found little of that in the weider mags, I remember about one article for beginners. Also, while some of the Olympic athletes were given steroids at York, under Ziegler, a good note Fair includes quotes Ziegler's strong concern after he left about the danger of overconsumption of steroids. He would prescribe the basic 1 pill dose of Dianabol, but the lifters, including Starr and others, would take 3 or 4, 'taking them like candy'. This Ziegler believed was unhealthy and dangerous. Fair quotes the older generation's concern(Grimek for one) with the drug using mentality of America. Weider's mags had articles that were certainly quite accepting of the use of drugs for enhancing performance or development(Why not? as one weider article said). American life and sport is not better off with this. Who showed most concern for America's athletes? I am glad that York's magazines encouraged a healthy lifestyle without drugs, as did Peary Rader's Iron Man. Hoffman did have concern for people's health, even if he did burn the candle at both ends, and Grimek, the editor, who by the way often ghost wrote for Hoffman, taking some of Hoffman's many lines and editing them, certainly was a great advocate for strength and health in America and abroad.For me, growing up and reading Strength and Health and Muscular Development, both from York, I absorbed an ethos of the value of strength and health in life and its development, esp. with weights, but also bodyweight exercise and cardiovascular exercise and sports, of how one would do much better to train naturally without any drugs, for a lifetime of health, and many other health guidelines, such as rest, a peaceful mind, nutrition, and avoiding dissipations, meaning much alcohol or drugs, or wild illicit sex. Now Hoffman had been a hypocrite in terms of that last matter, and inasmuch as that his team lifters were allowed to take the pink pills, there were two messages going on, one for the public, thankfully, and another for those lifters who came to be encouraged to try out the pills.Another way that Fair credits Hoffman was that he was for America, the melting pot. He was not biased against people based upon their skin colour or ethnic background. Was he biased against John Davis or John Terry? True, for guys like Harold Poole or Sergio Oliva, they did not seem to get a fair shake, and Oliva was an Olympic lifter. But neither did white men who were more bodybuilders, esp. if they had connexion with the santa monica operation. I think it is more that if you were in his operation, Hoffman was for you regardless of your skin colour, but if you seemed to be with his adversary, then he was not for you.Regarding York Barbell and its future, things have developed since the last reprint of the book. Ownership went overseas, and has now returned again to North America, Canada being the home of the current owner. Fair expresses savvy in that nutritional supplements were (and remain) a large source of profit, more than just equipment.And so I am glad that other books have come out which have more portrayed the York type of spirit in life, namely Brooks Kubik's books in the \\"Legacy of Iron\\" series, I especially like the first one. Jan Dellinger's book \\"The Dellinger Files\\" is also to be recommended. I rather prefer these books, but Fair's book goes into a great deal of detail, and so it certainly has its real place in giving us a picture of York Barbell and Bob Hoffman. He has compiled much information, and offered a view."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I am familiar with much of the content of the book having been part of the newest &quot;York Gang&quot; and knowing most of the newer characters. Although it is great to have a history of our sport, the author continually qualifies any positive aspects of Bob Hoffman with &quot;He did it for his ego alone.&quot; There are enough inaccuracies that I am sure of that I have to question the accuracy of the entire text. One of the characters cited as an accurate historical reference is known to be an exaggerator of far greater proportions then Bob Hoffman ever was. Lastly one of the much much quoted references was run out of York for theft."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"Whether you agree or disagree with the \\"tone\\" taken towards Bob Hoffman in this book - whether he was a devil or a saint (though the truth is, no doubt, somewhere in between) - you'll have to agree that a lot of time, work and research went into writing this book. Dr. Fair interviewed a lot of history's most prominent figures in the Iron Game in compiling the material here.Everyone with personal experience will have their own opinion of Bob Hoffman as a man. I don't really think that's the point here. The point is that Fair did a monumental task in putting this book together. There's a lot of interesting and little-known history contained it. I don't think anyone interested in the history of the Iron Game should be without it."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"As an olympic style lifter and subscriber to Strength and Health during the 60's, I was not aware of the real story behind the York Barbell Club. John Fair has thoroughly researched the Hoffman era and exposed the good and bad side of many of the personalities. For anyone who was active in weightlifting during this period, there are numerous familiar names and anecdotes. Some of the reviewers of this book have gone on a tirade about Bob Hoffman and seem to be assigning a rating based on their hatred for him, not on the quality of the book. Please rate the quality of the book, not the subject of the book."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I just finished reading John D. Fair's recently released Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell. If you want to know everything about the old York Barbell phenomenon and the iron game in general get this book It's so good. You may feel like you've been dragged through a repository for used razor blades but at the end your perceptions will be striped of all those idealistic notions you may once have had about what motivates people. And, lest you give up all hope, there are real heroes who come shining through. Fair interviewed all the right people and lays out the Hoffman phenomenon beginning with his great grandfather and ending with his death. From it, you can draw a number of conclusions but probably not that Bob was a healthy man (infected gastric intestinal system, vascular circulation problems), not a strongman (used aluminum weights for his exhibitions), and not a model of post Victorian moral virtue (considered a sexual pariah by York society).Fair depicts Bob as a man who is singularly focused, surrounding himself with mostly good people but concocting a fictional self-image that he himself came to believe. Believing that he was the world's healthiest man simply by repeatedly saying it, he worked incessantly with very little sleep, though he taught the importance of sufficient rest. Although promoting the benefits of exercise was his life's mission, he exercised little. And, despite his strong interest in nutrition, his diet was poor. There's the ironic incident where Bob's doctor lectures him on his need to exercise more. It's a story full of paradox. As one begins to doubt all of Bob's claims about himself, it turns out that he really was a decorated World War I soldier. Fair makes a case that Bob was sloppy in running his business, yet he was capable of making lots of money and during the depression, when many companies were failing, his York Oil Burner prospered. Though promotion of himself may have been his primary objective, he had linked his ego so tightly to weightlifting that it was impossible for him to promote the one without the other. The result was a financial and promotional boon for the sport. The revelation that encapsulates the book's theme for me is that Hoffman's Hi-Proteen wasn't quite as high in protein as we thought."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I was a disciple of Bob Hoffman and the York Barbell Company, although I came to question Bob Hoffman's true fitness aspirations. That said, I was not a fan of Joe Weider and his orgnization. A couple brief experiences with both.My faith in Hoffman and what he really did as opposed to what he said he did happened at an AAU Track Meet in St. Louis. During that meet as a side note I was able to see Bob Hayes run. Also, at the meet was Gary Gubner who I think Bob was coaching or at least had an interest. I got his autograph and didn't think much about it. Later in the day, I was hungry and was going to one of the local stands to get a hamburger or hot dog. I saw Bob and followed him and lo and behold he got a couple dogs and a coke. Now, that would not generally mean anything except he had written that he hadn't had any sugar products or junk food like hot dogs for many years. Busted that bubble.I also at the time watched the war of words between Wieder and Hoffman. Now I had bought York products and thought they were good value. I decided for a change to buy a adjustable weight stand from Weider. As was usual at the time, Weider advertised this was great looking stand and had pictures that to say the least was deceptive., They also advertised that you would receive hundreds of dollars in courses. When I got the stands, it was obviously cheaply made and in addition there were no courses. I wrote the company and never even got a reply. So cons, probably both of them (Weider and Hoffman) IMO."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"An excellent source for anyone interested in learning about the history of weightlifting or bodybuilding (or manliness) in the United States. I grew up in York, PA, but I never really understood the extent of York Barbell's influence on weightlifting until I read this book. It reads like a biography of Bob Hoffman, and probably could have been trimmed down a bit, but you can't really fault the author for giving you *more* detail than you really need.I did find the \\"Bob was always trying to prove his manhood\\" theme a bit heavy handed, because many of the behaviors attributed to Bob's \\"need to prove his manhood\\" would be explained differently if the subject were just another competitive businessman of the time, instead of a muscle culture entrepreneur. I love the title, because York's culture was undoubtedly about proving and appreciating manliness, but I just felt like the theme was re-stated too often and unnecessarily, and that gave the book a distasteful hint of gender studies pop-psych. Sometimes men are actively and consciously trying to prove their manhood, and sometimes men are just men competing and doing things.All in all I thought the author's treatment of the subject was appreciative, but even handed, fair and thorough. It gives a real sense of the times and the impact that Hoffman and York ultimately had in shaping American manhood."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I just ordered this Book and can't wait to read what has been written about a true ledgend, Bob Hoffman. I have not even looked at this book yet but by all the negative garbage I have read by other reviewers I must exhort! I first met Bob in the 1960s while sitting at the HI-Proteen milkshake bar at the Old Gym that used to house the old \\"Weightlifting Hall of Fame\\" that was before they built the new one off Rt 83 in York. I lived in Baltimore so it wasn't really that far to take a day trip to York. Anytime I heard that guys from my neighborhood were planning a trip I always made sure that I claimed a seat in the car!As I was saying when I first me Bob he walked through the door and stopped to talk to me and a couple of my friends who were enjoying protien shakes, his first words were,\\"Hi Boys, are you up here looking for some muscle\\" and the gave us a very friendly and fatherly grin. We all took turns shaking his hand and felt like we were in the presence of living royality.Meeting Hoffman that day was more important to me than if I had met Brooks Robinson, Johnny Unites and Tom Mattee all in the same day. You see I was on my way to making the sport of weightlifting and bodybuilding a life long way of life and after reading \\"Strength and Health\\" and only getting to know Bob through his publications at last I met the myth and was not at all disapointed!While in my teens I lifted with several different groups and the main one back then was the old \\"Mayfield Barbell Club\\" on Chesterfield Ave. in Baltimore that had several impressive members and some very good DEL-Mar-Va competitors. Sure I read what some others wrote about AAU contest conditions and the way they were being held and most of it is true, but guess what- I would not want to trade anything for those great memories. Back then we all loved it (and I still love just thinking about it).Some of the most memorible memories were at places like the YMCA in Baltimore City that used to hold many of the AAU Weightlifting events. What was cool in those days was that many of the guys competed in both the weightlifting and physic contest. Back then there we never no complaints as this was all we knew and remember this was the early days of lifting, back then lifting was only in with the out croud like myself. I would not trade them days for a million bucks! At least we all knew that Hoffman, York Barbell and the AAU were trying to set the pace for this up and coming sport. Young people now days don't have a clue as what it took men like Bob Hoffman, Perry Radar of \\"Iron Man\\" fame and others to get this sport in the lime light. As for Joe Weider I really don't want to get on that subject, from the very start his copy-cat tactics could be seen for what they really were by real lifters. Just let me make one quick example, Bob Hoffman's famous tri-oil \\"Energol\\" was a combination of wheat germ,soybean and rice bran oil and the stuff was great for giving you energy, we would buy it by the gallon cans at York (My father starting using it befor me and never went to work without taking it he swore by it and always said that it helped him to have great strength throughout his day of hard physical work). My point is that Hoffman invented this liquid gold but as everything else Weider had to take the Hoffman \\"Energol\\" and start selling his own with the same ingredents as \\"Energol\\" and call it \\"Enertol\\"! This is why Weider was always booed by so many hard core lifters in the early days . Talk about someone just looking for dollar signs!After serving several years in the US Meachent Marines (I went in as a teen)I was 21 years of age and wanted to have my own place to do some serious lifting. I rented a place in East Baltimore one block off of S. Broadway at 422 S.Ann Street and called it \\"The Original Broadway Barbell Club\\". I had a sign painted and put on the door with the same image that Hoffman had on the old York Tee shirts - a guy holding the weight overhead of a split \\"Clean & Jerk\\". Before I knew it others heard and wanted to start lifting too. There was never a charge the only thing was that you had to be serious about lifting, there was no room for sitters or talkers. There was no air conditioning only a floor fan and in the summer it would be so hot that the floor would have about an inch of sweat on it - but we loved it and I had some of my best work-outs in that place (my wife used to laugh at how you had to step over rows of benches and barbells just to get to the bathroom).About that time I also started teaching weightlifting at the \\"Red Shield Boys Club\\" on Clinton St. in Highlandtown (SE Baltimore City). I said all that to say this - everything I taught and followed was from the teachings of Mr.Hoffman. When teaching youths the fundamentals of lifting I followed the famous \\"Hoffman Formula\\" that helped to make many folks into world champs (only real lifters will remember the Hoffman Formula as most will not even know what I'm talking about,and that's fine)as I said back then lifting was really in with the out croud.Also I always encouraged other to indulge in Hoffmans protien products as it was always a staple with me and I will swear to the gains that others as well as myself made while taking down products like Hi Proteen powder & tablets (There was one gram of protein in every tablet),Crash gain weight Hi Pro candy bars, Hoffmans Breakfast Food, Energol,Involton (Iron Supplement,pardon my spelling)Livertol and one of my favorites \\"Proteen from the Sea\\"(I always believed that this was what helped me start pushing over 300lbs on the bench!).In 1983 during one of my visits to York I was lucky enough to see Bob Hoffman again. By this time he was in his early 80's but was very glad to stop and talk with me for a while. He was still big and vibrant and told me that the Doctor said that he had the heart of a 21 year old man. While we talked I let him know what an inspiration he had been to me throughout most of my life and thanked him for what him and all the other boys at York did for our much loved sport, he shook my hand and said just ,\\"Thank you\\". I read of Bob's passing not long after that and it affected me the same way as when we got the news in the early 60's that Kennedy had been shot(In fact hearing of Bob's death was much,much worse).Steve Stanko died in '71, Bob in '85, Paul Anderson in '94 and more recently the Great John C. Grimick (the only bodybuilder never to be defeated, yea I like what other wrote that Hoffman set all that up...right)If any of these armchair cridits ever saw JCG they would know that he was cut from a different mold then most and deserved every title he won. When folks talk of Hoffman only letting his people win the AAU events keep in mind that it was Bob Hoffman along with other members who made the ruling that a Mr.America contestant could only win the title once in his life (due to the fact that after Grimick won in 1940 & 1941 Hoffman knew that he would not be beat in many years to come and he wanted to give others a chance, this sounds pretty fair to me unless your name is John Grimick the editor of Hoffman's \\"Strenght & Health\\" magazine. If this is cheating by awarding your own people I pray that we should all be called the same!And whoever said that Hoffman wasn't a lifter,I beg to differ. How many of even the big juiced up boys could do a one armed bent press with 264 lbs...not many I gauntee you...but Hoffman could! The first photo that I ever saw of Bob was on the back of his HI Proteen can, you know the famous shot of him standing there holding out his chest. When I was a kid we used to say that the picture made him look like he was in an accident or something because his chest was so huge. That photo was taken back in the early 40's when things like a 54 inch chest was unheard of...but Hoffman had worked his way up to that size (He didn't get it from drinking cokeacola either)While at work back in 1988 I met an old lifter from the 1950's named Buzz Jones. This guy was an outstanding lifter and attended the York picnics back in the 50's. He had pictures from so many affairs back then that it was unreal! He told me a story of Hoffman that I will never foget (He also praised the ground Hoffman walked on). As the story goes a big meet was to be going on in York and many of the top champs of the 50's would be competing. Buzz said that neither him nor his friends had the money to get in. Hoffman walked up to them and asked if they were going to the show that night. When they said \\"No\\" Hoffman asked,\\"Why not\\" and they let him know that they were short of funds at that Hoffman said,\\"I can't let you boys miss a good meet like this because of lack of money\\" at that Hoffman reached into his pocket pulled out his wallet and gave them the money to buy the tickets along with some money for refreshments afterwards, that was how Bob was.It's not good to write negative things about anyone unless you really know what you are talking about. Hoffman was human and not perfect as no one is except our Lord, but I know more good that has come from this man and real life long encouragement for so many then hundreds of other men. I'm over 50 years old now and have been around the Horn a few times and have met all kinds of folks,and believe me Bob Hoffman will always be at the top of my list of Great Americans. Through the York BarBell Club I was taught a life long lesson of clean and healthy living that I still practice today...Thank you Bob!Enjoy! Joe Kopeck/Broadway Barbell Club"},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I enjoyed this book and feel that it deals honestly with bodybuilding in that time. The book is extremely well written and documented. It is not a white wash job by any sense of the term. Bob Hoffman was a risk taking promoter who stretched the truth in many instances to promote a cause that he believed in. Like most people who bring about change he was highly concentrated in one area and had many character faults in other parts of his personality. He was competing against Charles Atlas who got his build with weights,but continued to deny it to promote his mail order course and Joe Weider who was more interested in bodybuilding than weightlifting. In the end Hoffman almost singlehandedly opened the benefits of weight training to athletes throughout the world and should be given credit for that. Must reading for anyone interested in the history of the sport."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I must confess, I haven't read Dr. John Fair's book yet ... but I have met John, and we discussed his lifelong passion for weightlifting and Muscletown USA. Years ago, my weightlifting friends and I were avid disciples of Bob Hoffman -- and his two magazines, Strength &amp; Health and Muscular Development -- back in the late '60s and early '70s. One of the highlights OF MY LIFE was when my best friend visited me when I was in the Navy in Philadelphia in 1971. Our wives and we drove to York, Pa, and spent a day with Mr. Hoffman (met Dave Bednarski sp??, and other Olympic lifters!) and sat with Mr. Hoffman in his museum as he talked about his life (his favorite subject!). I cannot wait to read Fair's book and I already highly recommend it to those of you (you know who you are) who cannot imagine barbell Olympic weights with anything but &quot;YORK&quot; on them!"},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"A good book, and it seems solid in its accuracy.I can say that, being a bodybuilder for 25 years and a youth in the 70's when I would buy Strength and Health Magazine, that it was crystal clear that Hoffman had no care for bodybuilding. I was not smitten with his bodybuilding 'writings', and can say that his supplements were garbage which we could barely ingest without vomitting.It is true that one had to demonstarte athletic prowess along with bodybuilding development to even compete in Hoffman's shows, and then you were posing at about 2 a.m., after the weightlifting events had been completed. Hoffman did much to hold bodybuilding back, and he is only thought of in reverence by those who perhaps live in York."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I am continually amazed by the reviews that show up here praising Bob Hoffman, obviously by people who never really knew him.The fact is that Bob Hoffman did more damage than good for the entire Iron Game, even his pet sport of Olympic Style Weightlifting.And Hoffman via Dr. Zeigler was instrumental in popularizing anabolic steriods (see article by Bill Starr, a former York employee in the current issue of Iron Man)Hoffmans presence at AAU sanctioned bodybuilding events gave the sport a black eye by the mainstream media. The 1956 AAU Mr. Universe held in Virginia Beach, VA was a perfect example. Hoffmans actions at an event that could and should have done a lot of good for the sport had the opposite effect. Sports writers in the mainstream media critized the event and bodyuilding as a whole. Hoffmans retort was classic; \\"I think bodybuilding is sissified and I am trying to get it shut down.\\" Great PR for our sport eh?Hoffman was notorius for handpicking winners in AAU contests. Hoffman was the AAU and acted liked a mafia king. In the Virginia Beach contest, Hoffmans protege was in fourth place so Hoffman changed the judges making himself and Paul Anderson judges. This enabled Hoffmans protege to move from fourth to first. Hoffman and Anderson even had the audicity to put Olympic Weightlifter Chuck Vinci ahead of Ray Schaeffer, the then current AAU Mr. America who would go on to win the prestigious NABBA Mr. Univers a week later against better competition but with better judging. Schaeffer would end up in second place in the AAU Virginia Beach event thanks to Hoffman.A similiar atrocity happened 9 years earlier when the AAU arranged for Steve Stanko, a York employee to win the AAU Mr. Universe over better competitors like Eric Pederson and George Eiferman. Stanko had won the AAU Mr. America a few years earlier in a similiar fashion. To his credit, Stanko was the first man to total 1,000 lbs in Olympic Weightlifting. Catch the connection?Hoffman took on anyone who dared enter the muscle game and for any reason. His battles with Joe Weider, Dan Lurie, Rheo H. Blair and even Charles Atlas were classic. Hoffman wanted a monopoly. And Hoffman was quick to copy ev en after he criticized. For example, Weider came out with the highly successful Crash Weight Formula XR7. Hoffman debunked it without basis in issue after issue of his rag magazine for years and then finally came out with his own version. Guess what he called it? Crash Weight Gain. First attack then join. Of course Hoffmans product was more sugar than protein and didn't work as well as Weiders.In the early 1960's Hoffman via Dr. Zeigler introduced Anabolic Steriods to the York weightlifters. They made fantastic gains but Hoffman tried to give the credit to special Power Rack Training, a new piece of equipment that Hoffman introduced at that time. People like Bill March, Luis Riecke, Tony Garcy, Bob Bednarksi and more made fantastic gains. We now know the epidemic that has been caused with steriods thanks to Hoffman. (See current issue of Iron Man)The people writing positive things about Hoffman are undoubtably Hoffmans relatives or people who mindlessly bought into all the bull that Hoffman perpetrated for nearly 40 years. Or perhaps they got a FREE HI PERTEEN (The way Hoffman pronounced Hi Protein) shake.I met Hoffman back at one of the York Picnics and at the AAU Sr. Nationals and AAU Mr. America Contests that were held in York. I met him before he went senile. He seemed somewhat amiable but with an attitude and it was obvious that he did all this for his own merit. He had some interest in Olympic Weightlifting.Terpak was a complete jerk. John Grimek on the other hand was delightful to talk to and obviously genuinely cared about the Iron Game and it's followers. He was a great champion who was unfortunately used and abused by York and Hoffman.Fortunately, in the 1980's the York Empire fell apart. Strength & Health, Hofmans flagship rag folded in 1982. Muscular Development would have followed soon after but was bought. Powerlifting and Olympic Wightlifting formed new federations that really cared about the sport and had real athletes in control. Likewise, the IFBB severed it's ties with the AAU after only about 3 years replacing them with the better NPC and actually had bodybuilders running the sport, and disgarding the AAU like yesterdays garbage. AAU bodybuilding shows would then eventually go the way of carnival barkers.Hoffman did more damage than good for the Iron Game and for the few people who still think Hoffman was a saint and that York BBC was so powerful or that the AAU was the \\"legitimate\\" organization, I ask you, where is York BBC today? And where is the AAU today?Bob Hoffman, York BBC, AAU, good bye and good riddance! The sport is better off without you!"},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"I was hoping to read the history of Bob Hoffman and specifically the chronology of York Bar Bell, but it seems this is an expose of the semi-true claims of Hoffman's empire and his personal accomplishments along with some stories about some of the York boys who were real strongmen. Most of us who were growing up in the 60's and 70's remember hoisting the York 25 pound plates (perhaps adding some 10's later) on the famous York E-Z Curl bar, envisioning OUR biceps as grand as Larry Scott, Dave Draper, etc. I wanted less of the rather dry history of Hoffman and more of what his company did for us bodybuilders. Admittedly, I have only read the first few chapters, but while doing so (if I really cared) I would have had to get out the dictionary twenty times to find out what the author was describing. His writing style, in my opinion, would be better suited to the science of animal dissection rather than human interaction and documentation. The reviews I read led me to think there might be some awesome photos of the York gyms and perhaps even a history of the plate making process and their revisions. The photos that are included are poor quality. If I had paid full price (I purchased my copy used), I would have been greatly disappointed.

Strength &amp; Health (a ripoff from Health &amp; Strength published in England) stopped publishing many years ago. Muscular Development was bought by Twin Lab and now looks like a bodybuilding magazine. While Bob Hoffman with his York Barbell Company did much to start the weightlifting movement in 40's, what frequently is not said is how much damage the York group ala Hoffman did to hold back the Iron Game, bodybuilding in particular.Bob Hoffmans sole interest (aside from making money) was Olympic Weightlifting. Bodybuilding contests were used to draw audiences and defray from the costs of promoting weightlifting contests which were always held in conjunction with bodybuiding shows. If you wanted to promote a AAU Bodybuilding contest, you had to run a weightlifting contest with it. There was no getting around it. The problem was that aside from being about as exciting as watching paint dry, weightlifting contests would run all day and were expensive to promote. Consequently, promoters and contests were few.Then there was the athletic points thing in the AAU Mr. America contest. Like Bob Hoffman did anything to promote these guys other than in his magazine. So a lot of great bodybuilders would lose to lesser developed men (usually York Barbell/Hoffman employees) because they didn't score the mandatory athletic points. What a ripoff!And there was the 1949 Mr.U.S.A.--The Mr. Olympia Contest of it's time. A great idea ruined thanks to the Central Pa influence. This competition attracted more than 6,000 fans and the greats of the day, Ross, Reeves, Grimek, Stephans, Eiferman and others. Most felt that this contest was between Clancy Ross and Steve Reeves. Who won? John Grimek, a great champion to be sure but a very unpopular decision. By the way, Grimek was a Hoffman employee. The Mr. U.S.A. was a great contest that got messed up thanks to York. Grimek retired for obvious reasons, Reeves never competed in this show again (but would come back to guest pose in 1957 and brought the house down), Ross came back in '55, Eiferman came back in 1950 to lose to Armand Tanny and Al Stephans won the first IFBB Mr. America in 1949. The next IFBB Mr. America wasn't held untill 10 years later in 1959.The Mr U.S.A. Contest never attracted either the overall caliber of contestants or audience of the 1949 event. A great idea that went wrong. Simularly, in the 1948 NABBA Mr. Universe, Grimek and Reeves were supposedly deadlocked for first place. Both men came out to pose again. Grimek added muscle control, a back flip and then went into a split. The audience erupted. Grimek was announced as the winner with Reeves second. The audience booed. Rumor was that Hoffman told the promoters to make sure that Grimek won. There was no NABBA Mr. Universe the following year. In the 1950s, a dummy was made up to look like Bob Hoffman and conspicous at Southern California contests with a noose around it's neck and a sign saying; &quot;Hang Bob Hoffman.&quot; Hoffman was not pro bodybuilding, he just used bodybuiding. People in the sport knew it and were trying to get the message across.His products, particularly Hoffmans Hi Pertein (as he pronounced it) was a joke. Powdered skim milk was a better source of protein.In the 60's when powerlifting was created, Hoffman used the powerlifters the same way he used the bodybuilders. He produced a new magazine Muscular Development. At one point it was discovered that sanction fees from AAU Bodybuilding and Powerlifting contests and registration fees from AAU registered powerlifters and bodybuilders were used to promote olympic style weightlifting and none of it ever got back to powerlifting or bodybuilding.Even the Mr America contest was started by a independent organization and later became the AAU Mr. America and always held along with the AAU Sr. National Weightlifting Championships. The Mr. America was used to help support the AAU Sr. National Weightlifting Championships, not to support bodybuilding. Ditto for the AAU Jr. Mr. America and AAU Mr. North America at the time.Bob Hoffman and York Barbell may have been instrumental in starting bodybuilding, but did little to support it. In fact, if it wasn't for the Hoffman/York influence, we could have seen bodybuilding as it is today come a whole lot sooner. John C. Grimek was a great champion and a gentleman. It's regretable how York used and abused him and then tossed him aside in his senior years. But then what they did to Grimek was not much different than what they were doing to bodybuilding as a whole from 1940s to 1980s.York Barbell, goodbye and good riddance."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"While Mr. Fair, perhaps in an attempt to appear neutral, does take a few shots at Hoffman, it is painfully obvious that the author has more than a neutral fascination for York BBC and Bob Hoffman.Those of us who were in the Iron Game know that Hoffman did it for his ego alone. And York BBC under the aegis of the AAU did not promote the first Mr. America. It would be more accurate to say that the York boys via the AAU plagerized the Mr. America contest, stole it from the promoters who had started it in 1939.The first legitimate bodybuilding contests were actually held in Europe in the 1930's by the same people who would form NABBA in 1950.A World's Most Perfectly Developed Man contest was held in NYC back in 1920 and was won by Angelo Sicliano aka Charles Atlas. And the people who started NABBA, ran bodybuilding shows in Great Britian and throughout Europe in the 1930's.York Barbell didn't start bodybuilding and weightlifting competitions, they merely jumped on the bandwagon.Hoffmans sole interest was to sell magazines and his crappy supplements. Hoffman made himself the US Olympic Weightlifting coach which is interesting since he neither ever competed nor trained. It was all part of an incredible hoax.Hoffmans magazine Strength & Health was a ripoff of the British publication Health & Strength (sound familiar) who were also sponsors of the NABBA Mr. Universe, the real Mr. Universe Contest won by greats like yorks own John C. Grimek, Steve Reeves, Reg Park, Bill Pearl, Arnold Schwarzenneggar, Frank Zane, Serge Nubret, Robby Robinson, Chris Dickerson, Bertil Fox and Boyer Coe.AAU events were horribly run. The first show I went to was in Scranton, Pa. back in 1968. The Jr. National Powerlifting Championships and Jr. Mr. USA. Massive disorganization! The contest was held in a YMCA that had to be at least 50 years old and in the heart of downtown. There were only 7 physique contestants and only one who was of national caliber. Contestants posed under a flood light that was clamped onto to a basketball hoop! 5 years later the same promoters held the Sr, National Powerlifting Championships and AAU Mr. USA Contest. This would go down as the worst national AAU event ever! Seveal athletes got seriously injured due to bad equipment and bad spotters. Several national records were not set because of either horrible officiating or spotters grabbing the bar during the lift. During the physique show, the flood light that was attached to a basketball hoop fell just missing a contestant! The bodybuilding show was more of who was the promoters top vitamin salesman rather than who had the best physique. This would be the last national show or major show of any importance to be held in Scranton, Pa. It was terrible even by AAU standards!But this was all so typical of the AAU events during that time. Poorly organized and political. Other AAU events were only slightly better. Even the top shows held in York and sponsored by the man himself, Bobby Boy Puffman were held in High School Auditoriums of only average size and no air conditioning during the hot summertime.The bottom line is that Hoffman did this all for himself. Yeah, I know it's not nice to talk about the deceased, but Mr. Hoffman was not as loved as the author likes to make it look and York was not the powerhouse that the author tries to make it look either. Remember this was in the early days of the sport and comparing to what York Barbell had going on back then to the Iron Game, especially bodybuilding and powerlifting events today is like comparing a 1968 Chevy to a 2005 Lexus! Sort of like comparing a small Mom and Pop store to Wal-Mart. No Comparison.And let's get off this nonsense that the AAU Mr. America was like the Mr. Olympia of it's day. I think the real curiosity factor was who would get ripped off each year. The best guys lost and would either retire or switch to the IFBB or Dan Luries now defunct organization. The top champions were in the IFBB, even back in the 1960's.Even as far back as 1960, the best built men in America competed in the IFBB or NABBA events. Prior to the forming of the IFBB in the USA, many American bodybuilders would fly over to London, England to compete in the NABBA Mr. Universe and win over the AAU Mr. America Winners!And then there was that nonsense that York BBC pulled in the 1956 AAU Mr. Universe contest in Virginia Beach, Va.This book is not totally accurate as those of us who have followed the sport for many years know. Hoffman did more to hold the sport back than to help it. That is the sports of bodybuilding and powerlifting. Hoffmans only real love was Olympic Weightlifting.Notice that the AAU does not run bodybuilding events anymore? Some people blame Weider and the forming of the NPC back in 1982 for that. Perhaps so, but all Weider and the NPC did to the AAU was what the AAU had been doing to bodybuilding and the Iron Game for over 40 years! And the NPC took bodybuilding further than the AAU could have ever hoped to. I hate to think where the sport would be today if it were still in the hands of the York crew!The Arnold Classic sould probably be held in a small high school auditorium with perhaps 700 people attending and unsymetrical olympic weightlifters turned bodybuilders who represented York BBC winning over great physiques. Thank God for the NPC, the IFBB and Joe Weider! And thank God for the new powerlifting federations that were formed. Although today, there are too many.Thank God control of the sport was taken away from Hoffman, York BBC and the AAU.I respect Mr. Fair for his opinion and his desire to make money, but this book is not all that accurate."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"the book has everything you would want to know about hoffman and other famous bodybuilders, strongmen but the way the book was written too much information, was not entertaining."},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"While this book does dispel the image of Bob Hoffman as some sort of saint not to mention the fact that Fair dispels the notion that Hoffman was a strongman or superhealthy. In reality, Hoffman used aluminium weights for his \\"strongman exhibitions\\" and was quite unhealthy. And he was no saint.Hoffmans main source of income was from his Oil Burner business. He saw weightlifting as a business opportunity and his primary interest was olympic weightlifting with bodybuilding as a sidethought.Indeed, Hoffman found that by promoting bodybuilding events along with olympic weightlifting he could increase the attendance at the ole so boring olympic weightlifting contests.Hoffman also saw an opportunity to sell weights, vitamins, protein powders and other supplements via weightlifting contests and his magazine Strength & Health which in fact was nothing more than a catalogue promoting his products.Through the efforts of Hoffman, the AAU Mr. America was more or less a \\"who is the best built York BBC Man of the year.\\" Poor Dan lurie would win every subdivision and place second repeatedly during the early 40's and had to wonder when York would run out of employees that he had to be second to.In 1947 Steve Stanko, a York employee would win the AAU/FIHC Mr. Universe contest in Phildelphia. In all fairness, this being the time when legends like Clancy Ross, Steve Reeves, George Eiferman, Lud Shusterick, Andre Drapp and Oscar Heidenstam not to mention York Barbells very own John Carl Grimek walked the earth, Steve Stanko Mr. Universe? C'mon!The problems with Hoffman controlling the AAU bodybuilding movement continued through the 40's, 50's, 60's and even the 70's. Black and Puertican bodybuilders had no chance to win the coveted AAU Mr. America title and would frequently place lower than what they deserved in lower level contests as well. As a result, many of the top names just left the sport in disgust. The IFBB tried to launch in America but met with incredible opposition from Hoffman. It would be a decade later untill the IFBB would make a major impact on bodybuilding and give bodybuilders a fair alternative.For years Hoffman was concerned about the popularity of bodybuilding and felt that too many in the Iron Game were focusing on the muscle contests in lieu of his precious olympic lifting. For the same reason, Hoffman tried to hold back powerlifting, initially referring to the sport as \\"Odd Lifting.\\"I guess it was \\"odd\\" to Hoffman. The first National Powerlifting Championships were held in 1965 in York, Pa. and were incredibly successful. Hoffman even launched a new magazine called \\"Muscular Development\\" which would cover both bodybuilding and powerlifting while Strength & Health, Hoffmans flagship magazine (catalogue) would cover mostly olympic weightlifting with some health articles which were really intended to sell Hoffmans products. Sort of like an early version of informercials.To Hoffmans dismay, powerlifting grew tremendously. Participants found that powerlifting was far easier on the body and joints that heavy squat cleans, split cleans, overhead presses, snatches and clean and jerks. Powerlifting also drew larger audiences than olympic lifting and once again Hoffman was concerned about taking away from olymic weightlifting. When it was discovered that England, Australia, Germany, Canada and many other countries had powerlifting advocates, powerlifters were after the AAU to organize a World Championships. But alas, Hoffman via the AAU claimed it could not be done.In 1970, George Frenn who was an associate editor for Weiders magazine Muscle Builder/Power beseiged Joe Weider to organize a international powerlifting competition and Mr. Weider did. It was held along with the IFBB Mr. Western America in Los Angeles and was incredibly successful. This was despite attempts by the York group to stop the contest. According to the York magazines, \\"any AAU registered athlete who competes in this competition will be banned for life by the AAU.\\" Reality was that York was just blowing smoke. The competition was extremely successfu. So successful that now Hoffman saw the possibilities (via competition with Joe Weider??) to organize the first World Powerlifting Championships in York, Pa. in 1971. Interesting how the impossible became possible. It was most obvious that the only reason that Hoffman organized the first World Powerlifting Championships was in fact to even the score with Joe Weider...but the good news is what came out of it....powerlifting surged in popularity, formed their own federation leaving the AAU which as far as most people were concerned, stood for Amateur Archiac Union, at least as far as the Iron Game was concerned.Also during the 1970's, the IFBB gained acceptance with the General Assembly of General Sports Assembly giving the IFBB superiority over the AAU and establishing the IFBB as the official governing body for the sport of bodybuilding! Slowly, bodybulders in the USA began to switch over from the AAU to the IFBB and bodybuilders finally had a viable alternative. Today, the AAU no longer sanctions bodybuilding contests. The NPC, the american affiliate to the IFBB squelched the AAU and bodybuilders are far better off as result.Strength & Health went the way of the stagecoach. Muscular Development was bought by Twin Labs. York Barbell still sells weights but you won't find York Barbell running any national level bodybuilding or powerlifting competitions anymore or even local events.Getting back to my initial question, what exactly did Bobby Hoffman do for the Iron Game? I guess the best thing he did was plant the seeds for better promoters to take the sport where Hoffman couldn't or wouldn't. Bodybuilding shows are now held in large convention centers ins tead of YMCA's and High School Auditoriums and professional contests resemble rock concerts with special effects and large audiences. Olympic lifting and power lifting are both in better hands now as well.Protein products now actually have protein rather than white sugar and white flour, the two main ingredients in Hoffmans products.The other thing that Hoffman did was to infuriate members of the Iron Game to take the ball from Hoffman and run with it. To make The Iron Game the great sport that it is today. Hoffman may have initiated some of the things that we love about the sport today, but in fact, The Iron Game is far better off without Hoffman and York Barbell than it ever was with the York gang.One other thing. In the early 60's, York Barbell were the first to exploit anabolic steriod use. A certain Dr. Zeigler administered them to York Olympic lifters in an attempt to compete on a world level in Olympic Weigthlifting. Soon steriod use exploded to bodybuilders and weightlifters were taking steriods like they use to take vitamin supplements and eating them like candy. Interesting too that even without steriods, the Japanese, Russians and the Germans still stayed ahead of our Drug Taking Americans! If it wasn't for York Barbell and Bob Hoffman perhaps steriod use would not be so prevelent today.Gee--thanks Bob!"},{"Title":"Muscletown USA: Bob Hoffman and the Manly Culture of York Barbell","review":"The bottom line is t hat Bobby Hoffman did all this for his own good and it is really irrelevent as what the iron game was back in the 40's was nothing compared to what the sport is today.

The prolix, anonymous critic reviewer misstates the case. The point is that the claimed clear superiority of Dvorak's keyboard arrangement over the prevailing QWERTY arrangement did not exist. This belief in Dvorak spawned a vast number of models (many of which are cited in the book) in which the wrong choice persisted. Frustrated at the persistence of concerns for which the empirical basis had vanished, the authors went on to examine other alleged examples and to appraise the theory. The other examples also were invalid. That theory only establishes the special conditions that might produce lockin. The book nicely brings all this together in a lucid presentation. As the title neatly suggests, they go on to the point that belief in the theories they have long questioned are being used against a major company. The authors thus raise questions about the wisdom of applying such poorly tested theories to public policy. Beyond their argument is the movement in economic regulation to insist on strong evidence to support action. This is indeed an interesting book that those concerned with sensible government policy will find well worth reading."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"This a great book for those whose only exposure to the economics of the case has come from DOJ lawyers' press conferences. The &quot;Fable of the Keys&quot; article/chapter is excellent for its demolishing of the DVORAK v. QWERTY keyboard myth. Also good is the right on the money explanation of the Betamax v. VHS standard battle. When thinking about the claimed lock-in effect for Microsoft Explorer one should ask: even if ME is &quot;inferior&quot; to Navigator, does it really matter?For as M&amp;L illustrate, peceived dominant players in software markets have been completely overthrown in a short period of time (ie. 1-3 years using their example of Lotus and Wordperfect). Therefore, to buy the government's argument that Microsoft will lead to permanent ineffiencies, and this is based on the assumption that ME is inferior to Navigator, one must believe that people are either extremely stupid or that no one will ever, and I mean ever, be able to challenge Microsoft, but this idea flies in the face of all empirical evidence as well as common sense.Lastly, M&amp;L take some shots at academic economists near the end of the book. They write that the quest for tenure, acclaim, money etc., has lead many economists to distort economics by applying purely theoretical (read as: having no connection to the real world) to the real world. This is dead on. As a graduate student in economics I can attest to the fact that economics in theory and practice are too very different things. Unfortunately, many economists are not that scrupulous and take advantage of the popular belief that &quot;experts&quot; know something, and would rather make a quick buck testifying for the government than admit to the fact that economics in the classroom and textbook has nothing to do with reality."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"&quot;In Winners, Losers &amp; Microsoft, economists Liebowitz and Margolis present powerful evidence that Microsoft lowered prices.&quot; - NEWSWEEK&quot;Our 'Economics' focus discussed \`The Fable of the Keys,' a paper by Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, which showed that the QWERTY story was, because the standard layout is not in fact demonstrably worse than the alternatives. This cast doubt on the whole new-theory movement. Now the authors brought out a book, Winners, Losers &amp; Microsoft. It includes the keyboard paper but moves on from that, by way of a close look at the software industry, to a broader and deeper attack on the would-be heretics. By a long way, it is the best single thing to read on this tangle of issues. The book reviews the new theory carefully and in language accessible to the general reader, and then subjects it to a detailed empirical examination. At the end, very little of the fashionable critique of neoclassical economics is left standing. . . . Turning to the actual evidence, again and again, they show that good products win. The standard lock-in stories are examined and, like QWERTY before them, debunked. . . . Unsurprisingly, in view of all this, the authors take Microsoft's side in the firm's battle with the Justice Department. Their view of that endlessly complicated issue, set out in an appendix, is not so much a resounding acquittal as \`case not proven'-but they would say this should suffice. The case they make against the path-dependence paradigm as a way to see the world could hardly be stronger: it is a big idea that simply fails to stand up.&quot; - THE ECONOMIST&quot;Winners, Losers &amp; Microsoft gives 'path dependence' a cold shower and sheds much-needed empirical light on the success story we call Microsoft.

I'd be willing to give it three stars for its intellectual merit if it weren't for the patronizing and glib tone in which much of the book is written. Sadly, given that their argument has quite a number of fundamental flaws this glibness is unwarranted and results in the loss of one star from this reader. In the following I've culled three points from my notes--the first two minor but illustrative, the last one major.1. The author's diagrammatic explanation of the dynamic process of technology adoption under increasing returns (Figure 3.1 in the book) is well known in the coordination literature as Thomas Schelling's &quot;critical mass&quot; or &quot;tipping model.&quot; (See page 104 in Schelling's &quot;Micromotives and Macrobehavior&quot; or pages 234-42 in Dixit &amp; Nalebuff's &quot;Thinking Strategically.&quot;) L&amp;M do not attribute it to Schelling (nor do they cite him at all), but rather to their own 1996 paper. Since not knowing one's Schelling when writing about coordination is tantamount to being a Catholic priest and not knowing the New Testament, this is either a grave oversight or just plain academic dishonesty. This is rather more surprising since the authors have (laudably) gone to great lengths to unearth inaccessible and obscure sources to back their claim. [As a side note on the keyboard case, the authors' claim that the failure of Dvorak's DSK keyboard design to outcompete QWERTY constitutes a case of lock-in is incorrect. The fact that none of the other 403,291,461,126,605,635,583,999,998 possible arrangements of 26 keys on four rows did any better is the real case of a lock-in. Also, if, as L&amp;M seem to concede, DSK was about 5% better than QWERTY, and (conservatively) assuming that there are a million typists in the U.S., all typing away 30 hours a week for 40 weeks a year at a ten dollar hourly wage, these 5% amount to a whooping $600,000,000 gain in productivity per year in the U.S. alone. Again it was Schelling and not David who entered the keyboard example into the academic discussion. And the two points raised in the last sentence of his treatment of the subject (pp. 122-3) remain unaddressed by L&amp;M or other detractors: How can we internalize the externalities on our yet-unborn progeny; and what about the awkward features of QWERTY such as the position of the &quot;A&quot; key?]2. According to L&amp;M a stochastic process is path independent if the probability distribution for period t+1 is conditioned only on values of the system in period t. (Page 51 verbatim.) In fact, this property is called the Markov property of stochastic processes, and Markov processes come in both flavors--path dependent and path independent. Also nothing in the theory of stochastic processes is based on chaos theory, as L&amp;M claim. (Chaos theory generally uses a deterministic setup.) As can be gleaned from those passages (and the citations) the authors' knowledge about the theoretical underpinnings of path dependence doesn't go beyond popularizations such as Gleick's &quot;Chaos&quot; or Waldrop's &quot;Complexity.&quot; This might have been excusable when they published their earliest papers on the subject, but ten years later it is embarrassing. As a consequence the taxonomy they offer on first-to-third degree network effects is pretty moot. Markov decision processes are much more complex than decisions under uncertainty as discussed in textbook microeconomics, and it would stand the authors well if they familiarized themselves with the technical literature on the theories they refer to. (This reader recommends Martin Puterman's excellent introduction to Markov Decision Processes.)3. Probably the most quixotic element of their analysis is their much-hailed claim that Microsoft does well when their products are superior and does poorly if they aren't. As a metric for product quality they choose the evaluations of experts writing for computer magazines. This is a very odd choice, as it is everything but an unintrusive measure. In fact, L&amp;M make a point that (due to resource constraints) they only used the reviews from *leading* magazines. So the claim of superiority is in fact one of an early (presumably knowledgeable) agent signaling superior product quality. I'm not sure how the authors believe that those reviews are different from the newspapers reports about typewriting contests in Cincinatti that played such a big role in the QWERTY case. How can we determine that the opinions of experts, publicized early in the adoption process, did not influence less informed customers whose main goal was to choose the software that will eventually be the most-adopted one? And how can we know that those experts were bipartisan and represented the prefererences of the average consumer? If at all, L&amp;M actually make a case *for* the arguments of Paul David and Brian Arthur--that early events can have a major or even hyperbolic influence on the adoption process. If the authors are looking for valid (i.e. unintrusive) measures of quality, they should search for product evaluations that never got published, but instead disappeared in the vaults of research institutes like August Dvorak's infamous Navy study.In summary the reader should treat the arguments of Profs. Liebowitz and Margolis with a healthy amount of skepticism. In fact, if there is a major contribution the authors made to the research area at hand, it is never to trust a theoretical claim based on an empirical story without putting the sources under due scrutiny."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"When enormous companies are extremely successful it attracts a great deal of attention. Usually this attention is centered around fear. People are afraid of companies being too successful, and making too much money. The fact that Microsoft has risen to such a high status in today's market is terrifying to some people. They look at Microsoft and assume that just because they are very dominant it is a sure sign that they are going to try and drive competitors out and then raise all the prices. They accuse them of crimes such as, Predatory Pricing, Linking or Bundling, and Collusion. They do this instead of looking at the company for what it is, a very efficient, well running, machine. Many people have compared Bill Gates with John Rockefeller saying that there is not much difference. Well, if that is going to be said it should be known that even Rockefeller's most harsh critic Ida Tarbell described his company as \\"a marvelous example of economy.\\" Basically Gates and Rockefeller do have something in common. They both were able to run a business very productively, efficiently and innovatively and they will both be punished for it.When you look at the Microsoft situation you have to ask the question, who have they hurt? The answer to that question is nobody. As Stan Leibowitz and Steve Margolis state in their book, \\"Winners, Losers, and Microsoft,\\" the effect that Microsoft's competitiveness has had on the market is in fact a huge reduction in prices and a great improvement of quantity and quality of computer products (Ludwig). This is the exact opposite of what a monopoly is supposed to cause. Going into more detail, it can be seen that Word processing prices were on the rise before Microsoft developed their Word program for Windows in 1989. This alone caused prices to drop from $300 in 1990 to $50 in 1997 (Ludwig). Also Microsoft had a positive effect on personal finance software when they came out with their Microsoft Money program. This caused finance software to drop from $100 in 1990 to $20 in 1991 (Ludwig). It has also been proven that during Microsoft's existence, \\"the cost of information processing to the consumer has plummeted so far today that it is now one hundredth of one percent of what it was in 1975.\\" It's interesting to note that Microsoft was started in 1975."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"The authors are PH.D. economists, but obviously do not know how the computer industry works.

Dvorak simply makes the common keys easier to get to and all but eliminates the need for one finger to type two letters in succesion. Just think of a word that's easy for you to type in Qwerty (e.g., flask), and consider that the majority of words you type in Dvorak feel like that. Do you believe these agenda driven jokers or your own fingers?This isn't rocket science. I don't need a study to tell me that a layout designed for touch typing will be better than one that was designed to keep primitive machines from jamming, and I don't trust the authors of a book who will set aside common sense and ignore the obvious in their quest to prove their pet theory.Also, I think Microsoft is a great company and we're all better off because it exists, but to deny that their OS monopoly gives them a huge advantage in the marketplace for other software products is a special kind of idiocy which can only be obtained through decades of academic isolation."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"Forget Microsoft.

Unfortunately, their other work on path dependency has languished in less well-known journals.It is a wonderful asset finally to have all their work on technological lock-ins put together in this one volume, and accessibly written for anyone who is interested in the topic.I've been a long-time Microsoft user/hater, but I find most of the arguments put forward by the authors to be very compelling: When MS products receive top ratings, those products tend to dominate the market and prices fall. I'm not sure I agree with most software reviewers that MS IE is better than Netscape, but perhaps that's a personal preference.But as I said, this book is a superb and accessible summary of the authors' work on path dependency and is a telling condemnation of BOTH sides in the antitrust suit agains Microsoft."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"There are a lot of myths about why products succeed or fail. Many claim that customers get &quot;locked into&quot; products simply because they arrive on the scene first even when much better products are available. Some claim that Microsoft has taken over different markets despite inferior software simply because of the monopoly that it has in operating systems. Liebowitz and Margolis provide straightforward, convincing, and imaginative evidence that these claims are false.It is amazing how many stories like the superiority of the DVORAK keyboard hang around for years with no supporting evidence. They make for great stories, but as these authors point out they are false.If you want to learn about how markets work, read this book.Finally, the previous commentor's remarks about these authors being bought off is offensive and false. Liebowitz and Margolis wrote about these issues a decade before Microsoft became involved in its current legal problems. Anyone who reads this book will realize that Microsoft would have been a lot better off if they had hired them rather than the lame effort they got from the MIT business school dean."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"This book is unfortunately titled as it is really primarily about bringing real data and rigor to bear on many of the conventional &quot;stories&quot; about the economics of the new economy, rather than dwelling on the Microsoft antitrust situation. Clearly, the new economy tends to be characterized by more network effects, increasing returns to scale, and general &quot;winner-take-all&quot; effects than the historical economy. However, certain stories about early lock-in effects of technologies that are inferior, but that by luck got the early lead, have been uncritically passed from author to author. Examples are the QWERTY keyboard, VHS vs Betamax, Windows vs Apple, etc. Liebowitz and Margolis show that most of these stories do not hold up under close examination -- that in fact, these are not examples of the market failing to take the &quot;right path&quot;. Actually, the market generally seems to get it right.

Must reading for anyone interested in the economics and politics of high technology markets. Explodes a number of myths. Eg. If Microsoft software dominates the PC market because they control the Windows operating system why are Excel and Word the number one products in the Macintosh market? Liebowitz and Margolis dug up hundreds of software reviews to provide evidence for their views. By the way, as was pointed out in the review of the book in the WSJ, Liebowitz and Margolis are academic economists who have been studying and writing about this issue for almost 10 years - long before the Microsoft anti-trust trial started. The book is about a lot more than Microsoft in anycase."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"Leibowitz and Margolis tackle one of the central problems in modern antitrust economics: Can inferior products prevail in competition? If so, can the producer of such products achieve a monopoly? Standard neoclassical economics denies that either outcome is possible. Economic evolution tends to favor efficient equilibria, while inefficient local equilibria tend to become extinct. Two fashionable economic theories have been advanced, however, which claim that inferior products can not only prevail in competition but also achieve monopolistic status.Path dependence claims that inefficient local equilibria can persist over time. Initial conditions, which may be determined by chance or other non-economic forces (such as political interests), direct the system down a particular path. Subsequent deviations from that path may be precluded as too costly, even if there are more desirable or efficient alternatives available. Where the cost of reversing the initially chosen starting point or conditions is especially high, an inefficient equilibrium may result that resists correction by market forces.Network externalities is the other key element of the inferior product lock-in story. Some products become more valuable as the number of persons using them increases. Each person who adopts the product thus confers positive externalities on other users. Personal computers (PCs) are a commonly cited example of this phenomenon. The value of Microsoft's Windows operating system, for example, depends in part on how many people use it and thus create markets for compatible hardware and software. The more people who use Windows, the larger the market for ancillary products becomes, thus encouraging the development of more ancillary products of higher quality and lower price.The claim made on behalf of the combined effects of path dependence and network externalities is that one cannot depend on markets to get it right. Arbitrary initial starting conditions favor an inferior product. That product generates network externalities. As the number of users of the product rises, the size of those externalities increases, which gives the inferior product a huge competitive advantage. Eventually the network product achieves a &quot;lock in&quot; effect. At that point, path dependence kicks in. It becomes too expensive to switch to a new product even though that product is superior. Hence, the inferior product prevails.In WINNERS, Stan Leibowitz and Stephen Margolis popularize their well-known (among economists) work debunking these fashionable theories. An important theoretical contribution, albeit one which is likely to be of interest only to economists and economically-minded lawyers, is the distinction they draw between &quot;second-degree&quot; and &quot;third-degree&quot; path dependence, which is driven by the availability of a feasible alternative to the suboptimal equilibrium. Only if such an alternative is available, does the phenomenon in question demonstrate true path dependence. Only if such an alternative nevertheless remains not taken, can the phenomenon in question even potentially be deemed inefficient in either the Pareto superior or Kaldor-Hicks sense.Of greater interest to general readers will be WINNERS' debunking of several urban legends about path dependence and lock-in. Several now famous lock-in stories are reviewed, most notably the QWERTY keyboard and the VHS videotape format. Leibowitz and Margolis thoroughly debunk both stories. As for the supposed superiority of the Dvorak keyboard over the prevailing QWERTY model, for example, they show that the studies on which the claim of Dvorak's superiority was based were flawed. Drawing on evidence from ergonomic studies, computer simulations, and training experiments, they find that the Dvorak keyboard offers no significant advantage over the QWERTY model. Hence, the QWERTY fable (as they call it) does not even demonstrate second-degree path dependence, let alone the real thing.Of primary interest to the general reader, however, will be Leibowitz and Margolis' extension of their argument to the antitrust case against Microsoft. The success of Microsoft's Windows operating system over alternatives such as Mac or OS/2 is frequently attributed to a network externalities/lock in story. Assume for a moment that the lock in story is true. It is not clear what the antitrust implications ought to be. Antitrust historically was justified by concerns that monopolies are harmful: they result in lower output and higher prices than competitive markets. It is not at all clear that this is true of software markets. Even if it were true, the positive externalities that result from the network effect might well outweigh those costs. Hence, a monopoly created by network effects arguably ought to be deemed a natural monopoly and, as such, tolerated by the antitrust laws. (The use of a natural monopoly in one market as leverage to monopolize a second one, as Microsoft is alleged to have done, of course, cannot be so justified.)If Leibowitz and Margolis had limited their arguments to these points, the book would not have been controversial. (It also wouldn't have sold as well or gotten the attention it so richly deserves.) Instead, however, they try to debunk the claim that Microsoft's products are inferior ones that prevail only because of their network effects and path dependence. Here, I think they are on weaker ground than in either the QWERTY or VHS examples. Their primary empirical evidence on the quality of Microsoft products is software reviews in leading computer magazines with respect to a comparative handful of product markets. This is one plausible measure of quality, but surely it is not the only one. (I have often wondered whether the volume of advertising in those magazines effects their editorial content, for one thing.) Hence, it seems to me, that they overstate the case when they assert their data prove that Microsoft prevails in market competition because it makes high quality products that it sells at low prices. Having said that, however, this is an incredibly important and remarkably accessible introduction to the key economic principles that underlie the software markets."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"For those whose memories are short, Liebowitz and Margolis provide poignant reminders that Microsoft's success -- like that of the QWERTY typewriter and VHS video format before them -- was by no means pre-ordained or simply the work of imposing sounding &quot;monopolistic practices.&quot; Where Microsoft has provided the best product at the most reasonable cost, it has succeeded. Where it has not -- i.e. Microsoft Money and MSN -- it has failed.This book should be required reading of those government bureaucrats who now seek to &quot;remedy&quot; that which was never broken."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"No economist (or team of economists) has produced during the 1990s research that is as compelling, as exciting, as important, and as well-grounded in both theory and data as that of Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis. These guys' work is truly and deeply impressive. And their writing is a joy to read.They tackle some of the most challenging issues at play in modern economics -- and they succeed brilliantly! Because of the research these two scholars produced earlier in this decade, it is inexcusable for anyone to trot out the success of the QWERTY keyboard or that of the VHS tape as examples of &quot;inefficient lock-in.&quot; Because of the research they have done, and report clearly, in this new book, it is now inexcusable for anyone to claim that Microsoft's market success is due exclusively -- or even principally -- to &quot;path-dependency&quot; or &quot;inefficient lock-in.&quot;Liebowitz and Margolis show beyond any reasonable doubt that in those markets where Microsoft achieves and maintains a large market share, it does so by offering consumers deals that consumers fine attractive. Period.WINNERS, LOSERS, AND MICROSOFT is economics at its finest and most relevant."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"This book presents a compelling discussion of economic theory and offers scrutiny of several flawed theories of market failure with specific regard to Microsoft and the government's antitrust case against the software giant. Winners, Losers, and Microsoft gives noteworthy insight into the underlying assumptions of these deficient economic theories as well as into the perceptions used as their foundation of evidence. Leibowitz and Margolis point out crucial flaws in these theories which are widely used today by some economists. They also seek to destroy the government's evidence for Microsoft exhibiting a damaging monopoly role in the software industry. The authors' assertion is that markets cannot be oversimplified through questionable assumptions and faulty evidence in order to come to a convincing theory of market failure. Their main claim is simply that certain technologies win out over others in time because they are of superior quality.The text begins by offering up the economic theories that are later attempted to be disproved. The main topic of contention is the fact that some economists, especially those involved in the antitrust case against Microsoft, claim that market failure is possible in new technology industries because consumers are forced into buying inferior technologies because of network effects, the notion that consumers' buying habits are heavily influenced by the number of other consumers using that product. Further detail is explained concerning a strong kind of network effect which is also claimed to lead to market failure, a standard. Another confused claim by some economists is that Microsoft's elevated position in the software industry is detrimental to competition and a case of monopolistic harm being done, disregarding the fact that Microsoft could have had the better product.Another issue that the authors question is that economic theories of path dependence are strong support for the idea of market failure. The authors argue that there is a very real possibility that such models do not translate well to real-world situations and market processes. They go on to point out that there would be many more signs and proofs of market failure were there any validity to that theory. They explain that path dependence theories rely on evidence from past technologies that isn't reliable or even accurately reported. It is also mentioned that economics literature gives multiple inconsistent meanings to path dependence and that a system to classify path dependence at three levels is possibly appropriate. Liebowitz and Margolis define first degree path dependence as making the right predictions about the future but those decisions seeming erroneous at points along the way, but essentially no harm occurring. Second degree path dependence is described as making the wrong prediction about the future but you did so from the standpoint in which you made the right decision given the available information. Finally, third degree path dependence involves knowing that you are making the wrong or inefficient decision but still making that choice anyway. It is this third and most extreme view of path dependence that supports claims for market failure.Past technologies that are said to prove the existence of this market failure are then discussed, including the QWERTY keyboard and the VHS video system. The QWERTY keyboard was said to be an inferior technology that was harder on the user and led to slower typing speeds. The main competitor to the QWERTY, or Universal, keyboard was the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard (DSK) that was introduced in 1936. August Dvorak claimed to have designed a keyboard that he supposedly proved was easier to learn and that reduced finger movement. The QWERTY keyboard, having been patented in 1868, was designed with the keys arranged in such a way that the typewriter for which it was designed operated the best. The main piece of evidence that economists and proponents of market failure (lock in) use to support this case as being market failure is a 1944 Navy study conducted to compare typing speeds between the two types of keyboards. This study, once carefully examined, reported flawed and incomplete data yet came to a decisive conclusion. This study was also believed to have been done by Dvorak himself, an important piece of evidence. Yet somehow this data is used consistently to this day as evidence that the allegedly inferior QWERTY keyboard should have never prevailed over the DSK. Also, most of the other body of evidence for the supposed preeminence of the DSK has proven to be based on anecdotal research and inconclusive studies.The evidence for the superiority of Beta over VHS is another example of faulty reporting of research leading to misconceptions about the technology that is higher in quality. This text points out that the quality differences between Beta and VHS weren't as great as may have been reported and that, despite the slightly better picture quality, Beta lacked another feature (longer tape length) that most consumers wanted at the time of their heated competition and possessed attributes that weren't necessary to the average consumer (better editing and special effects functionality). Their conclusions on this matter were that market failure couldn't be said to have happened because the better product won the battle (VHS) and that maybe Beta was better suited for broadcasters and not the average home user.The next section of the book addresses the accusations that Microsoft demonstrated injurious monopoly actions through elevating prices and impeding superior technologies from achieving market share because of lock-in network effects. The authors show evidence through software industry price data that in the markets where Microsoft achieved control of a majority of the market share that prices actually tended to decline in every case. This evidence overrules the monopolistic accusations of Microsoft elevating prices due to control of the market by network effects. It is stated from the assembled data that, in markets where Microsoft competes, consumers have seen price declines of approximately 60%. Also taken into account is the notion that tipping, the idea that market share should grow at an ever increasing rate due to its increased attractiveness to consumers, can occur in markets where there are significant network effects. In fact, where Microsoft has dominated the market it has been shown to steadily grow to that dominance and not the sudden jumps and accelerations expected from tipping.The analysis of the spreadsheet, word processor, desktop publishing, and online services markets was intriguing because all of the criticism and accusations of Microsoft in each of these markets seems to lack any shred of evidence. The authors' contentions are based on credible economic patterns and widely accepted principles. Through examining market share (based on revenue) and product quality (based on a multitude of reviews), it is shown that there is convincing substantiation for the claims that Microsoft dominated the markets in which it had higher quality products and did not achieve significant market share when reviews showed Microsoft's product quality lacking. These conclusions contradict the accusations of lock-in due to network effects because Microsoft's product quality was consistently rated the best when it achieved a large market share, not the anecdote that Microsoft had inferior products but succeeded due to blocking competition. The authors make convincing arguments repeatedly for the fact that the best product will come out on top in a laissez-faire economy and that this is exactly what happened time and time again with Microsoft.Following this whole discussion is the appendices of the text which offer analysis of the charges and the rulings against Microsoft by the government. There are repeated instances of the Justice Department using economists Franklin Fisher, Brian Arthur, and Garth Saloner to instill the belief of network effects, lock-in, and path dependence into the judge and jury. Disproving this evidence might have been Microsoft's best chance at saving their case considering that these theories and economic conditions are completely theoretical and have little basis in fact. Also mentioned is the fact that the Department of Justice discredited many of Microsoft's witnesses and managers, not helping the defense' dismal situation. The eventual ruling by Judge Jackson reflected the nature of Microsoft's legal defense - extremely ineffective. Jackson ruled ultimately that Microsoft was guilty of all antitrust charges brought against it but one, almost completely favoring the Department of Justice' opinion. What was the most disturbing and surprising to me was the fact that Judge Jackson implied in later interviews that he made his decision based not on the content of what the defense had to argue but on the fact that many had been discredited by their untruthfulness. Jackson also made very few changes to the government's proposed solution to the Microsoft problem because he didn't feel competent to recommend any solution himself. I think this only highlighted the fact that Judge Jackson didn't have enough knowledge or understanding of economics to rule effectively or fairly on the case, simply going by whatever the government had to recommend."},{"Title":"Winners, Losers & Microsoft: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology (Independent Studies in Political Economy)","review":"This book is unfortunately titled as it is really primarily about bringing real data and rigor to bear on many of the conventional &quot;stories&quot; about the economics of the new economy, rather than dwelling on the Microsoft antitrust situation.

It is my favorite picture book. It has such a tremendous impact on the reader with such an economy of words that it truly drives home the image we have been using all year of words in a story being like a glass of water and food coloring: each strong word is a drop of food coloring making the liquid darker. Each weak, unnecessary word is water, making the liquid lighter. We want our stories to be bright red (or yellow, or blue, or green). This book is the closest thing to pure, undiluted red as any we've come across. The students are astonished by the power and strength of feeling that just a few words can convey.They are equally mesmerized by the incredible imagery of the illustrations. In just 28 pages, the boy in the story changes from a fresh-faced innocent of 13 to a world-weary adult in a matter of months.The language in the book makes it a perfect compliment to a study of metaphors and similes. He describes his attraction to Mr. Lincoln as \\"sometimes you take to a person, the way a horse snuffs up the smell of someone.\\" And goes on to describe him as looking \\"so kind and sad, towering up into the sky like a black tree.\\"Like many other books with war as the theme, Drummer Boy personalizes death due to combat. However, unlike most other books, it does so in a mere 40 words that leave the most powerfully gripping image I have yet to read in a children's book. Instead of describing death and destruction in gory detail, the passage concentrates on describing the dying soldier's hand clasped in the protagonist's until he dies. Not once was blood, bullets, or wounds mentioned...&quot;One near me cried for his mother. I held his hand until he died, and I always feel his fingers on mine, how hot and dry they were, how they grabbed mine and crushed them until his eyes stopped seeing.&quot;This is a book that seems to speak directly to the children's souls. It seems to touch something in them, for when the story is over there is an almost reverent silence in the room and you can almost feel them coming back from the farthest regions of their imaginations...changed by the sights and sounds of war."},{"Title":"Drummer Boy: Marching to the Civil War","review":"I love to teach history and this book is a winner. I am always amazed how children focus on the glory of war, not the reality. This book gently brings home the reality. In the illustrations the child, drummer boy ages before the eyes of the reader.

I hardily recommend this book to any parent and am going to purchase a copy for my son's school. This book lets a child relate in a very special way to a trying period in American history.

The entire story is framed by two portraits - the first shows the narrator as a very 'juvenile' farm boy of 13 years, happy, straw-hatted, rosy-cheeked ... and the last shows a scruffy soldier boy-man who seems to have aged 10 years. They are printed so that the two may be compared side-by-side, and this comparison is the most poignant and moving thing in the book - the artwork is subtle and superb, and says everything that needs to be said about how the reality of war changes a person. There is no glory here, just an incredibly sad beauty. It's too 'grown-up' for a 4 year-old but not for 8 years. Don't underestimate the sadness of this book though: the combination of the text and pictures is powerful, haunting, and very beautiful, but it doesn't end in a 'happy' way and tears won't be far away whether you're 8 or 80. I'd recommend the book as a real thought-provoker - be prepared for searching questions if you have a sensitive child. Impossible to categorize, but on the verge of genius."},{"Title":"Drummer Boy: Marching to the Civil War","review":"Author Ann Turner and illustrator Mark Hess team up to tell the story of a drummer boy who joins the Union army in the U.S. Civil War. It is a wonderful book that does not talk down to children.The protagonist is an unnamed thirteen year old rural farm boy. His brother, Jed, has already gone ahead to him into battle, and the boy yearns to join. He makes his decision after seeing President Abraham Lincoln at a train station. The boy feels the sad president was looking right at him, needing him to serve his country. The boy's family seems rather indifferent to the slavery issue, feeling it is none of their business, but the boy does sympathize for the slaves. He writes a goodbye note, and leaves home.He enlists, lying and claiming to be fifteen years old, and is assigned to be a drummer boy. He becomes part of his company, and then goes into his first battle. The terror of the cannon noise and falling bodies around him freeze him in place. A soldier dies holding his hand. Soon, the boy is almost a veteran, the battles run together. The faces of his friends and acquaintances blur together as well, and he takes special care to remember each and every one, since they may not be there the next day. The final page gives adults and children alike something to ponder, in the voice of the battle hardened boy: \\"And when the war's over and I go home, I'll stop to talk to Mr. Lincoln and tell him how it's his fault, how his great, sad eyes made me go and see things no boy should ever see.\\"\\"Drummer Boy\\" is a wonderful book for all ages. The text and pictures are just twenty eight pages long, with an interesting one page historical note, and Turner and Hess do not waste a word or image. Drummer boys were not just children who banged on the drums during battles, the drums were used to signal orders to the troops, making the children prime targets for the enemy.The book is large, and every illustration by Hess would look wonderful framed on a wall. His portrait of Lincoln, and two page painting of slave quarters, are breath taking. I went back through the book at its conclusion, just trying to take in the pictures on their own. Turner does not overdo the contemporary vernacular, you come to care for this boy as a real person. Her writing is not overwhelmed by the art, both complement each other excellently.\\"Drummer Boy\\" is appropriate for ages four through eight, according to the jacket notes. I think it is appropriate for any age above four, telling such a strong story in such little space.

The author does a terrific job of telling stories of different comic book heroes: their acts of heroism, nobility, as well as their inner conflicts and downfalls. The really cool part about this book, the author relates each Superhero story to a spiritual perspective---there are surprisingly many similarities, parallels and even ironies between the Superhero stories and what we learn in Scripture.All in all, the book is very smooth reading and definitely thought provoking. The author really sparked my interest in his Introduction, and I remained intrigued the entire book.

Lest anyone think this is an overly preachy book, it draws on expierences of people as well as Christianity. Although many of the themes may be accidental, Brewer notices that this cannot be help because, \\"Our Maker built us with a persistent longing for a rescuer who will save us from injustice and suffereing.\\" (p. 10)All the primary chapters dealing with popular superheroes are just great. Superman, Batman, Captian America, Spiderman, and Wonder Woman are particularly interesting, but the chapter on the Fantasic Four is probably the best (I say this as a Batman and Daredevil fan); however, this is my complaint with the book and why it falls a star short of five. Daredevil is one of the most inetersting and dynamic characters when Frank Miller developed and explored Daredevil/Matt Murdock's Catholicism. there are so many good themes here, but Brewer focus on the least complex (Daredevil's ability to recognize the truth).Some may say I'm being picky, but I think Brewer would appreciate my position - after all, the comic book world, while mundane and childish to many, is serious stuff."},{"Title":"Who Needs a Superhero?: Finding Virtue, Vice, and Whats Holy in the Comics","review":"The chapter on spider man made me cry.

If you need a superhero, you certainly can find one in the comics, and you certainly can find virtue and vice there, but implying that 'finding what's holy' takes some sleuthing because it is hidden is just wrong. Implying that it is hidden suggests that the you are going to need the writer's interpretation, when in fact it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what is going on in a comic strip, and the author's perspective is pretty skewed.For example, the author claims that more and more school sports events are being deliberately scheduled on Sundays in order to break up Christian families and their worship schedules. Does the author not know that other faiths worship on Saturdays and that there are only two days in a weekend? Think 'Lebensraum', and the rest is history.Anyone who is as shamelessly self-centered as this does not deserve a soapbox."},{"Title":"Who Needs a Superhero?: Finding Virtue, Vice, and Whats Holy in the Comics","review":"This is not what I expected. I actually threw the book in the trash. I was looking for a book that would be able to use for children especially little boys to help develop good heroes. This book is intended for adults but I wasn't impressed there either. I read some and not how I would present the subject. I think I get what the author was trying to say. But to me Christ is beyond a superhero. To lower Him to compare to a comic hero doesn't work for me. He is my Holy Savior."},{"Title":"Our national parks (The out-of-door-library : school ed)","review":"So I was hoping this book would be more photographic. I understand that the book was written over a hundred years ago but since this is an updated version a photo at the start of each chapter would have still kept a good homage to the old manuscript. Otherwise many would still find this book to be archaic though it is a classic."},{"Title":"Our national parks (The out-of-door-library : school ed)","review":"The book arrived as described in the condition--great.

I could not put this book down. I stayed up till 4 am to finish with classes the next morning. Very well written. You really feel you know what these people experienced. No detail was left out. So many books read in Psychology classes are from the criminals point of view. This was not."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I read this book when it first came out, in the very early 1980's. I can never forget the pictures this awesome author painted in my mind. They are horrible, and without giving the book away, everysingle time I hear the words &quot;Hi-FI,&quot; or see a pencil or a bottle of Drano, I think of this book. Ugh, giving me the chills thinking about it. By the way, I am wondering how the author liked the movie, if at all?"},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I actually live in Ogden, and this is a very big deal here. Everyone seems to know about it, or actually knows someone who was impacted by these events.

Although Cortney's life was horribly changed, he tried to make the best of it, as did his family, and beat the odds!"},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I read this book when it was first published, about 15 years ago. Not only is it well written, but it thoughtfully and compassionately presents &quot;the other side of the story.&quot; It's a book I've replaced in my library at least twice, and I'm thrilled it's being re-released. A real page-turner."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I first read this book in the early 80's. It was so horrific, I could not pick it up again until recently. Very well written and gripping. It is not often that one reads the story from the victims viewpoint and the far reaching consequences of a very senseless act of violence. I only wish there had been some pictures of the victims when they were alive. Their story will forever pull at my heart. May they rest in peace."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I am from ogden, utah where the murderes took place and i have never heard anything this inhuman in my life.

Very good book by gary kinder"},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"Most true crime books feature the life and times of the killer(s), with the victim portrayed as the unfortunate corpse in the first chapters. This book puts a human face on the victims.Courtney's struggle and bravery are heartbreaking and inspiring. This book shows how a moment of senselss violence, which is usually given a brief amount of news coverage, actually has a ripple effect that lasts a lifetime. A must-read."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"&quot;Victim&quot; is a masterpiece of the true crime genre, for it was the first book to ever describe in painstaking and intimate detail the enormous physical, psychological, and financial traumas that are enforced upon the survivors of violent crime, and it exposed, also for the first time, how these survivors are often victimised again by an uncaring justice system where the rights of the accused always seem to come before the rights of the victimised."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"Gary Kinder is definitely a practitioner of the old saying &quot;don't tell them, show them.&quot; A former prosecutor, Kinder tries his hand at writing a true crime book about a boy with his whole life ahead of him who blunders into a horrific store heist, is seriously disfigured and left for dead by the robbers. His mother comes looking for him and is similarly tortured (in her case, fatally). Kinder reconstructs the ordeal of the victim (hence the title) almost minute by minute. He then takes you through the police investigation and trial of the criminals. But all the while, he keeps the spotlight on the victim, which sets this apart from most true crime books. He never editorializes or preaches. He lays out the facts in a clear yet compelling prose style and he lets them speak for themselves. Kinder teaches a Continuing Legal Education course on legal brief writing (I'd love to be a fly on that wall). And if you think this is a good book, you will also want to read his &quot;Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea.&quot;"},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I'm a true crime buff and have read countless books that detailed grisly crimes. None have affected me as much as Victim. Kinder's vivid description of the horror that went on in the Hi-Fi Shop was cringe-inducing enough, but the aftermath of the crime was almost unbearably difficult to read. When it comes to most crimes, we read the initial news coverage, we read or hear about the trial (if the perps are caught), and that's it. Thanks to Kinder, I now always wonder about those that have to go on living after the final gavel bangs in the courtroom. Is there any such thing as \\"closure\\" for someone whose esophagus is so scarred from drinking Drano that he can't swallow? For someone who saw his son killed in front of his eyes? For those death penalty apologists who pity the perps, keep in mind that the barbarians who committed this crime had three square meals per day and no difficulty in swallowing them until the date of their execution."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"The story of the hi-fi murders is respectfully told in this book. What a horrific crime."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"This is a \\"must read\\" book.

But it's worth the effort, because the story of the Naisbitt family's recovery from an unimaginable tragedy is amazing and inspiring. This book is largely responsible for sparking the development of the victims' rights movement; it is the first true crime book to focus more on the victims of a notorious crime than on the perpetrators. This change in perspective makes an interesting and absorbing read."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I came across this story very by accident on television. I was horrified to realize it was a true story, and had to get the book.This book is TRUE CRIME from where the prespectve should be...the victim.In society the victim is delegated to just a name. This book has put a human face on crime and the consequences of crime. This book shows humanity at both the very worst and very best. I commend the family for allowing this very painful story to be told. Cortney was very unfortunate to have had experienced such immense tragedy, however he was tremendously blessed to have such a strong and loving family. I felt such inspiration from Cortney's story and was amazed at what a truly special man his father is. This story is haunting and will not be forgotten. This book shows the power of evil and the power of love and all that is possible from both sides.I pray that this family continues to find the peace they so deserve."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"Mr. Kinder presents an important reminder of crime's aftermath."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I was given this book by a friend at work who is into true-crime stories. I never thought that I would be so facinated by this story. I thought it was a cliche, but I could not put this book down. We are rarely given the victims' side of the story. Kudos to Mr. Kinder for opening my eyes and showing me that the world is not always black and white."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"This book focuses on the victim's family, the victim, and the criminals in that order. Unfortunately the family's accounts seem to be quoted verbatim without much analysis, the victim is shown only as reflected by the family, and there is no real discussion of the criminals' motivation. This material could have been the basis for a much better book."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"Regardless of your views on criminal punishment, this book should be on the bookshelf of everyone who works for the justice system. So many books tell us about the lives of the killers, thank god this one is different. When the headlines fade, so often we push crime victims out of our thoughts. This book clearly shows the story doesn't end with the last headline, that the victims live with the ripple effects for decades later of the crimes heaped upon them.I won't pretend it is a work of priceless literature, but it does provide some priceless insights on how the victims of crimes were, and still are, under-represented and overlooked in the search for headlines. This work is both engaging and a fitting eulogy to the lives it portrays."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"............And that is deliverance of this volume. Whenever I'm in a used bookstore I always stop in the crime section to see if Kinder's book is present &amp; accounted for, and the majority of the time it is. I encourage all to read this work. It is Kinder's finest hour in the face of grim business beyond comprehension. I will never read it again because what happened in that basement of the Hi-Fi cannot be reconciled in my mind.I read recently that Courtney has passed away not too long ago."},{"Title":"VICTIM: THE OTHER SIDE OF MURDER","review":"I can bet Victim is the best book I've ever read!

The aftermath of the survivors. It was out of print for quite a while, so I would loan out my hardback and make the person sign a written document that they would return the book. When I found out it was in paperback I bought it for my son.When I first got the book I thought that it was another ann rule type crime novel.

The (to many) annoying frame boundaries and scan lines have been removed to the greatest extent possible without removing essential information. I particularly like the contrast enhancement and other software tricks that have been applied to present each photo in its best light.To see what I mean, take a look at \\"The Process used to clean up scanning artifacts\\" on the accompanying CD.The coverage is very thorough, though there are a few irksome \\"misses\\" that were unavoidable due to the nature of the orbiter's path.Any \\"lunartic\\" is going to enjoy this reference book. From the visual standpoint it is a superb job and one wonders why it was not done years ago. Likewise, there were other missions whose results would benefit from this treatment, although their coverage was different and less complete. In any case, I find this an extremely interesting and valuable resource.The bad news is that the index is bad. To find a named feature, it's not always possible to use the index (many important and common ones are missing: e.g., Aristarchus, Eratosthenes ...).To wander through the photos in a predetermined path (without reference to a specific feature) is also a chore at times as the organization is according to the original photo numbers and not to an overlaid organizational scheme such as a high-level map. It is easy to get lost and it is sometimes hard to find your way out again. Since the processing is so well done, this is less disheartening than it would otherwise be ... I find myself staying \\"lost\\" on purpose sometimes, discovering vistas I didn't know were there before losing my way. But to a technical writer it's discouraging to see such potential missed for lack of a truly good index.Producing an IAU Nomenclature-based index would be a great project for someone with the time!The book comes with a CD which I haven't found to improve on the printed index: the indexes that are on the CD are PDF files that are NOT linked to the actual photos, so to use them you need multiple windows open on-screen simultaneously. It would have been far more convenient to provide the indexes in html form with links to the proper photographs.On the plus side -- and it is a HUGE plus, in my opinion -- both medium- and high-resolution images of each photo are on the CD and they are gorgeous images, especially given the technology used to produce the original photos.All in all, this is an extremely valuable reference, and one I am using almost daily. So perhaps I am being a bit nit-pickety here. It's only the indexing bit that prevents this getting my 5-star rating: If I could award it 4.75, I would."},{"Title":"Lunar Orbiter Photographic Atlas of the Near Side of the Moon","review":"If your looking to explore the moon, this is the book to have. On the back cover of this book, it says a CD is included. Sadly this book doesn't come with a CD ROM. The book was returned to Amazon, then re ordered again with the same results.

Recommended for those being treated with acupuncture or for those that may be interested in acupuncture treatment, but not in an exhaustive deliberation on Chinese medicine. If you desire a good basic understanding of this health system this book will serve you well. If you require more discussion and detail then start with \\"The Web That Has No Weaver,\\" and branch out from there.The text is somewhat dated, but this does not take away from the basics you will acquire from this reading. The case studies are not necessarily outdated in this case, as they are used to illustrate a concept that holds true regardless of historical context.Again, this book amply serves its purpose as a basic introduction. Take it for what it is and you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Acupuncture: How It Works, How It Cures","review":"The book is OK for the layman. However it doesn't really get into how it works and how it cures. The case studies are also very old.

The length of the stories makes for good bedtime reading. Many stories hold lessons in life that are learned by animals, and apply to children. Read these stories to or with kids of all ages. The pictures of animals and fantacies are good. Pictures of people are dated (1950's), but it doesn't seem to make the experience irrelevant."},{"Title":"Westward the Dream (Ribbons West) (Book 1)","review":"This book was awesome.

I can appreciate it more looking back at it... and I positively loved the series!Where this may not be a newer series it is fantastic! It covers the settling of the railroad and it is full of history. I have to admit I am a Tracie Peterson fan and this series did not disappoint me ... I just wishs there had been more ... it was excellent! I, who I have to admit have had no interest in the history of the railroad found it fascinating ... yes, I knew some of it but really, really enjoyed it. It is based around the time of the Civil War so there is so much going on during that time. The difficulties that they go through you feel for all of them ... and as s woman that is trying to show her independence you understand where Jordana is coming from. The struggles of Victoria and Kiernan are heartbreaking and you feel each and every one of them. It is also so hard throughout the series reading the struggles of Caitlan ... what a great series!

Both times were at exhibitions here in Houston. I cannot say enough about how incredible his wildlife paintings are.... every nuance of the individual animals is captured. He also ensures that the reprints (posters :)) of his paintings are as accurate as possible. I have several prints around my house and folks who see them for the first time never fail to complement them.This book has most of his best work and while the scale is smaller, they still show the detail and clarity.

A great addition to my Map Skills unit!"},{"Title":"Maps and Globes (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"I bought this title to help introduce my son to map skills. It is very informative and written at a child's level; I am quite pleased with that aspect of the book. The one problem I have with it is that it repeats the legend that everyone thought the earth was flat up until 500 years ago, when Columbus and Magellan finally proved otherwise (see pp. 6-11). Though we probably all heard that one while growing up (I certainly did) it has been debunked (see the book _Inventing the Flat Earth_). The ancient Greeks first figured out that the earth was round when they noted that it casts a round shadow on the moon during an eclipse and that ships seem to move downward as they disappear over the horizon. By Columbus' time all learned people actually knew the earth was round; they only disputed his theory that traveling west rather than east would prove to be a \\"shortcut\\" to the Indies.Anyway, I just wanted to warn parents about that bit of misinformation since none of the other reviewers mention it. It's actually understandable since the book is copyright 1985; AFAIK the research debunking the \\"Everyone was a flat earther until five centuries ago\\" notion was done after that. Still, there's a lot of good information about maps otherwise so you may still wish to use the book and just explain the error or skip over those pages."},{"Title":"Maps and Globes (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"This was a great book to explain maps, where they came from, etc. It is for children 2nd grade and up, and can be rather detailed at times.

However, the book would be greatly improved by a glossary defining all the italicized words in the book."},{"Title":"Maps and Globes (Reading Rainbow Book)","review":"While written for youth, this is a very good introduction to maps. It is especially useful because it informs young readers that maps are not always accurate. The historic discussion helps to bring students to the present in terms of how maps, in general, evolved. Comparison of globes and flat maps is very instructive. I would havesaid more about the utility of Mercator and similar maps (especially rhumb lines, shortest distances), but the Greenland/South America discussion is on target. I would have included another map -- the Western and Eastern Hemisphere and related cartographic data to Old and New World -- it introduces what young students will learn in later classes. Measurement on maps is effectively dealt with, but it is important to distinguishthe 'naturalness' of the Equator from the 'arbitrariness' of the Prime Meridian. Nice coverage of South America, but it might be more useful to put the pair of maps opposite each other. Authors should avoid referring to the land area as 'dry' land. It could be confusing.

They seem to enjoy it too. It seems a little dated though."},{"Title":"The Water Gods: The Inside Story of a World Bank Project in Nepal","review":"This book gives the reader an intimate glimpse of one pivotal moment during the struggle to stop the Arun III mega-damn project in Nepal. The writer, Anna Paskal, takes the reader along on her trek up the Arun Valley with a group of local and international activists, reporters and filmmakers. She makes a point to present to the reader the, at times, precariously diverging agendas of all of those on the trek. Her willingness to expose her emotional and intellectual responses to the various situations the group finds itself in gives the text a raw immediate feeling. The snippets from interviews of government officials and activists that she weaves into her tale lend this travelogue unexpected depth. For me, the only drawback of this book is that I would have liked to hear more about the time the author spent before and after the trek.

I don't think anyone should judge what is art, and what is not... but this book was so vague and unhelpful it was hard to draw information out of it, even for questions that were based on the text. It did seem as if the author was more interested in confusing and shocking the reader than actually providing education. The class itself was good, but I could have definitely found a better text.

This is an actual art piece by a person, who shall remain nameless, who has brought millions of dollars for such offensive, hideous barn muck. Most of you out there detest the \\"Art World\\" for rubbing our faces in feces like the above example of so called \\"art\\". Tens of millions of people know the names of every Nascar driver, or champion athlete...but who knows the name of artists today who get millions for shabby, tacky repugnant pig swill?This book absolutely features such vomit. You will find your attention directed again and again to the most deplorable crap you have ever seen-and the author does her emasculating feminist best to compel you to like the preposterous spew.We are all sick to death of people using the gimmick of profound moral shock in order to get into the press, and ultimately into print in an art history book, or college text book like this...by vomiting out ther most disturbing traumas for us to 'seriously contemplate'.We despise these self absorbed, peurile chumps who 'call' themselves artists.I am an Art Major, who spent a lifetime making a modest living as an artist. If the client didn't like it, I went without food, or the phone was disconnected. Real artists never in history had the privelege of making millions offending everyone! The Art World has gone beyond ludicrous. It is seen now as a realm of the blind leading the blind. Pieter Bruegel made a painting of that in the 1500's. Hoighty toighties, conning other vastly overpaid twits and hedge fund dipslimes into thinking they have bought something valuable. That's criminal enough. But to pay $140 for one of these books designed to brainwash the population into thinking excrement is art? Andres Serrano did that recently- a one man showing of large 5 foot high photographs of excrement. And passed it off as 'art'! All of these people should be forced into hard labor prison camps for a few years. The 'art' (pig swill featured in this book ) has nothing whatsoever to do with art, or reality, or anything at all. Authors like this are no better than the Madoffs who also manage to con rich people out of billions...and laugh all the way to the bank. This author and the artists in this book should be arrested , just like Madoff was, and pilloried int he press."},{"Title":"Understanding Art Study Guide","review":"they did not specify that it was the study guide instead of the actual book I needed."},{"Title":"Understanding Art Study Guide","review":"I went to a multimedia school where I took a class on the fundamentals of art &amp; design. Understanding Art was the required text book. Little would I know that I would still be talking about Understanding Art and recommending it for years after that class! (Just don't let my teacher know that!)The book takes you throughout the history of art, starting from the earliest forms, throughout the middle ages, native traditional art, to the renaissance, to post modernism, to surrealism, to art deco, bauhaus, dada, and everything else. There isn't a form of art that isn't covered and illustrated, which is extremely beneficial, as you truly do learn how art forms evolved throughout the years. Another benefit to this book is that it covers the different medias in art - sculpture, paintings, print, masks, archetecture, and more.The photographs of the artwork are present throughout the book, and the text gives you insight and background knowledge of each art era that you wouldn't otherwise see. One might usually associate art history text as boring and monotonous, but this is not the case. The text is informative and exciting to read all at the same time.It's a great book for someone who's starting out in art history, but even long-time art fans will enjoy it too."},{"Title":"Understanding Art Study Guide","review":"As a college Art History instructor and an avid reader, I can honestly say Lois Fichner-Rathus has produced one of the finest Art Appreciation texts on the market. The sixth edition of Understanding Art is both visually and intellectually exciting.

Addional illustrations (many in color) add to the enjoyment of spending time with this updated classic.Though I've referred to this as an Art Appreciation &quot;text,&quot; it is by no means dry.The author's viewpoint and writing style are never boring and she continually exhibits great perceptiveness, and wit, in her commentary. The progression of the book's sections from a well-done &quot;Introduction&quot; to the &quot;Language of Art,&quot; a look at the varying media of art, and finally a series of chapters on historical style, is well done and logical.

Even though a lot of this story is fictional and based on some facts, its still fascinating. The book is very in depth, with a lot of detail. The story does become dull at times, particulary after Tuptim's death, but the book still picks up again. It was interesting to see how many more characters there are, their weren't used in all the movies of this story.This book is definetly a great book for anyone interested in finding out more of the story of Anna and the King."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"I am 14 years old, and have recently read this wonderful book. It is sometimes slightly gruesome (i.e., Lady Tuptim) but more often good prevails, and Margaret Landon did an excellent job of combining Anna Leonowens books and many historical documents to create this book. I hope everyone who reads it, young or old, agrees and enjoys."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"\\"How old shall you be?\\"\\"I am 150 years old, your Majesty.\\"\\"In what year shall you be borned?\\"\\"Seventeen hundred and twelve, your Majesty.\\"\\"How many years should you be married?\\"\\"Several, your Majesty.\\"Pause.\\"How many grandchildren shall you have by now? How many? How many? How many? Ha! You do not answer that so quick. I make better questions than you answers, hmm?\\" (pages 58-59)This is Mrs. Anna Leonowens (an English governess's) first introduction to the eccentric 59-year-old King of Siam, King Mongkut, in the 1860s. Margaret Landon's \`Anna and the King of Siam' is an intriguing, historical tale based on ancient, Siamese records and the secret diaries, letters, and conversations of Anna in Bangkok that reads like fiction but is amazingly genuine [some parts]. Anna, along with her six-year-old-son Louis, embark on an erratic odyssey through a foreign land of a cryptic culture that will, in a few months, become traditional to them. Yet there are some seemingly barbaric issues to be cleared up. Among them are slavery, the King's concubines in the harem, and the unjust treatment of several subjects. While Anna may have altercations with the King, she comes to revere his intellectual methods of attempting to create Siam a scientific nation in modern times but expresses severe criticism on needless occasions. As a governess, her duties are to instruct the royal children (of which there are more than 67; however, only the eldest participate) and aid the King in composing extraordinary letters to renowned world leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria. Prince Chulalongkorn, Anna's most prominent and smartest pupil, is heir to the throne on account of being the eldest; she attempts to steer him onto the positive path of ruling the country justly. Also bestowing color to Anna's experiences, including misadventures, other than irrelevant talks with the King on that of Moses and ethics is a cast of supporting characters: Tuptim (the slave), Lady Thiang (the King's head wife), Lady Son Klin, and countless others. Across Anna's remembrances, a message is conveyed: despite one's differences they must master the skill of understanding the outsiders and point them to salvation, excluding falsehood by supplanting it with truthfulness. 'Anna and the King of Siam' is a fascinating web of Siam's (now Thailand's) superb past filled with rich descriptions for a journey neither the reader or Anna will let sink into oblivion even until the breaking end. --P.J. Persad"},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"Based on the 'original' books by Leonowens one might expect some editing of that which was dull. The book is not well written. It is actually a tougher read than the original. It lacks pace. It is historically unsound (see first review by teenage student of history). But there are moments when an atmosphere is created which, on reflection, is stolen from the original. I had to force myself to read it as part of a list of books I wish to cover. I think the writer knew nothing of Thailand."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"I found this book online just after seeing a National touring company performing Rodgers and Hammerstein's &quot;The King and I&quot;. The program synopsis indicated that it was based on a true story. As usual, the book far outpaced the musical/movie in its depth and strength of story. The characters are fascinating as is the mysterious setting of distant 1860s in Siam. Though the telling of the King's brutality and his many wives and concubines may not be suitable for reading to small children, the work should hold the interest of anyone 10 years old or more. The prose is easily readable though some words were not familiar."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"Some times ago i wathed movie &#34;Anna and the King&#34;, i really like it. After this i wanted to read book &#34;Anna and the King of Siam&#34;. There isn't such books in my town. So i decided to use the net for this. And found this website and ordered the book. How pleased i was to get it after so short time. about one week, thank you.I enjoy reading this book, i love to find something new which i didn't saw in the film. The plot of this story is thrilling. And the most important that these book and film was based on the real story of the real woman Anna Leonowens. Her fate was particularly unusual and difficult, but she was so brave and intelligent. Anna was able to go through all the difficulties and gave her light to Siam. I regret that i didn't read this book before.I would recommend this book to anyone, who enjoy novels and even those who didn't wathed the film. Because it's one of the best film i've ever seen and one of the best book i've ever read."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"At about the age of 13 I was rummaging one day in the closet and discovered that my mother had belonged to a book club, and here were all the books. The most interesting one was this one, complete with the dust jacket which showed that Anna didn't look anything like Deborah Kerr (nor did Mongkut look anything like Yul Brynner). I was fascinated by the book and read it three times. I saw the movie The King and I three times. I thought that the book was a biography, and that every word was true. Very many years later I discovered that this was an historical novel, that Landon had fiddled with the facts, and that the Thai people (\\"Siamese\\") were highly displeased with both Anna and Margaret. I even found a Thai woman to discuss this with. Well, I still loved the book and the movie. I know that Landon was guilty of Orientalism and made the King seem like an idiot at times, and the movie was even worse in this respect, but I had gotten my pleasure out of them before being let down. I do hope that it really was true that Mongkut had the uppity French ambassador seized by slaves and tossed out of the palace. I later met, or at least saw in person, the boy who played Anna's son in the movie."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"This is a wonderful read - I've read it several times. The descriptions of Siam (Thailand) are very vivid and the characters are well drawn.One word of warning - this isn't really a biography. The author said something like, it was 75% fact and 25% fiction based on fact. Abbot Low Moffat, in his biography Mongkut the King of Siam (which I also heartily recommend), thought that Ms. Landon was a bit generous of her assessment of the veracity. Moffat claims that Anna Leonowens' own books, written to support her family, are exaggerated and include falsehoods.I don't think that I would have liked this as well if I had known what I know now. Still, a classic novel, and one well worth reading with that caveat. Since Siam is now Thailand, it is easier to imagine this as being wholly imaginative and not describing a real place."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"This book tells the story of Anna Leonowen's heroism in a wonderful way. She is an admirable role model for her incredible courage and pursuit of truth and fairness. Margaret Landon tells her story in an interesting and easily readable way. There is nothing boring in this book; I read it from cover to cover without pausing!! You are right there all along with Anna as she finds her way around in a very foreign and often puzzling culture for a woman raised in the British tradition. An excellent book!! I especially recommend it for showing that women can be strong and maintain their femininity!"},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"Thais have been outraged by the lies of Anne Leonowens for decades, since her 'books' were published and the first movie 'The King and I' came out.Leonowens stories were nothing but that, 'stories'. She barely met the King of Siam, as a woman of her stature (a lowly governess) would never have been allowed the access to the King she says she was given. King Mongkut was a highly-educated monarch, who knew more about foreign policy and diplomacy than most people in this era. In fact, Anna Leonowens was no more influential with King Mongkut than I am with Queen Elizabeth. She was just a good fiction writer.That Thais are not featured in the movies (in the latest one, the main actor is Chinese) says a lot about the validity of the information, and that both movies are banned in Thailand, where Thais revere King Mongkut and King Chulalongkorn.Worthless reading if you want to actually learn something about the history of Thailand."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"To call King Mongkut a bloodthirsty tyrant much less a barbarian not only slanders his memory but downright belittles his legacy. As if only Christian western culture has a monopoly on virtue, the book only pictures the king as a lusty womanizer. Never mind the fact that he could have been king at a much earlier age, he chose instead to become a buddhist monk to live a life of poverty and celibacy for more 20 years where he witnessed first hand the suffering of his people and became familiar with western ways. Would our own president or even Gandhi have his restraint we would have elevated them to sainthood instead of being maligned and slandered as Ms Langdon and to much greater extent Mrs. Leonowens had."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"I can only adequately describe this book as dull and downright boring. Historically it needs to be taken with a grain of salt, although I accept that some of it is pertinent. As Jodie Foster's character in the recent remake of this saga posits, \\"England's ways are the ways of the world.\\" Landon, with fervent missionary bent in hand, shouldn't have stayed in Thailand for so long given her contempt for their way of life.Ultimately the books so called historical authenticity is the very thing you question. The idea of underground torture chambers or cellars, granted that Bangkok is at best marshy swamp and 6m above sea level, is ludicrous. And we are talking about the area of ratanakosin, one of Bangkok's lowest points vis-a-via the water. Also, did Landon not bother to look at Siamese history prior to her arrival and reposit the politics of the harem against contemporary Siamese history? Was she so blind to the success of Mongkut, and certainly Chulalongkorn, not to question the integrity of what Leonowens (a reinvented woman, if ever there was one) was writing?The book just drags on about the role of women (a worthy issue nontheless) and the perfidous Siamese. It doesn't offer any insights into why the Siamese are this way, supposedly, and it smacks of neurotic Christo-centric 19th century morality, which bugs the hell out of most people. I can only reiterate that its ugly moralism and at times, often poor narrative, kill what could have otherwise been an interesting read.Save your money and don't get the latest cinematic representation regardless of how well dressed up it might seem."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"I was drawn to Anna and the King of Siam because of the Musical, The King and I. I not only enjoyed reading the book, but I also enjoyed comparing the two works based on the same woman's courage and dedication. Anna Leonowen's life and work in Siam is not only facinating, but an interesting aspect of history as well. The book shares and outlines this story in an interesting and exciting way. Anna had to have great courage and dedication to do what she did in her time. The difference in culture was alluring to her, as well as shocking at times. Throughout her time in Siam, she formed many friendships, and she had many who admired her. She gained a few enemies as well. Anna also had an intriging relationship with the King, which fluctuated on a regular basis. Anna was truly a remarkable woman, as was her story. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"For sheer readibility, it's worth 5 stars. But for its history and biography, I would rate it less than zero. So as a compromise, I'd give it 3 stars. The Siam king Anna Leonowens portrays (Landon's 1944 best-seller is based on Leonowens' original account) looks nothing like the real king Mongkut whom historians study and the Thais revere. The real Mongkut is the closest thing to a philospher-king that modern Asia has produced and his political reform essentially created modern Thailand. He was an accomplished linguist and spoke several European languages including English. He was well-versed in western science and history. From his success in preserving his country's independence in the age of western imperialism by playing off colonial powers against each other, it seems he knew as much about the balance of power as, say Metternich and Palmerston. He laid the basis for the modernisation reform and foreign policy initiatives long before Leonowens set foot in Siam. So it's hard to see how she could possibly play any significant role in these areas as she had claimed. Little wonder that the Thais are upset about Hollywood's latest attempt to remake the King and I starring Jodie Foster and Hong Kong movie star Chow Yun-fat. How the sheer fantasies that made up Leonowens' book - and the historical illiteracy and cultural insensitivity of Landon's - came about warrant a serious interdisciplinary study in 1) psychology of self-delusion; 2) history of Victorian colonial racism; 3) western orientialism that portrays an exotic East of sensuality, barbarity and mystery. Would I let my children read thse books? Yes, of course, 'cause they are entertaining. But I would advise them to read some real history to debunk the egomania and delusion of Leonowens."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"I am 15, so to establish my credibility I must explain that I am currently writing an enormous research paper on the controversy over various written and film versions of Anna and the King of Siam. After roughly three months of extensive background research, I read this book and found it to be almost entirely untrue. I believe that those who claim King Mongkut would not have accomplished what he did without Mrs. Leonowens counsel are disillusioned and clearly have not read much on the subject. He was an extremely enlightened and well-educated monarch with no reason to engage in conversation with an English schoolteacher. Many people actually believe that she met the King only once, or not at all. Despite the glaring errors, however, I have seen both the musical and the newest version with Jodie Foster and enjoyed them immensely. Read this book and see the movies only if you are aware that they are fictional."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"The history of Anna and the King of Siam is as romantic as the story itself. Author Margaret Landon found what may have been the only copy of Anna' book, The English Governess at the Siamese court while she was a missionary in Thailand. Later, she located the Romance of the Harem in a second-hand bookstore in Chicago. She paid a $1 for the book, which turned out to be a fine investment. Landon combined the two books and added fictional elements to create a skillfully written novel.The exotic setting and romantic story so impressed the wives of both Rogers and Hammerstein that they convinced their husbands to write a musical based on the book. And thus we get the musical The King and I, plus several movies, most recently one with Jodie Foster.Landon wrote other novels (Never Dies the Dream) based on her missionary experience but never achieved the same greatness as in Anna and the King of Siam. This is a well structured novel, with a lot of drama. The death scene of the Fa-ying is incredibly touching. Anna is believable; sometimes annoyingly persistent, other times selfless and very very brave.The actual writins of Anna Leonowens are also available. It's fun to read Landon's book and then the source material she used. You may agree with me that Landon's skill as a novelist took Anna's story and made it unforgettable."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago, and returned to the commemorative edition as an exercise in nostalgia and to revisit history as it is written, remembered, and transmitted. The gist of this review is simple: we make into saints those people into whose stories we can inject our own preferences, dreams, and agendas... and we callously portray those who are more difficult to understand. Even so, the result can be lyrical, touching, and even valuable, if understood for what it really is -- a hagiography.This book deserves 4 stars because it gives thinking people a chance to take a peek at how an anti-colonial American missionary would evaluate the role of a British Colonial expat in a culture which threatened and resisted them both -- gracefully. Even while trying with the best of motives to tell the truth, it is difficult for an author to hide her baggage when describing a world to which she can never belong.When Mrs. Landon writes Anna's &quot;innermost thoughts,&quot; for example, the latter include anti-colonial rhetoric that is a standard theme of American internationalism, but a passing rarity among British expats! These thoughts also model some of the missionary fervor of Landon's own Thai agenda.No author ever lets us see the world as it is -- just their best perception. Here we have the odd experience of peering at the unfamilar via the eyes of a foreigner who is guessing (poetically) at the views of a stranger."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"Many months of living and learning about the wonderful people in Thailand made me appreciate Anna and the King of Siam even more. This book provides many realistic details about the Thai culture during the 19th century. I read Anna and the King of Siam after reading Anna and the King. I found the contrast between the two books facinating. Although I enjoyed reading both books equally (for differenct reasons), Anna and the King of Siam provides more realistic version of interactions between an unkown foreign English teacher and a powerful king. The people of Thiland truly love and respect their king for many good reasons. Understanding this, however, one can understand how both movies regarding the story of Anna Leonowens (The King and I &amp; Anna and the King) are currently banned in Thiland."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"I really liked this book because it was really exciting. I also liked how it taught you about different traditions and religious beliefs. I have never read another book that took place in Siam, so that was really interesting. I liked how when after someone said something in the language that people in Siam speak, they would also print in English what they were saying. Anna the main character's, bravery and courage was great. I admire how she could stand up to a king without being scared.The story is about a widowed school teacher from England who travels to Siam to teach the king's son and Prince Chuklalonkorn along with his many brothers and sisters. The king's many children are eager to start their lessons, as is Anna, but little did they know that they would become more like friends than like a school teacher and her young pupils. In the beginning Anna and the king are always bickering and disagreeing with each other, but they too, soon become friends.I think that anyone who is interested in adventure should read this book. This book is for someone who loves to learn new things such as languages, religions and or monks because one of the Ladies in the palace is in love with a monk named Balat. The king also travels to different places for business and sometimes has dinner parties that involve people from different places. If I could be in Anna's place that would be great.I think that is a great adventure!"},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"This is truly a tale of the power of one life. Anna Leonowens remarkable story reminds us that truth and compassion are the most powerful weapons against oppression, tyranny and fear. Anna's boldness and confidence in the face of King Mongkut's absolute power over life and death was rooted in her faith. This faith also inspired her to endless acts of selfless compassion towards the oppressed of Siam. Her relationship with Prince Chulalongkorn, the love and understanding they shared, is touching. It is significant that later in his life (after reigning over Siam for 29 years) he ascribed to Anna the credit for imparting to him the principles he needed to know in order to transform his country."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"In this age of post-modern political correctness it is easy to rewrite history using emotion in place of the facts. This book tells a story that not everyone wants to hear, now that the influence of Western thought and culture on the East is seen more as oppressive aggrandizement rather than the educational enlightenment it truly was.That the 19th century ruler chose a woman to educate himself and his children (and therefore, his country) shows clearly that Mongkut's political motivations were to gain knowledge without being dominated by a western pedagogue. Mongkut realized that, to enter the modern age, he needed to tap into elements of the west's (in some ways more advanced) culture, and do it without making himself vulnerable to the sometimes heavy-handed white male missionaries who were clamoring to &quot;enlighten&quot; any non-Christian regions of the Earth. In any event, it is clear that Mongkut could not have achieved as much as he did without the help of Leonowens, and the hand wringers who would deny her any credit at all do great disservice to the memories of both historic figures. It is also interesting to note that those who doubt the veracity of Leonowens' story have motivations that stem most distinctly from the fact that she was a woman."},{"Title":"Anna and the King of Siam","review":"Anna and the King of Siam and the musical The King and I, are about as different at apple and oranges. Anna and the King of Siam is one woman's experience in 19th century Thailand. It deals with the issue of the day: Slavery. Anna has a big heart and is always buying people out of slavery. She is in conflict with the King who has never met a woman with an opinion or view on anything, although he has about 2,000 in his harem. A very excellent read!"},{"Title":"Meant to Be (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Kim, Book 2)","review":"Kim, the main character has a lot on her plate to deal with, but I'm impressed at her maturity. I also liked the fact that she sees her own mistakes, the cute little quirks about writing her column, and I was quite surprised by the twist near the end. I wasn't expecting that so soon, but it made me cry. I think this book would be a good book for any teen because it shows teens being teens, and their (human side)--that we are all capable of making mistakes, but we learn from them. Kim is a good role model. I'm forty-nine years old, and I enjoyed this book so much, I ordered the other two."},{"Title":"Meant to Be (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Kim, Book 2)","review":"Kim Peterson doesn't know what to pray for. Should she be praying that her mom is healed of the cancer invading her body? Should she be praying for her best friend Natalie -- who has suddenly dropped off the deep end? Should she be praying for her boyfriend Matthew to become a Christian? Or should she focus on the piles of letters from the teenagers in her town dealing with their own problems? It's overwhelming. Kim feels more stressed out than ever before, and it's only a matter of time until everything caves in. Where will she turn then?Melody Carlson continues her long-standing DIARY OF A TEENAGE GIRL series with MEANT TO BE, the second book following the life of Kim Peterson. The story continues right after the last few pages of JUST ASK, as Kim tries to deal with her mom's cancer and the other fifty problems that seem to plague her life. Carlson weaves the plotlines together well, mixing in her signature emotional punch that will leave readers thinking about family and friend relationships in their own lives.Kim is definitely a well-defined character dealing with very different struggles from Caitlin or Chloe, the previous two girls spearheading the series. Both characters make cameo appearances here, but Kim is very much the center of the story. The tension of trying to live a \\"normal\\" life while wondering if she's ever going to see her mother again fills every page. Kim has a journey to travel, and it takes her to some dark places where she must find hope in the only place she can: God.For fans of previous entries in the series, MEANT TO BE is another welcome addition. New readers would be fine to jump in with Kim's story, but really should go back to JUST ASK in order to follow the details. And Kim's journey is far from over. The last pages leave the story open, and readers will be grabbing for the next installment."},{"Title":"Meant to Be (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Kim, Book 2)","review":"This, so far is one of my favorite books. I highly suggest you read it. This book is part of a series but at the time, I didn't know it so I ended up reading w/out the other three books. It was still absolutley WONDERFUL!!!"},{"Title":"Meant to Be (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Kim, Book 2)","review":"I thought that this book was great! Infact I thought that as a Christian book it was the best that I have ever read! Kim is just like a normal teenager. She faces the same exact problems and everything! THis book was very emotional and was very well written!

She is a Christian and putting her faith in God to help her for each and every problem. Her friend Nat is always telling her to be careful because Kim is dating a non-Christian boy and Nat thinks this relationship will pull her away from God. Later on, Nat seems to have ignored her own \\"Be Careful\\" advice when she starts dating a Christian boy, Benjamin (Caitlin O' Conner's little brother). Not only that but Kim's mom (the one who adopted her) has stage four ovarian cancer which is terminal. Kim is praying very hard for her mother but so are a lot of other people who are close to her or not. Will Kim's mom hang in there? Will Nat get into something beyond her control?I like how this book has action every turn of the way and it was interesting. I did happen to dislike how the ending turned out because it was not what I expected. I also disliked how Nat's situation turned out.I really liked this book and I wanted to keep reading more and more. This is the second book of the series but I haven't read the first book yet. I can't wait until the other books come out. This book just introduces Christianity.Girls involved in a related religion will probably enjoy it best because it talks about Christian faith inside of others but anyone could read it, religious or not."},{"Title":"Meant to Be (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Kim, Book 2)","review":"Wow. I just finished reading this book, and it was so awesome. If you thought the first book, Just Ask, was good, then you've got to read this. Just when you thought Melody Carlson wrote fantasicly in the first Kim book, you'll think she outdid herself with \\"MeToant Be\\". It made me laugh, cry, and feel anxious. It feels like you're really there, experiancing every moment with Kim and her friends and family. I've never really read a book that made me this emotional, so that's really saying something. If you want a good read, then you're not wasting your time with this book!"},{"Title":"A History of the End of the World (An Invisible Book)","review":"An entertaining and informative history of the idea of the &quot;End of the World&quot; and how various conceptions of &quot;the end&quot; influenced the course of history.This book includes more than a few surprising facts about well known historical events and people and their connections to the apocalyptic that aren't usually mentioned.Throughout the book the authors' wit and sense of irony comes through. This is a fun book."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"As a first time Michener reader I have nothing to compare Texas to, but as a collector of \\"anything Texas,\\" I am amazed. While America's current affair with memoirs grows, this is an excellent work of fiction to enjoy between diary pillaging. Texas reads with the believability of several family histories inter-connected with each other through Michener's \\"Texas history.\\" The novel is so masterfully prepared that I found myself repeatedly glancing back at the \\"Fact and Fiction\\" section near the introduction making sure I had not fooled myself into believing Michener's Texas is fully real. I first purchased Texas in 1989 and kept putting off reading the 1300+ page book for shorter books and personal projects. I finished reading the novel in less time than I expected and as soon as my second copy arrives ( nearly destroyed my nine year old copy through wear and notes) I plan on reading it again. Note Michener's use of quotations throughout the text as he presents the story through the voice of Dr. Travis Barlow and the individual voices of the well developed Texans. Every section brings one closer, focusing not only on the entity of the Texas spirit, but also humanity and interconnections between all people and all histories."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I wish the book were longer as I was disappointed when it was over. Michener paints a fine portrait of a complex and powerful state story. Michener moved to Austin, Texas while writing the book (~1985) and made it his home from then until his death (1997). Clearly Michener fell in love with his adopted state just as millions before him did.My regret is that I didn't read this book during the seven years we lived in Austin. It is time to plan a visit!"},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I checked this out from my school library after enjoying The Covenant and Hawaii, which have plenty of questionably racist material in them on their own, but this was just abominable. Within 20 pages one of the characters (in present-day Texas) is talking about the \\"barbaric Indians\\" \\"In our wisdom, we exterminated them\\" (verbatim quote). I got over halfway through it and every chapter was just another description of another generation's holocaust of Indians. First it talks about how the Spaniards came (Texas originally being part of Mexico) and killed some Indians. Then it describes families moving from Germany killing Indians. Then it describes families from Scotland, making a pit-stop in Ireland (Scots-Irish Americans) and coming to Texas to kill Indians. Then it talks about families from Illinois and Kentucky moving south... to kill Indians. 500 pages in but only halfway done, I'd had enough of this garbage. Michener's worst."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Another great James Michner epic. This is really long for a paperback (1322 pages). His great stories are strung toegther with a device called \\"The Task Force.\\" This was a fictitous committee of leading Texans currently studying the history and future of Texas for the Govenor. I appreciated the thoroughness of his coverage of the Alamo. Having grown up on Walt Disney's version of the Alamo, I believed that Santa Ana was evil and the Alamo people were really kind, innocent people. Well the facts bare out that Santa Ana was strongly anti-slavery and the Alamo people were strongly in favor of slavery. I guess Santa Ana had enough racisim with Spain. The Alamo fighters on the other hand were people who supported and fought for the institution of slavery. It was ironic that some Texans might say today Mexican, \\"go home.\\" The Mexican was there 300 years before the American. At least they were not exterminated like the Native Americans. Despite its early intolorence, it has gone on to be a really unique state(which is probably why Micnener chose it for his novel)."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"If you can speed read and spot the jewels and love Texas, this book will work for you."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"This book was a great epic up to a point. It was interesting and highly informative, especially for Texans with an interest in Texas history. Then the wildcatting section ended. At this point the book became slow, boring, and predictable. Michener ran out of story or the deadline was coming up very soon, as it just took a serious nose dive after the 1920's. The modern Texas is far more appealing than Michener made it out to be, and as a result, I was very disappointed with the storytelling. The last 200 or so pages were just not worth it. Otherwise, the book was excellent. Too bad he ran out of steam.I also have a small beef with his education comments about Texas. I would like to point out that the state schools are the ones with the poor education reputations, not the private ones. I am a graduate of Trinity University in San Antonio, and for the seven years prior to my graduation, it was voted as best buy for the money by U.S. News and World Report. S! adly, when I graduated, it dropped all the way to number two. How about them apples, Michener!"},{"Title":"Texas","review":"An enjoyable book but don't bother reading the last two chapters. I don't know what the author was thinking. Maybe he had seen too many episodes of 'Dallas'! Ransom Rusk was a little too 'JRish' for my liking.Apart from that glitch the rest of the book is a great read. Some of it extremely hard to come to terms with from all sides, Mexican, Anglo/German, Black and Native American. But nevertheless very worthwhile if you have the time to read it."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Michener can get run off on some the most boring, technical details that have no place in a well-written novel, but Texascertainly educated me about that unusual state. I was entertained more than not, but great characters and plot were sporadic. I can't help comparing him to Clavell and Jennings, and that's not fair to the guy. I will read his other work, but I'm going to hold off for a bit. I think Michener will appreciate this, though. I turned the last page much wiser than when I opened the cover. Enlightening."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"James A. Michener manages to educate you a little while also creating interesting enough stories around the State of Texas United States of America. He covers the natives, the influence of Mexicans in the area, and more modern issues like the obsessions with oil and gridiron. Pretty interesting book, in general.Got to be a lot of research in something this long. This is a pretty cool trick to pull enough. I wonder how many library chairs he wore out back then while working on it."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I have a goal to try to read all of Michener's books. Three of the best so far are Centennial, Chesapeake and Hawaii. Have not completed Texas yet."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Author James A. Michener has conceived and written an epic novel about the state we now know as Texas. Using his characteristic writing style of starting at the very beginning (in this case, with Coronado looking for the 7 cities of Cibola) and then developing the story generation after generation through his many rich and interesting characters. Michener tells the complete story of Texas, from its beginnings to the present. The reader learns how Texas was first \\"settled\\" by Spanish priests who came to bring salvation to the natives, what animals first roamed its lands (He devotes part of a chapter to the amradillo and it is very interesting reading!), what the native \\"Indians\\" were like and how they survivied in this sometimes harsh environment, how the Americans took the land from Mexico in the Spanish-American war, the Alamo and what really happened there, how the discovery of oil changed the state from a huge open-range cattle pasture to an economic giant, and finally, it tells the story of the multi-ethnic people of Texas, and this perhaps is Michener's strength in story-telling.Yes, the novel is a long one - over 1,000 pages, but it is still an absorbing page-turner. Each chapter is a mini-novel in itself and tells the story of a particular generation of people in Texas' development. Michener has a knack of creating and developing characters that are both interesting and believable and this is his greatest strength as a writer. The reader comes to care about these fictious charcters as though they are living breathing realities, and in a sense, the charcters are \\"real\\", as Michener's painstaking research enabled him to form his charcters based on historical personages.\\"Texas\\" is a marvelous book, and for those that are into long sweeping novels, this is a book for you. It seems that Michener's writing style either fascinates or tries the patience of his readers. Michener goes into great detail in explaining the lives of his characters and some readers are impatient with his extensive prose and are apt to put his books down before finishing them. I happen to love his writing style and appreciate the detail, as it paints vivid word pictures in my mind. Michener is one of my favorite authors, for each of his books takes me to a particular place or culture, and it is as though I am actually viewing that culture, its people, and the land first-hand. I have learned a wealth of information about near and distant lands thanks to the writing of James A. Michener. These are places I may never visit in my life, but thanks to Michener, it is as though I have been there through his writing.I most certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the land and people of Texas, or any student of historical fiction. (the book makes compelling reading even if you have no interest in historical novels). Once you read Michener's \\"Texas\\", you will have a tremendous appreciation for the hardships that the first settlers endured to \\"tame\\" this great land. Like me, I believe you will always remember Michener's \\"Texas\\" for the rest of your life.I highly recommend this book; it may be one of Michener's best novels.Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I have read most of Michener's work, and I rate Texas among the big three, not only in size but in quality. (The other two are Centennial and Chesapeake). I particularly like the way Michener presents the entire history of Texas, and yet focuses on the key aspects of change that make this region so interesting. We see how cotton, cattle, oil, barbed wire, football, etc have changed the very culture of the people of Texas. Each long chapter is another window from which we can see the evolution of the landscape and the people. We see the hearty characters that made Texas what it is today and examine the very heart of the issues which shape the modern day Texan. For all of this, it is a novel, with the sweeping epic qualities of Gone With the Wind or Michener's other great works. Don't let the size stop you. The novel is as big as the state itself, and worth every minute of the ride."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"This has to be one of James Michener's greatest achievements. If this isn't his best book, it is one of his best. At 1322 pages you would think that would be enough, but with all of the topics JM touches I actually found myself wanting more.Mercifully this one does not start with the formation of the earth's crust. Instead, JM jumps into the action and begins a saga that lasts almost 500 years. From the Indians, to the Spanish Friars, to the Alamo, gunslingers, frontiersmen, immigrants, cattleman, entrepreneurs, Texas Rangers, real estate barons, King Cotton, oil men, and football. This only scratches the surface.JM follows the lives of several families from their immigration to Texas and the lives they cut out for themselves while there. Beyond fascinating. I highly recommend this book. Don't let the size of it scare you off because if is a fast read."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"James Michener writes another of his super famous world renowned mega one word title novels that take a geographic area and tell the whole story with intertwining familys. From the inital journey into texas to the founding of Bejar (San Antonio) to the horror of Comanche Indian raids, to the fasinating detail of commerical real estate development! I have never read a Michener book I didn't consider a treasure, and this one is no exception.For anyone who is afraid of reading a James Michener historical fiction novel....Just because the books are long and you might think it will be a boring history novel, it is not! The books are fascinating, trust me I have read almost a dozen of them so far and they have all resonated with me, Hawaii, Chesapeake, Centennial, The Source, Poland, The Drifters, Caribbean, Alaska, TEXAS! I love them all so much! And I wish nothing more than for all those reading this to pick up a James Michener novel now!! Start with Hawaii!"},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Michener's books are long and all of us who are fans know this, but this one is probably the longest one. It does get a bit tedious at times, but the book is very good and it's worth persevering with it. I don't know what our reader from Denmark was thinking, but the book is certainly not dreadful. I found the history of this state totally fascinating, and it felt like I was there when Texas was just coming into being I felt like one of those intrepid settlers that were responsible for making Texas a state. I would like to visit this state sometime because it has a great history. The story was good and the characters strong. I especially liked the story about the Alamo. This almost mythic battle comes alive in the book. America you have a lot to be proud of in this state."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"only very few sellers mention that they are pricing one volume only in the hardback version and the customer is astonished when he receives only volume one in the mail although he believed to have bought the whole book/vols 1$2. paperback is in one volume."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I'm actually surprised by some of the negative responses of the previous reviewers. Their opinions are certainly valid, and I wouldn't quibble with them, but I thought &quot;Texas&quot; was Michener's best fiction (&quot;Iberia&quot; is his best book) that I've ever read.The history of the state was fascinating and well-balanced. The characters were more likable than in most of his books (except maybe &quot;Chesapeake&quot;). The book certainly is long even by Michenerian standards, but it never became tedious in the way &quot;Alaska&quot; did.I think anyone who reads this book will be delighted by the magnificent effort Michener must have put into writing this. It's fun; it's fascinating; it's beautiful."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Texas is like the Texas it describes, large, diverse, bold and beautiful. Michener has developed a masterpiece that might take the average reader awhile to &quot;get into.&quot; (I delved into its 1000+ pages once a year ago and put it down, only to recently pick it up again) But, Texas is well worth the time and the effort. Texas traces the history of the state from its beginnings as a Mexico territory through its short stay as a independent state into its annexation into the United States, role in the civil war and beyond. Michener saturates the book with interesting people and places, puts you at the Alamo, San Jacinto and the battle of Vicksburg... you follow a cattle drive, live through a hurricane and do battle with Indians. His characters experience all the best and the worst that Texan history has to offer and see famous Texas patriots (Sam Houston, Davy Crockett) and infamous vilians (Santa Anna, Benito Garza, the Comanche Indians) at work and play. However, the best part of the book is its description of the &quot;culture&quot; of Texas, the way the reader is shown the influence of Spanish, Mexican, French,and German settlers, the influx of adverturers from Kentucky and Tennessee mixing with northern merchants, southern cotton growers and, of course, the various Indian tribes that occupied Texas. You learn to appreciate the diversity and the psyche that made Texas the place it is today. It is a delightful, adventuresome, wonderful book-- by the end, you may want to move there yourself."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"This book is among my favourites. I have read most or many of his books twice and always find them to be entertaining and educational. I keep a copy of Hawaii, Alaska, and Texas near at hand. This is a nice 1000 page historical novel that gives a very detailed picture of the evolution of the great state of Texas, now one of the most dynamic states in the USA.Michener's books use a common plot formula that starts out by telling a story that in some way reflects and utilizes accurately the actual or known historical developments and time lines and people of a region. In the present case it is about a group of people that came up from Mexico to settle in what is now Texas. It progresses through the development of the region adding in settlers, farmers, outlaws, lawmen, business people, adding in more characters and phasing out as time moves forward up to current times.When I decided to review this book I was not certain if people were still interested in buying this book but I was pleased to see that there is still interest at Amazon.com in buying and reading this great story but perhaps not quite as popular as some of his other works."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Michener's vast novel about the men and women who have lived in the Lone Star state (or the land that would one day become it) over the last almost 500 years is a heavy, thorough reading experience.

From the first days of the Spanish explorers, through the era of foreign domination, the missionaries, the Indians, the coming of the whites and the war for Texican independence, the days of the cowboys and cattle barons, the discovery of oil, the 20th century boom all the way to the state's 150th anniversary in 1986.

But when finished, you will have a good grasp on Texas history and see how everything in its past formed the State and its people. And unlike many Texas history books--especially those written in the past--the role of the group who really built the State from the very beginning--the Mexicans-- is presented to the reader."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"It takes a \\"Giant\\" book to account for most of the history of Texas, but James Michener has done it before and he did it again with his epic known simply as \\"Texas\\". It needs no more to enhance it's title.It starts off with a gathering of present day movers and shakers of Texas, all of whom, including the author himself, are decendents of Texans that go back to the Alamo and beyond. Each has his own private thoughts about the writing of this history. A diverse gathering, they represented a broad and very proud spectrum of heritage; of the cultures that made up the fabric of the people who claim the land as theirs, or the \\"other way around\\". They wished to make certain they had the \\"right man\\" for the sacred job of writing up the History in novel form. His own initial and private observations of the tone of this meeting and of the people who represented the \\"best of the State\\" are as good as the rest of the book.The chapter dedicated to The Alamo is breathtaking. The passions, mixed ideals, confusion about loyalties, all of these emotions are somehow projected to the reader through Michener's translations. The Alamo...\\"you can look in vain for crosses, and you'll never see a one; but sometime between the setting and the rising of the sun...\\" (ballad of the Alamo)I have always found reading about the Lone Star State fascinating and intensely beautiful - from the original Southwest Campfire ballads, the sand and cactus, the vast open, untamed loneliness; to the mystery and aura surrounding the Old Spanish Missions. (I had not realized that San Juan Capistrano began it's life as one of five missions along the river in San Antonio, being moved to California much later.) Determined people squared off at each other at every turn; from the dedicated (and not so dedicated) friars who were determined to bring the \\"truth\\" to the Apache, to the equally determined Apache who thought his own beliefs and cultures were just fine the way they were. Things like this always remind me of the astute observation of someone else - a voice still powerful from another intense struggle of long ago:***\\"Most men and religions feel themselves possessed of all of the Truth\\"** - Benjamin Frankin - from his speech during the Debate of the Constitution -It's all a reader could expect from a novel of this magnitude - and more - because it instantly assigns faces with the facts and figures, the breath of life into ancient words and signatures on paper that somehow survived as the only proof they had been there. We need flesh and blood reminders of our past; a faded memory can leap off the page and be made vibrantly whole again with the right words. Michener sees that we get it. Impeccably researched, it has the touch of the master in it's telling - if you are interested in the history of Texas and want to read only one book on the subject, this surely should be it.It's a \\"time undertaking\\" to absorb this book, but it's worth every minute spent on it - a truly vibrant history of the Territories before and after they became States. As a Wyomingite who read \\"Centennial\\" as well, I'm certain Texans can find their own \\"holes in the story\\" but someone has to write of it and fan the flame for future generations. Michener excelled at the impossible task, in my view."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"TEXAS is all about the history and the type of people that moved to this state, from Europe and from other States.

Yes, it's formulaic but it's a formula that works. Some of it is so accurate it hurts. The part where the two friends go together on a hunting ranch and wind up enemies is way, way too close to home.I won't try to synopsize what is a long and fascinating novel but I learned [I think I learned] things I hadn't known before. Did you know that the Texas longhorn became extinct in Texas and had to be reintroduced from some remnant herds in Mexico? No? I didn't either. It might not even be true but if the reader THINKS he was learned something new, he'll probably be interested. Did you know that only the longhorn steer gets really long horns? Me neither. As a matter of fact, it really isn't true but it's a fascinating falsehood.Hey, Michener, at his best, can really write, twisiting fact and fiction into a tale worth reading.

It was written by Michener, so is, as one would expect, very long. It is a slightly different format than others of his novels, though. It flips back and forth between the current day and stories of history. Current day has folks from a representative set of backgrounds. The history story takes each of those people and frames historical tales around their ancestors.

The attention to historical detail and the clear distinction between fact and fiction are meticulous, which was the author's trademark judging from other books.Regarding the fictional component,it appears that in pursuit of packing in the large history, the story became very long, too long in my opinion. I would have preferred fewer characters in a more compact story. Not surprisingly, the sheer number of characters made it hard to develop them evenly. Some of them simply disappear, or surface much later in the book in a one sentence update.I recommend this book for readers that view books as an opportunity personal development as well as entertainment - readers that prefer entertainment only will likely find the length too daunting. I am in the former group and I felt very productive as a reader, learning basic Texas history while relaxing with a nice story."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I vividly remember when Mr. Michener was in Texas researching this book and the interview he gave to a local magazine. We had moved to the Dallas area from a lifetime in Denver and Boulder, Colorado to spend 3 years there on business. I couldn't wait for the book to come out. I wanted to know if he was going to tell the truth or tame it down. When we first moved to Texas I felt like I needed a U.S. Embassy there.Michener gloriously blends his history with colorful story telling to give you a lesson in history that you will savor and leave you wanting more. Make no mistake, the state of Texas has a huge impact on the rest or the United States. When he wrote Texas, he wrote more of the real Texas history than fiction. He also wrote the truth. When you finish this book you realize that Texas has unlimited potential, but changes very slowly because it is a huge landscape. You completely understand the Texas state of mind, the bigger than life people that live there, the courage of it's minorities who have lived there longer than anyone else and the courage of those who fought for it.As a surprise, he gives you a whole new respect for the Armadillo and it's contribution to the cure for leprosy!

No one can tell a story better than James A Michener and TEXAS is just one more in a long line of this writer's BEST SELLERS.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Another strong multi-generational effort by Michener, capturing the essence of Texas through the eyes of the people who settled it. The very best part of the book traced the life of Otto McNab, the central character, as the events and the nature of his home shaped his thoughts, feelings and his life. This is Michener at his best. I thought the book got a bit boring towards the end, a little drawn out and dry as it entered the modern era, which is why I rate it 8 and not 10."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I cannot exaggerate the value of Michener's historical depictions in his novel, Texas. I really wish we had been assigned this book in junior high or high school to give us students a better picture of Texas history. It is a truly incredibly work of historical fiction. I fell in love with some of the characters and their story lines, and just when I felt the plot was getting a little bit stale, Michener throws in a bit of romance.Michener very deliberately and methodically weaves these story lines together to achieve an amazing work of literature...until you reach the last part of the book. Toward the end, Michener seems to become bored, and he rushes through it until it's a bit of a mess. I personally believe that he forgot some major aspects of history that greatly affected Texas, such as the Great Depression and the Spanish-American War. He didn't really say anything about WWI and WWII either. In my opinion, the book just fell apart.Even so, I highly recommend this novel to anyone who wishes to gain a better understanding of American history or just to whomever wishes to read something touching and beautiful."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I have read most of Michener's works and this rates up with the best of them. The characters are so interesting (ex. Otto McNabb, Benito Garza, General Quimper) and it is amazing how Michener can blend them with the historical personalities so convincingly. I found myself checking the fact section constantly to ensure myself as to who was real.So many part of the book were so vivid that I felt I was there (ex. the Plaza in Saltillo where the young people walk in circles with their chaperones).I was happy that Michener did not overplay the action at the Alamo. I have read so many books that have hundreds of pages devoted to describing the action. Michener gave just enough detail that I could picture the battle as it unfolded and the events surrounding it (ex. Bonham riding around Texas trying to get support for the doomed men).The battles of Goliad and San Jacinto were perfectly depicted. Many philisophical problems were brought to light during the book (eg. Mexican and Catholic culture vs. Anglo/non-Catholic) in very interesting ways that made this book hard to put down. The book was over 1300 pages yet from the start the reader is never daunted by the size as it never gets boring. Well worth getting this one if you see one in good condition at a garage sale."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Simply a fantastic read. Michener's realistic fiction, describing the trials of multiple families over many generations, was beautifully written. I thought I would get bored reading a 1600 page novel...I was wrong."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"In \\"Texas,\\" Michener's storytelling greatness delivers five centuries of colorful, bold and adventurous characters, who settle and build \\"the biggest state in the Union . . . without Eskimos,\\" best known for its cowboy ranches, oil and football.To appreciate the author's work is to absorb the tremendous breadth and continuity of his entertaining historical coverage across vast expanses of time, without demanding character development at the deeper level typical of great works of literature. Though a single, unifying literary theme may be absent from the thousand-plus pages of \\"Texas,\\" a number of notable observations on human nature and society come sprinkled throughout the story:1. Greed: Coronado and other Spanish explorers' crazed pursuit of the fabled Seven Cities of Gold north of the Rio Grande during the 16th century is an example of how boundless greed often entices people to delude themselves into foolishly chasing illusory riches, even though the evidence of their existence may be only sketchy at best.2. Indians Against Indians: Though bloody and unforgiving battle between white settlers and Indians persists in the relentless movement of American settlers westward into Indian territory during the 18th and 19th centuries, it is important to realize too that the individual Indian tribes, each by itself a separate nation, often showed as much animosity towards one another as they did towards the white intruders.3. Prejudice: The prejudices of early Spanish colonizers of northern Mexico regarding social hierarchy--considering Spaniards born in Spain a privileged class compared to, in order of declining social rank, settlers who were Spanish by blood but born outside of Spain, mestizos of mixed Spanish and Indian blood, and Indians--illustrate just how pervasive discrimination based on birthplace and a person's physical features has been throughout history.4. Culture and Demographics: Aside from the Anglo settlers' climactic victory over Mexico's General Santa Anna at San Jacinto, Texas, in 1836, two significant reasons why the land on which the state of Texas now sits became part of the United States instead of Mexico are: a) Settlement patterns: Anglos, with more individualistic values, were better suited by culture to the expansive open land of Texas than the Spaniards who preferred to cluster together in tight communities reminiscent of Old World Spain; and b) Demographics: More American settlers from the north ventured into Texas in the 1800s than did either Spaniards or Mexicans, leading to Anglo dominance based simply on their becoming a majority of inhabitants in the region.5. Freedom: The unique past of Texas as a free nation, the Republic of Texas, for nine years prior to becoming a state in 1845, provides an historical basis for the sense of freedom that prevails moreso in Texas today than in any of our other 49 American states.6. South-North Economic Difference: Even without the Civil War that ended slavery and brought the South into the Union, the Southern states in the 19th century, having a concentrated, less resilient economy reliant on a single industry (cotton, susceptible to the ravenous boll weevil), would inevitably over the decades ahead have lost economic power and political control to the Northern states, which benefited from the strengths inherent in their more diversified, self-sustaining economy.7. Hispanic Future: Shifting demographics--with Mexicans attracted by economic opportunities north of the U.S.-Mexico border, and Spanish-speaking immigrants having a higher birthrate than the Anglo-American population--are gradually transforming the southern part of Texas into an ipso facto Hispanic state, and resulting ethnic tensions relating to bilingualism, dominant culture and national identity will likely become increasingly volatile in the future.\\"Texas,\\" the book, succeeds in its portrayal of Texas, the state, as a place where, at least historically, risk-taking and justice have been intertwined like nowhere else. As Michener's Longhorn cattle drover, R.J. Poteet, puts it, \\"If Texas is bountiful in rewarding gamblers, it's remorseless in punishing those who stumble.\\" Perhaps this explains why almost all of the primary characters in \\"Texas\\" succumb to vengeful deaths by enemy gunshot or other violent means; in fact, only earless Emma Larkin with the wooden nose lives long enough to die by natural causes (heart attack), a refreshingly generous way for Michener to end her eventful life marred by years of cruel and inhuman treatment as a young child in the captivity of brutal Comanche Indians."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this one. I spent a short time in Houston, Texas before reading the book, so it kind of felt like I was learning more about somewhere I've been. Almost like reading a book about something that takes place in your hometown. It's a kind of a rush reading and recognizing places you've been or grew up. A very informative book and very interesting.While in Houston, I experience a lot of predujice against Mexicans. Many derogative terms were used to describe Mexican people. When will people ever learn that it is human nature to try and rise above their station in life and to struggle for survival for themselves and their families. To want something better for their children?"},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Texas is a land of extremes that inspires pretty strong reactions. This means that any book about it that wants to be credible must walk the line between blind, gushing adoration of all things Texan (right or wrong) and mean-spirited bashing of cherished icons and legends of a very friendly people. Neither extreme of portrayal is really fair, when you get down to it.Michener, as usual, finds that midpoint. In this novel he includes the many peoples that have lived in Texas, viewing the legends and stories with a receptive and forensic eye. Each new wind of history that has blown over Texas is recorded and its impact portrayed. In the end, ultimately, we see how Texas came to be Texas, with all that that entails today. I'd say it's fitting that this is a pretty large book.Enthusiastically recommended to fans of Michener, those interested in Texas, or anyone who enjoys the genre of 'faction' (fiction closely paralleling history)."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"It is true, that Texans think Texas is different. And so it is. Michener not only does a great job of detailing the histories that shaped the great state of Texas, he also demonstrates how the people drawn to Texas consistently faced amazing challenges, only to overcome them in spectacular ways.While this is an interesting read for anyone, but is a must-read for the proud Texan."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"I think this is Michener's longest and consequently one of his best that I have read. Michener uses his typical formula shows the historical development of Texas from the 16th century to present (1980). What makes this work is that he shows the evolution through the eyes of different families (with varying ethnicity's) throughout different generations. You get to see the Texan perspective from differing points of view. Warning, it's a very long read, but looking back well worth it."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"Michener has a great way to recount history in story-like prose. I learned a lot about Texas; what a neat story about how this state came to be. Michener tells it like he thought it was; the good and the bad. This book should be mandatory reading throughout high schools in Texas.The book is long and a bit slow to read. But it is one of those things you invest time on and it really gives you a lot of return.I would recommend it and look forward to reading it again some day."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"A very good book, overall. I have loved Michener's works since being enthralled by Centennial at 13 years of age. He had a way of making you feel you know the characters intimately by the time you are through with the book. His masterful placing of fictional characters in the middle of historic events is amazing and the history lessons abound in this work. The reader does pay a price however. The book is long and at times I felt the desire to skip ahead a few pages, feeling that I would not miss much of the story and could save myself considerable time. It took me over 6 months to read this book. Time defintely not wasted but I may have been tempted to cheat a little and look ahead if I weren't so enamored with Mr. Michener's writing style! A good book but not quite comparable to Centennial"},{"Title":"Texas","review":"As a transplant from California to Texas, we have found that the culture and the pride in this state are unprecedented and wanted to understand why and how it came about. My husband began reading the Lone Star which is a historical factual book--even longer than Texas. But my book was obviously the most exciting as I finished mine about three weeks ago and he is still struggling with his. Both books give clear examples, stories, and amazing facts about Texas and although it took me 62 years and my husband 70 years, we got here as fast as we could! Texans are a different breed and in order to understand this, you just have to live here, get to know these wonderful people and then read the history."},{"Title":"Texas","review":"First... This book is LONG at nearly 1400 pages of tiny print and single spacing. I am not a fast reader (average) so it took me forever. That being said, it is a great history lesson woven into a story starting with Spain's conquest of Mexico, the Church's move north and ending up in the 1980's. It touches on all sorts of things from the Indian wars, to slavery to the fight to properly present TX history. Lots of neat tidbits about things from oil wells to armadillos.if you have an interest in TX, get it and read it. This book solidified my resolve to move to Texas in a few months.Pretty sucky the publisher won't do a kindle version....
