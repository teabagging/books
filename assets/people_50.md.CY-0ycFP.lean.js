If we neglect this practice and prefer to acquire our understanding from books, we incur a secondary downfall.\\"This is incorrect and misleading.The vow is: \\"Deprecating him and referring to the letter\\". This has two meanings: not to be disrespectful to the teacher, and secondly: not to rely on his words literally; one has to look for the meaning of the teachers' words.Je Tsongkhapa, based on Asanga's Commentary, explains the 34th Bodhisattva training pledge as follows:>>\\"Deprecating him and referring to the letter.\\"&lt;&lt;\\"To deliberately discount the person speaking doctrine - not sincerely conceiving of him as a spiritual adviser and a teacher - and to fail to pay respect to him with one's body, while ridiculing him with humiliating [questions] and making sarcastic remarks with harsh words, and referring to the literary expression in the sense of making much of it, is a defiled fault.Briefly, if the words are not good but the meaning is good he fails to rely upon the meaning, whereas if the words are good but the meaning is not he does rely upon it. Some would have it that the deprecation amounts to saying to the preacher that his teaching is only literary expression, without meaning, or that the meaning is incomprehensible--in other words, failing to enter into the spirit of the letter. This should be taken as explained earlier in the Bodhisattva Bhumi in context of the four points of reference.Jinaputra and Samudra further gloss this as a misdeed of 'disrespect for the doctrine'.These three misdeeds are explained by the new commentary as failing, respectively, in eliminating bad view, in application to study, and in service to the lama, [all] as part of collecting wholesomeness. 'Makes his reference the letter' is explained as relying upon the literary expression in the sense of discounting the person who is speaking doctrine.\\"(quoted fromAsanga's Chapter on Ethics With the Commentary of Tsong-Kha-Pa: The Basic Path to Awakening, the Complete Bodhisattva, page 232)As I said above this book of Kelsang Gyatso claims instead that it would be a fault in the Bodhisattva Ethic: \\"Preferring to rely on books, rather than to rely on our spiritual guide\\".I don't know if Kelsang Gyatso invented this vow or not but this claim is defacto not correct when compared with the origin Indian or Gelug authoritative scriptures or even temporary commentaries-ecxept the LTWA edition which seem to have copy and pasted from Kelsang Gyatso's list of the vows...It was Je Tsongkhapa himself who distrusted Tibetan authors much and was very keen to check if what had been said about Buddha's teachings is in accordance with Indian (Sanskrit) scriptures. Je Tsongkhapa remarked if something is in contraction to the origin Indian sources it should not be accepted.The spin of this vow it would be a secondary downfall to 'Prefer to rely upon books rather than our Spiritual Guide' is the complete opposite of Je Tsongkhapa's own approach and invites to follow blind devotion.Explanation of the Buddhist practices explained in the book without such errors can be found in:-Confession of Downfalls, published by LTWA, and in-The Bodhisattva Vowby Geshe Sonam Rinchen.The most genuine and precise commentary on the Bodhisattva vows in the context of the Gelug school is the quoted text by Asanga and Je Tsongkhapa:-Asanga's Chapter on Ethics With the Commentary of Tsong-Kha-Pa: The Basic Path to Awakening, the Complete Bodhisattva* Usually the author is known to hold a Geshe degree, however different sources (e.g. his monastery Sera Je Dratsang, Newsweek or the Tibetan Government in Exile) dispute this claim."},{"Title":"Blessings: Prayers and Declarations for a Heartful Life","review":"I love this book.

The text here is still long. No-one who wishes to understand RAMBAM and his genius should read any abbreviated version, neither Guide nor M. Torah.This text is available free on Google, and may be downloaded into pdf.There, print size is fine--big in other words.It should be noted that the cited translator did not translate much of the book. He credits the actual translators as applicable.I do not agree that only those versed in rabbinic lore and law should read Maimonides. Guide is much harder to understand than M. Torah. His discussion of the comparison between the Prophets and Aristotle is quite interesting. The fact that he surrendered to biblical principle Aristotle's notion that the Universe is Eternal is not quite clear here or anywhere as to whether RAMBAM accepted the rationalle offered later by Nachmonides that the miracles disappear if the universe is eternal or if RAMBAM simply went with convention. (As honoring the tradition that the male is the only biological parent, while knowing science has proved this false) It should be recognized that Maimonides is not rejecting science; he does not compare the prophets to science, but to Aristotle. As Aristotle was a highly imperfect scientist, Maimonides is in fact accepting one metaphysical statement over another, but the truth of the universe's creation in time or its eternality was not known then and is not known now. Maimonides says that death occurs for individuals in order that types can survive. This is closer to a scientific notion; and the fact that it runs counter to TANACH does not bother him much.Maimonides may be seen as Darwin before Darwin, as Einstein in an age before science, the inspiration of Spinoza. Guide differes from M-Torah in that in Guide Maimonides is interested in truth, both Truth and truth, whereas in M. Torah he records and summerizes the words and thoughts of others.As I do not read 12th century Jewish Arabic and am unlikely to learn, I cannot speak to the accuracy of the translation. The Hebrew translation was done during RAMBAM's own lifetime, but I know of no comments he made on the translation. I recommend the screen version, not because it is better, as both are the inferior 2nd edition, but because of print size.As a very useful and life-directing exercise, I recommend that Maimonides' \\"Guide\\" be read at the same time as one reads St. Thomas Acquinis' \\"Suma Theologica.\\" The result would be a much stronger understanding of thought process and human events."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Yes, this is a true classic. Though there have been many works written since this jewel was first written, it still shines as a jewel in the crown of the Torah.The translation may not be of the order of some of the more recent interpretations, yet it remains clear and lucid. There is littel interpolation in the translated text ( a difficult ask). This edition keeps the classic cover, and surely remains an essential component in any discerning thinkers library. Whether you are Jewish or not, this seminal text is one that can only benefit the thinking reader.This edition has good, sturdy paper (ok, it is not parchment standard, but at this price, what more do you want?). Its binding is equal to much more expensive books, and its size ensures it will be used again and again.Read and enjoy (even if you disagree with the text) and you will understand why \\"From Moses to Moses, there is no-one like Moses!\\""},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"I have the kindle 2. I downloaded a Guide to the Perplexed which was available on GoogleBook. Although the text was readable, there was no formatting and the footnotes and commentary were merged with Maimonides' words to make the thing unnavigable - continuity was destroyed.The Amazon version on the other hand is without footnotes and is easily read. Another reviewer has criticized the Friedlander (late nineteenth century) translation as a bit archaic. I did not find this although there is the occasional word that one encounters only infrequently in more modern literature.If you are simply interested in reading the book, the Amazon Kindle version seems more than adequate. I have no way of knowing how reliable the translation, and wonder how the reviewers who do have opinions on this issue reached them."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"The Guide for the Perplexed is truly a masterpiece of Jewish thinking, providing a foundation for integrating Toraic and Talmudic insights with Aristotelian philosophy and scientific observation. Be forewarned: This is an intense piece of Rabbinic literature and tends to require digestion in small pieces. A discussion partner, reading the book with you is a great help. My only criticism of this particular edition is that the typeface is small and older style - if you're a dinosaur like me, that can be a limitation."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"A classic.

Other than that, it is very helpful and as relevant today as it was when it was written! This should be in everyone's home library who is Jewish, and if you aren't Jewish, you probably should have it too! It is helpful for people who aren't studied in religion, or neophytes, as well as scholars. Maimonides certainly doesn't need my help in selling books!

Then if one has been reading other things for those years, it will make more sense the second time around.But the reason I'm posting this is I love the Kindle Format. The book is thick and heavy to hold. The print is small, and the margins are a bit narrow. The only bad part about the kindle format is it would be hard to skip ahead a couple hundred pages.

Quick delivery also."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Maimonides offers an interesting perspective on the questions of theology. As told in the introduction, Maimonides rose from relative obscurity to a high level of academic merit very quickly due to his clear and distinct understanding and interpretations of the scripture. Indeed, his insights are what this book is all about. It is not an exhaustive study of all of the questions raised in the old testament, nor of other inquiries into the various properties of the divine, but it covers a lot. I found the text to be a little dry; not as captivating as a Platonic dialogue, but not as confusing as, say, one of Aristotle's essays. Were I to do it again, I might reconsider buying this edition because the type is quite small and Maimonides covers a lot of ground in little space, so I found my self using up the margins while trying to keep up with his thoughts. One of the nice things about this edition, however, is that it is in one volume, the entire guide to the perplexed. I found other editions, with larger print and such, but nothing besides this has the complete text. Moreover, it's cheaper than everything else I found! The translation is descent to good. It was done in the late 19th century, so you might say that it's a little dated, but it doesn't effect your reading. I read this book during a college seminar at St. John's, if you were wondering why I would have read this thing in the first palce. Speaking of which, I don't know if I'll ever really read this book again. This may be an important point, because while owning a book means you can do with it as you please, if you don't read it again, then it's just dead weight."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"I'm going to try to separate my critique of the text as it is presented, and Maimonides work.The typeface used here is awfully small, and crammed onto the pages with a crowbar, it seems. The margins must be measured with a micrometer. I suppose the publishers were determined to get the thing into one volume, but this book is really pretty slender; I don't see why it couldn't be larger to accommodate larger print, with more white space, so the words aren't crammed together like passengers in steerage.The translation is dated, and takes some getting used to, if you haven't had a lot of exposure to late Victorian English, the language may be off-putting. I happen to have a degree in English literature, and have read many styles extensively, and barely notice how dated the language was. There are other translations, but Freidlander, in this translation is very cautious in keeping his words consistent. This is important, because a large part of Guide for the Perplexed is defining Biblical terms.The Guide for the Perplexed is a brilliant work. Maimonides is my nomination for &quot;most important post-Talmudic scholar.&quot;The Guide is not a simple work; Maimonides does not spell things out; he doesn't give succinct answers to ages old questions. One doesn't go to this book, look up &quot;Cain,&quot; and say, &quot;Ah, there's where he got his wife.&quot;This is a book to aid the reader in becoming a better scholar. Where Maimonides does not give answers, he presents the tools that may assist the reader in studying the Torah, and coming up with his (or her!) own answers.Words are defined, and also analyzed in an etymological way, which is really more mystical than scientific, but we're talking Torah.Maimonides knows better than to give tools for interpretation without also giving lessons in interpretation. Some of his own mishnot come through as he discusses interpreting the Torah. He also discusses prophecy and free will, but eventually brings it all back to Torah.Anyone who wants to be a serious Torah scholar needs this book."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Maimonides' Guide is a masterwork of philosophic interest to Jews and non-Jews interested in the problem posed by philosophy to revealed religion, but Friedlander's translation is not the way to approach it. Besides removing the ambiguity of Maimonides' title by rendering it &quot;The Guide *for* the Perplexed&quot;, he translates technical Rabbanic hermaneutical terms into awkward and sometimes inappropriate Latin 'equivilants'. Anyone who needs such translation won't be able to understand Maimonides' thought anyway, steeped in Rabbinics as it is; anyone looking to learn something of the Guide will be unable to do so with this translation. Shlomo Pines' translation is universally considered superior; be sure to get both volumes."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"This turn-of-the- (20th) century tranlation from the Arabic has been absolutely superceded by the Pines-Strauss University of Chicago edition.

The Rambam (Maimonides) is an absolute giant of learning and explanations. In this volume, he presents many of the philosophical sides of Judaism which are rarely encountered.The text is divided into 3 books.The first book starts with discussing the use of homonyms in the Bible, especially in relation to describing God. The thesis that emerges is that it is only superficially that the Bible describes God as corporeal but the real doctrine precludes corporeality. The second topic discussed is the nature of esoteric study in Judaism and why it should only be taught in a restricted manner. The third topic is where Rambam protests against people using positive attributes to describe God and tries to prove that God is beyond such attributes. Then, he describes the Kalam argument (an Islamic school of thought that tried to prove the existence of God amongst other things) and points out his view of the flaws in it.The second book starts with a discussion of Aristotelian philosophy in terms of cosmology and metaphysics and compares that with Judaism, especially the mystical tradition. Rambam then gives his own view of the world structure which is at times very amusing in terms of what we know of science but still very interesting. Then, he describes the nature of prophecy and what exactly it meant to be a Biblical prophet.The third book opens with a hinted exposition of mystical passages in the Bible, such as Ezekiel's Chariot (Ezek Chap 1 and others). Then, he talks about God and the problem of Evil as well as providence. Finally, he describes the perfect worship of God as well as the purpose of most of the major commandments in the Torah. It is here that I could see why there was much opposition to the work from within the Jewish community - as he tends to provide unorthodox rationalisations that go against traditional expositions.As you cna see, he convers sooooo much that a serious believer or non-believer would wish to consider that it's an absolute gem. The translation is dense, both in language and print but at least it's accessible in terms of being in one volume as well as the price. If you can penetrate the at-times-archaic language, I think this book will greatly enrich your life."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"I gave it 5 stars, because it is a great piece of work - essential in Jewish studies - in its full, unabridged version. In keeping the price of the book low, the creators of the work left the readers a couple of problems. One, the type is way too small. Two, aside from the introduction, there are no notes or commentary, leaving the unexperienced reader with little resources for such an extremely intricate work. The creators should have tripled the size of this book and put it out in two volumes. I, and I'm sure many others, would have had no problem paying triple for it, if that were the case, for it is a work that is well worth the price. But that does not diminish its current greatness."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"Maimonides' philosophical opus presents his views on biblical interpretation, creation, the nature of prophecy, the reasons for the commandments, divine providence, free will, and many other topics.

Unfortunately, it is an effort with this edition, as the type is absurdly small."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"After further trying to use the Kindle version of The Guide I have decided that it is just unusable. The entire book is one long unbroken stream of text. The beginnings of chapters aren't highlighted or separated using line breaks. Even footnotes are embedded right in with the text. Unfortunately Amazon won't let me change my original star ranking. But I'd rate this implementation as one star. I needn't emphasize that his is a great book. Also, I have no problem with the dated 100-plus year old style of the translation. It is the implementation for the Kindle that leaves much to be desired. There is no active table of contents. This makes navigation very difficult. I started reading after finally finding the beginning of the text after paging through page after page of the inactive TOC. Then my Kindle \\"hiccupped\\" and restarted itself at the home page. I was not amused at having to page through the same inactive TOC to find the text that I had been reading. I would be much more putout if I had spent a lot of money for it. At $0.99 it is still worthwhile buying. Just remember that you will have to take the time to put in your own navigation bookmarks."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"An excellent work by a late medieval Jewish theologian/metaphysicist (a contemporary of Aquinas) who presents and breaks down the metaphysical arguments of the day for the existence of God, a God-created universe, and the interpretation of the Torah.

Our contemporary physicists could use his methods to uncover logical flaws in their theories about the ultimate origins of the Universe.

A must read along with the works of Augustine and Aquinas, and for that matter, any modern work on the ultimate nature of Nature.rac"},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"as other reviewers pointed out. But even so I got something out of it - especially at the beginning (where Maimonides attacks simple-minded literalism) and the end (where Maimonides tries to justify the mitzvot). I'm sure that in a few years when I am a bit more intellectually sophisticated, I will get more out of it.One really interesting part of the book that none of the other reviewers has mentioned so far: Maimonides' explanation of divine intervention in our lives. He asserts, based on Torah, that such Divine intervention affects humans but not animals (Part III, Ch. 17). Why? Because \\"Divine Providence is connected with Divine intellectual influence, and the same beings which are benefited by the latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of Divine Providence.\\" (Id.) And given that Divine Providence is connected with intellect, it further follows that \\"the greater the share which a person has obtained of this Divine influence ... the greater must also be the effect of Divine Providence upon him.\\" (Id., Ch. 18). Thus, \\"the greater the human perfection a person has attained, the greater the benefit he derives from Divine Providence.\\" (Id.) In other words, if you are Abraham or Moses, you get plenty of divine influence in your life. For the rest of us, the world takes its natural course.It seems to me that this theory allows us to reconcile Biblical miracles with the day-to-day reality of bad things happening to good people and vice versa: perhaps prophets get individualized reward and punishment in this world, and the rest of us don't. (Caveat: I am NOT saying that this view is factually correct, or even that Maimonides endorses this view; it is not clear to me how spiritually elevated Maimonides thinks one has to be to receive Divine intervention- whether only Moses, Abraham, etc. get it, or whether ordinary good and intelligent people get it as well, or whether he would draw the line someplace in between)."},{"Title":"The guide for the perplexed,","review":"My review and rating is restricted to a comment regarding the small typeface which makes this edition a difficult read.

I would say there are a variety of styles represented in the book, but it tends to lean more to the traditional with an occ. formal country look (florals, stripes, etc).When I read a decor book I put tabs on pages that either gave me ideas or when I liked the rooms.

Thoughts of Fantasies, Half-Truths, and Outright Lies is a startlingly frank exploration of an incredible range of common emotions and life experiences from a uniquely masculine and African-American perspective. The openess and honesty of this compilation of poems and short stories transcends the boundaries of race and gender to resonate with most readers, who have ever experienced love, loss, the exhilaration of the creative process, and the struggle to connect with a partner as well as friends, family, and community. Written with a refreshingly masculine point of view and with a perspicuity not often captured even by other male poets and authors, That's It! appeals to men by giving an articulate voice to many of the shared feelings and truths of the male experience, while welcoming women to a unique window on the male soul."},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe (Piano Voice Guitar)","review":"I have to say I was really bummed out when I opened the book and didn't find all the music I was expecting.The theme is missing,Evacuating London and Lucy Meets Mr.Tumnus were cut in half,and the four songs at the end of the soundtrack took up 2/3 of the book.There just wasn't enough music from the movie to make it worth buying."},{"Title":"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe (Piano Voice Guitar)","review":"I can't reccomend this book.

Even if this book isn't widely read, it is quite important in the history of political ideas.&quot;Reflections on Violence&quot; is a little difficult to read sometimes, because it was the result of many articles that the author had written regarding many subjects. When he finally put them together he didn't rewrite them, because he believed that to be good, reading must be an exercise that implies a certain amount of work. Well, as a matter of fact he achieved that aim, but all the same the book is well worth the effort.In &quot;Reflections on violence&quot; Sorel gives great importance to the idea of social myth, because according to him, myths can lead everybody's energy towards a given aim. In his opinion, there is an enormous difference between myths and utopias, due to the fact that myths don't only describe an ideal, but try to reach it. Through utopia you tear yourself from the world, with a myth you transform it (and transforming it you find yourself, because man is creative activity).Sorel thinks that myths are not rational, and because of that they cannot be judged intellectually. One of the myths he studies is the myth of the general strike. He believed that particular myth could give the proletariat (through syndicalism) enough strenght to fight against the bourgeoisie. Sorel also affirms that violence is positive, because while force gives the workers chains, the violence directed at that force frees them.In conclusion, I must say I liked this book. When he highlights the importance of myth, I guess he also somehow stresses the tendency human beings have to dedicate their life to an ideal, a cause. And that ideal is likely to be of the utmost importance to us, because our beliefs make us. That is the reason why it is so important to choose the right ideal, the right cause.The problem is that Sorel doesn't measure the truth of each myth, but merely its efficacy, and by doing so opens the way for all kind of disasters. How can we expect even a little bit of rationality from social life if the ultimate end of that life cannot be evaluated rationally?. And if we cannot understand intellectually our aim (the myth), how can we realise if it is legitimate?. If you can, read this book... It'll make you think !!!Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Reflections on violence","review":"Today, George Sorel is virtually unknown. A century ago, this French political thinker was quite notorious. Shortly after the October Revolution in Russia, a Swiss newspaper accused Sorel of being responsible for it. The aged philosopher took it as a compliment, and wrote an article called \\"In Defence of Lenin\\". What Lenin himself thought of the episode is less clear, but in a work published long before the revolution, he called Sorel \\"a notorious muddlehead\\". Now, you don't get a reputation like *that* without reason!Sorel's ideas are difficult to summarize in a short review. Indeed, many scholarly works have been published on the man, who considered himself to be a socialist, while being seen by many as a forerunner of fascism. Sorel claimed to be a Marxist, but his Marxism wasn't the Marxism of Marx, but rather a strange blend of revolutionary syndicalism and ideas adapted from a long range of \\"bourgeois\\" sources. While initially a supporter of the left-wing syndicalist CGT, he later collaborated with right-wing monarchists, and seems to have praised both Lenin and Mussolini at the time of his death.\\"Reflections on Violence\\" was originally published in 1906, and later revised and expanded. It remains the most important text by Sorel, and the natural place to start for those interested in his thought. It should be noted at the outset that Sorel's text isn't particularly exciting, all the hype notwithstanding (as in the editorial review at this product page). Lenin and even Trotsky wrote worse things than this, and so did Nietzsche. Nor is Sorel's text an easy read, although it's better than its reputation. Sorel admitted that the text wasn't particularly systematic, and that it was really a collection of notebooks. He does loose the red thread a couple of times, but the main ideas are still easily discernible.\\"Reflections\\" was written during Sorel's left-wing, syndicalist and ostensibly Marxist period. What immediately strikes a reader familiar with socialist texts, is that Sorel's booklet doesn't look very \\"socialist\\". There is very little of the rethoric typical of such texts, and Sorel frequently references works by non-socialist authors, including Tocqueville, Renan, Bergson and Cardinal John Henry Newman (!). It's clear that Sorel was an independent thinker, a \\"Sorelian\\" if you like.In the introduction, Sorel explains that he is a historical pessimist. He believes that pessimism is the only truly revolutionary position. Optimists become reformists, in the vain belief that society can be reformed according to their hair-brained schemes, and when they realize that this is impossible, they simply stick to it, accomplishing nothing but corruption and decadence. A pessimist, on the other hand, realizes that society is rotten to the core, and must be revolutionized en toto, at a single stroke. Sorel compares the revolutionary labor movement to ancient Christianity and 16th century Calvinism, two other pessimistic movements. The introduction also deals with Sorel's theory about myths, also mentioned in the main text of \\"Reflections\\".One of the main themes of \\"Reflections on Violence\\" is that reformism actually works, and that this is a bad thing! The bourgeoisie, its politicians and the Church have become timid, cowardly and frightened. They no longer want to fight the proletariat. The labor unions and workers' parties can easily scare this cowardly bourgeoisie into making concessions. This benefits the reformist labor leaders and politicians, who will eventually become a corrupted establishment group amongst others. Meanwhile, both the economy and society at large degenerates. The solution to this unhappy state is proletarian violence. At one point, Sorel writes that such violence should be directed in particular against \\"good\\", philanthropic employers and other upper-class do-gooders, to show them that the workers are ungrateful. Violence separates the classes, the proletariat from the bourgeoisie, and it will force the bourgeoisie to become more war-like, heroic and dynamic, something Sorel considered a good thing. Curiously, for a very heterodox Marxist, Sorel actually accepted the most \\"pro-capitalist\\" part of Marx' thinking: the idea that the capitalists are historically progressive since they develop the productive forces, make the economy more efficient, while simultaneously creating their own grave-diggers (the proletariat). Thus, the revolution simply takes over a productive apparatus perfected by capitalism. Sorel feared that a timid, decadent bourgeoisie wouldn't fulfil this historic mission, and that all of society would decline as a result. He compares this to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. Thus, the violence of the workers actually forces the bourgeoisie into completing the task assigned for it by history, a task that will inevitably lead to its destruction. And no, I haven't misinterpreted Sorel. He actually does say all this!The revolutionary syndicalists in France called for a general strike to usher in socialism. Sorel supports the idea of the general strike, and he seems to suggest that it's a necessary corrective to the errors of traditional Marxism. Sorel admits that society haven't become polarized between two classes, something predicted in \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". What economic forces alone haven't accomplished, will be accomplished by the general strike. It will polarize society between workers and employers. Sorel also believes that workers lack a revolutionary impulse, and might be by nature conservative. Once again, the idea of the general strike is intended to cure this. Notoriously, Sorel calls the general strike a \\"myth\\". It doesn't really matter to George Sorel whether a general strike is possible or not, or perhaps only partially possible. What matters is the *idea* of a general strike, an idea that energizes and mobilizes the proletariat, turns it into a class of Homeric warriors, and spurs them on to heroic action. In passing, he even seems to admit that his concept of myth borders the religious, but doesn't seem to consider it such a bad thing. Indeed, Sorel seems fascinated by the power religion has over its adherents, Catholicism in particular. Since the myth cannot be rationally analyzed, this particular Sorelian notion has come under much criticism. What if the myth of the general strike is dropped in favour of another myth, say a nationalist one? Was this why Sorel so easily transitioned from the far left to the far right?Sorel was, if not muddleheaded, at least very contradictory. There are many unresolved tensions in \\"Reflections on Violence\\". One is the tension between Sorel's elitism and ouvrierism. On the one hand, he feels nothing but contempt for vulgar, useless people. On the other hand, he eulogizes the workers, especially the poorer ones. He seems to have regarded the working class as potential heroes, while the intellectuals, politicians and philanthropists were worthy of nothing but scorn. Another, more serious, tension is between centralization and decentralization. Sorel admires the captains of industry, large-scale factories, and the industrial revolution, at one point scornfully calling England \\"medieval\\". But Sorel also has a libertarian, decentralist streak. He opposes the Jacobins, and believes that the French Revolution simply captured the centralized state apparatus of the ancient regime. (His main source for this analysis is Tocqueville.) Sorel opposes the centralization of the labor unions, since this would make them easier pray for reformist politicians. Indeed, Sorel's ultimate aim is to abolish the State, and it does seem that he wants to accomplish this task more or less immediately after the revolution (no gradual \\"withering away\\" here). But if the state is abolished, and the labor unions are decentralized, how can production and distribution still be centralized and large-scale? This is never explained.But the most obvious tension concerns the view of violence itself. As already noted, Sorel actually opposed Jacobin terror, and hoped that the proletarian revolution would be less bloody than the bourgeois revolutions. Indeed, there is a strong streak of moralism in his text. Sorel clearly felt moral revulsion at the corruption of left-wing politicians who sold out their ideals, partisan patronage in the civil services, the use of police spies even by a \\"liberal\\" government, etc. He also believes that the task of the proletariat is to create a new, higher morality (which sounds like an idealized version of old, conservative morality). So where does violence fit in all this? Sorel tried to distinguish between two kinds of violence, the one heroic and Homeric, the other brutal and decadent. The former kind of violence, in combination with myths, gives the proletariat a sense of the sublime, and saves civilization. The second kind of violence is simply destructive. A century after the publication of \\"Reflections on Violence\\", it's easy to see the problem: \\"heroic\\" violence for a \\"sublime\\" \\"myth\\" very easily becomes brutality, terror and oppression."},{"Title":"Reflections on violence","review":"Sorel's most famous work is an interesting conflation of Marxism and XIXth century Romanticism. Like most socialist literature it idealizes the \\"worker\\" as an heroic figure standing astride history.The book advocates syndicalism (a system in which industrial workers' unions are the vehicles of political power), but it eschews the pseudoscientific rhetoric favored by Marx and Lenin. Sorel is not particularly strong on economics, and he knows it.What he does know is cultural history and he advocates political rebellion through violence and mythmaking. The book is essentially a broadside against Jaures and the calculative, creeping parliamentary socialism of fin de siecle France. He finds Jaures and his methods to be too meek and compromising. He characterizes parliamentarism (accurately) as a system of endless debate, dealmaking and \\"selling out\\". Sorel advocates revolutionary violence as a means to both power and the creation of a new mythic order. He correctly observes that the Jacobins were violent and bloody, yet they managed to create a mythology for the French Revolution which still held a strong cultural resonance in his day.Direct action, mythmaking and ruthless bloodshed were the means Sorel recommended for revolution. His ideas went largely unacted upon in France, but the anarchosyndicalists of Spain took him quite seriously.His greatest disciple however, was a young socialist named Benito Mussolini. Mussolini's Fascist movement was based upon direct action and inspired by a myth of a resurgent Roman Empire. Mussolini made explicit reference, again and again, to the importance of myth in revolutionary struggle.Sorel inadvertently became the prophet of revolutionary Fascism.Two asides: (a) there is no reason for corporate executives to keep this book by their bedsides - it contains nothing of economic value, and its ideology is thoroughly exhausted and devoid of contemporary relevance; (b) Sorel is one of the few French intellectuals besides Tocqueville who seemed to have a healthy respect for America and the American economic miracle."},{"Title":"Reflections on violence","review":"I think I made it through a couple pages before I stopped caring. Dont take a class with this book in it. Leave that for the kids who come to school in skinny jeans, with a spotty beard, shaggy hair, and a longboard."},{"Title":"Reflections on violence","review":"No World Wars had happened when Sorel wrote this book; no death camps, no Predator drones. In this context, his comments on violence are naieve. But his sense of the role of intellectuals in history is brilliant - being, primarily, that the cycles of social change are only marginally touched by them. His concept of mythos bridges the gap between Jungian archetypes and action in the world."},{"Title":"Reflections on violence","review":"This book, should be studies in conjunction with books on violence. It illuminates that despite today's pacifity within the labour movement, circumstances (as exist in these modern times), justify resorting to 'activism'. A reading of Sorel's expose of the machinations of Socialists, the Middle Classes, et al clearly show that in these years of 'Neo-Liberalist' ideology and the guises of Capitalism under the new cloak of 'Globalisation' ..... nothing has changed for the great swaith of working poor, dumbing down or buying off Trade Unions etc etc.This book should be required reading of anyone who aspires to a pro-active approach to conditions surrounding work and Labour.It would be useful for corporate executives and polticians to keep this book permanently by their bedsides."},{"Title":"Reflections on violence","review":"This a book that influenced both communism and fascism. Although it was written from the perspective of the political left, its most enthusiastic reader was probably Benito Mussolini. It shows the compatibility of certain aspects of communism and fascism. It is surprising that it is not widely studied in courses on fascism. For more books on totalitarianism I have created a Listmania list.The book itself is not easy to read. It, however, is important to read this in order to get an understanding on underlying philosophical forces that produced modern totalitarianism."},{"Title":"Reflections on violence","review":"An excellent exposition of revolutionary syndicalist thought, quite in contradiction to statist Marxism, and infused with the spirit of the labor movement. Long before Michael Foucault, Georges Sorel pointed out that ethics are determined by the ruling class.Those who are squeamish about Sorel's unabashed enthusiasm for class violence will remember that all societies have been ushered in with violence. The present capitalist society was created in bloody revolutions that saw the rebelling bourgeoisie cutting off the heads of their fuedal masters left right and center! America is founded on revolution. France is founded on revolution. Britain is founded on (limited) revolution.In class terms, Sorel argues, might makes right. And, as the pragmatic bourgeois revolutionary Mao put it, power comes from the barrel of a gun."},{"Title":"Simply Successful Surgery: a holistic approach to a conventional procedure","review":"Thorough, easy to read, loaded with tips.

Thanks so much!"},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"I am currently reading this book for a class called \\"Diverse Populations\\" and I have never in my life read a book so confounding and infuriating. I honestly have no idea how this book was ever published through a mainstream publisher and managed to make its way into institutions of higher learning. I honestly can't even finish the chapter I am on because each sentence is more racist than the one prior to it. According to this book, there is only really one type of racism: white racism. And most if not all whites are racist. And most of us don't acknowledge racial struggles as we benefit from marginalizing people of color. They don't bother to place these statements in any contextual manner or cite sources, rather they make statement after statement that reeks of white guilt.Here are a few doozies:\\"Many whites declare they are not racist. They listen to rap music, dress like black urban youth, and respect African American athletes. They argue that they have never discriminated against a person of color and that they cannot be blamed for events of 40 or 200 years ago. THEY TAKE NO RESPNSIBILITY FOR SOCIETY'S RACISM\\" ....seriously?? So ALL whites should take responsibility for ALL racism? Even if we are not racist?\\"A first step in confronting racism in schools is to realize that racism exists and that, if teachers are white, they have benefitted from it.\\" Ok, I guess that any accomplishments in my life have only been achieved because of \\"white privelege\\" (another term used frequently in this book)I honestly am infuriated and disturbed that this book is even published let alone being assigned to grad and undergrad students. It makes a statement that most whites are racist and that people of color will always be under the thumb and never succeed as much as they would if they were white. The authors should be ashamed of themselves for spouting such irresponsible rhetoric to America's future educators."},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"This is a good basic textbook for raising cultural awareness. As a member of the \\"dominant\\" culture in the U.S. who has seen many that don't really understand cultural differences (except on a superficial level), I recommend it.

From the 1st chapter, I realized it is really a book all about bashing our dominant culture, here in the U.S. The only reason that I give the book 2 stars rather than 1 is because it is so badly and erroneously written (so much is taken out of historical context to bash the US) that it is forcing me to really look at our history and find out what really happened, because the book is definitely not an accurate depiction of the world."},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"This book was a required reading for an undergrad \\"Teaching Diverse Populations\\" class. I had hoped that the book would be about breaking the barriers between races, classes, sexes etc.. I was wrong. The entire book from start to finish told us how the dominant culture is wrong, and others in society are not. Prejudice against dominant culture. It irked me that it used politically correct terms for almost every culture, but white. It rarely used European American. I thought this book would be about strategies and methods of teaching diverse students not a one-book crusade against \\"the man.\\"The only reason this book gets two stars as opposed to one is because the examples that started each chapter did get me thinking. As well as a few of the other critical thinking exercises in the book. Too bad there were was not more of those, and less text.If you are a teacher planning on using this book STOP and look for another book that is better suited by giving more concrete examples, strategies, and methods of teaching.

All the book does is tout how evil White people are and how badly Blacks and Hispanics are discriminated against. According to the book, only White people discriminate and the Blacks and Hispanics have no control over their lives. Now I am not naive and I do know that there is racism and discrimination in the world, but White people are not the only perpetrators of it as the book seems to insinuate. If you have to read this book for a class, I feel your pain. If you are looking to read something for your own information, then save your money and buy something else.

How ironic that one of them is a white woman. They constantly write about white people stereotyping others, and yet they are stereotyping whites with no evidence for their claims. I emailed the authors to ask them for some proof of their ridiculous statements and received no response. I had to spend $80 on this book for a GRADUATE level education course.

Not only is it poorly written, but it is intellectually shallow -- nothing but an assemblage of hackneyed cliches about how horrible the &quot;dominant culture&quot; in America is. I cannot believe that I have been assigned this trite tome as the sole text in a GRADUATE level course. What's even worse, it provides virtually no guidance for current or prospective educators about how to effectively teach a classroom full of students of disparate races, cultures, religions and socio-economic backgrounds. What a shame that is, since this is such a very real need in education today. Thank goodness this is only for a 4-week summer intersession.

It is a secular humanist apoligia for multiculturalism in education. It is singular in point of view, never straying from the thesis that multiculturalism is good and schools must support it; hardly the sort of reference work for a university level discussion of the issues. The philosophy behind the book is that people are hardly more or less than those cultural elements which have been socialized into them with little responsibility for their beliefs or actions. The main text is that every culture is equally valuable in society, forgetting that &quot;society&quot; is essentially American culture with its own priorities. They go into great detail on the virtues of immigrant cultures and the vices of the American culture, hardly accepting that it has a right to exist as well. The most difficult aspect of this is the authors' almost laughable inability to get outside of their point of view and treat the issues with something approaching objectivity. The book is unbearable in its &quot;holier than thou&quot; attitude. I don't know if this is typical of the ilk but if so, it is hardly a wonder that the multicultural mavens have difficulty selling their point of view"},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"While I can't imagine anybody buying this book unless required to for a class, let me warn you away just in case.

Could not believe I was forced to endure this text for an entire course. Totally insulting and biased."},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"I am an undergrad, and I was ready to compose a lament upon reading this work. I can't imagine why grad students would be exposed to this book, it's not very good. The authors are tackling a very real problem - given the pluralism prevalent in most public (and many private) classrooms, how does an educator go about maneuvring within that classroom to successfully engage and instruct all it's members?Good question.The book attempts to tackle the areas of class, race, gender, exceptionality, religion, language, and age; they want to illuminate the nature of these topics and explore the issues involved in approaching and including them in a multicultural classroom. Unfortunately, even though they divide the various demographics represented in our American pluralistic classrooms well, they rarely get into dealing with this problem very effectively.The prolegomena they have (the first chapter) was supposed to explore what we mean by &quot;culture&quot;. They co-opt Goodenough's definition, &quot;a way of perceiving, believing, evaluating, and behaving,&quot; and that's, ironically, good enough as a starting point for trying to wrap your mind around these issues. Unfortunately, they immediately endorse a hyper-relativist perspective regarding the legitemacy of various ways of &quot;perceiving, believing, evaluating, and behaving,&quot; which doesn't really set them up to grapple with this problem. Basically, they never provide a foundation of unity from which various groups can be included in a pluralistic classroom other than via their notion of democracy, defined through &quot;cultural relativism&quot;, &quot;social justice&quot; and &quot;equality&quot;. Though they try, there are no satisfactory explanations given to legitemate these ideas. They should have stuck to discussing how educators can effectively teach in classrooms where the students have a variety of worldviews/cultures than dabbling as amateurs in philosophy, anthropology, and politics. This book is, practically speaking, worthless.Because their epistemological, anthropological and political assumptions color _everything_ that they say for the rest of the book, if you're not familiar with these areas, you'll never be able to meaningfully engage with this book, whether you agree or disagree. These assumptions of the authors guide the portraits they paint and evaluations they make of culture and the present pluralism, as well as informing their advice on how we ought to navigate a pluralist classroom as educators.I suggest reading a bit in philosophy before trying to tackle this problem. Routledge has a great series to familiarize yourself with philosophical problems, I especially suggest their book on _Ethics_ by Harry Gensler. It is simply written, and very practical. That is a _perfect_ place to start figuring out how to deal with these practical (and partly theoretical) problems without introducing a &quot;solution&quot; that only brings more bad weather in the future."},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"why would i read a book about multiculteralism that actually promotes racism and hatred? Isn't that besides the entire point?This book is disgusting, shallow, and biased and it is being forced upon grad students, presenting only one extreme cliche that all whites are racist and empowering the notion that there is only one time of racism. So many points in the book completely invalid, infuriating and misrepresented - I completely question the authors' motives. They are actually creating and PROMOTING racism.It literally blows my mind that this book is published, FORCED upon people to read, and ACCEPTED as factual. This review does not even come close to revealing how angry and insulted I am over this book. I am not racist. The authors most certainly are.If whites are supposed to start apologizing for the last 200 years of racism, every culture in the world is going to have to do the same thing because every single one is guilty. Just one of many illogical and backwards taken out of context arguments in the book.Do yourself a favor and don't read this crap, it will only make everyone angry about everyone else, its sole purpose is to promote hatred and negativity."},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"I was required to read this book for college. I was excited about the book until I realized how one sided it is. It mainly talks about problems african americans have. Doesn't talk about native americans, asian americans, or hispanic americans much. It also isn't politically correct. They call different culture groups native americans, asian americans, hispanic americans, african americans and white. Although sometimes it states european americans instead but the authors should have stated european americans from the begining since they did for the rest of the ethnic groups. It was also one sided on the role of women. It made it seem like growing up to be a \\"girl\\" was a bad thing and a stay at home mom should feel bad because she's not in school. In my opinion, this book is one sided, biased and a waste of time. I am reading the 8th edition and cannot believe it got this far."},{"Title":"Multicultural Education in a Pluralistic Society (Understanding Cultural Backgrounds in the Classroom)","review":"I had to take a class in Multicultural Ed last semester and I had to buy this book.Loved the class, hated the book.All of the reviews bashing it are correct. It rips on the \\"dominant culture\\" over and over saying that everything's wrong with it and nothing they do is right. All white males have been placed in a position of power by there skin color and gender and there's nothing people of other races can do about it because all white people go out of their way to oppress everyone else. It talks about the \\"me\\" culture of white America (which is true, but it happens in all countries that are highly developed ie. Germany, England, Japan, etc.)Granted, some of topics are true like it is easier to get a job being a white male, white people get treated better in the court system, and they get preferential treatment in certain stores and dealerships.It makes it like everyone who isn't a white male has no chance to succeed because of the position they are put in. It also makes it seem that whites are responsible for literally everything wrong with society and everyone else are good people who would never hurt a fly, but they are oppressed by this horrible group of people (white males)For example, there's a topic on religions and when it talks the Nation of Islam it glosses over their disgustingly overt racist propaganda, it's like everyone gets a free pass to act however they wish because at the end of the day everything is the \\"dominant culture's\\" fault.The best way to explain the book is this way. If I lived in another country and knew nothing about America and read this book I would picture all white males as James Bond like villains.

I am outraged that I have to read this book. It is very offensive. Word for word, discussing affirmative action \\"whites filing reverse discrimination cases believe their individual rights to an education at a select school, a promotion or a job should be based soleley on their individual achievement. They believe that other factors such as income, ethnicity, race or gender should not be valued in the process. They overlook the fact that they have been privileged throughout their lives because of their race and family income.\\" And who is stereotyping who? Who's to say all white people have been advantaged and come from wealthy families? And, it is very sad if you feel or represent that your group feels that you should get into a good college, get a good job, or a promotion because it is owed to you. These things should come as a result of what you did as an individual, not because someone feels they owe it to you. Besides, that card is gone now, look who's the next president! This book tries to inflict the author's liberal views instead of facts. I know that I am in school to become a teacher, but is this how the teachers get such a bad reputation for being liberals? Are they actually brainwashed by this garbage? Donna Gollnick, you have done a great disservice to your group by writing this pitiful, poor sorry me liberal book and to the people of your group that do work hard for what they have and are proud to be where they are because of their own merits, not any handouts or \\"social justices\\" as you say.

From the very first page of the introduction through the end of this text book, I was so impressed at the thoroughness in covering aspects of culture in America, especially that of students in today's school system.A reviewer complained that it didn't give any solutions for solving problems in schools. First of all, this textbook presents the facts and information. A student is to take the problems that these students face and use them to find solutions. Sometiems the solutions are quite obvious. However, you must realize that giving people the solutions without explaining the reasons why first is quite dangerous and extremely ignorant. If solution book is what you are looking for, read C.M. Charles' &quot;Building Classroom Discipline&quot; (7th Edition).But even that book doesn't over the diverse cultures that our schools contain today. The editors/authors of this book were very inclusive in writing compiling this textbook and I highly commend them and highly recommend them to you.This book covers the different struggles that different groups encounter, their origins, the reasons why they have sustained or haven't and why it is important to acknowledge the multiculturalism in our schools. Whoever didn't &quot;get&quot; this book obviously didn't understand what the title meant.

Each chapter addresses a group that has different needs and offers practical information to promote sensitivity to their challenges. This book was a wealth of information and an education to me as I took the semester course in diversity.

Two of the pigs are eaten in the story, which can be disturbing to younger children. The size of the text is enlarged during the times when the wolf is being \`bad' or danger is being introduced. That is a good way to allow the reader to raise his or her voice at these times while reading, but again, that can be scary for a child to hear. The colors in the illustrations are a bit dull to set the mood of the sad, scary story in my opinion. The plot is alright and somewhat easy to understand and follow. But I highly do not recommend reading this to young children. They would not predict that the pigs would be eaten and that the wolf would be eaten at the end. A way to use this book in the classroom would be to read a few other versions of the three little pigs to the class and compare and contrast them. Have the students work in groups to formulate similarities and differences of the characters, plot, setting and more."},{"Title":"Forever Ours","review":"My mom and I read this book together when she was diagnosed with a terminal illness 2 years ago.

These stories, coming from patients, associates, and friends, involve near-death experiences, death-bed visions, apparitions, and meaningful dreams. \\"Some of the things I have heard from their loved ones and some of my own experiences have caused me to believe that there is more to this life than meets the eye, and that gives me hope and helps me to do this job,\\" Dr. Amatuzio writes.Perhaps the most intriguing story is that of a man who had a near-death experience while in the recovery room following surgery. He recalled leaving his body through the top of his head and then watching doctors and nurses attempt resuscitation. He remembered being able to read all their thoughts, including those of a nurse who was upset that she had to stay and help because she had a date after work. At the same time, a patient next to him had a cardiac arrest and left his body. The two men began communicating by means of telepathy while observing the confusion below them. The two men ventured through the wall and outside, where they saw a dazzling light. After seeing his deceased mother, father, and aunt, he realized he had to go back. The other man continued on and did not reunite with his earthly body.This book would make a great gift for a terminal patient or someone grieving the loss of a loved one.

Just by reading these accounts, I found myself being impacted in the same way.

I can't decide who I want to loan this book to first--anyone who has lost a loved one, will lose a loved oned, or will die themselves, will benefit from this. Our culture is so much in denial of death--the word itself conjures up a black fear for many. We can all benefit from a new view of death as rebirth, and this book is evidence of that. Thank you, Dr. Amatuzio. By writing this book you are bringing much needed hope."},{"Title":"Forever Ours","review":"After receiving a copy as a Mother's Day gift, I have given 5 books as gifts; one for Father's Day, 4 as funeral memorials. Three others have borrowed and read my copy. One of them bought five more copies to give away. Another friend is recommending it to others who lost a close friend recently. Everyone loves it. This book is beautifully written and is a quick inspirational read for anyone, weather you have lost someone recently or not. It starts with Ms. Amatuzio as a young child learning about the death of a dear elderly neighbor, moves through her education as a doctor, and to her career as a medical examiner and forensic pathologist with inspirational stories of hers and others in her life. I tell friends, &quot;don't read the last page until THE END&quot; and &quot;read it in private, you will cry with an overwhelming feeling of knowledge and understanding of life and afterlife.&quot;"},{"Title":"Forever Ours","review":"This was a well written, thought provoking book.

Six years of good memories crashed down in April, and my world became topsy-turvy. Everything went wrong. How could he have suddenly turned into a tyrant? Last April, Tristan died in a car wreck and gave me an extra year to live, for which I felt much guilt.Ms. Amatuzio's research into the paranormal, she calls immortality, proves beyond a doubt that \\"our loved ones are truly forever ours.\\" For me, there was no longer any \\"greater things to come.\\" Just a few disagreements and my world came crashing down around me. How could I have mis-judged him so? I knew all along that I was not good at judging character. I'd made the same mistakes over and over. We all make mistakes along the way, but how could I have been so wrong. I was completely baffled about his change of heart and demeanor. As she proves so eloquently, for some things there is no explanation, just a deep knowing called synchronicity.Occasionally an event in one's life seems too out of the ordinary to be a coincidence. At times, such events seem to happen almost on purpose with a deliberateness which surpasses understanding. But why now? Because of an inherited hyper-thyroid condition, I became dependent on his calmness which had worked magic on me. His way of presenting things in a humble way fooled me absolutely in every way. It was like a thunderbolt had hit my brain when the 'faker' showed his real self. It's magic became it's tragic.When a coincidence occurs, we know because our hearts are lightened and seem to skip a beat. For a moment we think differently and dare to hope that there is more to life than we previously imagined. There was hope for contentment, even if only temporary. At times, she says, the things which bring the greatest unease also bring the greatest gift. She follows the lives of several families which had lost loved ones to death as they reflected on how that particular person had changed their lives for the better.It's been written that if you look at something closely enough, you begin to see right through it. She feels that the answers to life's most difficult questions are woven into its design, much as in an optical illusion. She concludes with this: \\"It is my fondest hope that the wisdom shared in this book will comfort and remind us of what really heals. Knowing that we are loved, knowing we are never alone, and knowing our loved ones are ours forever.\\""},{"Title":"Forever Ours","review":"This book became a bridge for me when my beloved husband, John, died of cancer in 2004.

She explains that the real experience of death is far more fascinating and rewarding than often thought of by medical professionals, who think of death as simply the end of life.

While the author is a scientist -- a forensic pathologist -- she stresses the spiritual elements of death. Most interesting are those who experience near-death experiences and are resuscitated. All report leaving their bodies and looking down on themselves and then ascending to a bright light with new colors and smiling loved ones who have previously departed. Also interesting are the many spiritual signs of death -- visits from long departed when one is about to die and then visits from the recently dead to the grieving in the form of dreams or visions.But what about the vast majority of us who never get any signs or visions? The book, for that reason, provides limited comfort. However, the author's ability to accept spirituality with her science is admirable."},{"Title":"Forever Ours","review":"I have read many books of this type before, having suffered grief, and am always looking for a different slant on the afterlife. Because the writer in this instance is coming from the aspect of science, I found it all the more believable.

I would still recommend this book to fellow seekers."},{"Title":"Forever Ours","review":"I am fortunate to live in the same county where Dr. Amatuzio was the chief medical examiner and didn't realize how lucky I was because fortunately, I never needed to know. Dr. Amatuzio retired recently and I am currently privileged to work with her predecessor during the most awful time of my life, the unexpected death of my 2 year old daughter. There is a reason why Dr. Amatuzio is known as the \\"compassionate coroner\\" and her predecessor is the same- kind, compassionate, highly educated and very professional.Both of her books have brought me comfort and helped me to heal during my difficult time. Although I believe in communication after death, sometimes people are skeptical of stories that are written from a psychic medium's perspective. That is what I love about Janis' books- she isn't a psychic. She is a highly acclaimed forensic pathologist who risked the ridicule of her respected colleagues and peers to share the stories that cannot be explained by medicine because these stories needed to be told. These stories will give you hope, comfort and encouragement even if you don't need it right now but someday you most likely will."},{"Title":"Glencoe Physics: Principles and Problems - Teacher Wraparound Edition 1999","review":"Exactly.

An underlying mystical aura about her, you begin to understand that she is &quot;bound&quot; for something very special and unusual where sexuality is concerned. The story does a great job of humanizing the heroine through her many degrading acts, running a gamut of sexual possibilities without surrendering her most prized virginity to the men she encounters. An arousing and well written piece of erotica that might just make you cry as well. As an erotic writer myself, I found it an inspiring read.-Mistress Twilight Blue"},{"Title":"Thongs (A Brandon House library edition, 2038)","review":"An extremely carnal read; where passivity is an act of power, and where exercising power is shown to be ultimately an act of surrender. The ambiguity of this terrain, while filled with stereotypes of gender roles (rich English masochists, Glasgow tough men, carnal Priestesses, etc), gives the book an androgyny of feeling. The violations and pleasures cut so thoroughly through the participants' conscious roles and desires, the reader of whatever persuasion and gender is left as penetrated as the characters. Cold yet sweat drenched."},{"Title":"The Apparitions","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously - this collection of images captured bodies in motion, yet froze them in a tense moment of time.

It follows a similar theme to a John Norman novel. Fiesty Earth girl call is transported away to a stange land where her talents are put to a new purpose. It's not predictable and I did not guess her true role in this new world until the author exposed it for me. It is a sexy book, but it's not all about sex - there is an intersting plot. And although our heroine spends most of the story naked she doesn't get a lot of action herself.I'll be looking for another title from this author."},{"Title":"Zoot","review":"Like the Gor series this book follows a now familiar idea: kidnapped earth woman taken to alien environment by a dominant man. However, unlike the Gor series here the women are the main characters and not merely broken into stereotypes. The main male character is named Zoot, thus the title. He isn't a Gorean man by any means even though he does expect his harem to be ready and eager to have sex with him at all time, bending to his will in all things. There is a reason for this that becomes clear as you read. Nor is the main female character, kidnapped earthling Connie, submissive at any point in the novel. A refreshing twist on the idea of kidnapping women for male pleasure off-world."},{"Title":"Zoot","review":"Wow, I wasn't expecting the depth of sex or plot when I ordered this book. It runs the risk of being too much of either, erotica or fantasy, to satisfy everyone, but on the other hand, you certainly CAN'T be disappointed, regardless of your preference. Zoot borders on cliche, but Thompson takes turns that keep you thinking. As the other reviewer mentioned, the book is named after the dominate male, but it's really about the women, told mostly from the heroine's point of view. Kind of The Story of O with an attitude. The sex scenes hold NOTHING back, but they're written with such flare they put your typical erotic prose to shame. Just so you make no mistake, this is NOT your ordinary Romance. In fact, there is no romance, to speak of. Call it Action/Adventure/Erotica. Wow."},{"Title":"Zoot","review":"That's what this book is. in case you are wondering, marfs are crocodile like beasts in this book. Anywhoo the plot is actually a good one in this book, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The HEA ending fell flat, but I will say the heroine in the book is a good solid, strong female character. But, Erotica this is not. The euphemisms in this book for womens parts are not good: 'tender thorn'/WTH??? One reviewer says this is 'prose'- I don't think so.All these good reviews MUST be the authors friends, but GOOD friends should be honest..................."},{"Title":"Zoot","review":"Zoot has collected women from all planets of the universe and now has quite a sizable harem. However, he wants and needs someone different this time. And he goes to Earth to find a very special, extremely insubordinate woman by the name of Connie. Connie is a beautiful redhead who turns down men and their pickup lines by shouting at them in public. But her life changes when she encounters a naked man running in front of her. She is abducted and taken to Zoot's planet for a unique purpose. Zoot is a dominant male, an alpha in every sense, something that does not sit well with Connie. What follows is a delectably erotic novel with a lot of BDSM elements.I agree with the reviewer who says that this novel is similar to the classic Gor series. This novel also reminds me of Jaid Black's Trek Mi Q'an series. All of these books have the whole science fiction erotica theme of an earth woman being taken to an obscure planet by a man. I also agree with the reviewer that this novel, unlike the Gor and Trek Mi Q'an books respectively, doesn't come across as offensive or as over the top. I like the fact that Connie isn't a ninny who is willing to submit to Zoot without question. The story is told from her point of view for a vast portion of the novel. I have often said that I don't read erotic novels written by men much because said books remind me of Penthouse letters and the stories treat women as objects. During the last few years, it has surprised me to read that many so-called erotic books written by women for women illustrate women as sexual objects and not much else. I read erotica as escapism and therefore am able to suspend disbelief, which is why I am able to read said books with an open mind. However, Chaz Thompson has surprised me with a book that is far less objectionable than Jaid Black's (a female author) futuristic books. His writing is different and intelligent to boot. Don't get me wrong, this book has a lot of storylines centered on male fantasies, the harem being the most obvious one, but I enjoyed reading it immensely. The sex scenes are great! This is pure erotica and one that I look forward to rereading in the future."},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","review":"Although most of these essay were written over eight decades ago, I found them to be extremely timely, especially the title essay. Whitehead shoots straight. He begins by stating that most teachers transmit &quot;inert&quot; ideas in their practice--they teach material that has to practicable bearing on providing any meaningful help to students.He identifies three different stages or rhythms in educational methodology that happen in tandem and in rotation (I visualize a geocentric universe filled with epicycles of rotating moons and planets to illustrate the layers and rings of motion in teaching). He bases these stages on Hegel's Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis, but he adapts them to the classroom and human learning. He calls these rhythms Romance, Precision, and Generalization. In Romance, the teacher needs to awake the sense of wonder and curiosity in a student's mind. This will provide the impetus to pursue the learning to the next stage: Precision. In the second stage, the student studies by drill and repetition the formulae, rules, and grammars that build upon a thorough knowledge of a filed. In the third stage, Whitehead declares that the student needs to move into a realm of Generaliztion. In this rhythm, the student makes connections, applications, and full, mature usage of the material and ideas.I wish more teachers and teachers interested in developing their pedagogical methodolgy would take the time to read this short masterful book."},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","review":"The university that accepted me into its six-year medicine program required that I read this (and other) book(s) during the summer before entering their program.It changed my life! It helped me to think about what I wanted to get out of formal education, how I wanted to develop my own mind through the rest of my life, and how to choose education that serves my objectives. This book made me a more knowledegeable consumer and user of education."},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","review":"Whitehead's essays are timeless. For the reader who instinctively feels that learning must be meaningful to be of value, Whitehead is a must read. This book is well suited to curriculum designers and/or instructors who feel strongly about including experiential activities. Whitehead's insights would be especially useful for decision-makers/sponsors of learning who must demonstrate a positive return on their investment. The first-time reader will have to overcome a sense of frustration that Whitehead's keen observations are as applicable today as when they were written nearly seventy years ago."},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","review":"The highlight of this book is chapter 9 as he discusses ontology, i.e., the nature of what truly exists. He talks about the present as always changing into the past and the future. In other words, the present isn't really present. To illustrate how change occurs he mentions a piece of meat as it is cooking. If left unattended, when will the meat cease to be meat?In places he gets bogged down in jargon and complexity. He starts by discussing education in general, noting that in addition to English, a student should study French and Latin, that certain things can only be known though the original tongue of the author. Overall this is an insightful collection of essays."},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","review":"This book is as fresh and usefull as it was 50 years ago when I first read it. The summary of this book, that is Whitehead's concept of the message to be received from the writing, is the first line of the book. Dr. Whitehead assures us the purpose of education is to enrich life and \\"scraps of information have nothing to do with it.\\" This magnificent book belongs on the shelf of every person who is interested in education of mankind throughout life. We are fortunate to have been blessed by this scholar and humanist."},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","review":"This is a great collection of essays. Whitehead explains in the title essay what we should try to accomplish with education, and in the other essays talks about how to do this. We want to have a powerful and active mind that can connect ideas and solve problems. We have to have a large stock of knowledge to work with, but knowing a large number of facts isn't the proper goal of education. By analogy, we need to know a language to be able to write and thus we need to know many words, but the goal of writing is not to have a large vocabulary. Also, education should enchant people with the power of ideas and make them interested in learning; Whitehead himself says that he would rather have students graduate who enjoy reading literature rather than students who have dissected it and associate it with boredom, because the main use of literature is for exercising the imagination. It's better to be able to get a vivid picture in your head from reading than to list themes that occur in a book.In the title essay Whitehead says that the first thing do with a scientific idea is to prove its worth, because why would someone care to follow the proof of a theorem whose statement they don't understand or whose significance they don't see. I'm specially interested in mathematics education, and Whitehead argues that we can radically reorganize our mathematics curriculum. Why do we spend time teaching the solution of quadratic equations? We are given that a number satisfies a quadratic equation, and this is almost enough information uniquely to nail the number down. But there are certainly many other areas in mathematics where the same game can be played of seeing how uniquely we can determine something from some information. One doesn't need to know the quadratic formula to be able to talk about derivatives or even simple differential equations, and we shouldn't assume that we have to follow the traditional order of the mathematics curriculum. In the essay on mathematics curriculum, Whitehead says that one of the main goals of mathematics in a liberal education is to train students how to handle abstract ideas. There are many topics in higher mathematics that could do this and that would not require that the student first have to learn the cross product or the fundamental theorem of calculus, and that would give the students the feeling that they were in contact with big ideas in a way that finding the derivative of a rational function or finding slant asymptotes fails to do.The two other important ideas in this book that I want to mention are that we will never have enough time to learn even the most important parts of the most important topics (and thus we have to develop good patterns of thought rather than aim to know a lot, since we can never know enough to feel complete), and that there are three stages to learning: initial contact with an idea (romance), learning the right techniques for handling an idea (precision), and then having mastery of the idea (generalization), and that it would be better for students not to be in the same stage for all their subjects. For example, when a student is formally learning grammar they could be introduced to ideas of science without demanding they remember lists of technical terms, and then later when they begin their precise study of science they could be in the romantic stage of, say, history."},{"Title":"The Aims of Education & Other Essays","review":"Whitehead makes some good general points, then a few more specific remarks including a quite interesting defence of the study of classics and a sketchy outline of a mathematics curricula (sensible but rather boring and far from revolutionary: de-emphasise technicalities, skip addition formulae in intro. trig., etc.), then there are three chapters on various aspects of logic and science that have nothing to do with education. Now I quote some highlights. \\"The fading of ideals is sad evidence of the defeat of human endeavour. In the schools of antiquity philosophers aspired to impart wisdom, in modern colleges our humbler aim is to teach subjects. ... I am not maintaining that in the practice of education the ancients were more successful than ourselves. ... But when ideals have sunk to the level of practice, the result is stagnation.\\" (p. 29). \\"The mind is never passive ... You cannot postpone its life until you have sharpened it. Whatever interest attaches to your subject-matter must be evoked here and now; whatever powers you are strengthening in the pupil, must be exercised here and now; whatever possibilities of mental life your teaching should impart, must be exhibited here and now. That is the golden rule of education, and a very difficult rule to follow.\\" (p. 6). \\"The love of a subject in itself and for itself ... is the love of style as manifested in that study. ... Style, in its finest sense, is the last acquirement of the educated mind; it is also the most useful. It pervades the whole being. The administrator with a sense for style hates waste; the engineer with a sense for style economises his material; the artisan with a sense for style prefers good work. Style is the ultimate morality of mind.\\" (p. 12). This last point is relevant for Whitehead's justification for the study of classics, along with \\"the vision of Rome\\" (p. 69)."},{"Title":"Classic Shrewd Challenges","review":"This is one of best puzzle books of all time.

As a result the average pack weight is between 40 and 60 pounds. Ray Jardine, with his background in engineering, approached it with a skeptical eye. Through a series of well thought out strategies, Jardine removed everything that was not absolutely essential, and then found creative ways to reduce the weight of even those items until his pack weight is now a fraction of the average.After reading this book I could not help but wonder if I couldn't apply a similar strategy to my life. What was truly essential and what was fluff that could be left behind? Of the things that are essential, what could be modified to further reduce drag. I am a long way from perfecting this strategy, but I find myself constantly asking the questions that Ray asked as he built his system.If you love backpacking and want to find ways to take it to the next level, this is the book. But even if you don't love backpacking this book has some remarkable lessons in it. Just take a look at what Ray has been able to do over the last few years to see the evidence for a carefully examined strategy."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Don't waste your money buying one of these used for 40 bucks.

The Jardine's are two, rather amazing people (from what I read in the book) and the reader is able to reap the rewards of their trials and errors. I've only finished reading ~130 pages and I see room for improvement.Many of the photos do not have captions, which require the reader to create their own (the photos emphasize the text, but an explanation is helpful).A step-by-step photo illustration of certain processes, similar to an instruction manual, may be helpful (e.g. how to erect a tarp tent with trees/without trees).The book also states &quot;During the night the hiker's body gives off several pounds of moisture.&quot; (p66, Beyond Backpacking). That computes to nearly a half gallon of water (water weights ~8.33 lbs per gallon). The average resting human perspiration rate is 720g/day.On page 114, Mr. Jardine speaks of butane/propane cylinders, &quot;Still, we cannot escape the fact that the empty cartridges are an ecological disaster, considering the huge quantities of them going into landfills. Some types are recycleable, which is nice in theory but rarely practiced.&quot; I assume Mr. Jardine will provide facts to prove his statements (I've never seen huge quantities in landfills). I could continue, however, the review text has limitations (and I've not finished the book).Bear in mind that this book is geared toward the 3-season ultra-light (ultra-obsessive?) hiker (&quot;...from the factory weighs 1 ounce...I grind the excess plastic away, reducing its weight to 0.85 ounce.&quot; P127, Beyond Backpacking. 0.15 ounces weighs ~0.0095 lbs, which weighs less than the dirt stuck to the bottom of a shoe).I believe that Mr. Jardine is a very knowledgeable person, however, he uses opinions to substantiate a large amount of his reasoning.Overall, this is a rather informative book for any hiker/backpacker and is definitely worth purchasing (and should be read with a grain of salt)."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"In a society whose population has grown soft from the amenities and conveniences of modern culture, few can begin to comprehend what it takes to complete the mega-hikes accomplished by the author. Even within the backpacking world, much is revealed as far as fitness, assimilation with environment, self-reliance, and goal setting are concerned.Yet this book really does go beyond backpacking; in its iconoclastic views on foot travel, in its celebration of minimalism, and most importantly, in it's subtle questioning of society's values. Rather than merely an esoteric blueprint for the hardcore backpacker, this book is an uplifting example of what can be experienced athletically, logistically, and even spiritually if one can let go of the expectations of modern life and simply walk unencumbered for months on end.\\"Beyond Backpacking\\" revolutionized the world of long distance hiking by calling into question what is truly needed to sustain an epic trek. It will, at the least, make you re-evaluate the gear collecting dust in your closet.

Not just a eccentric, he's a millionaire that wants to cry poor. The more you get into Jardines life you will see on his webpage he advises you to buy $10.000 sewing machines and buy $100 worth of materials and a 100 hours to make what basically is a $6 army duffel bag, you know the ones with the shoulder straps. Then he takes any labels off any gear or covers the labels, because he won't endorse any gear without his name. Dah you endorced Pfaff,Elna,Bernia and Viking sewing machines. What's with that then? Oh and on his website he crying about the bugs and afraid his Giant North face V-25 geo dome don't blow over, but broke a tent rod and didn't know how to fix it. I'd get a real charge out of his tarptent followers when he knows better than to really use one. Looks like a $20 dollar tarp to me that you had to buy a $10K sewing machine to make. Don't follow this advice he gives. For in real life, he pays someone with a big van to follow him to every road crossing with over 500 pounds of gear or take him to the motor inn like bear grills did. That's the way. the real rayway. We could all do one up on him, just carry a credit card a cell phone and have the van follow you. Enough said.But if you really want to start backpacking. the book to buy is by the past Colin Fletcher, \\"THE COMPLETE WALKER\\". And if you don't want to get nasty like me, don't read Nessmuk. Nessnuk is the real deal, they didn't have vans back in the day. For example; Jardine used a 110 pound Coleman canoe on one of his rich vacations and cried so much, I think he took down that journal. Nessmuk on the other hand over 100 years ago made a 11 pound canoe and his full pack weight was ligher yet and canoed right across the great lakes. That takes some guts. Jardines on a head trip to, he's mental, he's got no proof that he invented freinds, yet he keeps claiming he did. Everyone that climbs knows better, that he is nuts.Global Climbing, how expensive is that of a hobby anyway? Well if your in that rich eccentric group upper level group, trying to fit in us lower level slumdogs. Then go for it. Otherwise the rest of you would do better with real life book by the late Colin Fletcher. And if you read this ray, think I'm full of it, lets do a test on the old canol trail, with no support teams, with your RAYWAY junk, and see who wins. Lets go in the fall to.

I believe that Ray Jardine's techniques and philosophy will revolutionize hiking and camping. Currently, thousands of hikers are beginning to enjoy the benefits of going light; weather the hike is a five miler or a thirty mile hike. The long distance hiker is able to go farther in less time, and he or she is much more comfortable due to the economy and decrease in weight. Eventually, millions of hikers throughout the world will derive these benefits."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Ray approaches \\"the ultralight philosophy\\" like a recovering alcoholic preaching about the evils of \\"demon rum\\". The one thing all these ultralight writers have in common is they once carried ridiculous loads like sherpas, and finally saw the light. Who was ever that idiotic? Most of us figured out long ago that lighter is better, and I've never seen anyone outside of a paratrooper carry 60 plus lb. loads. He reminds me of a kid I knew in 5th grade that maintained he invented the word (insert common racial epithet).Jardine brings nothing new to backpacking, except for the digusting habit of hiking in biking shorts. For the most part his book consists common sense tips on lessening the load, interspersed with egomaniacal psuedo-spiritual diatribes. Other highlights include some incredibly stupid thoughts on giardia, mosquitos and food.Save your money, buy Colin Fletcher's book.

Sure, if you wanna race against mother nature to get from mexico to canada in 4 months, but I don't think anyone has ever fully enjoyed the experience cruising along the PCT 20+ miles a day continuously. However, I do like the idea of making my own gear, but his extreme behavior and belief system really puzzles me. While reading I asked myself; Does he want people to believe he's some revolutionary founder of lightweight backpacking? I guess that would explain his gloating of his small following called &quot;Jardinites&quot; (he proudly exclaims in the book), that believe his practices and beliefs are on par with Charles Darwin and other great influencial minds of our past. I say, &quot;wake up you simpletons&quot; it's all common sense!

To me, both criticisms seem to have missed the point. To me, the great value of Jardine's book(s), his website, and other writings is thus:1. you can build it, sew it, or make it yourself. you don't have to buy it from the outdoor industry, if you don't want to.2. comfort and enjoyment are possible (and sometimes alot more probable) without alot of the stuff that we think are necessities.3. less weight doesn't mean that you have to go faster, but that you can go faster when necessary or desirable. it's not speed, but efficiency that matters.4. and, most importantly: YOU can figure out the best way to do things, even if they don't make sense to anyone else."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Anyone interested in backpacking should read this book first.

Or you may love him. In either case, regardless of your backpacking experience, you should read this book, or at least parts of it. By using many (not all) of Jardine's suggestions, I have stripped pounds off my back, without sacrificing comfort. I have also stripped ounces.I have been wilderness backpacking for about ten years. Using many of Jardine's recommendations, this year I have hiked parts of the Inca Trail (Machu Pichu, Peru), the Continental Divide Trail, and the Appalachian Trail (234 miles barefoot, and counting). My opinion is -- nothing I did to prepare was as valuable as reading, and thinking about, this book. And never has my backpacking been so enjoyable.One additional comment. I found Jardine irritating at times. His emphasis is so much on speed (miles per day) that I'm tempted to ask -- if all you're interested in is getting to the end of the trail as quickly as possible, why don't you hitchhike? He also doesn't seem to enjoy the people he meets while hiking, which rubs me the wrong way. But, setting these (mild) criticisms aside, this book deserves to be in the reference section of your personal library."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Ray Jardine presents his eccentric, provocative approach to backpacking. I would not recommend this approach to a beginner, but only an experienced backpacker. Some of his ideas go beyond eccentric to nutty--he speaks approvingly of walking barefoot, for example, or of eliminating the very innovations that have done the most to improve backpacking--sleeping pads, stoves, hip belts. And his numbers never quite add up--by his own admission, his &quot;eight and a half pound pack&quot; can weigh up to fifty pounds. Nevertheless, the book is worth reading for the challenge he presents, and also for some of his advice on particular issues (handling ice and snow for example). One reviewer called this book the &quot;most comprehensive,&quot; but I would certainly see it as less so than Complete Walker IV, which I would recommend to everyone."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"This book will strike a positive chord with anyone who enjoys spending time in a wilderness setting. Being in the wilderness is all about stepping into nature's world and out of our own, more ordinary, &quot;civilized&quot; one. Here is a book that describes how to do this fully. A big focus of the book is packweight. Jardine focuses on what nature requires of us, as opposed to what some salesman in a suburban mall sporting goods store feels we require. There is a big difference between the two.I have been reading (and rereading) Jardines's books over the years and this one is his best. It incorporates and expands upon earlier versions. (It doesn't have his PCT trail itineraries though.) As a begining backpacker, I was most concerned about safety issues - how to judge a creek for fording, remove ticks, use an ice axe, etc. It's the best information source I found for all these types of things. With more experience and subsequent readings, the stuff I'd glossed over initially got more interesting and that is the beauty of this book - its great depth.I really get the sense thruout the book that this author is passionate about his subject and about nature and longs to involve the reader to the same level he himself is immersed. It's a great book."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"It seems many people get upset with this book because it tells us the opposite of the big outdoor goods manufactors and their advertisers. Ray can get a little preachy but his ideas are worth listening to. Many people have used his ideas and found out that you dont need to carry 60 pounds on your back. Also, let us not forget that lite weight backpacking is anything new. A 67 year old women in 1954 thru hiked the Apalachian Trail in 1954 with a 20 pound pack and wearing natural fibers. She did it again 2 years later. His easy to follow instructions are great. Instead of spending $200-300 on a pack, make one for yourself. The same goes for a sleeping bag and tent. All of the materials are very easy to find. If you arent sure, make a pack for $20 and go on a 2-3 day hike only carry 20 pounds or less and see how much enjoyable your hike will be. people say how can you enjoy a trail if you walk 20 miles a day. Well, the reason you are doing 20 miles a day is because you arent hampered by all the weight. You actually get to look up and see what is going on around you instead of staring at your feet because of the weight of the pack. Maybe this book may not be for the casual hiker(although they could learn alot and may hike more) because there is alot of information here. Many hikers and backpackers here will be turned off because they just spent $1000 on equipment they didnt really need. Even so, you bought the stuff, still there are many ways to cut the weight of your burden. The man is an expert in backpacking, that is given.

But his arguments are reasoned ones. This is the strength of his book. You can take it or leave it based on the arguments. Jardine is also certainly arguing from his particular value system. If you don't agree with the system then you won't agree with everything he says. Why slander him? I've read and reread this book and its predecessor, The Pacific Crest Trail Hiker's Handbook. I've learned a lot and disagreed with a little. When I disagree its usually with his goals not his methods. I don't think Jardine has ever intimated that his goals should automatically be your goals. If you're interested in minimal gear hiking this book is a good introduction that should be read critically. Some readers are uncomfortable with the tone of the book.

Because he explains the reasons behind his methods."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"A comparison to the controversial works of Charles Darwin is needed to understand the essence of Ray Jardine and the revolution the book &quot;Beyond Backpacking&quot; has created. When Ray Jardine published &quot;Beyond Backpacking&quot;, similar events occured to the episode of Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species&quot;. Following the circulation of these books brought about extreme contention world wide. From the uniqueness of their ideas so far from the norm, yet unquestionable efficiency when applied to their application brought to the public that &quot;fearful&quot; state we call change. What Darwin has done for science is what Ray Jardine accomplished for backpacking. To doubt the significance of either of these men's books would be idiotic. Wether adoption of Jardine's (or for that mater Darwin's) ideas occurs is up to the individual, but in my opinion, any book which makes a society rethink &quot;sound beliefs&quot; is worth reading."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Condescendance and a zealous behavior are not the way to present something different.

Sure, I can see in a few instances where his practices would benefit a long distance hiker, but recent general concensus from Backpacker magazine has concluded that the vast majority of backpackers are uninterested in Jardine's obsessive approach. Nevertheless, there are a few that revel in his ways and it's safe to say many of these people take greater pleasure in obsessing over pack weight than actually being out in the wilderness."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"The &quot;advice&quot; and information in this book is pure junk. I learned nothing new about minimizing my backpacking load except that some idiots are willing to put up with any amount of unpleasantness and discomfort to have bragging rights about carrying very little equipment.Among the author's ridiculous suggestions are: cut the tongues out of your shoes; scrub your pots clean with weeds, leaves or pine needles; and bring an umbrella to fend of rain and hot sun (I'd like to see him try that while hiking through Tazmania with rain blowing sideways because of the gale force winds). He also advocates not using bear canisters, which will get you kicked out of most U.S. National Parks in California.The author claims to have minimized his backpacking load to 8.44 pounds, but this doesn't include any food or water. What, pray tell, is he going to subsist on while taking his lovely unencumbered hikes? Worse still, his system depends on having hiking partner who is willing to share the load with you. The book's advice is useless if you are a solo hiker.Don't waste your money on this book.

Contrary to other reviewers, I find him willing to share his experiences and findings and is perfectly willing to let me make up my own mind and incorporate just those things I feel will help me.Yes, he is more focused on his personal, internal relationship with nature, and less so with those around him. That is his choice, and you can still be social and lightweight. Mileage is also much more important to him than many of us, but again, that is just personal philosophy.I don't see him as anyone trying to grow a religious '&quot;lightweight&quot; cult, but rather someone who is very focused on his experiences outdoors and wants to share some of his ideas with others. I really appreciate the anti-commercial and DIY focus of his gear recommendations (learned to sew!), the downright truthful look at nutrition and I even like his philosophy of experiencing nature. But I make up my own mind and these are just data points. Be a bit more open minded and you'll be surprised at what you can extract from this tome.So in short, this is a highly recommended book that will teach you much and prepare you to build/modify your own ideas on being in the out-of-doors."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Ray Jardine is a purist in the art of ultra-light backpacking.

What a shock to find out that they were also thru-hikers. After that I read his first book on hiking the PCT and have incorporated several of his techniques.

BB has a lot of information that is missing in the other backpacking books such as: stretching excercises, campsite selection ideas that will keep you warmer and safer and drier, knot tying, blister prevention, hiking enjoyment, sewing your own equipment. Ray Jardine pays a lot of attention to safety, as well.This book shows that you don't need expensive equipment to begin summer backpacking.

The tone of the book is very positive as well, as Jardine refrains from casting different methods in a negative light.The book also has an appealing &quot;outside the box&quot; thinking process with innumerable bits of tips and wisdom and that can lead to more enjoyment of anyone's wilderness experience. Personally this book has guided me to a much easier way of camping, as well as travelling in general."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"I agree with all the 5-star ratings here. Ray Jardine has used his experience, education, and logical mind to improve on (by most often simplifying) equipment, technique, and I dare say the philosophy of backpacking. I may never be an ultralight backpacker, but this book lightened my pack by 20 pounds!...and for that it was most valuable. Many &quot;myths&quot; of backing are debunked in this book. He carefully looks at the advantages and disadvantages of each piece of equipment and how it relates to the goals of the journey. Just for example: tarps vs. tents. I particularly enjoyed his reasons for &quot;stealth&quot; camping. He deals frankly with the bear and cougar issues and personal safety. I especially liked the section on sewing your own gear."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"For me this book had a lot of tips i am using now on my trips.

This gives me a much greater opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors. It seems that most hikers and backpackers are lightening their loads. Some at more extreme levels and other just a little here and there. Some of us are almost fanatical about it while others are more sensible in lightening the loads on their backs and feet. I would like to give Ray and his wife a heartfelt thanks for helping me make hiking more enjoyable.."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Beyond Backpacking, or as a short desription would read, Enlightening the Outdoor Experience, is truly a work based on the authors experience and his desire to share those experiences with others. It is written in an easy flowing, well thought out, posative and friendly manner. I seemed to breeze through its pages absorbing new and exciting information with what impressed me as profound simplicity. The kind of information that only someone who has mastered a subject or endeavor can formulate and then relay in such an easy to understand manner.Backpacking and the outdoor experience in general tends to be advertised as overly complicated and burdensome. Ray Jardine presents a system with methods and understandings that the novice hiker and experienced adventurer can benefit from.Beyond Backpacking has provided me a sturdy bridge transforming what used to be &quot;getting ready for war with nature&quot; into &quot;experiencing a connected experience with nature&quot;."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Mr. Jardine's book is the most useful book on the topic of backpacking that I have read. It's greatest value is that it encourages the reader to think for his or herself. It asks the question, &quot;is the way we have been backpacking the most efficient, the most enjoyable?&quot; The answer to that question is found through direct experience with Jardine's ideas. I have begun experimenting with these ideas and found the experience very rewarding. For example, I used the polyethylene tarp on a 5-day trip through the Olympic National Park. My buddy and I slept warm and dry each night at a fraction of the weight of a typical two person tent.Beyond Backpacking is much more than a guide to lighter gear. It is a how-to manual for enhancing all aspects of the wilderness experience. Very inspiring!"},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"In this book, Ray Jardine lays out his tested and true methods of backpacking. The book is very personal. Reviewers who complain that it is preachy are taking it wrongly, in my opinion. RJ states how he does it, what he has found that works for him, and he shares it with the reader. I don't think it's meant to be a backpacker's \`bible', rather one man's account of a very successful system (RJ has thousands of hiking miles logged to back it up). The same goes for the more philosophical passages. Personally, I find them refreshing and relevant reminders of the real purpose and benefit of getting out on the trail.Folks who trash the book because they've found a bit of advice or two that won't work for them are throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And they may be misinterpreting what is being said. Does anybody really think that RJ wouldn't understand the impracticality of using an umbrella in a sideways-blowing gale? Would it comfort these small minds if RJ prefaced every sentence with \\"in my opinion, under certain circumstances...\\"? Can a personal statement be made in print, or is \\"one size fits all\\" the ordure of the day?Don't want to drink untreated water? Then don't. But obviously, using the guidelines for evaluating water sources outlined in the book, this man has, evidently without serious consequence. There's no guarantee- it's up to you to deal with the risk or not.I learned a lot, and was provoked into considering all of my gear and my entire approach to hiking. More valuably, I got a close look at one independent-thinking and very accomplished hiker's system. No, it all won't work for me. I will not, under normal circumstances, sleep with all my insulation layers on in order to save weight on my quilt or bag (too uncomfortable). Ray does. I can understand and tolerate this difference in preference without deriding the author as some kind of charlatan or crackpot.This is an excellent book, worth reading for any serious backpacker. I do believe it is more relevant to a long distance hiker than someone out for a weekend, but having a lighter and more comfortable hiking experience is a goal worth pursuing in either case. Perhaps above all, this book encourages self-reliance (making one's own gear, discovering things that work through actually trying them, etc.) and finding one's own way rather than relying on second-hand information (most insidiously from advertising). I'm grateful to Ray and Jenny for this book. Essential for the backpacker's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"We are overwhelmed with advertising insisting the backcountry requires 70lbs of gear. Learn how to take 8.5 lbs instead. Some Backpackers want luxury in the wilderness, well try taking only 8.5lbs of equipment with you. That truly is luxury... No sore backs and wrecked feet. Even though I have never done a 2000 mile plus thru-hike I have used all of Ray's ideas on many treks from 20 miles to 200.This book makes the outdoors more of a pleasure and I would recommend it to anyone planning a trip of more than 2 days. It will save you tons of money and tons of weight."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Though I did find some useful practices in Mr.Jardines book, I find this man to have a personality like a religious cult leader. He presents his ideas and beliefs as though they are scripture and that we are the flock of sheep(mindless followers) he seeks control of. Remember: backpacking is a very simple activity, not a race to finish the fastest or most efficiently, we have enough of that in society. After all, anyone with common sense knows a lighter pack is easier on the back. I do agree with Jardine's point of people falling into the marketing traps of gear makers. So in that regard I feel the book is worth reading if your looking to shed a few pounds by making your own gear. Aside from that, Collin Fletcher's &quot;Complete Walker III&quot; is a nonzealous, practical and the most informative book to backpacking I've read."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"A Good book if you haven't already got \\"The Pacific Crest Trail\\" by Ray Jardine.Much of the same information is in \\"Beyond Backpacking\\" as was in \\"The Pacific Crest Trail\\". This shows me Ray Jardine gave out all his information in his first book so now he really has nothing more to tell. You might as well have put one cover on the other with the exception of a very few changes. In fairness though, it is a great book if you don't have \\"The Pacific Crest Trail\\". But I don't think you need them both. It is all the same ultra-light backpacking techniques, and backpacking safety,equipment,and hiking methods in both books.

Quite a bit of what he says seems like commonsense once you read it, but most backpackers wouldn't have thought of it. For instance, once you realize how much lighter a soda bottle is than the thick plastic water bottles sold at REI, it seems like a no-brainer to switch. It took me years to realize how much unnecessary weight, space, and expense I was devoting to stove, fuel, and freeze-dried packaged food, when in fact I could enjoy non-cooked alternatives just as much. On the other hand, a lot of the advice in this book is only relevant if you're planning on doing very long hikes. He states a lot of opinions as facts, or calls them \\"discoveries.\\" Some of these opinions just seem goofy to me. No way am I going to use a drafty quilt instead of a mummy bag. His statements about the amount of water people need to drink are part of an urban folktale that's grown in the telling over the last few decades, and many of his statements about hydration have been scientifically disproved, e.g., it's not true that coffee is dehydrating. The section on food is a longwinded, pseudoscientific screed on health food and whole grains, full of anecdotal evidence about how he personally felt bad when he ate pasta, and good when he ate whole grains."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"i am an experianced outdoors man and new to the world of backpacking. this book has all the info on how to pack how to organize a extended trek and invaluable concepts for any beginer or seasoned hiker. there is chapters on potential dangers of wilderness packing, ticks poisonous plants, animal danger, hygiene, and how to cope w/ each of the elemants. if you're experianced in backpacking it may change you're point of view or hiking style all together. i highly recomend this book to any one new to this style outdoor adventure. :)"},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"This book is in large part outdated from the available commercial equipment point of view.However the book is very well organized and very well written, regardless howopinionated it is.The material is written for a chronic light (no) weight fanatic, not an enthusiast.I am an advocate for light weight bacpacking, in most part because I am getting older, but without crossing into the field of being anal about it.

The best thing about it is if you only listen to half of the book it will increase your enjoyment of the back country ten fold. When I first went hiking decades ago my pack was 25lbs because I couldn't afford much equipment. As I started to hike more often and accumulate more gear, I loaded myself down more and more until one horrible trip where I resembled a pack mule carrying more than 70 lbs (and that is without water)! The 110 mile trip went uncompleted and was not very fun and I just assumed it was because I needed to be in better shape. Then I bought Ray's book... the simple idea of weighing everything you bring with you changed my camping life. By my next trip, I shed 40 lbs out of my pack and by the time I went back to the same 110 mile trip a few years later I had a pack weight of just under 11 pounds (that is with gear for those of you that have packs that themselves weigh 8 lbs) not including water and food. I laughed as I flew by the people weighed down by 70 lb packs... it was the most enjoyable and easy I had taken... 110 miles with most of it over 10,000 feet.There is no reason to do everything Ray says, he does get a little spiritual... Take what he says and apply it to you. I would never go hiking without shoes like Ray sometimes does, but I threw out my insanely heavy and expensive \\"hiking\\" boots and bought some very light trail running shoes--they work great--as an application of Ray's philosophy to my hiking."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"The whole time I read this book, I couldn't stop thinking about Mesquito Coast.

In other words, I recommend reading the book even if you won't necessarily enjoy it the whole time. As someone who perenially carries a house with him when hiking, there are a number of useful suggestions in this book and it offers a fresh approach to hiking.

I'd go so far as to say, I likely would not have completed my PCT throughhike without this book.Though most of the book is condensed wisdom, some of Jardine's suggestions struck me as dubious. For example:1) Suggesting people will get used to giardia is irresponsible. Some may, some may not. Sitting on a porcelain throne is no way to spend your hike.2) Quilts are cold and drafty. The bottoms of sleeping bags, where the insulation is compressed, do provide a function: they keep the cold air out.3) Taking your own silverware to a restaurant is dubious. There are many ways to get digestive tract illness, dirty silverware at a restaurant is just one and not the most likely.4) People taking help from trail angels are not parasites. (Though people expecting help from trail angels may be.)5) Many people need to eat for comfort as well as nutrition. I don't recommend Ray's trail menu unless you are not fond of eating.6) Recommending stealth camping as a tactic to avoid bears was also irresponsible. Many people do not take bear canisters, get nervous when bears stalk their camp and then try hanging their food, which the bears happily eat. This is driving the Rangers nuts as bears increasingly become habituated to people food, making the bears potentially dangerous.7) Do not count on vibrational harmony keeping mosquitoes away. Odds are, most bugs haven't read Jardine's book and don't know you are in vibrational harmony with them. Use DEET.Still anyone hiking should benefit from this book. Just don't let Mr. Jardine do all the thinking for you."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Most beginning backpackers buy what looks like the best equipment using ads in magazines, recommendations of store personnel, and suggestions from friends who occasionally hike. I did the same, and found myself overloaded with goods, out a lot of money, and struggling on the trail. I couldn't help think that there must be a better way. I looked through several books on backpacking before going out and overlooked this one because of the title. I thought the title, Beyond Backpacking, suggested a text for experienced backpackers - not me. After an initial arduous struggle, I read and bought the book. Beyond Backpacking is the answer to easy and economical backpacking - and it is more relevant to beginners.Ray's book covers the basics of backpacking without any hype and dispels many of its myths. Important items, such as footwear, clothing, backpacks, food, cooking utensils and tents, are covered in unexpected detail and clarity. For example, I thought the best shoes for backpacking were the sturdiest, thickest full-grained leather with gore-tex liners. Ray jokingly mocks the boot advertisements and explains why a lightweight pair of trail sneakers works better. Another good example, with clothing, is the selection of socks. He uses and recommends thin nylon socks because they are durable, inexpensive, somewhat breathable, and easy to hand wash and dry. I think I unknowingly wasted about $15 bucks on each pair of smartwool socks.Ray's writing is clear and easy to follow. Each subject is covered very thoroughly. Beginners, like myself, may want to skim through some sections to gain some basic knowledge and understanding. More advanced backpackers may want to read sections more thoroughly and compare their knowledge and experience with his. Mr. Jardine provides his C.V.; listing some of his hikes, trail experience, and manufacturing experience. He qualifies as an expert and, in the text, usually points out where others' views differ.As a person, I am very critical. Under most circumstances I would not give a book a five star rating. This one gets it because it is well written, covers the subject thoroughly, and, if I would have been smart enough to read this book before shopping for gear, I would have saved several times its cost, been more comfortable on the trail, and traveled farther and easier. My only criticism of the book is the misleading title. What is \\"Beyond backpacking\\"? Kayaking? Bicycle touring? Astral projection? Virtual camping? I overlooked this book when starting out because of the title. This book is a worthwhile investment for the beginning backpacker and may also appeal to the experienced backpacker unfamiliar with the lighter less expensive approach to enjoying the outdoors."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Jardine is a VERY experienced hiker, backpacker, and climber; he's done it all, many times. In this book he basically says, &quot;here's how I do it, you may want to do that too.&quot;A word of caution before you approach this book: it is not for novices or people approaching hiking/ backpacking with initial enthusiasm and expecting an uplifting and nicely illustrated book. Jardine's tone is often critical of established hiking practices. Some of his own suggestions will seem extreme or absurd to a novice. You need to have gone to a few overnight hikes before you can start to understand, let alone agree with, Jardine.Pros:Tried and true strategies from an experienced expert. As an experienced hiker, I agree with Jardine in most of the book, even if I do not practice similarly. The most useful advice is on ruthlessly cutting down the weight of your pack and gear. Also very useful are his insights on &quot;stealth&quot; camping, water purification, trail food, footwear, dealing with bears and bugs, etc. He even covers the use of ice axes! The book is a relatively large compendium of thought provoking ideas.Cons:You must know where Jardine's coming from in this book: 100-day long continuous hikes of the Pacific Crest Trail and other mega-hikes. This type of outdoor activity does not appeal to me, and I bet most of us won't be doing it either (got time to take a 100-day vacation? wanna spend it all in the woods?). Here are a couple of examples of how the mega-hike mentality skews the usefulness of the advice in this book. Jardine pushes for cutting down on pack weight. However, he mentions how he lugs along many gallons of watter on long and dry trail stretches, and as we all know, water is about the heaviest bulk in your pack. Also, he says, don't stuff your down bag in the sack, it will lose its loft. Of course it will, if you hike 100 days non-stop!!! But if I go for a weekend overnight, I certainly want the lightest and smallest package, which means a tightly stuffed down bag. Jardine also lashes out against the supposedly low nutritional value of dehydrated bag-meals, which may also contain additives like MSG. If I hiked 100 days non-stop, I would also care about this. However, on the occasional overnight hike, I want a tasty, no-hassle warm meal, that is also light to carry, and dehydrated does it for me. In addition, the consistent insistence on making your own gear is a tad bit extreme; there are plenty of lightweight options in outdoor shops nowadays.Overall: read this book. My cons section is longer than the pro's since I did not list all the good ideas Jardine has :) He is very passionate about hiking and very experienced; his writing is biased, yet his ideas are useful and interesting."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Like Ray Jardine, I learned my camping and backpacking skills in Scouts. Like Ray, I was so prepared for any contingency that I could hardly lift my pack. Unlike Ray, I didn't figure it out for myself--I had to read his book.Ray's basic theory is that if you pack light enough, you can travel 2 or 3 times further with the same energy. Although inspired by long-distance hiking, the techniques and ideas can make short trips more enjoyable.I haven't tried everything in his book yet, but everything I have tried has worked. Ray's innovative challenge to conventional backpack thinking is nothing short of revolutionary."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"In this book, Ray Jarnine puts forth a total reinvention of the culture of backpacking around the principle that &quot;less is more&quot;. The author offers many clever techniques for drastically reducing packweigt and then argues that this can lead you to travel faster, enjoy your trip much more let alone save big bucks. Furthermore Jardine argues, that less overmarketed gear allows for fewer distractions and a more effective connection with the outside world.My experience experimenting with the &quot;Ray Way&quot; during a long distance hike was overwhelmingly positive. The running shoes, the super light homemade backpack and the tarp which are the three pillars of the Ray Way allowed me to cut several kg of my packweight. There are two caveats on the flip side. Since I did most of my hiking in moderate wheather, I really do wonder how packing so sparsely would work in colder and wetter conditions. Also regarding the switch from bulky hiking boots to running shoes, I recommend taking Ray's advice and building balance, ankle stength and reducing packweight before throwing any boots away.Finally, it must be emphasized that this book totally goes against the status quo. Be ready before you start reading it. It turns the culture of hiking completely on its head. Yet this book also presents some dramatically innovative and thought provoking ideas. For walkers that are open to trying something new and also for those that would like to think more about the philosophy behind spending time outside, this book is a must read.The reason this book is rated 4 out of 5 despite the innovative content is because the author can a get a little carried away into discussion of hiking philosophy that occasionall sounds like &quot;a little too much&quot;. This is a liability and detracts from the overall credibility of the book."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"This book is the most phenomenal book on outdoor travel that I have ever seen. I was under the very mistaken impression that backpacking involved huge investments in money, and a great deal of suffering. I found out how wrong I was. After reading this book I did a backpacking trip with 8 pounds of gear (excluding food and water), and it was by far the most enjoyable backpacking trip I have ever done. It made the trip seem like a plesant stroll in the wilderness rather then hours of labor under a huge pack. It is often misunderstood that Jardine recomends these methods in order to go faster. I believe that he recomends these methods because they are more fun, easier, and less expensive. Speed it merely a pleasant by-product, because carrying an 8 pound pack isn't hard work! I read the &quot;Pacific Crest Trail Hikers Handbook&quot;, which is essentially the first edition of this book. In &quot;Beyond Backpacking&quot;, Jardine simply added some more information and removed the info specific to the Pacific Crest Trail itself. Either version is highly recomended. I spent hundreds of dollars on unecessary, heavy gear.This book would have saved me a lot of money, had I bought it sooner."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Ray Jardine was a radical backpacker when Beyond Backpacking was written, or so it seems.Beyond Backpacking is a great book which covers a varied range of topics - from equipment to food to trail hazards. It offers great advice and tips about backpacking in different conditions and dealing with trail life. The focus of the book is ultra light backpacking, hiking with only the lightest equipment you need. Yet Jardine preaches the entire book against being part of the Western world, including but not limited to endless rants and scowls at manufactures and modern food. This tends to be annoying at first and gets boring later on.I must warn you not to take anything for granted. Jardine states a lot of \\"facts\\" in his book, some of which are untrue, others are not confirmed. Pick and choose as you go - when Jardine wrote this book he worked two-three months every year. While he has to cut and save you can hike in more comfort and struggle with less logistics by spending more money.Before taking in kind of action influenced by this book I suggest that you (a) figure out what really fits your own hike (AKA Hike your own hike, not Ray Jardine's hike) and (b) search the internet about ultra light backpacking. Jardine simply does not discuss any cons that any of his techniques and methods might hold - while quite a lot of hikers have homepages discussing the pros and cons of certain lightweight techniques.Beyond Backpacking is an important and inspirational read. Just remember that the situation of gear nowadays is different to five years ago, and most importantly do not to take anything written for granted - do your research before hiking"},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"I have backpacked most of my life using traditional methods and traditional gear. A few years ago, I heard about a man by the name of Ray Jardine who was developing radical new ideas and methods to enable people to travel into the wilderness with very lightweight equipment. After reading his book &quot;Beyond Backpacking&quot; I experimented with virtually every idea in the book and found them all to be extremely useful, efficient, and safe. In short, Ray's methods allowed me to enjoy the outdoors at a level that I had never before experienced.The book is very well organized, clearly written, and presents ideas in such a way that makes one wonder &quot;Why didn't I think of that before?&quot; This is a must read for both experienced and beginning adventurers and is already a classic among experienced backpackers."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Ray Jardine has written my favorite book on backpacking. I was expecting a nutty, opinionated rant. What I found instead was an incredibly positive, articulate and informative book. I've been backpacking regularly for years but I can honestly say that this book taught me a lot and opened my eyes more than once. It's not critical of other backpacking styles and it doesn't create fears- it dispels them. After reading this book, I was so hyped up by his positive attitude and deep love for the outdoors that it made me want to get out even more. He points out that we've been taught to fear the outdoors by equipment manufacturers who want us to buy all their bombproof, leadweight gear to deal with improbable situations on the trail. Much of this gear is not optimally functional and comes between us and the outdoor experience. He liberates us by teaching us to make our own gear and modify what we've bought.He deals with many aspects of backpacking not even touched upon by larger books like \\"Complete Walker IV\\". \\"Beyond backpacking\\" is largely dedicated to backpacking practice, rather than just a long gear list. That's exactly why I learned so much even after having read two books by Chris Townsend and one by Colin Fletcher.If you go into this book having decided that lightweight backpacking is a fad, you're not going to like it. This book is not a fad, however, and Jardine doesn't even use the trendy word \\"ultralight\\". After reading this book, my pack went from 25 pounds to 10 and my daily mileage has doubled with no extra effort. The numbers are just numbers to me though, the important thing is that I feel my new backpacking style has brought me closer to what I go outdoors to enjoy.He does have some 'mystical' moments that might not appeal to some, but I just see it as him expressing his great love of the outdoors. If it bothers you, just ignore those passages. He also comes to a few conclusions I disagree with, but these were minor. The book might be a bit too advanced for someone just getting started.Overall, an extremely liberating and encouraging book! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"When I was a boy scout, me and many of my fellow scouts completed the wilderness survival merit badge. Armed with only a swiss army knife, and a knowledge of edible plants, we had to survive in the wild for a number of days. I don't know how many scouts, outdoor students and military personnel undergo this type of training, but it really teaches you what is important to bring with you on a camping trip. After undergoing this type of training, you are never the same. No matter what anyone says, you know what is important and what isn't in the wild. Most backpackers quickly come to an understanding about pack weight too. I think there has been an unspoken understanding among most experienced backpackers that the ideal is to feel like you are on a day hike, but still provide the basics. It just feels different to carry less and to be more into nature, less weighted down. It really has nothing to do with covering more miles. I think Ray Jardine talks about miles because it is an objective measure of what you can do if you carry less--you can also walk fewer miles and enjoy them more. Most backpackers care more about the journey than the destination. Communing with nature is not a religious cult, it's why we go backpacking in the first place. So, I think Ray Jardine is not saying anything that any experienced backpacker doesn't know when it comes to being as light as possible. I see Mr. Jardine's contribution more in field-testing certain methods in certain terrains, and in thinking deeply about how things are done. For example, before I read his book, I would just camp in any old place- preferably one that looked like a campsite. Reading about, and thinking about campsite selection makes this whole process a lot more rational and sensible. The value of this book for me is that it stimulates thought about things I never really thought about before. I think it accomplishes its purpose if it gets you to think. I think this book should be read really critically, not accepting any of it until you field test it for yourself, and observe closely how well it works for you. I would be especially leery of the nutrition bits. Anyone who wants to think about nutrition should first figure out what their body needs when it is backpacking, and then figure out the best way of meeting those needs. To figure out your needs, you first need to understand a little biochemistry/physiology: what nutrients are used for what purpose in your body, and when are they used up? Some people take multi-vitamins with them on backpacking trips--this has always seemed a little excessive to me based on my understanding of the physiology of vitamin metabolism. You should also watch yourself--what foods do you crave? When do you feel full or hungry? When does a meal on the trail feel complete? Another valuable thing about this book, which I have yet to try myself, is the home-made gear ideas. A lot of the ideas look really good, and I am anxious to learn to sew after reading this book. If you are an inexperienced backpacker, you should definitely read this book to find out what every experienced backpacker knows. If you are inexperienced, you shouldn't even attempt the PCT without the training suggested in the book or its substantial equivalent. Anyone who is experienced will have an appreciation of the magnitude of the mental and physical training required for a trek of this length. If you are an experienced backpacker, you can get a lot of ideas that are worthy of being tested to see if they agree with you. I think almost anyone who reads this book will think of at least two ways they can make their backpacking technique better, or shave at least a pound or two off of the weight they carry. If you haven't invested in any gear yet, you can probably save a significant percentage off the cost of equipping yourself, if you are willing to make it yourself. Making your own gear will probably give you a sense of pride about it, (judging by the home-made gear pages on the web) and plus, you'll know how to fix it if it breaks. This book can give you some ideas on that too. Other innovations are on the web. Many serious backpackers have often felt like modern technology which makes things lighter has trickled down to backpacking too slowly, and that manufacturers have not been responsive to backpackers' needs. This is changing now with the ultralight \\"movement\\", which Ray Jardine, among others, is partially responsible for. So I am willing to forgive any tirades in the book. I would consider this book a \\"must read\\" if you are interested in deepening your backpacking technique. I have read on the web on people's web pages, over an over again, how backpackers have read this book, and it has stimulated them to try things out, and get out more, and get more out of getting out. Things they previously thought were obstacles to their going backpacking, they learned to overcome. There really are things to learn about backpacking. We haven't figured them all out yet, but this book makes a very important contribution along the way."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Beyond Backpacking is absolutely the best book written about light weight backpacking! Ray Jardine is truely a progressive thinker. The ideas he shares in the book are time tested (by himself and many others following in his steps) and they work quite well. I think of Ray as a philosopher who challenges the prevailing thoughts about backpacking and even other aspects of culture.

I modified his ideas to suit my own style.Ray Jardine does an excellent job of explaining ultralight techniques, and how he gravitated toward them in the course of 5 megahikes. He urges you to field-test all your gear, whether homemade or store-bought, and he recommends training prior to a distance hike. This book, positioned for the mainstream, is a bargain for anyone willing to develop their outdoor skills.Ray's credentials, listed at the end, demonstrate his passion for adventuring and exploring. That passion has probably taken him to new areas of interest \\"beyond backpacking.\\"Addendum December 1, 2004Since the last entry I have hiked from Maine to Gaspe' Quebec and from Georgia to Key West, Florida, thereby completing the distance of the North American east coast. I would not have attempted it and could not have done so without reading Ray's book.It's worth mentioning that 85% to 90% of Appalachian Trail thru-hikers have some kind of breakdown before completing the whole distance. Many of them return to finish the AT in sections. Of those who do finish in one season, the average time for completion varies between 4 and 6 months. I didn't have that much time.

I have incorporated many (although not all) of his ideas with great success.My 1st appapachian trail hike in '92 had me lugging a 50+ lb pack. Today my pack base weight is below 20 lbs.

No doubt, a lighter house on the back makes a more enjoyable experience, but when he presents it in an arrogant and scriptural like manner it gives me the feeling he covets to become some revolutionary leader. Though his approach and accomplishments are efficiency based, he by no means is the founder of lightweight backpacking as he slyly insinuates through the book. People with common sense from the begining of time have known &quot;simple and light&quot; makes easier travel. He clearly saw a controversial topic and capitalized with a zealot approach. Hitting the multi-million dollar backpacking industry nerve was just too easy, considering the sheep had followed it all too long.

Otherwise buy Complete Walker IV by Colin Fletcher first; then see if you want Ray Jardine's book.Jardine's Book is focused on lightweight backpacking, a worthwile pursuit in my opinion. There are lots of advantages to reducing pack weight and Ray suggests many things to help, concentrating on 'the big 3': pack, shelter, bag. This book is definetely aimed more for the thru-hiker (which are cross-country hikes of 2000 miles or so) rather than the weeekend hiker, but still interesting nonetheless.My main problem with this book are the many flawed suggestions or erroneous &quot;facts&quot; in it. You have to sort through it to keep the good stuff. One of the more ridiculous ideas is that a positive mental attitude prevents bug bites (less ridiculous but still unproven is taking lots of Vitamin B).Also Jardine is very preachy and when he suggests something (like shoes rather than boots) he keeps repeating them in other chapters, hammering his point. He doesn't allow for the possibility that someone might do things differently, completely the opposite attitude that Fletcher has in the Complete Walker. This book could be called the INcomplete Walker.As for specific ideas (and my opinion), it's pretty much limited to:- A lightweight pack (good!) worn on only one shoulder (annoying).- A tarp instead of a tent: good idea, but needs extra bug protection in many cases.- Shoes instead of boots: could work with the right shoes but my fragile ankles prefer boots.- Nutritious food: sure, but I'm not going to grind my own wheat to make flour as Jardine suggests! Ray seems to think that white flour gives no energy which is false - it's not very nutritious but 1000 calories is 1000 calories no matter what.- A quilt instead of a bag: seems like a good choice for a couple but not weight/heat-efficient for a single person.- An umbrella: inefficient, heavy, doesn't even protect you correctly (ever use an umbrella in any wind). This idea is the silliest of all.Overall an informative (but be guarded) book that's really irritating to read. There are better ones out there; save your money unless you thru-hike."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"This is an outstanding book.The author is dead on in his indictment of the &quot;leisure industry&quot; its ads, magazines, etc. that try to convince everyone that they need hundreds, if not thousands of dollars of heavy gear before daring to venture into the woods.But the book isn't just a rant. He provides simple advice about how to hike great distances under many different conditions while carrying a very light pack. Before I read this, I could not imagine doing a serious hike with less than 30-50 pounds of gear. No more. I plan to get my pack well under 20 pounds.I was very impressed by the author's honesty. He notes that a company (Go-lite) consulted with him to have him design several items of gear. He says that their stuff is okay but notes that most people would probably be better off sewing their own gear.The author's credentials are very impressive, including his through-hikes of the US's major trails, his first ascents of several peaks, and his invention of some key climbing gear.Finally, a couple of reviews take issue with Jardine's lack of &quot;Christian&quot; cheerleading. First, I don't judge how-to books by whether the author goes to the same church I do. I look for solid advice I can use. And, in any event, I steer clear of anybody who claims to be a Christian, just before throwing rhetorical stones at others."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"I recently found this book after trying to get friends to go for lighter hiking.

However, some fo the more exteme ideas can be adjusted to fit almost any comfort level."},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Prior to the release of this book's forerunner, &quot;The PCT Hiker's Handbook,&quot; the lightweight hiking and camping movement that we know today did not exist. Individually, certain outdoor enthusiasts may have had their ideas, but, collectively, backpacking culture the world over marched to the beat of a very different drum. Author Jardine refers to this drum as &quot;the standard backpacking method,&quot; and it was synonymous with a heavy, &quot;everything but the kitchen sink&quot; mentality - a mode of backcountry travel that was rarely well considered, seldom enjoyable, and sometimes just plain dangerous. Not surprisingly, perhaps, relatively few people hiked any great distance in the wilderness back then. But Ray Jardine was a notable exception, and it is from his incredible 20,000 miles of long distance hiking experience that we now arrive at the iconoclastic and ultimately culture-defining ideas contained in &quot;Beyond Backpacking,&quot; the all-trails version of his now classic Handbook.Ray once quoted scientist Niels Bohr, who said, &quot;An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field.&quot; We owe much to each of these men; Bohr for at last describing the atom, prime constituent of the universe, and Jardine for tirelessly rethinking wilderness travel, and in so doing our relationship with the universe and all its constituents. For &quot;Beyond Backpacking&quot; is more than just a book of methods, a work detailing the how-to's of lightening our loads, of traveling more comfortably, of enjoying the physics of the pastime. It is all of this, and very capably and credibly so, but moreover this book elevates our outdoor activity to the level of fine art, prescribing a higher purpose to the hiking and camping than a simple end unto itself. Jardine takes us beyond, to a concept he calls the Connection: a heightened awareness of the natural world around us and of our place within it. Each of the book's 53 chapters is intended to lead us toward this connection, through a gradual shift in our wilderness methods and philosophies. When we achieve the connection, Ray teaches, we cease being mere visitors in wilderness, and instead become fully functioning members. We rediscover our heritage, our true, innate selves. The universe then is ours for the asking.Whether you're interested in shedding pounds from your weekend camping outfit, or planning a lightweight, injury-free thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail, &quot;Beyond Backpacking&quot; leads the way, always thoughtfully, with trail-proven savvy, and always with an eye toward personal refinement. Gone are the days of the mindless backwoods slog, head down, teeth bared, and body on the verge of collapse. In their place a new generation of &quot;Ray-way&quot; adventurers is discovering something far more profound, that the lighter we travel the lighter our spirits may also travel. Or as Thoreau put it, &quot;Man is rich in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone.&quot;"},{"Title":"Beyond backpacking: Ray Jardine's guide to lightweight hiking : practical methods for all who love the out-of-doors, from walkers and backpackers, to long-distance hikers","review":"Even though this book is a bit out in left field for those of us who have been hiking all their life, it still has great lightweight principles that can be applied to backpacking.

Although she says that it received extensive revision, it still reads like a thesis. Like many theses in the humanities, the researcher has started with a hypothesis and collected a critical mass of facts supporting that hypothesis. \\"Many Tender Ties\\" sets out to show that Indian women who married white men, and the female children and grandchildren of those unions, played an important role in Western Canada's fur-trade era. Because few of these women kept personal records, the research relies heavily on the journals, letters, and records kept by men of the time and place. The author feels that Indian women gained significantly from trade with the whites, perhaps more than Indian men. Awls, kettles, needles, beads, thread, and cloth all made life easier for women compared to Indian culture prior to European contact. Further, when an Indian woman married a white fur trader, especially an important one, she often gained prestige in both the Indian and the white cultures and she may have found her daily workload diminished. These Indian or mixed-blood women frequently served as a liaison and facilitator of economic and social issues between the whites and the Indians. Since there weren't clergy available, these unions were usually \\"after the custom of the country.\\" Although some white men considered the unions to be a matter of convenience only, a great many lasted for a lifetime and resulted in numerous offspring. During the initial generations of the fur trade, the whites usually treated the unions as the equivalent of marriage and the women involved had a respectable social status. Problems occurred later as clergy came to the fur trade posts and declared the marriages illicit, the women concubines, and the children illegitimate. Further, as the fur traders brought white women to the posts, the white women reinforced the English, class-based society that the rigors of the fur-trade had muted. Racism intensified. Thus, the status of the Indian and mixed-blood women suffered severely due to the influence of the clergy and the white women. The author sums up the result by saying that \\"prejudiced gained hold to such an extent that [the] potential for racial integration was lost.\\""},{"Title":"Many Tender Ties - Women In Fur-trade Society, 1670 - 1870","review":"This book had the potential to be great. It contained vast amounts of information, mostly in anecdotal form, but was poorly organized and edited. I'm a bit of a grammar snob, so maybe I'm being too picky, but I was continuously distracted by Van Kirk's usage of the word \\"which\\" when \\"that\\" would have been correct. It seemed she was self-consciously choosing to use \\"which\\" because it sounds more formal, but it was simply wrong in most uses. A sample sentence: \\"The women which lived in this fort...\\" No, not correct.As far as organization, she backtracks frequently and rarely mentions approximate years, which makes it very difficult for a reader to keep track of when the events mentioned took place. In one chapter, events covered will stretch from, say, 1800-1830. Suddenly, the next chapter is referencing events from 1790-1800. There's also no background information provided on the fur trade industry itself or the meaning of the ranks within. She expects the reader to know where bourgeois, voyageur, governor, Chief Factor, and other casually-mentioned positions within the companies. Without these frames of reference, I had a difficult time reconciling all the anecdotal history within the book.With the help of a ruthless editor, this book could be great.

The book is intelligent, fair and kind and thorough. It seems that all the major relationships of Wordsworth's life are carefully described. Relationships with his sister, Dorothy; his wife, Mary Hutchinson; his French amour Annette Villon and their daughter are all carefully desribed. His brothers, his children, Coleridge, Robert Southey, Walter Scott are all part of his life, and insightfully presented in the book. Davies writes well about the Lake district, and Wordsworth's business dealings. It is a good, solid, well- rounded portrayal of Wordsworth. The poetry is not analyzed, but introduced and placed in the context of the poet's life. At the end, I liked Wordsworth very much and will be happy to read more of his poetry. I would give the book 4 1/2 stars if it were possible."},{"Title":"William Wordsworth: A Biography","review":"This disappointing and tedious book about Wordsworth's life and times lacks insight and warmth. The author is a dabbler whose books' topics include fiction, the Beatles, and a hiker's guide to the Lakes District. The current book grew out of the author's research for his hiking guide, when he discovered that there was no other detailed, non-academic Wordsworth biography. In essence, the book is a calculated business venture rather than an expression of the author's interest in,knowledge of, or love for Wordsworth. To his credit, the author is frank about these facts, although his uninspired text could not have hidden them. The book is flawed by unnecessary and uninsightful speculation on the one hand and on the other by a general lack of sensitivity to the profound beauty of Wordsworth's work. The author's narrative style is dry, lifeless and uninspired, and Americans will be particularly put off by its distinctly British flavor, which can only be regarded as a provincial flaw in a book offered to general readers in the global market. Spelling, word choice, turn of phrase, and the assumed context are so distinctly British as to leave American readers feeling that they are overhearing a joke which they do not quite understand. Many Americans will find the book inaccessible for this reason. A much better choice is Penelope Hughes-Hallett's &quot;Home At Grasmere&quot;, which is warm, sensitive and well written."},{"Title":"William Wordsworth: A Biography","review":"Hunter Davies set out to write a popular biography of Wordsworth. He indicates at the outset that this is not going to be a work of literary criticism, that it is not going to focus on the development of Wordsworth's poetry.This present work nonetheless in helping the reader understand Wordsworth the person, also helps us understand Wordsworth the Poet.Wordsworth was orphaned from his father at the age of eight, and from his mother at the age of thirteen. He was supported by relatives who did not approve of his behavior as a child and young person. He was exceptionally independent and often rebellious child.When his mother died he was separated from his siblings. Only at the age of seventeen did he come to see them all together again. And here began one of the most significant relationships of his life, with his sister Dorothy. She would be for him the companion of his youthful years, the great souled fellow explorer of nature and inspirer of his Poetry. She would remain even after he married Mary Hutchinson a central figure in his everyday life. For the last twenty years of that life Wordsworth and his wife cared for her. This after she had lost her mind and sat all day in her wheelchair.One important theme that runs through this work concerns Wordsworth as family man, as good brother, as faithful loving husband, as caring father.Wordsworth 's life too has important friendships at its center. The greatest and most creatively important is with Coleridge. Davies tells the story of their work together on 'The Lyrical Ballads', and of the many years they were close. Coleridge had a central role in recognizing and promoting his friend's genius. It may well even be that Coleridge feeling Wordsworth the far greater poet ceased writing poetry of his own because of this. Coleridge's great poems , 'Kubla Khan', 'The Ancient Mariner' are part of the \\"Lyrical Ballads'. But most of the twenty- three poems are Wordsworth including the very great 'Tintern Abbey'Davies also gives us a good sense of Wordsworth's character and of the transformation with the years from revolutionary youth to more conservative figure. Wordsworth too went from financial dependency and relative poverty in his early years to greater prosperity towards the end of his life. He went from being an orphan to becoming the head of a family which included besides his wife and children two other women, his sister Dorothy and Coleridge's longed- for- one Sara Fricker. The story of how the far more gregarious talkative social Coleridge came to greater loneliness with the years- and how the more taciturn Wordsworth came to build a rich home in which he had much feminine support is told movingly by Davies.Wordsworth's friends Southey, Lamb, Coleridge DeQuincey considered him to have lived a fortunate and happy life. This was in one sense true. But he also knew terrible losses with the years. His sailor brother John's death was a blow he recovered from only with great difficulty. He and his wife lost two young children in a year. This too devastated him. The last blow was the death of his beloved daughter Dora at the age of thirty- seven. Still Wordsworth lived to the age of eighty , in relatively good health most of the years. He also knew great renown and recognition in his latter years. And his relationship with his wife Mary only seemed to grow stronger with the years, and was one of true love and mutual respect. He who always had a special caring for children lived to see five grandchildren, the children of his eldest son, John.Wordsworth despite the great popularity he would one day have did not have a smooth path to recognition and acceptance as a Poet. His work was for many years harshly criticized and ridiculed. The 1807 edition of his Poems received ten negative reviews and not a single good one. But Wordsworth had equanimity and confidence. The calm sublime of his Poetry was apparently that of his character also. Weathered, rugged looking Wordsworth who even in his latter years would walk twenty miles a day was a pillar of inner and outer strength. The great Poetry and most believe it was created in the decade from roughly 1797 to 1807 has stood the test of time. His life as portrayed in this biography was that of a person of virtue, principle and great genius.I greatly enjoyed this work. It has given me a much fuller and complete sense of Wordsworth's life and work than I had had before."},{"Title":"Mastering Pool","review":"When I was a frosh in high school, I got interested in pool. I didn't get really good, but I did find a copy of this book in a library. Although I only got to spend a day with it I found it fascinating for strategy. I lost interest in the game for awhile, but really got into it the past year. When I found it on the internet, I bought it without hesitating.the book covers four games: 14.1, 8-Ball, 9-Ball, 1-Pocket. Straight Pool gets the majority of the coverage, with alot of good strategies for the game. 8-Ball gets a fair amount of coverage, but no time is really spent on defense and safety play. I find this strange when he says in the beginning of the section how 8-Ball is underrated and contains lots of strategy (he is right on that). 9-Ball gets only 10 pages or so...some good info...interesting that back when he wrote this, you could play a pushout at any point in the game, not just after the break shot. his one-pocket section covers a good deal of info in not too much room, I wish he could write more on it because one-pocket is a good game and deserves more than a gambling reputation.

The issues include:- British Strategic Policy, 1936-38, - Political Uncertainties in Egypt during the Interwar Period, - Palestine 1936-38: the Reshaping of British Policy, - The Policy of Appeasement : the White Paper on Palestine and Jewish Refugees, - British Strategic Policy, 1939-June 1940, - Defence Issues in Egypt and Palestine, 1939-40, - British Strategic Policy, July 1940-June 1941, - British Intervention in Egyptian Politics, - Wartime Policy towards Palestine,Britain's War in the Middle East allows the reader to see the making of British foreign policy and to understand it as a process that was shaped by interactions with the countries of the region before and during the first years of the Second World War. As Martin Kolinsky explained in his masterful study of British strategy and diplomacy, in this period, Britain was caught between the contingencies of global warfare and growing nationalist pressures in the Middle East. Indeed, the dominance which Britain established in the Middle East after the great war was seriously challenged during the years 1936-42. In those crucial seven years, Britain's position was confronted by a formidable combination of internal and external threats, arising from new currents of Arab nationalism and from Axis pressures and military operations. The use of a rich collection of original documents and Kolinsky's inspired scholarship makes this book indispensable for historians, researchers and students. It builds and draws on the author's earlier works on both before and after the period in concern (&quot;Britain and the Middle East in the 1930s&quot; and &quot;Demise of the British Empire in the Middle East 1943-55&quot; [co-editor with Michael J. Cohen in these books] and &quot;Law, Order and Riots in Mandatory Palestine, 1928-35&quot;) and adds new information to this extraordinarily complex subject."},{"Title":"Jewel : A Chapter in Her Life","review":"I have read JEWEL, A CHAPTER IN HER LIFE, by Clara Louise Burnham, at least a dozen times since a hardcover copy was given to my family when I was about seven years old. (I am now seventy-two.) It is a delightful, heartwarming story, but probably could not be fully appreciated without some background or interest in Christian Science. My mother read it to me at first. I was able to read and understand it myself by the time I was twelve. The book is a fictional story about how an eight year-old girl living around the turn of the century (19th to 20th) uses her understanding of Christian Science for healing a physical problem and relationship problems. I would recommend getting an original hardback copy published in 1903 rather than a newer paperback edition because it sounds like the pictures did not reproduce well in the newer editions. Also, the picture on the front of the 2010 edition relates to nothing in the story! I purchased a hardcover copy for a friend a year or so ago from Amazon. It was in perfect condition, better than my own copy."},{"Title":"ATL Server: High Performance C++ on .NET","review":"If you're a hardcore C++ developer wanting to do native web development, ATL Server is a great library to work with. If you've done ISAPI extensions, you'll find ATL Server to be a natural, flexible and very performant extension of that model, which makes development a *lot* faster.And if you like that, then this book is a great way to get you up to speed on ATL Server. It is, after all, written by the people who wrote it. The book is wonderfully easy to read, covers both the basics and plenty of advanced ATL Server topics, and has tons of examples. Plus, it has the advantage of being written with real applications in mind.On the other hand, if the profile above doesn't sound like it fits you, then this book is probably not for you :)"},{"Title":"ATL Server: High Performance C++ on .NET","review":"The ATL Server library is the perfect addition to ATL, adding the ability to create web services and web applications with the light-weight model of ATL. I found this book very useful for getting new members of my development team up to speed on the basics of ATL Server development (both those with previous ISAPI experience and those without).I also found this book very useful when tackling some of the more difficult problems that our application faced. In particular the Advanced sections on SRF files, Request Handlers and Web Services provided a number of useful techniques that we were able to apply in our application.The book also outlines some techniques for using parts of the ATL Server library in non-web applications, which we are finding very useful as we update some of our existing code."},{"Title":"ATL Server: High Performance C++ on .NET","review":"This is an excellent book on the definitive technology for VC++ developers wanting to write web applications.

Still, a high percentage of them are very skillfully written and will provide readers with several kinds of enjoyment. Further, the Introduction by Michael Gilbert, who selected the stories, provides insights into the crafting of crime fiction and the nature of the special \\"voice\\" of Cyril Hare (pen name of Alfred Gordon Clark, a lawyer, who served as a judge for many years).In terms of structure, the majority of the stories in this collection fall into three main categories: 7 of them are Puzzle Stories which test readers' wits, 6 of them are \\"What If--\\" Premise Stories which have \\"punitive plots\\" (i.e., at the ending a wrong-doer has something bad happen to him, usually because he has outsmarted himself), and 15 of them are \\"What If--\\" Premise Stories which disclose a more or less ironic and surprising twist at their endings. The 30th story, perhaps the worst in the collection, is \\"Dropper's Delight,\\" a rambling, disjointed, and unaffecting tale of a bank clerk's good luck (few readers will care either way what happens to anyone in this piece).The best Puzzle Story, I think, is \\"Death of a Blackmailer,\\" a sad and touching tale with a tragedy embedded in it; as with Ring Lardner's famous story \\"Haircut,\\" readers are trusted to solve things that characters cannot. \\"The Death of Amy Robsart\\" is a very good Puzzle Story involving an American film actor, his French wife, and a British starlet who dies shortly after playing the part of Amy Robsart (the historical wife of Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, supposedly the lover of Queen Elizabeth I), who died under suspicious circumstances in 1560. The least effective Puzzle Story is \\"The Rivals\\" (which was praised by Gilbert): probably it will not work for current-day readers because it requires specialized knowledge about an aspect of \\"old-tyme dances\\" (which the Internet does not clearly provide).Of the Premise Stories with ironic Punitive Plots, perhaps the best is \\"'It Takes Two,'\\" about a diamond thief. \\"Sister Bessie or Your Old Leech\\" (which Gilbert briefly discusses) is unsavory and its ending easily foreseeable. Many of the stories in this category and the next are similar to stories by Roald Dahl, Saki, and Lord Dunsany.Among the best Premise Stories with Disclosure Plots are \\"The Markhampton Miracle\\" about children's prayers, \\"Miss Burnside's Dilemma\\" about a vicar's wrongdoing, \\"The Ruling Passion\\" about an antique teapot, and \\"A Very Useful Relationship\\" about con artists. Some of the stories in this category are humorous, while others are rather nasty or unsavory in their final revelations. \\"The Tragedy of Young MacIntyre,\\" a comic piece, is perhaps the weakest. \\"A Life for a Life\\" in my own view is not only the best story in this category but the best and most touching piece in this whole collection: it involves a stranger joining a barroom debate about capital punishment and telling how his own life was once saved under what seemed to be supernatural circumstances."},{"Title":"My Wedding Planner","review":"I purchased this planner based on the glowing reviews on this website. It did have some good questions to keep in mind and some very good organizational materials, but I also felt like 1-800-WEDDINGS were hyping themselves too much. (I work in advertising and still found it offensive). I was also upset that the &quot;honeymoon&quot; section had only two tabs-&quot;Sandals&quot; and &quot;Hawaii&quot;. As if these are the only two places anyone would consider honeymooning. It just made me wonder how much Sandles was paying them to promote their resort. In the end, I took some pages from this planner and put together a better one for myself (the pockets did come in handy!). It was helpful, but it may not be everythng you need."},{"Title":"My Wedding Planner","review":"This &quot;planner&quot; has more advertisements for 1-800-wedding's financial services and other vendors' products and services, and less helpful information than most of the other planning books that I've seen.

Compared to other books, this was a waste of my money."},{"Title":"My Wedding Planner","review":"I was recently married and used the 1-800-WEDDING Planner throughout my wedding planning activities.

It covered every detail and she couldn't believe all the info I was able to give her after the appointments--it gave me all the questions to ask...we wouldn't have even thought to ask most of them. It's also really easy to use and has pockets to hold all the papers and receipts. The &quot;Timeline&quot; section lets you know when you should have certain things done and throughout the planner it tells you where on the company's web site you can download more information.

It really does take you through every step of the wedding planning process, and since I was paying for my own wedding, I also appreciated the section that helps with budgeting the wedding. (The little items for the reception can really add up!)Out of all of the wedding planners to choose from, this is by far the best one available.

Overall an interesting book aside from a few chapters Richards spends chasing his own tail in an attempt to reconcile morality with desire."},{"Title":"Principles of Literary Criticism.","review":"Routledge should be ashamed to have published such an important text with so many typographical errors. I'd say buy a used copy of the Harvest HBJ edition instead."},{"Title":"Principles of Literary Criticism.","review":"In the years preceding the publication of Principles of Literary Criticism (1924), I. A. Richards was watching the very foundation of literature change or perhaps unravel right in front of his eyes. Authors such as Alfred North Whitehead, James Joyce, and T. S. Eliot had begun writing texts that represented enormous changes in style, tone, and content. Further, the audiences who were reading these texts were no longer composed of the elite scions of Edwardian society. In increasing numbers, middle class and even (horrors) working class blue collars began to seek the university degree that they felt sure would be a ticket to a more prosperous life. The problem with this growing mass of would-be-intellectuals was that they had to encounter and digest what to them was a bewildering and vastly confusing array of theories of learning that were heavily dependent on the aesthetically oriented Romantic vision of emotion and psychology that contemporary professors of literature insisted must be mastered prior to tackling the admitted complexities of the texts themselves. It was this required assimilation of subjective and pseudo-scientific notions that Richards was determined to overcome and eliminate.Richards also took to task the pedagogy that had been transplanted from Germany that required literature students to master history as a prerequisite to reading texts. According to this model if one wished to study Shylock's motivation for his insistence on his pound of flesh from The Merchant of Venice, one first had to absorb the fullness of Jewish culture and anti-Semitism then prevalent in the Elizabethan age. Once one knew all that, then the play itself became quite secondary if not irrelevant. What Richards sought was a method that would focus solely on the words on the page with considerations of history, morality, psychology, and all other disciplines conveniently ignored. It seemed logical to Richards that a methodology of text over context was the only way to arrive at the \\"true\\" and universally accepted core meaning of a text.Alas, almost from the first day of publication, Principles of Literary Criticism caused a huge backlash from critics who were equally determined not to nudge a host of disciplines to the Dustbins of Unwanted and Unneeded Facts. These critics examined Richards' use of terminology to divide all texts into three overarching categories: good, bad, and defective. A \\"good\\" text clearly presented its thesis. A \\"bad\\" text communicated something but whatever this \\"something\\" was it had no intrinsic value. A \\"defective\\" text also communicated something but this \\"something\\" may (or may not) have had intrinsic value. Richards' critics jumped all over his overly vague use of subjective terminology like \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" or \\"defective\\" in what to them was a pre-ordained failure to achieve objectivity using subjective words. Further muddying the linguistic waters was Richards' unfortunate comment that only those who were of sound mental faculties could develop the requisite critical skills. Still, despite the ongoing brouhaha, Principles of Literary Criticism established the need to pay very close attention to reading skills that we now call \\"close reading.\\" One might argue, then, that the very defects of his theories made it possible for the next generation of theorists to tackle texts in such a way as to sweep aside the outmoded and quaint New Critical methods in favor of a myriad of now accepted means to tear texts apart."},{"Title":"Silly Songs (Play-a-Song Series)","review":"ISBN 0785300546 - Interactive books always rate high with me because they go pretty far in drawing kids into reading. Silly Songs, as far as the text goes, hardly deserves a reward (the songs are, of course, well known, not original) but the illustrations by Jerry Tiritilli are gloriously colorful and fun and move the book out of the average.Songs are: Down by the Station, Bingo, Row Row Row Your Boat, Oh Where Has My Little Dog Gone, Do Your Ears Hang Low, The Eensy Weensy Spider, The Noble Duke of York, Pop! Goes the Weasel, Polly-Wolly-Doodle ans Be Kind to Your Web-Footed Friends (to the tune of Hurrah! for the Red, White and Blue). Each song and its illustrations takes up two facing pages, with the text in large letters. The buttons, when pressed, play the full song so that you and your child can sing along. The illustrations are every bit as silly as the songs.The replaceable batteries are a big plus in books like this since it would be a shame to throw it away when the batteries die! The pages are by no means sturdy - the book is for the 4-8 age group, and board books are generally behind them at this point - and, like any over-sized book, because the pages are large (they measure about 12\\" x 8 \\") they tear easily in eager hands.

They are well illustrated, generally with animals playing the characters. The pages are sturdy, which is very important in a large book that they will want to study on their own. The songs are cute and with enough musicial detail to figure out the tune, even if unfamiliar with it previously. OTOH, over time, the volume fades so it's important to learn the songs.My children have learned simple matching skills by studying the books on their own. The buttons are a snippet of the illustration so they figure out the gist of what they're supposed to do to hear the appropriate song. They can review the songs on their own, over and over again, but they're fun to sing together too. I prefer the songbooks over the \\"hit the button for an illustrative sound\\" type of books because there is better continuity. I believe they can both be effective in teaching reading, but the song books make it more fun for both the parent and the child."},{"Title":"Disciplining Sexuality: Foucault, Life Histories, and Education (Athene Series)","review":"A look at the French sociologist and philosopher Maurice Foucault's conceptions of power from the perspective of gender and sexuality within schools. Sue Middleton argues that the problem is both historical in nature and persistent in being, and that even today much of the control of young human beings is physically manifested in their bodies, especially their sexual bodies, despite the much publicised outlawing of methods of discipline like caning. I read this book as a sociological aide, but would equally recommend it to those training to teach. Most important it is written very clearly and is excellent at the demystification of Foucauldian language in particular."},{"Title":"The Colors of His Love","review":"In this world of rush and hastiness, it was pleasure to take the time to read a book like this that made such an indention in me. It caused me to do what I think a good book of this genre should- probe areas of myself and put them into the refining process. Do I love well or just put a face of love on at the appropraite times? Will the imprint I leave be a hollow one of just self, or will it be the image of Jesus? Kathy and Dee use engaging stories to illustrate their points, which makes for a delightful read.For readers looking to move deeper into their relationship with the Lord and thus into better relationship with His people, this book deserves a look."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I really enjoyed this wonderfully simple romantic tale timelessly set in a Japanese fishing village. Those who are used to reading Mishima's other works might find this book a wonderful change of pace. I thoroughly enjoyed the development of the characters and the sweet, awkward moments that occur between the two lovers in this classic tale of first love."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"...is how, according to Nathan's biography, Mishima referred to this book on several occasions. It does seem very uncharacteristic, being a straightforward love story, showing great interest in its humble setting and without Mishima's trademark disdain for 'ordinary people,' but I think it may have been as true to his aesthetic inclinations as his darker works. It highlights the other side of the tradition which fascinated him - the life-affirming courage and old-fashioned masculine code of the samurai, as opposed to the more morbid dictate that the samurai 'must die each day in his mind.' Near the end, a character makes a remark along the lines of: 'Shinji's got guts. That's really all that matters,' and that seems to sum this book up pretty well. I think this book may have meant more to Mishima than he admitted. It's certainly accesible to those who wouldn't like his more intense stuff, and provides a spot of definite interest for fans."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"In a time when understanding and good will seem all too hard and too fine, classic novels like this and \\"The Tale of Gengi\\", written by a lady of the court, Murasaki Shikibu, give a westerner a feel for Japan that is needed. Japan still has an Emperor and England has a Queen... their customs and traditions remain."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Although this story has a fairy tale-like element to it, it also has a satirical meaning. It is actually a satire on society and his opinion regarding other issues such as suicide. The island of Uta-jima is a utopian society and, of course, can't exist in real life. A delightful story and has some &quot;inappropriate&quot; scenes but is tolerable.

The Sound of Waves doesn't have the suicides and violence of other Mishima works - something I don't miss - but it also lacks his usual depth of character study and glorious prose - that I do miss. The key characters are altogether too nice, too perfect. Shinji, the handsome, brave, self-effacing youth who never told a deliberate lie until page 156 of the book - and Hatsue, much the same, but with perfectly perky breasts. It seemed that Mishima grew tired of these too perfect creations and rushed the book to its happy conclusion. I kept anticipating the emergence of a savage twist, but it was not to be - all was happiness and light. I suppose Mishima may have written this as an allegory for what he (perhaps) secretly hoped his life could be - and I think John Nathan explained in Mishima's biography that he was influenced by a fascination with Greek legends and sculpture at this time - but thankfully he returned to the Mishima we love with later works.Can't say I would recommend this book, other than as an interesting part of Mishima's canon of work. The Vintage International edition is worth reading for their hilarious profile of Mishima - \`born into a samurai family, imbued with the code of complete control over mind and body and loyalty to the Emperor' - utter nonsense!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Fifteen years ago I read this while on a Jap. lit. binge; I have since read all of Mishima's novels available in English (are there others not translated?), and this one remains one of my top two with Temple of the Golden Pavilion. I just re-read it over the past two days, and it has not lost any of its appeal.The characters and setting are reminiscent of Steinbeck, as in The Pearl, The Red Pony, and Tortilla Flats, yet the narrative has a pathos and philosophical sensitivity that provide insight into a deeper Japanese identity crisis as one prominent review detailed earlier. With a light touch of classic Mishima eroticism, this is an engaging read of the \\"root for the good guy\\" type."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"June 5, 2008I just finished reading the Sound of Waves. It's a true to life account of life in a Japanese fishing island in the mid 1950's.What would people do without all their modern conveniences, luxuries and entertainments? They would probably live like the people of Uta Jima, finding joy in a simple life close to nature and their families and neighbors. When someone needs to fix their house, all their friends come to help out. When a young couple suffers a crisis, the whole village helps work out the problem. And being close to nature, even the Gods are there to lend their behind the scenes assistance.I recommend this book to anyone who would like to experience life in rural Japan."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Richard Hugo, an excellent poet and teacher, said that each poem has two subjects - the triggering subject (or the story), and the second, deeper subject. This holds true for many great works of literature, not just poems, and The Sound of Waves is no exception.On the surface, we have a subtly erotic love story about Shinji and Hatsue, two hard-working young Japanese people in a close-knit, isolated, traditional village. They go on with their romance despite ugly rumors which prompt Hatsue's father, Terukichi (known as &quot;Uncle Teru&quot;) to forbid his daughter from seeing Shinji. There is a happy ending, but I won't give it away.This is more than your typical love story. The main characters, Shinji and Hatsue, are ideal Japanese people in the traditional, uncorrupted village: hard-working, devoted to the family, honest, and religious. The rumormongers are Westernized: Chiyoko - a pessimistic girl - is a student in western literature at a city university, and Yasuo - a rude, selfish, lazy boy who wants Hatsue for himself - is well-read in pulp magazines. It is traditional Japanese willpower and discipline that keeps Shinji and Hatsue together despite their obstacles.What is remarkable is that the book does not make its point with a sledgehammer. The traditional characters win out, not because they tattle or scream; their integrity forces the modern characters to face the errors of their modern ways. This book is almost as relavent to our changing America as it was to Mishima's changing Japan. One read-through and you will understand Mishima's patriotism, his long quest for a return to tradition that led to his seppuku."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Few books accurately capture the feeling of first love the way Yukio Mishima's &quot;The Sound of Waves&quot; does. Set in a small Japanese fishing village in the mid-20th century, this is a beautiful story that will charm the romantic at heart with its simplicity and intensity.Shinji is a poor young fisherman, living with his widowed mother and relatively carefree. That changes when he sees a lovely young pearl-diver named Hatsue looking out to sea. Shinji soon finds that he can't get Hatsue out of his mind; he's fallen in love, for the very first time. She soon falls in love with him as well -- it's first love for them both, and for a few days everything seems fine.But things start to go wrong when an unhappy young girl sees the two of them leaving a secluded spot. Soon rumors are spread about Hatsue and Shinji's relationship, and the arrogant Yasuo even physically chases Hatsue when she is getting water. When Hatsue's overprotective father forbids her to see Shinji again, and seems about to betroth her to Yasuo, Shinji has only one chance to be reunited with his love.Generally the word &quot;romance&quot; conjures images of busty half-naked women being held in impossible positions by chiseled he-men with torn shirts. But &quot;Sound of Waves&quot; is genuine romance, about the sort of love that any person could experience if they are open to it, in any part of the world. He is also one of the few authors who can convey the joy and pain of being in love. Not to mention the exalted way one can feel, without losing sight of their humanity: Shinji and Hatsue definitely have hormones, but keep them in check. There's a kind of mature innocence to how these two interact.Yukio Mishima's writing is both brief and detailed. Simple and descriptive, evoking the wind, sea, trees, and shorelines. The story is a simple one (boy meets girl, girl and boy fall in love, boy and girl are separated, etc), but its simplicity is part of its appeal. There are even some things about pearl-diving and fishing included, to give a glimpse of the lives that Hatsue, Shinji and their families live.The best thing abou this brief novel is the lead characters. Shinji is a shy, inexperienced, capable teenage boy, not a confident stud. Hatsue captures his attention not through mere physical beauty (though she sounds quite pretty), but through her sweetness. The wannabe-playboy, and the &quot;ugly&quot; girl who wistfully falls for Shinji, are like real people.This is romance as it should be written, beautiful and tender with lovable characters and haunting prose. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for in sweetness. A memorable and beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"A 16-year-old recommended this book to me because &quot;it has a lot of SAT words&quot; and I, being the SAT prep instructor that I am, had to investigate. My young pupil was indeed correct in saying that the English translation of this book contains many words commonly seen on the SAT, but she failed to mention how incredibly well-written the book was, too!I had a very hard time putting down this book simply because it flows so beautifully. Words are not wasted; everything is said for a purpose, from the desriptions of the scenery of this small Japanese island to the descriptions of the sunburnt faces of the main characters. Mishima tells the story of a forbidden love that doesn't become too sappy sweet. It is refreshing to read a novel that focuses so much on human character traits (&amp; flaws) while also leaving room for serendipity &amp; fate.An easy read with a nice plot and excellent character developments, this book is highly recommended to readers of all ages. And if you happen to know of a high school student who wants to improve his/her vocabulary and critical reading abilities (or you happen to be one), then this is the perfect book for you! You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Yukio Mishima wrote The Sound of Waves following a visit to Greece and his immersion in the literature of ancient Greece. His fascination with the Mediterranean world and his affection for ancient literature (in particular, Daphnis and Chloe) is reflected in this sunny novel. He produced a very approachable and charming story about a island fishing village, and it is no wonder that this book was the first selected for translation into English in 1956 (published in Japan in 1954).The novel centers around Shinji, a young fisherman, and Hatsue, who had been given away by her father Terukichi but was called back by him when his son died so he could marry his daughter and adopt the husband into his family. The story follows what one would expect in a small village where everyone is known and gossip abounds. It is assumed that Hatsue will marry Yasuo, who is from a family that is well off whereas Shinji is poor. Love, however, takes a different hand and when Shinji and Hatsue see each other something begins that cannot be stopped. Of course, there are obstacles in their way and Terukichi places his daughter under house arrest because of the gossip that has grown over their relationship. But the reader understands early that Shinji is bound to triumph over adversity and win Hatsue because his character is noble and hard-working. I don't think anyone would doubt the end of the novel; it is the character development and Mishima's powers of description that keep your attention.What adds so much to this novel is Mishima's description of island life. For example, he brilliantly describes the women divers who struggle to bring up abalone and notes how they cut their toes when they use their foot to push off the sea floor. We also have descriptions of the men of the island relaxing in the bath-house, the meetings of the islands Young Men's Association and such mundane tasks as the women fetching water from the local spring.Mishima's fascination with the cultures of the Mediterranean did not last long and he repudiated The Sound of Waves. This novel may not be characteristic of Mishima's writing but it is a good place to start to get to know his writing before advancing on into Confessions of a Mask. The Sound of Waves is a lyrical and sunny book that deserves a high readership."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"A subtle and masterfully told tale about two youths discovering love on a rural Japanese island. This book is very different from the other 5 or 6 Mishima novels I've read, but it is still beautifully constructed and skillfully rendered.The book explores themes of innocence, loyalty, fidelity to tradition and the transition from adolescence to adulthood. Despite the lack of &quot;action&quot; in the book, the story is still riveting because of the chasm between rumor and truth that the protagonists must cross.Mishima definately adds a unique twist at the end that is sure to irritate some and I was a bit perplexed about it myself for a while. Then I remembered this is a Mishima novel and we certainly wouldn't expect anything less from a man capable of such grave seriousness, outlandish specatcles and biting humor."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I found this book to be very unique, which is why i loved it so much. Though it's for a more mature audience. At my school it was such a controversial book because some of the sexual content. Though i'm glad that the teachers won the battle agains't the parents of banning it. That's what created the mood in the story, without it, it wouldn't be The Sound Of Waves. A very good romantic book, it will draw you in, you'll feel your in it."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Yukio Mishima's THE SOUND OF WAVES is, on its face, a classical and infinitely subdued love story, a Romeo and Juliet tale without the tragedy. A young but poor fisherman, Shinji, falls deeply in love with Hatsue, daughter of the wealthy businessman Terukichi Miyata who has just returned to her small home island of Uta-Jima (Song Island) during a vacation break from her studies. Hatsue reciprocates Shinji's amorous interests, and the two exchange secret messages and arrange covert (but essentially Platonic) trysts. The more sociably acceptable match, Yasuo, also desires to marry Hatsue, and her father presumably leans toward this better arrangement. Yasuo's marital goals are further aided by Chiyoko, daughter of the island's lighthouse keeper, who informs Yasuo about the young couple's illicit romantic escapades because she fancies Shinji for herself. Unknown to Shinji (but patently obvious to the reader), Uncle Teru recruits both young men to work on one of his ships in order to gauge their character and test their mettle for their marriageable worth to his daughter.Of course, for the ultranationalistic Mishima, the story provides little more than literary cover for his philosophical leanings. In that regard, THE SOUND OF WAVES operates on several symbolic levels. First is the question of fate versus free will - are Hatsue and Shinji fated to be together, or are their actions (and those of others) the driving forces from free choice that bring them together. Mishima offers events on both sides of this issue, from Hatsue's writing of hidden notes and Shinji's courageous actions on Uncle Teru's ship during a bad storm on the one hand to the interventions on the other hand by Nature in the form of an angry wasp when Yasuo attempts to seduce Hatsue during her late-night water drawing and during Hatsue's chance meeting of Shinji at the island's former military observation tower.Second is the question of individuality versus community - do Hatsue and Shinji owe more allegiance to the good of their island community and their respective families than to their personal feelings for one another? Mishima idealizes the traditional Japanese cultural emphasis on community and family over the welfare of the individual, presenting a Japan that now seems hopelessly nave and outdated. Every character is ultimately selfless, acting with saintly virtue and atoning for earlier sins and errors before the story's end. Not surprisingly, virtue is its own reward, and each character's selfless action leads, against all societal odds, to a fairy tale ending.Mishima's characters on Uta-Jima live outside of time - like Rousseau's noble savages or Paul Gauguin's Tahitian natives, they live in a world where a healthy and virginal adolescent boy and girl can like naked in each other's arms without apparent thought of consummation. The only person who displays a sense of heightened sexuality is the author himself, who repeatedly demonstrates a female breast fetish that can only be described as disturbing. Life on Uta-Jima projects an Eden-like simplicity, so utterly withdrawn from the modern (i.e., real) world that the story itself could be taking place any time from 1750 to 1950. Not until well into the novel do we discover that World War II is already history (obviously never having touched this Eden) and that the Korean War is underway. Only in the last several chapters of this book, as the story reaches its denouement, does the modern world impinge ever so lightly on Uta-Jima and its inhabitants. Mishima may well have been lionizing them, but to the modern reader's sensibilities, they appear (with the exception of Uncle Teru) as hopelessly childlike, ill-equipped for the Japan we know is charging toward them from a decade or two down the road.THE SOUND OF WAVES is elegant in its slow pacing and narrow story line, illustrating a Japan that may once have existed - or perhaps it only ever existed in idealized form, in Yukio Mishima's mind. Regardless, the story line is classical, the writing as translated by Meredith Weatherby is lyrical, and the world it describes contrasts sharply with the militaristic leanings and violent har-kiri death of its author. Uta-Jima is a life some readers might wish still existed, while others may be glad that such backwardness and nave isolation have followed Mishima into increasingly ancient history."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I read Mishima's \\"The Sailor who fell from Grace with the Sea\\" years ago and while Sailor got rave reviews, I actually preferred this story.Mishima masterfully weaves a simple love story that, despite its Japanese setting, is evocative of youthful love everywhere. The sensitive protagonist is a hero the reader will root for from the first page; of course, it's partly a fairy tale we've read a thousand times before, where the peasant (fisher boy) falls in love with the princess (bourgeois daughter). There are no dragons slain in this tale, however, except those of personal dilemmas and our hero's inevitable rivals.A charming, heartwarming tale of unforgettable characters told with Mishima's trademark poetic simplicity."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Written in a simple yet lovely style that is vaguely reminiscent of Hesse's Siddhartha, Mishima's tale of innocent love and virtue is stirring. Unlike his customarily dark themes, he takes us to a small fishing village on a Japanese isle and creates a legend of two hardy youths that meet and fall in love. Despite their young age, their bonds are strong and through all their trials together you can't help but fall in love with them both. This is an excellent book that I would recommend to any reader."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The book The Sound of Waves by Yukio Mishima first caught my attention when I read one of its short reviews saying that it is the story of first love set on a small Japanese island. I decided to read it and was not disappointed.The book starts when a young and poor fisherman, Shinji, coming back from his work catches a sight of a beautiful girl, Hatsue, a daughter of the wealthiest man in the village. The two young people meet and fall in love with each other - for the first time in their lives. As they set out on adventure of experiencing all joys of their feelings they also have to overcome all the difficulties their life presents them with such as gossips and ill-natured stories aroused by the villagers.Although this book's major theme is first love it is not the only one that compels the reader to take this book and to keep reading until the end. Yes, The Sound of Waves shows all the beauty of being in love for the first time, it describes all the feelings of wonder, joy and uneasiness that love brings. Also this book captures the beauty of nature of a small island, untouched by civilization. Between describing the adventures of the characters, Yukio Mishima takes time to describe the scenery around them - graceful pine-trees, powerful ocean and rocks on the beach. All of these have their own beauty and wisdom in them that teaches and helps any person from the island that needs it. People and nature in this book are intermingled with each other in some natural and powerful way.The island is very remote and has its distinct traditions and ways of living and thinking; and the book is excellent in portraying all of these. It describes the ways of fishermen and divers. The book shows the souls of its characters, their hopes and dreams, their reaching out into unknown and growing as a person while still being closely connected with nature and being devoted to each other and their island.The Sound of Waves is a fairly simple book, yet this fact does not make it less forceful. It does not complicate things but rather shows everything in naive and simple perspective full of events and feelings. If you are looking for some romantic and charming story, The Sound of Waves is your pick."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I was forced to read this book by the Honors program at my school, and i thought it was pure revenge against the students from our teachers...but...After I started reading this book, I got addicted, and kept on reading and wanted to know what was going to happen next. I thought it was very inspiring and truthful. Being a Buddhist myself, I understood what the writer had to say. I know 1 thing...I didn't spend my summer reading junk, but i spent it wisely by choosing this book...=)"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Of all the Mishima novels I have read, this is my favorite. Although it is not as complex as, for example, the books in the Sea of Fertility tetralogy, it nonetheless has a feeling of contentment that is lacking in his later works."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"At first read I was charmed by the book and thought a typical love story where the love always prevail. But then at my second time around I began to see the deeper meaning of what Mishima was trying to say. Throughout the whole story he uses the character to convey a tension between the carefree good spirit wildness of Shinji and Hatsue and the evil ill spirit controled spirit of Chiyoto and Yasou. I love the theme and the message that Mishima conveys through the book."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Japanese tend to be shy and meek people, which surprised me greatly to read the dramatically brief and stark blunt nudity scenes described in this book. Such an innocent cover, but this book really is full of shocks and surprises. This truely is a timeless story about two lovers, a rich female with a posessive and over protective father, who's intelligence we are incapable of knowing at first glance. Super."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound of Waves, by Yukio Mishima, is the second book I've read by this author (The Sailor Who Fell From Grace with the Sea), and I can see the similarities in styles. I wonder if I'll recognize it in his other works.In The Sound of Waves, a young, poor Japanese fisherman is transfixed by the daughter of the island community's richest man. She returns his affections, but dissatisfied suitors begin a campaign of rumor that tarnishes their relationship, particularly with Hatsue's rich father.Author Mishima makes it clear that he had a critical eye regarding the topics and places he writes about. The reader feels the drudgery, and importance, of the various activities in a fishing community, plus the politics and dynamics of a small town. The ending can be faulted as being vapid, but still satisfying. Mishima seems to leave plenty behind for the imagination."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound of Waves is, simply put, a story of romantic love woven from the simple life of a fishing village in post-war Japan. Mishima's book doesn't include vast social criticism, but rather hearkens back to a world where common people have simple dreams, and where right wins out in the end.The highlight of the book is perhaps the descriptions of people and nature, and especially the way nature affects people. Butterflies are signs, but Mishima makes clear that it is people who make them such, and not the gods. The sea and village are both backdrops to Shinji's and Hatsue's romantic coming of age, and their romance is on their own shoulders with only the feelings and ambitions of their rejected alternatives to stand in their way.A good read for any time when you're in the right amorous mood."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Mishima was such a great writer and this story is such a beautiful tale and full of nature and the angry sea. True love conquers all in the end I guess even if it's a cliche. This is easy to read and can appeal to any age from middle school to senior citizen. I recommend it as a gift to someone you love. This is so tame compared to his other darker but great other books. I'm sorry the world has lost this man."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This book is a great example of the perfect romance/love story; guy falls for girl, girl falls for guy, they get married, etc. However, Shinji and Hatsue had a lot of obstacles to overcome before they could be together. The characters did this with will power and personal strength, which I think is also major theme of the book. Not only Shinji and Hatsue show examples of this theme, but will power is also displayed by Shinji's mother and the mistress of the lighthouse. This theme is not immediately obvious, but many retorical devices of the book symbolize it, so there is an essance of it there, under the surface. The book shows a great tale of love; however, will power is what helped the characters obtain their happiness."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"i've read many of mishima's later works, and was surprised by the gentleness and simplicity of this story. while lacking the undercurrents of torment and eroticism he later developed, this poetic little novel is timeless."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I read this book, and it was really nice. It talks about a young man named Shinji and how he falls in love with a young woman named Hatsue. They can't let the neighborhood know that they like eachother because Hatsue is more upper-class. It has a wonderful story line and I reccomend this book to people of all ages...but especially to teenagers who love to read about love stories."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and consider it one of his finest works. It's subtle presentation and simplistic beauty just makes it an amazing story. It is HIGHLY recommended to anyone who wants a purely beautiful story. If yer looking for Stephen King or Robert Heinline, you'll be disappointed--however, if you want something with some soul, READ THIS!!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This is a story of young love in a fishing village in Japan. It is a gem. We have a simple boy, salt in his hair and dreaming of nothing more than owning his own fishing boat some day. And here is a simple girl training to be a diver after mollusks. (True, this particular occupation has been an object of cheesy soft-core since Hokusai and before, but . . . .) The story has a timeless quality--there is no other way to put it. The boats run on diesel, but it is no accident that our setting is an island, removed from the dust and distractions of Tokyo, where other stories by Mishima are studies in anxiety, squalor, materialism and so forth. There is no element of badness here, save a little jealousy and deceit which are painted as, in their way, natural things. As our young ones have their first thrills of intimacy in a secluded hut, their love seems to crystallize the tender innocence of the place, the sunburned faces and pine trees rustling in the salty breeze. Remember this old, old tanka:&quot;If only the world would always stay this way, fishermen drawing up their boats on misty banks.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I noticed most of the people who gave this book 3 stars or less were grade schoolers who were assigned to read this. Being a grade schooler isn't so bad. But they probably gave it a low rating because they were assigned to read it. Being assigned to read something actually makes grade schoolers more critical of the book. Many times I hated a book I was assigned to read in grade school or college, only to pick it up years later and have greater appreciation for it. Hopefully, those kids will read this years later and see the beauty of this book.My quick review: the prose was lean and detailed. Themes include jealousy, gossip, misunderstandings, and hard work pays off. I liked the protagonist. He was simple but not simple-minded. So many times in my life I've let the negativity of others get me down. Petty people don't like humility; they think it is a sign of weakness. Nor do they like confidence; they think it is a sign of arrogance. This book showed how harmless actions can cause petty people to get you into trouble. But the protagonist didn't let it get him down. I loved that about this book. He just kept being himself and working toward his goal. In the end, he was greatly rewarded while those who tried to bring him down were put to shame. I recommend this book to people who need to remember to keep going for positive goals; don't dwell on the foolishness of others; and your reward will be more than you expect."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Yukio Mishima does write some more complex novels (such as Spring Snow) but for a rather short, enjoyable, and quick read this novel is perfect. Though the translation is dated, it is still excellent. The story is timeless and transcends time and place.The characters are rather interesting, though not very well fleshed out due to the short length of the novel. While I did find the three main characters were much more important to the story, there are several minor characters who are incredibly interesting and intriguing, especially Hatsue's father.A lot of the book does deal with Japanese customs, but the reader can identify with these characters even from a different culture. Despite cultural differences, we all want the same thing, we all respect honor and loyalty and yearn for love and acceptance. A wonderful message and a wonderful book.Update 11/2011: After reading the Sea of Fertility tetralogy, I have become a great Yukio Mishima fan. This is a great short novel to get into his work. After reading this, Spring Snow is surely a great second novel to dive into."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This was a homework asignment project. The book was interesting but it would not be my choice for pleasure reading. Nothing wrong with the book or writing, Its just not my type of book to read."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound of Waves is a simple and charming story about two young people falling in love, their trials and triumph, on a tiny island that lies in the straits connecting the Gulf of Ise with the Pacific. The 1400 inhabitants of Uta-jima (Song Island) live in a tightly woven, stratified society that mirrors the larger Japanese culture in its essentials, though the island has been bypassed by much of the postwar modernization sweeping over the rest of Japan.Shinji is 18 when the story opens, a recent graduate of high school where he earned notably poor grades. His inclinations propel him in another direction: that of the robust physical outdoorsman, working on a small fishing boat earning a living harvesting mainly octopus from the sea, whose presence dominates the lives of all the islanders. Shinji's mother, a widow, ekes out a living as a diving woman.The island's calm routines rarely ever change; thus it is a topic of conversation when a new face turns up on the island. Shinji first sees the unfamiliar girl on the beach as he is going to visit the lighthouse keeper, and later, on the fishing boat, he learns that she is the daughter of Uncle Teru Miyata. One of four daughters, Hatsue, had been put out for adoption to a family of diving women on another island. But when Miyata's only son was killed, he called her back, had her put back in the family register and decided to adopt a husband into the family for her to carry on the name.Shinji's dormant adolescent feelings have been stirred by his encounter with Hatsue, and he suddenly finds himself distracted by thoughts of her. At the same time, he is reminded that his lowly station in life places her beyond his reach. That night, at a meeting of the Young Men's Association, Shinji learns that Yasuo Kawamoto, the son of a prominent village family, has been invited to a homecoming celebration for Hatsue. It would appear that Kawamoto, whose social standing eclipses Shinji's, is Hatsue's father's likely choice for his daughter's future husband.The rest of the story relates the growing attraction between Hatsue and Shinji, and the rivalry between Shinji and the self-important Kawamoto, who assumes that he will prevail.Eventually Hatsue's father arranges to have both Shinji and Yasuo serve as apprentice seamen on one of his ocean-going vessels. Unbeknownst to either of them, he has designed this as a test of their mettle. The one who shows the greatest \\"get up and go\\" will win Hatsue's hand.The steamer sails for Okinawa to pick up a cargo. Shinji throws himself into the life of a sailor, while Yasuo slacks off and brags that he will become the owner of the ship when he marries Hatsue after the voyage (thus enraging the captain). A tense moment arrives when, setting out for home during a typhoon, the ship is forced to return to harbor. Moored to a buoy, the craft lurches in the storm-tossed sea. One of the mooring lines snaps, and the ship's officers are fearful that the others might come loose and they would be set adrift. The captain asks for a volunteer to swim to the buoy and attach another line.While Yasuo cowers fearfully, Shinji steps forward and dives into the turbulent sea. The mission, though fraught with tension and danger, is a success. The ship rides out the storm and sails for home.Teru announces that he has decided on Shinji as a husband for Hatsue. The reports of the ship's captain have convinced him that Shinji has the most \\"get-up-and-go.\\"It was deceiving to read this book before taking up Temple of the Golden Pavilion and Confessions of a Mask. In those books, written before Sound of Waves, Mishima's complex personality is exposed: his self doubts, homosexuality, obsession with death and blood. Compared with these works, Waves seems completely out of character. The plot is romantic, the characters wholesome and one-dimensional. Even the world they inhabit, an island, stands apart. One wonders why he wrote it? Was it because he knew this story would be a resounding commercial success? Mishima's biographer John Nathan relates that Mishima referred to TSOW as \\"that joke on the public.\\"There were, apparently, other commercial novels that remain untranslated. Mishima seems to have pursued two parallel careers, one that brought him predictable financial rewards, the other a riskier artistic path (that nonetheless brought great fame, commercial success, and Nobel Prize nominations). The duality resembles that near schizophrenic divided personality that drove him to extremes throughout his life."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"It's a young romance. Usually I don't like romances, but this one made a lot of sense. It gave a sense of innocence; gave actual typical adolescent behavior; coming to terms with infatuation, sexuality, and pride; and a great moral in the end. Beautifully described about village islanders' situations and everyday life. After I read this, I wanted to get this story in the original Japanese, just like Mishima's \\"Temple of the Golden Pavilion\\"."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This book is not like all the other love novels because it seems to deliver from a different background (actually, it does deliver from a different background). If you have read The Temple of the Golden Pavilion by Yukio Mishima you may like this book. And if you haven't read the Temple.....then you should. This man was a genius, many saw him as disturbed as many geniuses were/are in fact. And for a little more background information, Yukio Mishima was the final person in Japan to commit honorable seppuku which is honorable suicide.

Definately a must read!"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Richard Hugo, an excellent poet and teacher, said that each poem has two subjects - the triggering subject (or the story), and the second, deeper subject. This holds true for many great works of literature, not just poems, and The Sound of Waves is no exception.On the surface, we have a subtly erotic love story about Shinji and Hatsue, two hard-working young Japanese people in a close-knit, isolated, traditional village. They go on with their romance despite ugly rumors which prompt Hatsue's father, Terukichi (known as &quot;Uncle Teru&quot;) to forbid his daughter from seeing Shinji. There is a happy ending, but I won't give it away.This is more than your typical love story. The main characters, Shinji and Hatsue, are ideal Japanese people in the traditional, uncorrupted village: hard-working, devoted to the family, honest, and religious. The rumormongers are Westernized: Chiyoko - a pessimistic girl - is a student in western literature at a city university, and Yasuo - a rude, selfish, lazy boy who wants Hatsue for himself - is well-read in pulp magazines. It is traditional Japanese willpower and discipline that keeps Shinji and Hatsue together despite their obstacles.What is remarkable is that the book does not make its point with a sledgehammer. The traditional characters win out, not because they tattle or scream; their integrity forces the modern characters to face the errors of their modern ways. This book is almost as relavent to our changing America as it was to Mishima's changing Japan. One read-through and you will understand Mishima's patriotism, his long quest for a return to tradition that led to his seppuku."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I was forced into reading this book by my Language Arts teacher, as a comparison to Romeo and Juliet.

I would have given it a 3 if it wasn't for the last sentence, which left me angry and irritated, I won't go into it incase someone else actually wants to read it to find out, though I suggest against it.Also, there are some fairly graphic scenes with discriptions that I really didn't want to read."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"this book is okay about 2 teeangers who fall in lve. nothing special..i had to read it for school and i was pretty much bored all the time but if you really wanna read this go ahead if u r in to all that love stuff"},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I had to read this book &quot;The Sound of Waves&quot; by Yukio Mishima for school. We were supposed to read it and write about the human emotions that the book expressed. This was a very tough assignment because the book didn't express much. Even though the stroy is a love story the plot moves very slowly. This is because of the excessive despcription of even insignificant things throughout the story. If one were to cut the inane descriptions the story would be about 20 pages long. However, it would also be a much better story. The reader would be able to understand the true power of love that does manage to shine through all of the excessive imagery. Other than the fact that the author had to some how manage to make the book over 100 pages long the story is fair. It is interesting to all ages, prbably more to those interested in love stories and romance. Younger readers will get a taste of mid 1900's Japanese vulture as well as a pretty entertaining tale.

This book have very easy ideas and easy to understand. It is like many other romantic stories and you can pretty much predict. For me I didn't really like the book because it is too concrete. I like to solve problem and figure out what is going to come next, but this book did not give me the chance to do so. However, the cover and introduction of the book really caught my attention and basically that is why I chose the book.The book is about two teenagers fell in love the first time they met. Unfortunately, both of them had an arrangement of marriage with someone else, so the two lovers need to go through some obstacle to get together. Both of them need to find ways to deal with their parent and people in the village.So if you want to read a book that is simple and easy to understand, then I recommend you to read this book.

Then read it a second time to appreceiate it's literary value -- the simple but lively characterazation, the beautiful yet realistic protray of the island landscape/seascape.In a more subtle philosophical note, this book express Mishima's believe in the traditional Japanese values.

The biggest challenge they have is that Shinji the boy is poor and his social class puts him in a disadvantage compared to the son of the richest man in town.

On one level, this is a timeless story of coming of age and young love. On another level, it is the story of a Japan rarely seen, that of a small fishing island off the main island. Or, it is a story about words, meaning only Mishima can write such fluid, crisp, and spare prose which are both poetic and descriptive. The gift of this novel, as in most of Mishima's work, is not in the story, but in the way it is told."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"When I picked up this book, the book jacket said something like &quot;And so, Mr. Mishima uses a simple setting of a fishing village to create an unforgettable love scene of amazing tenderness and purity.&quot; I remember being skeptical about this, thinking &quot;Tenderness? In this century? Pshaw! This Mr. Mishima must be full of it.&quot; And I've never been happier to be wrong.The Sound of Waves is not a multi-faceted epochal genre-shattering masterpiece. And it's all the better for it. It's an extremely simple love story set in a remote Japanese island where the people work all their lives fishing and/or diving for pearls. And it's beautiful. The book jacket was right on. Hatsue is portrayed with such amazing tenderness and sympathy on the author's part that she becomes a human being, but she's not the only one. The &quot;ugly girl&quot; who falls in love with Shinji is also an amazingly real person. As is Shinji's mother, as is almost everybody else. It's incredibly refreshing to finally read an author who eschews all that arty &quot;deep complex psyche&quot; crud for the sake of such simple, yet unmistakably _human_ characterization.Sometimes the language seems a little clunky - this is entirely the fault of the translation. I imagine it must sound even more beautiful in the original Japanese. (And the translation is no great impediment - come on, this book _is_ extremely short.) In short, this is why humanity invented writing - so authors like Mishima could write books like The Sound of Waves. Now, I've only read three of his works, so it's theoretically possible that he has surpassed The Sound of Waves somewhere else, but I doubt it. Remarkable."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Mishima wrote The Sound of Waves after a European trip whose highlight was ten days in Greece. In form and texture the novel has a myth-like feel, and it extols the classical virtues of discipline, forbearance and honoring tradition. This book has an earnestness that sets it apart from the self-conscious posturing so prevalent in other Mishima novels.Shinji, a teen age fisherman on a small island off the coast of Japan, falls in love with Hatsue, a robustly beautiful abalone diver who is the daughter of the richest man on their island. Hatusue's father opposes her love for the poor but virtuous Shinji, wanting her to marry the better connected Yasuo instead. The lovers persevere in the face of this obstacle, Shinji's mettle is tested on the high seas, and, without revealing the ending, let's say that readers of traditional romance stories will not be dismayed by what happens here.Years after its publication, Mishima tended to treat this novel, which was wildly popular and almost immediately turned into a movie, as something of a joke he had played on the public. (Though it's easier to see why this book, a sort of Japanese version of Love Story, was so popular, as opposed to Norwegian Wood, Murakami's twisted tale of young love that was equally popular a few decades later.) But Mishima has put significant craft and effort into The Sound of Waves, such as gorgeous descriptions of the rugged, isolated island, and a a real feeling for the sweaty rhythms of fishermen's work. The anguish and ecstasy endemic to young love are delicately, fluently evoked. We find no traces of authorial snickering in either the plot or the prose.If we take the novel at face value - a sincere attempt to tell a timeless love story in as emotionally honest and straightforward a way as possible - then we can also view it as Mishima's attempt to embrace the traditional Japanese virtues of modesty, self-effacement and following the rules. If this book is Mishima's attempt to adopt the mindset of a \\"normal\\" Japanese, something he was constitutionally incapable of being almost from birth, then the novel takes on a poignancy that is not specifically derived from the story. The boy may get the girl, but Mishima will never get the comfort that comes from being part of the herd. Instead it was his fate to soar high, and, like Icarus, pay the ultimate price for his presumption."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"I read this book for my senior summer reading and I was stunned by how it soon engulfed me. I just couldn't put down the book! The characters and story were well developed and there was always something to keep you in suspense. It is definitely a great romantic novel."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Written in 1954, this is Mishima's fourth novel and one that stands out from his more famous works in a number of ways.Mishima is mostly known for character introspection; dark, mysterious protagonists whose psyches are peeled away chapter by chapter. \\"The Sound of Waves\\" isn't like that. It's not like many Mishima novels that I've read.It's a simple love story. Kind of reminiscent of the one told in \\"Spring Snow\\", although here, we're given a more minimal brush stroke from the writer in that the story's setting takes place on a very small, secluded island off of mainland Japan.Though it would be easy to label this as typical Japanese romance-drama, it's really more than that. It shows a writer coming out of his shell and holds some very beautiful passages that I would attribute only to Mishima. He writes in a way that is very personal for me, so I guess I'm a little biased, but this is a great piece of work.Like the tide pulling sand from a beach, Mishima's place in literature becomes more apparent with each novel I progress through."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The story Mishima tells of the love between a young fisherman and a pretty girl newly-arrived into his tiny world is sweet and touching in itself. However, peeling back the layers of the love story reveals Mishima's sense of Japan and its place in history.The Japanese nationalism lurking underneath the simple story is evident only upon further understanding of Mishima's life and writings. There are far away lands where wonders exist that could not be seen on Shinji's small island, but these things lose their meaning once they are out of sight. Shinji himself is young and strong, a metaphor for the Japan that Mishima imagined.A very good book for the beginning reader of Mishima. A second read is warranted to understand the nationalist underpinnings of his writing, though."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Sound of Waves is a story of 2 young teenagers falling in love with each other on a very strict island. In the book Sound Of Waves, the most memorable part was the letter writing between Hatsue and Shinji. Shinji and Hatsue meet at the light house and Shinji gives Hatsue a seashell. My favorite character is Hatsue because she knows how to defend herself from others. She is not a type of person that likes to be pushed around by others. What I liked about the book was when Shinji and Hatsue met each other at the light house and Shinji pretended to be asleep while watching Hatsue getting undressed. The part I didn't like was that Hatsue's father prohibits her from seeing her boyfriend. Hatsue's father would not see Shinji's mother. The book has a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Certainly the &quot;nicest&quot; Mishima novel I've read -- sweet, even. It was wonderful to read this after some of his darker work; it shows that Mishima has a lucid grasp of both ends of the artistic and aesthetic spectrum, and is not necessarily preoccupied with being disturbing. While not my favorite, this is a fine, fine novel; where some of Mishima's other books will only appeal to some, The Sound of Waves I could easily recommend to almost anyone who doesn't make squinchy faces at the mere mention of classic literature."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"A love story situated in a small little fishing village.I'm sure you can read the synopsis from the other reviews. Therefore, I'd just like to say that this book is worth reading because:1) It is short and easy to read.2) It is well-written and has that Japanese &quot;thing&quot; about it.3) It definitely surpasses modern pop-culture style love stories."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The book itself is beautiful. It's an easy read on a simple love story. My only complaints would be the time it took to get to my house and the spine had a little dent. I needed the book to get to my house ASAP (for school), but it took a lot longer than I expected. The spine on the bottom had a small but noticeable dent. Both problems are minor, but are the reason why I am rating this a 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"As the title of the review says. The book doesn't innovate in the genre, is a tad cliche, etc... yet somehow still manages to be captivating and interesting.Character development is part of it. I mean, the protagonist (Shinji) isn't some sort of uber-stud perfect guy (for once), Hatsue isn't very cliche either, though I can't pin down any reasons why. The main thing that I liked about it was that the characters seemed like _real_ people, not a cheesy-pickup-line-spouting product of a bad imagination.The story was a tad cliche, but was nonetheless very good. My main reason for liking the story is that it wasn't a few paragraphs of romance thrown into another story here and there just for kicks, the purpose of the book was to be a romance novel and nothing else. I say this in comparison to other stories, like the LotR movies, which threw in 5-10 minutes of Aragorn and Arwen being mushy (which wasnt even in the book) just to attract a wider audience and make more money...But anyway, I'm rambling... the point is that this book is GOOD. And that's coming from person who HATES romance novels, so that's gotta be some indicator as to the quality of the work."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"Sound of Waves is a typical love story that takes place in an idyllic Japan. It has many elements which was very perdictable, Boys meets Girl, Boy falls in love, etc. As I see it, this is Yukio Mishima's thoughs as to how Japan should achieve modernization without losing tradition values. The author of this book was an extreme patriot and lived during the second world war. I suggest this to anybody who enjoys good romances. This book does though lag in any real exitement, but that's how fairytales are.If you actually read this, e-mail me and give me some feedback if you read the book."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"If you want to read a romantic and straight forward book, Then The Sound of Waves, by Yukio Mishima, is right for you. This book have very easy ideas and easy to understand. It is like many other romantic stories and you can pretty much predict. For me I didn't really like the book because it is too concrete. I like to solve problem and figure out what is going to come next, but this book did not give me the chance to do so. However, the cover and introduction of the book really caught my attention and basically that is why I chose the book.The book is about two teenagers fell in love the first time they met. Unfortunately, both of them had an arrangement of marriage with someone else, so the two lovers need to go through some obstacle to get together. Both of them need to find ways to deal with their parent and people in the village.So if you want to read a book that is simple and easy to understand, then I recommend you to read this book. Because it is so easy to understand, it does increase your reading rate and build up your vocabulary. Overall, this book is not too bad, and not the best."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"At first read I was charmed by the book and thought a typical love story where the love always prevail. But then at my second time around I began to see the deeper meaning of what Mishima was trying to say. Throughout the whole story he uses the character to convey a tension between the carefree good spirit wildness of Shinji and Hatsue and the evil ill spirit controled spirit of Chiyoto and Yasou. I love the theme and the message that Mishima conveys through the book."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"\\"The Sound of Waves\\" by Yukio Mishima appears to be a modern classic that is not holding up well to the test of time. It was one of the first modern literary novels coming out of postwar Japan to gain wide recognition and fame. Its 1956 release in English translation a decade after the close of World War II was perfect timing. It soon became a standard in English classes all over the United States. The book appealed on many levels: as exquisite lyrical literature; as a charming first-love and coming-of-age tale with strong moral overtones; but perhaps most importantly, as a subtle way to build better understanding about a culture that young Americans needed to accept with greater respect following years of war-induced Japanese demonization.I was only ten years old when this book came on the American scene, so I missed out on having to read it as a teenager. I read it for the first time a few days ago, more than fifty years after it was first published in English. I approached the book with great expectations, but I was sorely disappointed.First, I suspect much of the original beauty of this lyrical novel is lost in translation. There is still a great deal in the writing to be admired, but the words lack the sparkle of innovation that no doubt exists in the original Japanese.The story is endearing in its lyric simplicity, but it stretches the credulity of the modern mind. Perhaps I am too world-weary and academically well-read, but for me the story seemed far too unrealistic--more like a fairy tale. All was too rosy, too one-sidedly idealistic, too much the idyll--the perfect harmony of man and nature. I've read too much anthropology to know this is possible at any time, in any culture. The noble savage is, after all, a complete fiction. \\"The Sound of Waves\\" was Mishima's own delusional vision of a perfect Japanese past that was quickly slipping away. It was a theme he returned to repeatedly over the next fifteen years of his life before committing seppuku (ritualistic suicide) because, in his words: \\"I came to wish to sacrifice myself for the old, beautiful tradition of Japan, which is disappearing very quickly day by day.\\" Mishima certainly was not a man of sound mind.I see no continuing redeeming value to reading this fairy tale in the present day. In its time, it sparked an interest as a lovely tale about love in Japan--subconsciously, it helped move many toward a love of Japan. But those times are over. There is widespread tolerance and understanding of differing cultures.Today, there are far more compelling works of worldwide modern literary fiction, some written directly in English, that have more meaningful messages to convey to the modern reader--messages that may help us deal with the reality of the human predicament that we find ourselves in at this, the beginning of the 21st century--this an age of widespread terrorism and ecological disaster, a time where oil wars, water wars, global climate change, and famine loom on the not-too-distant horizon. Much modern world literature aims indirectly to helps readers comes to terms with these all too pressing comtemporary world issues. If you are not familiar with these books and themes, try reading most Booker Prize winning authors."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"This is a book about two teenagers who fall in love. One of them is a Fisherman and the other is the richest man in the villages daughter. they both go through a lot of conflict in priving their love."},{"Title":"The Sound of Waves","review":"The Sound Of Waves is one of the best &quot;little books&quot; I've ever read. While there isn't much deep philosophical introspection, it is a brilliant story, crystal-clear, with no wasted words. It tells the tale of Shinji, a young man just becoming aware of his sexuality, and his love for a pearl diver named Hatsue. While the love story is very traditional and familiar, Mishima uses subtle and strikingly vivid imagry to make the book fully come to life in the reader's mind. Mishima was a body-worshiping homosexual, and like the romantic works of Pierre Loti, the boy-girl story is probably a cover-up for a boy-boy relationship. Mishima's lust for the male body comes out in this book during his descriptions of the young men at their club meating. The book's ending, a nice twist, also brings into focus that aspect of Mishima's philosophy and lifestyle. I enjoyed the book very much; it was good company during a sleepless night."},{"Title":"Wilhelm Hohenzollern: The last of the kaisers","review":"The historical record about the mental and emotional state of Kaiser Wilhelm II is quite clear, he was fundamentally a weak and unstable personality. Unfortunately, once he was able to retire Otto von Bismarck there was no person with the strength of character and the political backing in the government to compensate for his antics. Furthermore, most of the rest of the world was also unstable. Tsar Nicholas of the Russian Empire was another weak monarch, the Ottoman Empire was continuing to fall apart, the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was held together only by the presence of the aged Franz Joseph and the power of the working classes continued to rise.This book is a history of Wilhelm II, from his birth that left him with a deformed left arm, through his early years and finally to his abdication and movement to Holland. The emphasis is on the years from his ascending to the throne up until the start of World War I. Specifically, his ramblings and machinations that led to the alienation of both the Russian and British Empires. The key failure was in the relationship with Great Britain, which was very interested in forging an alliance with Germany. In the last years of the nineteenth century, a great deal of the rivalry between Britain and France remained and there was the real potential for armed conflict between them. However, Wilhelm II insisted on continuing his buildup of the German navy, an action that could never serve any purpose except to antagonize the British. Once the relationships between Germany and Russia and Germany and Great Britain failed, the only significant ally that Germany could have was Austria-Hungary.It is a consensus among historians that if there had been a Bismarck in the German government in the early part of the twentieth century, World War I would not have happened. Bismarck's clever system of alliances and understandings between nations would have prevailed and the assassination of the Archduke in Sarajevo would have been nothing more than a local conflict. From this description of the actions of Wilhelm II, you can understand what a tragic figure he was, a man put into a position that he was totally unsuited for. His childlike antics generated contempt and fear even among his fellow Germans and age and experience were unable to turn him into an effective ruler."},{"Title":"Safety Net, internet safety, child pornografy on the net, ethical hacking","review":"One of the major strengths of the book is the author's discussion of how some of the more popular software programs available today are designed to block problem Websites and their indecent material. Although these programs do not assure 100% successful filtering, the author does rate them and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each one. The author correctly states that human oversight is always superior to filtering software. Therefore, parents, teachers, and others should always exercise adequate control over the child use of the Internet and the online services.Another strength I found fascinating was the description of clever programming and marketing ploys used to gain the attention of those online. As the author points out, some people will use extremely clever means to ensnare children and adults alike. To his credit the author cites examples of other threats apart from sexually explicit material. He writes of twelve children who followed easy-to-follow instructions found on the Internet on how to build homemade grenades. A number of these children were badly hurt when their grenades exploded. Other children online have formed close intimate ties with others and have actually left home to meet their newly found &quot;friends&quot;.The author rounds out the book by offering an adequate glossary of terms, a list of safe Websites for kids, instructions for surfing the Internet, setting up and operating parental control software, and a very helpful guide to detect the presence of suggestive material. The book is footnoted to provide readers with documented sources. Readers should visit the Kidshield Website for updated and additional information.The incidents cited in the book are reason enough to be on guard for the welfare of children today. Sadly, at present we cannot rely upon local, state, and federal governments to protect children from the exposure of negative influences that exist on the Internet, whatever they may be. We should take immediate a! ction to make such threats much less of a problem and burden. This book offers a thoughtful response to a problem every parent, teacher, and other concerned persons in this technological era should become familiar with. Get a firm grip on this problem before this problem gets a firm grip on your kids!"},{"Title":"Growing In God's Image","review":"Growing in God's Image is the fourth book in a series that was preceded by God Help Me!, Starting Over God's Way and Moving Forward God's Way. Growing in God's Image can also be read independently from the other books by those who already experience and enjoy Christian faith.Mr. Walker encourages his readers to develop a personal closeness with Jesus, God and the Holy Spirit that transcends merely observing the ordinary forms of worship. This encouragement is buttressed by many quotations from the New Testament.To fulfill our potential, we must submit to God's plan for us at all times. This means taking time to stop and listen for guidance before acting. With greater deliberation, we can live the lives on Earth that God intended for us. Also, we can flourish in the comfort of always having God with us so that we do not face our troubles and temptations alone. In addition, we should model our lives on the life of Jesus and draw inspiration from reading the Bible on a daily basis.The message is filled with the hopefulness and love that shout out at us as we read the early books of the New Testament that describe the life of Jesus.May God bless you!"},{"Title":"Growing In God's Image","review":"Walker's best so far. (Mark 8:34-38) Christ has called us to take up our cross and follow Him.To grow in God's image we must become a new creation in Him. In this book you will learn how to do this. Through the author's own personal trials and tribulations and his experiences ministering to others you will gain his insight into what God has revealed to him and wants all of us to know. God loves us and longs for us to have a deep personal intimate relationship with Him. All it takes is for you to put your complete faith and trust in God, surrender your self-will to His will. You will soon find the person God had originally intended you to be; others will see the image of God in you as you become a servant of God serving others in His name.I highly recommend Clarence Walker's other books: God Help Me; Starting Over God's Way; and Moving Forward God's Way.\\"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?\\""},{"Title":"Most Evil Mobsters in History","review":"The most evil mobsters in this book are:Joseph BonannoAl CaponePaul CastellanoFrank CostelloCarlo GambinoVito GenoveseSam GiancanaJohn GottiSammy GravanoMeyer LanskyLucky LucianoGeorge MoranDean O'BanionDutch SchultzBugsy SiegelThis is without any doubt the best book in the 'Most evil ...' series there is.

Each chapter covers a top mobster in 9-15 readable pages (plus a few photos), including Al Capone, John Gotti, Sam Giancana, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, Carlo Gambino, etc. We learn about each man's start in the crime syndicate, their special talents, and the roles they played as they rose through the ranks. Not suprisingly, most were from New York City or Chicago, although Bugsy Siegel (Las Vegas) and Meyer Lansky (Miami & Havanna) later branched out to warmer climes. Each mob figure was influential, street wise, and one clearly not to be crossed. Readers come away with a better understanding of organized crime in the USA, its extending reach, and its dangerous, corrupting influence.The author is occasionally repetitive and delves into unproven areas regarding the mob, Castro and the Kennedy's. Also, some might ask why she omitted Tony Accardo and mob bosses from cities other than New York and Chicago. Still, this makes very interesting reading."},{"Title":"The 500 Best Ways for Teens to Spend the Summer: Learn About Programs for College Bound High School Students (College Admissions Guides)","review":"I am a career coach who helps young people optimally position themselves to colleges, graduate schools and employers.

Meditation, as described in Feel Better Now...Meditation, requires none of that.In clear, simple and gentle language, he explains -- often using amusing illustrations from everyday life -- what meditation is, how to do it and what benefits you may expect from the practice. As a long-term meditator, I found the book an excellent review, and even picked up a few new hints.I am also a churchgoing Christian. Some Christians think the practice of meditation is in opposition to Christian principles. While I respect their right to their views, I believe that meditation in no way contradicts, interferes with or dilutes my practice of my religion. Many Christians, including clergy, practice some form of meditation.If you want to learn how to meditate or review the basics, this book is for you.

In that regard, this small gem of a book has been quite a find! It deals, as the subtitle says, with &quot;Buddhist explorations of consciousness and time&quot; through a historical and philosophical account of the third set of the Buddha's teachings, the &quot;basket&quot; of wisdom. Although the subject matter is rigorously discussed from a philosophical standpoint, the book is anything but dry philosophy. Here, in enjoyable and fairly straightforward language, the author brings alive the fundamental Buddhist analytical and synthetical approaches for understanding of the nature of reality, and yet makes this potentially academic study reverberate wonderfully into such practical areas as the need for pure moral discipline, as well as pointing the way to more effective training in meditative tranquility and insight. I think this is one to keep on the bookshelf and re-read and study again from time to time as one's practice deepens, and it will also serve undoubtedly for me as a starting off point for a wealth of further studies, contemplations and meditations."},{"Title":"Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time","review":"Nyanaponika introduces Early Buddhist philosophical psychology in detail. He shows that the common and superficial understanding of the Buddhist theory of self - according to which the theory is a mere list of the parts of a self - is wrong and overlooks the Abhidhamma (probably because it is an abstruse section of the Buddhist canon). The theory includes an often overlooked but sophisticated and plausible description of functional relations amongst the parts of a self, and Nyanaponika shows this with astonishing vivacity. This shows that the Early Buddhist theory was an early scientific psychology of a functionalist sort: a monumental acheivement in human intellectual history. All the while, he skilfully shows how the theory is logically connected with the Buddhist notion of psychological self-refinement and nirvana. Still, Nyanaponika and the Abhidhamma ideas he explains seem at times to rely on a dubious empirical method: the introspections of ancient Buddhist masters (which may have included the Buddha himself) who wrote the Abhidhamma texts. As a consequence, some of the descriptions of the parts of the self and their functions seem vague or implausible. Also, although Nyanaponika is good at explaining the philosophical as well as the psychological, one might have liked a bit more discussion of the structure of what appears to be an underlying Buddhist argument that there is no self. The book is of interest to philosophers and psychologists."},{"Title":"Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time","review":"The Abhidhamma is a survey of the realms of consciousness together with those concommittents that precede and accompany consciousnes. This book offers a view of that landscape of consciousness in a voice different from Bhikku Bodhi's translation of \\"a Compendium Manual of Abhidhamma\\", giving a greater sensibility for this truth than I began with. It also helps illuminate the Suttas. As there is no self, much of the mechanics of my idiosyncratic persona I attributed to selfhood can be extrapolated through understanding this compendium of thought. Well worth the price and the time to read it."},{"Title":"Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time","review":"In Abhidhamma Studies, the Ven. Nyanaponika Thera has done something truly unique. For many of those who have a cursory acquaintance with its contents, the Abhidhamma is an impenetrable thicket of terms and tables. It is seen either as the dense high philosophy of monks who succeeded the Buddha, or the loftiest teachings of the Buddha, meant for gods and enlightened monks.In this book, Nyanaponika Thera brings the Abhidhamma down to Earth and gives us just a glimpse of the insights it yet waits to unfold. In his introduction, Nyanaponika Thera argues that the Abhidhamma is only relevant as an organic, growing discipline engaging the minds of courageous and insightful souls. This work is not a dry summary of the contents of the seven books of the Abhidhamma, but an introduction to the method of the Abhidhamma.The book begins with a brief contextualization of the Abhidhamma. The Abhidhamma is the third \\"basket\\" of the Pali Canon, the canonical scriptures of Theravada Buddhism. It consists of seven books, and these seven books are largely composed of lists of terms, definitions, and classification schemata. The origin of these books, however, is a subject of dispute.One of Nyanaponika Thera's primary aims in this book is to show the profundity of these books. The degree of rigor, consistency, depth, breadth, and purpose one finds in the Abhidhamma cannot help but suggest the presence of a sublime mind. As the author unpacks a small fragment of this teaching, one becomes mesmerized by the subtlety of this system. More importantly, the practical application of the system becomes readily apparent.The purpose of the Abhidhamma is not to systematize and classify all of reality as an intellectual curiosity. Its true aim is to systematize the reality experienced by the mind relative to the goal of liberation. Without this focal point, the system of Abhidhamma would be left chasing its own tail, attempting to prove its own suppositions. However, because liberation provides both the ground and the aim of this system, many of the questions which plague metaphysical systems become moot. For instance, the question \\"what is a phenomenon?\\" is replaced by the question, \\"what are the characteristics of phenomena?\\" In the view of liberation, it is very important to realize that phenomena are impermanent, impersonal, and unsatisfactory. Beyond this, it is not relevant to attempt to define phenomena in terms of something else.The Abhidhamma is a great boon for anyone attempting to understand causality at a deeper level. Nyanaponika Thera gives a beautiful exposition of the system's two-fold method of analysis and synthesis. Through analysis, the Abhidhamma dissolves the solidified reality of \\"I\\" and personality into a multitude of mental factors. Through synthesis, the Abhidhamma shows the relations which exist between these factors, and how they challenge or support one another.Nyanaponika Thera's insights will mirror the experience of all those who have taken some time to witness the mechanics of their own mind. More importantly, his writing offers a tool to refine our own observations. A critical insight offered by the author is that the way we observe can affect the course of what we are observing. For instance, we might find that our mind is see-sawing between agitation and tranquility. If we focus unwisely on the agitation, we may very well increase the agitation to the point where tranquility leaves the scene altogether. Similarly, if we focus wisely on the tranquility, the agitation may very well subside. The author offers many examples of how mental factors engage and balance one another, and for those who are devoted to maintaining continuous mindfulness, these observations are invaluable.Abhidhamma Studies succeeds on multiple levels. As an introduction to the system and method of Abhidhamma, it reveals this branch of the Pali Canon to be a perennial philosophy, a body of thought which not only provides timeless philosophical, psychological, and ethical insights, but also opens myriad channels of exploration and exposition. As applied Abhidhamma, it demonstrates the power of both the system and the method, delivering practical insights for anyone engaged in serious meditation. Most importantly, this work demonstrates the value of a clear and focused mind directed toward understanding the subtlest mechanics of reality. It invites us to establish a continuous awareness of the causal mechanics of our mind, destabilizing the ego and paving the way to wisdom.For those with a philosophical inclination, this book is a nourishing gourmet meal. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time","review":"The book flies very high on the contents of the third basket of the Canon by only focusing on the description and categorization of the main mental dhammas but still presents many obstacles to anyone just familiar with the plain discourses of the Buddha. Still there is something very fascinating on finding oneself dull while reading of one's own mind!Someone might also find interesting the heavy effort put by the author to ground the contents of the Abidhamma to the other parts of the Canon to prove its authenticity but, probably, non-scholars would have liked the effort to be been spent better otherwise."},{"Title":"Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time","review":"A readable bridge to those of us who could never quite put into words those doubts."},{"Title":"Abhidhamma Studies: Buddhist Explorations of Consciousness and Time","review":"A little gem of clarity and succinctness which deals with the deepest concepts of Buddhism."},{"Title":"The Reform of the Frankish Church: Chrodegang of Metz and the Regula canonicorum in the Eighth Century (Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought: Fourth Series)","review":"M.

It reallys shows the reality of what racial discrimination was and is occurring. This amazing true story goes through the life of a man who, like most whites males, will never be in a situation of being a true minority. It is astonishing the reactions this educated man gets because of a simple change of skin color. I think everyone can learn a lot from this book and make those who don't see it ,realize the racial tensions this nation has.

I have come to realize that while there is ignorance and while there is hatred there will always be racism. Racism is nothing that anyone is born with. Racism is instilled in a childs mind throughout his or her childhood just like manners or putting on your seatbelt when you enter a car. On the last page of the book Mr. Griffen explains the seemingly everlasting trend of racism. \\"Whites teach their children to call [blacks] \\"niggers,\\"\\"(p. 159) said the negro boy that was helping out Mr. Griffen. The little boy had fallen victim to this early teachings many times and now said that \\"he would not even go into white neighborhoods because it sickened him to be called that.\\"(p. 159) Today in most parts of the country we have done away with the unmerciful \\"hate stare\\" and the blatent insults that have scarred so many african-americans still alive today to tell about it. But until we teach our children to love all and to not allow hate and prejudices to become a part of them the issue of racism will still be around in many different forms."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"So great and on time, one of the easiest ways to get a book online.

He is very preoccupied with the growing racism among whites towards blacks. He recalls reading a report about the growing rate of black suicides, especially in the South, and realizes that as a white man it is nearly impossible for him to know what life is like for blacks. He comes up with the crazy idea to go to a dermatologist to alter his skin color so that he may pose as a black man in the South. This book shows in detail what happens to him while in the South as a black man to being refused to sit at the soda fountain or order a soda in drug stores to not being allowed off a city bus to use the bathroom to the extreme of being stalked by a black man and threatened to be mugged. This story tells the true hostility that whites had for blacks in the South and calls into question the term \\"separate but equal\\". This is a gripping tale of a man who would and does do everything he can to gain insight into a race so foreign to him. It is an excellent read if you are interested in the history of America and I would definitely recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Although the events author John Howard Griffin recounts in this short book took place over 50 years ago, they still provide important lessons to those wondering what life was like for African-Americans during a dark period in our country's history. In 1959, a white journalist decided to change his appearance so that he could see firsthand what it was like to be black in the South. He shaved his hair, ingested a substance that would darken his skin pigment (and applied another topically), then headed to the streets of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. What he found was that even some of the persons who behaved quite civilly towards him when he was white, behaved badly when he was black. During the month that he was disguised, he experienced firsthand the hardship his fellow (non-white) Americans were forced to endure when wanting to do such things as: use a lavatory, ride the bus, and engage in transactions with merchants. Sometimes, even when he thinks that a white person is being helpful (a man at a park for example), he realizes he's mistaken.He experienced racism not only in Baton Rouge (his first stop), but everywhere else he goes (Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia). Traveling by bus to these other southern states, he finds things even worse. Eventually, he realizes he's had enough and outs himself to a journalist friend who helps him obtain photos of some of those he's interacted with along the way in order to help document his experiences. He recounts what happened in a sort of diary/journal format in this book. In summary, Black Like Me is a must read for anyone who needs a reminder (or not) about how far we've come...and how far we've yet to go in improving race relations in America. Also good: The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley, No Higher Honor by Condoleeza Rice, and Roots by Alex Haley."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"talk about walking in another's shoes!this a truly remarkable account.

The strengths of the book was how well researched and accurate it was on both sides. I think that every one should read this book.

It brazenly articulated the differences on how people, in particular the author, are treated in the Deep South based on the color of their skin. The author had his skin darkened through chemicals and ultraviolet light. He traveled from New Orleans to Atlanta by road (mostly bus) and chronicles how people looked at him differently just because he was black. For a white man he found the experience utterly appalling. It was also staggering how various white men approached the author to discuss very crude sexual matters, thinking that African-Americans are only of any value based on their sexual prowess.This book should easily be considered five stars by most reviewers. However the book is flawed. The author is not a particularly fine writer; he has a tendency to ramble. And I feel the author has taken some journalist liberties. I wanted more of the facts about people, what they look like, what they said and did, etc. But the author seems to be inconsistent; sometimes he wants to lecture us on racism, other times he delivers a documentary on his travels.Bottom line: an important and very shocking read.

It starts out with his experiences in New Orleans as a black man. He knew about some of the things that are done to black people, but didn't know the full extent of how much white people try to degrade the sense of value or self-worth of all black people. He experiences having to walk miles ot get a drink of water, working for hours and having just eough money to eat that day, and the whites attempts at lowering all black's self worth, including the \\"hate stare.\\" However, New orleans is relatively nice for Bkacks. When he reads that in Mississippi there was a lynching case the FBI had found tons of evidence for and the White grand jury wouldn't even open the packet of evidence. The mississippe folks claimed they had wonderful relationships with the Negros. Griffin had even met some of them before, and talked about there relationships with the Negros. He saw a whole new side of them when he went as a black man. He was horrified at how inhumanely people could treat other people and shares very insightful thoughts ion what racism was really like.I would highly reccomend this book for someone to read, although it's not for younger children. it''s more for tenns and audults. It has a plethora of large words that some with smallish vocabularies might not understand.

It also covers the backlash against the publication of his story.Black Like Me is a concise, fast and engaging read. The reader is often able to see things through Griffin's eyes, even as Griffin tries to see things through the eyes of others. He does an excellent job communicating the cultures of fear and despair he encountered. The entire account of his travels as a black man is riveting.If there is any nit-picking to be done, let it be for this: at times, particularly early on, Griffin's descriptions of mundane, everyday objects and details seem forced and do not aid the narrative.While today's racial tensions are much less overt (and much less publicized), Black Like Me still has quite a bit to say about the universal elements of human nature and the culture of racism.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"John Howard Griffin is a man of deep thought and deep feelings.

Griffin got together with a doctor who artificially darkened his skin by medication. John traveled through parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia while he was \\"black.\\" While he was a \\"tenth class citizen\\" he sometimes had to go all the way across town to go to the restroom or get a drink. Griffin even had a hard time cashing travelers' checks because he was black. The white bus driver wouldn't let him get off to go to the bathroom. One night he was followed by a white man who threatened to stab him. On Griffin's journey he found out that blacks will do anything they can to help each other out. Strangers would pull him off the street into their homes. The way the book ended was Griffin stopped taking medication until he was white again. Then he saw blacks in a different way.I suggest this book to people from 13 years old and up because there's some bad language in it. I liked this book because it taught me that if you were black back then, you were treated like garbage by whites, but blacks would treat others really nicely. I would give this book four stars. It went into detail, but a lot of the whites he met acted the same way, mean."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Honestly before reading this I use to get mad that there was so much racism around and that I thought that as a mixed woman I had it bad because I had two different colors in me. After reading this you will change your view.Its starts off that John Griffin decides that he wants to know what it's like to be black and goes to get surgery on his skin color. The doctor doesn't think it will happen but tries it anyway and soon John's skin begins to get darker. He then decides to see what the average white man will do since his color and the opposite of his and turns out to be very disappointed. He tries to by a train ticket in the middle of the book and the things that the people say to him made me shiver. He travels to Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia and still nothing changed. After he collects his data on this mischief he starts to write about it for the newspaper and gradually things changed. You must read this book to find out what really happens. It will make you view our world a different way and make you think about every time you had called someone something mean or were racist towards them. When the book first came out in 1964 there was nothing but controversy about wither they should ban the book or not. Personally Im glad they didn't or I would've never known what respect was.

Indefensible Hate still exists here, and there is no indication that it will make as great a stride in the next fifty years as it has in the last fifty.Without question, this book should be required reading for all teenagers (and adults) across the country. To understand another's perspective is the first, primary step in eradicating intolerance. This book (which is a slight bit didactic at points) is the remarkable journey of a man who bothered to really try to understand the life of the black man in the American South as best as he could. Of course he could never truly KNOW, but he certainly took pains to do what he could to understand the experience better than anyone before.Students (eighth-graders) in my Honors Language Arts class are required to read this book, and I hope they will discover from where we as a nation have traveled. Those who easily bandy about epithets or think unkind thoughts about others (whether because of race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, or ability) might get an honest sense of perspective by taking the trip with John Howard Griffin.Better yet, after reading this book, ask yourself these questions (and I will ask my students): \\"If given the opportunity to change my appearance so dramatically as to appear to be from a different race for six weeks, would I do it? What would I fear going into it? Suppose I was told after four weeks that it was impossible to change back; how would it make me feel?\\"For a country that falsely prides itself on equality for all, I believe that our conversations about racial equality are sorely lacking in our public dialogue. BLACK LIKE ME would be an excellent place to start a meaningful conversation."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Read for the first time in the early 1960's when the only contact we had with Black people in Small Town, Wisconsin, was an occasional Nat King Cole record, this book had a profound affect on me. It was the only book I ever read, flipped back, immediately, to the beginning and read again, so great was it's impact. Griffin's story of his encounters with Southern Whites (first as a White Man and then as a Black) in the days of segregation really opened my eyes to a kind of behavior with which I, as a young reader, was not familiar. While it's for certain that racism in Northern Wisconsin existed,it took the form of the \\"out of sight,out of mind\\" variety (but God forbid that they ever got any farther north than Milwaukee...). It was not mentioned, but it was there simmering. Griffin's expose, for me, knocked any practice of racism, benign or otherwise, flat on its ass; it made very real the kind of hateful hypocrisy that lies behind an otherwise respectful U.S. of A. citizenry. As I traveled through the South with Griffin, I began to feel the same sense of revulsion the author feels; how could such a thing be? To my young mind it was a mystery. Would Nat King Cole, who everybody loved, be treated like that? And so the seeds of empathy for the oppressed were planted within me (along with a dose of healthy skepticism regarding the nature of man). As I looked at the book again recently, I thought about how lucky I was to have read the book when I did; if I hadn't read it when I did, I might be a very different man today."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read this book as a teenager many years ago, and my teenage son is reading it now.

It cannot allow for the decade after decade after decade build-up of racist attitudes and history. Nor can it allow for the day after day after day of soul-numbing hatred. Still, for its time, this book was revolutionary.

In New Orleans the white person is nice to the black man but the white man does not respect the black man just tolerates him. In Mississippi the white person is very degrading to the black man. You cannot even look at a white woman in Mississippi without getting lynched. John Griffin who was on a bus ride in Mississippi was not allowed to get off at his stop because the bus driver was a white man and a horrible racist and he just wanted to mess with John Griffin. John Howard Griffin was a courageous journalist because he was a white man who wanted to turn himself black to see how the black man lived in the South. He wanted to see what the real hardships were for the everyday black man. For example how hard it is to find a job or a place to live; everyday things that we take for granted in today's society. The book showed me that racism is a real thing that blacks even in today's society have to deal with.

It would start describing how he felt at certain situations and I would think \\"break through, he's shedding his persona of a reporter and letting his story take him into itself\\" but then it would stop. I felt there were a lot of details that could have been added that would have made it so much more powerful. All and all said though it is an American classic that gets its point across and for that I truly respect it. I just wish there were more in it...

In this book, the main character, John Howard Griffin, undergoes a temporary medical treatment that turns his skin dark. When he does not take the medication, he turns light again. While he is black, John Howard Griffin finds the experience to be much worse than he expected. Though fellow black people treat him with warmth, white people treat him with hostility and contempt. He never expected the comments on every street corner and the constant dirty looks. When he was white again, he found that white people then treated him with respect and were courteous. On the other hand blacks gave him weary looks filled with fear. John Griffin was soon discouraged within a few weeks and could see the exhaustion on his face just as well as the next black person. In the end, this experience brought him to the conclusion that racism was simply a huge misunderstanding between the different races.I really like how this book shows not only more than one point of view, but from one person and one mind set. So he has taken his same views, and applied them to both worlds. It is interesting how John Howard Griffin goes takes the initiative to actually try and understand the other side of racism. He goes all the way through with his deal to write an article and finds how hard it really is to be black because of the reality of it all. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. The story is a true reality check for the main character, and, though it seems slow at first, it is a really eye-opening book for someone to read.Shannon"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"The 1980's movie, \\"Soul Man\\" uses a premise similar to the basis for this book. In the movie, a white man darkens his skin color so that he can obtain a scholarship to law school that is reserved for blacks. It is a comedy and is very funny, although there is some serious social commentary. John Howard Griffin did the same thing in the late fifties in an attempt to learn the plight of black people in the south. It was a time of extreme racism and he took a great risk in doing so. Once he wrote of his experiences, the most extreme of white racists would target him for death.It is a very powerful book and is the strongest possible commentary on how absurd racism is. By taking a chemical and changing the color of his skin, he goes from a respected member of society to a demeaned object. You also learn how much power the radical racists had in the south at the time. There were many whites that were disturbed by the intense racism in the south, but were terrified of the potential for violent retribution if they spoke out. Griffin also writes very well about the despair of the blacks and how it manifested itself in many of the behaviors used to justify the perception that they were inferior. It is clear that only the Federal government had the power to destroy racism and the actions taken by the courts to overturn the racist laws will forever rank as one of their finest hours.I first read this book as a class assignment in high school and have reread it three times since then. Fortunately, we are decades beyond the type of events Griffin writes about. However, these events should never pass from the public consciousness and I strongly encourage everyone to read it."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This gripping book helps whites to experience life from the other side of the racial divide. In 1959, author John Howard Griffin (1920-80) used special medication to darken his skin, and then traveled the Deep South as a black man in the latter days of legal segregation. The \\"Negro\\" Griffin encountered separate facilities, hate-filled stares, assumptions that he was over-sexed, and job options limited to menial labor. He found conditions slightly better in big cities like New Orleans and Atlanta, but never free of rudeness or indignities. Griffin also met a small number of whites that apologized for racism. When Griffin switched his skin color back to white, blacks became surly, and whites became friendly. Unfortunately, Griffin never ventured outside the Deep South, depriving us of a chance to compare racism between regions. In this sense, his stirring book is too short.BLACK LIKE ME angered white southerners when published in 1960. Griffin (who'd once recovered from blindness) received anonymous death threats, and soon developed health problems associated with his special medication. Too bad we cannot step into each other's race the way Griffin did - it might make for a better society."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Anytime you that you think your life is bad, pick up &quot;Black Like Me&quot;, a riveting expose on how black people were (are?) treated in the Southern U.S. in the 1950's/1960's. You think you've got it bad? Has anyone ever prevented you from using the restroom facilites when your bladder was full, just because they could? Has anyone hung you from a tree just for looking at a white woman the &quot;wrong&quot; way?What white America did (and still does to a certain extent today, they just aren't as obvious about it anymore) to the black community is revolting, disgusting and stomach churning.I found myself closing the book in several passages because I couldn't bear to continue reading about the absolute delight white men and woman took in berating, insulting, ignoring and torturing black people.You will be distubed and sickened while reading &quot;Black Like Me&quot; in which a white man uses pills to darken his skin in order to pass as a black man while traveling through the deep South. What he experiences pure evil behavior from whites (with a few exceptions). However, time and time again, he is amazed by the kindess and courtesy shown by his &quot;fellow&quot; black man.Perhaps faith in humanity can be restored by witnessing how kind your fellow man can be, but you will be appalled at how cruel others can be.A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"John Howard Griffin's \\"Black Like Me\\" is probably one of the most important works of the Civil Rights Era. Sadly, it's not important so much for what it says (although, what it says is quite powerful), but for the fact that a white man said it. Griffin doesn't say all that much that black writers hadn't been saying for decades, but for a variety of reasons, white people - even well-intentioned white people - couldn't hear it until it was said by one of their own.One of the biggest obstacles in the Civil Rights Movement was that most black people had long been conditioned not to tell the truth of their experience to white people for fear of angering them and suffering reprisals. In turn, because of this silence, whites could comfortably wear their blinders and assume that \\"separate but equal\\" was working just fine. After all, most whites interacted with blacks at least from time to time and most didn't harbor any ill sentiments. Most were courteous and pleasant, and most were genuinely - albeit naively - unaware of any real suffering by blacks. It was just the way things were.The only way to breach the barrier between blacks and whites, and thereby bridge the communication gap, was for a white man to become black and live in the \\"Negro\\" world. The important thing to note about Griffin's transformation is that, while he was scrupulous about altering his appearance, he specifically chose not to alter his name, speech patterns, mannerisms or any other fundamental aspects of himself. This gives the lie to the oft-repeated rationalization that blacks were judged by the \\"content of their character\\" rather than the color of their skin.Perhaps the greatest strength of Griffin's book is his ability to simultaneously sink himself fully into his new persona while at the same time consciously and carefully observing and critiquing his responses thereto. Griffin makes passing reference to \\"when I was blind\\". We don't know the circumstances of either his blindness or his recovery, but it shows that Griffin has had previous experience entering into and returning from an alien world.The first time Griffin sees his new \\"Negro\\" self in the mirror, we, the readers, experience the shock and alienation right along with him. As he learns to navigate as a \\"Negro\\", we too learn things before that we'd never even thought to think about before, let alone experienced before. We feel Griffin's fear as he is stalked by a young, threatening white kid. We squirm in disgust as white man after white man probes the \\"sexual character\\" of the \\"Negro\\". And we sigh in gratitude for the small and large kindnesses he receives along the way. Most of all, we too lose touch a bit with our comfortable white existence and sense, perhaps for the first time, what it feels like to be literally uncomfortable in our own skin.My only regret about the book is how short it was. I, in my own selfishness, wanted the experiment to go on so I could experience more of that alien world which I thought I knew. But the fact that Griffin could endure the experiment for only a few weeks speaks volumes. Certain places he is only able to stay a few hours before fleeing or being rescued. Fortunately, he had the resources and connections to do so. Imagine being poor and black, consigned to such places having to struggle like an animal to survive, and then having that very animal-ness flung back in your face as the reason you are not worthy of equal citizenship?Griffin's 1979 epilogue is also immensely important as it gives a context and understanding of the development of the Civil Rights Movement. Many of the same patterns which existed pre-Civil Rights - the \\"Negro\\" as an ignorant child who needed to be led and controlled by smarter, \\"benevolent\\" whites for his own good - persisted throughout the movement. Well-intentioned whites were understandably upset to be pushed aside after putting their time, money and reputations on the line, but seen from the black perspective, it made perfect sense. It wasn't about separatism as much as it was about empowerment, which blacks could (and can't) achieve so long as whites are in charge of deciding what rights will be fought for and how.Finally, many will argue that this book may have been important \\"back then\\" but it's dated now because things are different. After all, we have our first black president, don't we? But the very rise of that black president has made it crystal clear that the struggle isn't over and that the movement still has a place. From the documented rise in overtly racist \\"hate\\" groups to the perhaps nave ideas of people like Rand Paul who thinks that private businesses should be legally allowed to discriminate, it is inescapable that \\"Black Like Me\\" is as relevant today as it was then. If anything, perhaps we need a new John Howard Griffin to cross racial barriers and compare the lives of today's blacks to those whom Griffin encountered. I do believe we've made progress, but I'm sure today, just like fifty years ago, many people would be shocked to hear the truth."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I just had to own a copy of this book which helped shape my view of the world when I read it as a teenager.It is a great companion book for those who love To Kill a Mockingbird.

So when I heard about the book Black Like Me, I was amazed anyone would put themselves into a different culture so they could understand it from an insider's perspective. What I got out of this book was amazing.The book Black Like Me is about a white man by the name of John Howard Griffin. He grew up during a time when Blacks were poorly treated by Whites in the South. Griffin goes out of his way to create an appearance and environment that is authentic to the one that most Blacks dealt with during this time. He goes through an operation that turns his skin black. Griffin discovers how easily people judge and label others by their appearance.It is a powerful book that gave me a good perspective on the hardships that minority cultures face. It was interesting to read, and it is definitely at the top of my list. I strongly recommend it to everyone, young adults and adults alike.PR 15"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This is a non fiction book but it reads quickly like a novel, partly because its told in I narrative and instead of concentrating on facts and statistics John Griffen focuses on his emotional journey as a white man traveling as a black in the deep south.Before reading it i knew what racisim was of course, and i've read books on this time period and since about racisim but this was the first book that really made it real for me. This has to do mainly because he had a white man's perspective, or a perspective of being one of the opressors and switching to one of the opressed.It is also amazing what John Griffen did- turning his skin color black, traveling through the south, and then later reporting on what he found even though he knew he would jeopardize himself and his family. It took a lot of bravery and not many would do it. He changed his whole identity at the cost of losing it.This book can relate to any situation where one group is being degraded because of their skin color, religion, etc. John Griffen's views of how racisim plays out and how it affects the whole society are timeless.Everyone should read this, it only takes a short time, its not a long book, but the book's impression and story will stay with you for a long time after."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"if you question the civil rights movement or anything pertaining to racial bias, you should read this book.

I will be ordering a new one when I am ready!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Books written by individuals who intend only to write, as truthfully as possible, of their experience or discovery can be boring. For many, researching a specific topic or seeking out the studied experience and speaking of the results, irrespective of the response is a matter of moral integrity, for others it is fodder to be used in order to espouse one's cherished opinion. Typically, these type of books are read by individuals who are interested in the specific subject studied, the reverberations are limited to a relatively small discipline where the findings are discussed, studied and incorporated into the discipline or quickly ignored. When such a book is penned by a \\"common\\" writer about his experiment in changing his ethnicity (in this case, a White man becoming a Black man), plunging into the world inhabited by that ethnic group (the segregated South of 1959) then writing with explicit truthfulness of that experience, the result can be historic. Black Like Me is a historic book, celebrating its Fiftieth anniversary, which is just as relevant today as it was when published in 1961.John Howard Griffin was a respected author living in Texas in 1959 when he choose to surrender his privileged life in order to speak with authority to those of his white community of the plight of their black neighbors. He did so by literally changing is skin color and spending five weeks living as a part of the Black community in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Those states at that time were the center of Segregationist laws and behavior. It was well known, within that region, that a white person could do any harm, including murder, to a person of color without fear of legal retribution. Mr. Griffin found the racism of a much more insidious, pervasive and expected reality than even he had expected. He quickly discovered that he was on the receiving end of this evil for the single reason of his skin color.Reading of the pain he suffered, indignities demanded of him and the realization that this was \\"as good as it would get\\" for those whose daily life he was experiencing for a short time was an encounter with my own ignorance, prejudice and arrogance. Mr. Griffin shares his epiphany of seeing himself as a black man was a transformative one,\\"I looked into the mirror and saw nothing of the white John Griffin's past. No, the reflections led back to Africa, back to the shanty and the ghetto, back to the fruitless struggles against the mark of blackness. Suddenly, almost with no mental preparation, no advance hint, it became clear and permeated my whole being. I had gone too far. I knew now that there is no such thing as a disguised white man, when the black won't rub. The black man is wholly a Negro, regardless of what he once may have been.\\" (p.31)The remainder of the book is his detailing, often in horrid detail, of just what being black in the segregated South was like. Mr. Griffin's looking into the mirror for the first time and seeing a black man looking back shook him to his core, reading this book has caused a similar response within me.This Anniversary Edition includes an epilogue written by the author in 1976 which speaks of the repercussions of this work, the results of the Civil Rights struggle of the 1960's and was very educational as to how race relations turned out so differently than was \\"The Dream\\" of that time period. It also includes an essay by Mr. Griffin, \\"Beyond Otherness\\" one of his last, which speaks of the power of the individual within the culture. The book ends with an Afterword by his Biographer Robert Bonazzi and it speaks to the timelessness of this powerful book.As I read, sometimes fighting nausea, then tears, then finding myself smiling, this book, I saw how Mr. Griffin's experience applies to our present culture. Then as now all are \\"accepted\\" as long as \\"they\\" comply with \\"our\\" expectations, do not have a name that's sounds as if it originated in the looks Middle East or skin color that is \\"too dark\\" or appear to be attracted to people of one's own gender or . . . .

What irony that a nation titled \\"United\\" should go through so much division! In his poignant narrative Black Like Me, John Howard Griffin chronicles his experiences in America's Deep South during the 1950s as a white man dyed black.Griffin's journal entries are easy to breeze through and intense enough to keep your eyes glued to the book. I basically read this book in 2 days.Although this story did not surprise me, it profoundly impacted me and added to my personal convictions that no one should mock, scorn, or humiliate another individual solely because of appearance. It is pure ignorance to say that because a man is black, he is less deserving of basic human rights.I feel that this book has given me great insight and is another astonishing example of how important it is to treat others, no matter what they look like, with respect, dignity, and honor. Not doing so can cause them to feel unwanted, ashamed, and desolate (as Griffin so aptly points out).Overall this book has stirred up a myriad of emotions in my heart: anger, repulsion, anguish, outrage, and amusement. It pains me to see how some people justify their cruel treatment toward others. It pains me to see others being treated with utter contempt and disrespect. The fact that a person can degrade another human being merely for the color of his skin is ridiculous and utter foolishness.This book is an honest telling of a time in our American history.I say, definitely go read it!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book is an incredibly eye-opening, raw, horrifying, and hopeful work.

It arrived in good time. I'm happy with my purchase."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I enjoyed re-reading this book, a nonfiction kind-of-documentary by John Griffin, a white journalist who reports on his travels throughout the South of the US in 1959. During this era of Jim Crow, segregation of Blacks and whites was commonplace in the South, and institutionalized discrimination against Blacks was too. However, what makes Griffin's book very unique is that he traveled in disguise as a black man in the South.The book is an excellent study of many sociological issues and concerns of that time period in the US, and I was particularly struck by the compelling information of racism and sexism that Griffin objectively presents. Griffin introduces the reader to many stereotypes which were used to describe African-Americans during this journalistic odyssey. As with most stereotypes, the stereotypes presented in the book are based on ignorance and misunderstanding of African-American culture.Griffin reports of a certain perverse curiosity that many whites had (and may possibly still have) regarding African-Americans. Unfortunately, Griffin chooses to present the reader with certain stereotypes without attempting to explain them. Such stereotypes, however, need to be carefully examined, in my opinion, to illustrate the dynamic interaction between racism and sexism, and to clearly see how racism and sexism are utilized in Black Like Me and in everyday life as mechanisms used by whites to discriminate against,and often times, victimize African-Americans.Griffin, as a black man, speaks of the numerous encounters he experiences with white people. The vast majority of these interactions occur at night. Griffin writes, \\"A man [white] will reveal himself in the dark, which gives an illusion of anonymity, more than he will in the bright light.\\" [Griffin, p. 85] Griffin refers to his encounters with white people as pornographic. In conversation, white men interrogate Griffin in hopes that he would reveal some mystic information concerning the lifestyle of sexual behavior of black people. From these experiences with white people, Griffin posits that these individuals believed that blacks were \\" an exhaustible sexual machine with over-sized genitals and a vast store of experiences, immensely varied.\\" [Griffin, p. 85]Griffin's nocturnal encounters with white men suggest that such sexual perverse curiosity was one means by which white men subordinated and exploited the black male. Centuries-old white mythology is also employed in the book to victimize blacks. That is, fearful white men established untruths which have been used throughout American history to impede African-American progress.White mythology has been used to explain the unexplainable as well as to place the white man above other non-whites. History chronicles how white men used to portray the black male as an animal, a horse, a stallion possessing physical prowess, inexhaustible sexual appetite, and uncontrollable passions. In support of such mythology, Griffin recounts an incident when a white man asked him if he had ever had ever been with a white woman. When Griffin responded that he had never been with one, the white man states, \\"There's plenty of white women who would like to have a good buck Negro.\\" [Griffin, p. 86]Another established mythological portrayal is of the black female by white people. black women were perceived to be sensual, exotic, and extremely provocative. \\"...NOTICE!...it was only another list of prices a white man would pay for various types of sensuality with various ages of Negro girls.\\" [Griffin, p. 81] Griffin reports that black women were greatly used and abused by white men, and frequently black women were also mistreated by their own race. Sadly, some black men, when paid a certain amount of money, would even assist white men procure black women and children.In mythological terms, the black man was viewed as Apollo, the black woman was viewed as Venus, and the white woman was viewed as the Virgin Mary. These stereotypes which were devised by white men have not only caused significant problems for blacks, but also have caused problems for white people. Two more frequently employed stereotypes created by white men and given to blacks included the aggressive savage beast, and the docile child inferior to whites in all aspects. Many other stereotypes have been created and utilized by whites in the US to describe blacks, however, the previously mentioned ones are perhaps the most ingrained in the American psyche and the ones which surface in Griffin's work.Although Griffin painted himself black on the outside and experienced many things which African-Americans experienced at that time, his interpretation of his collected data was from the perspective of a white man. Griffin's cultural orientation, ethnic heritage, gender and race were constantly with him at all times even if they were not always visible to the naked eye. Therefore, Griffin was only able to draw a conclusion from his darkened \`white' feelings, reasoning, and senses.Griffin's experiment stands as a testament to the wrongs which had been done to African-Americans during the Jim Crow era. I would recommend Black Like Me to anyone interested in investigating how white people perceived and treated African-Americans in the South prior to the Civil Rights Movement in the US."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"BLACK LIKE ME is a classic in every form and needs to be a mandatory read in today's high schools.

This experiment of changing from the white race to the black race took place in the 1960s' when the United States was facing severe racial conflicts. He migrated to southern cities in search of knowing how it feels to be hated and discriminated against just because of his color. He encountered hate that he never knew existed changing from one race to another in a matter of several minutes. He soon learned what real hate feels like, and that it was not easy being a Negro in the south during this time. John Griffin's experience taught him many important lessons. He learned that their ministers preach sin and hell just as much as his, have the same puritanical background as his, and many more of the same qualities and ethical thoughts about life. He is trying to say that we are all equal, no matter the color of our skin and flesh. You should not judge a man by his race, but by the quality and depth of his true character and soul. He is stressing that Negroes should not be treated badly or unfairly just because of the simple fact that they are a Negro. Overall, he wants people to know that a black man is just as much of a man as a white one, and one day he has a dream that whites and blacks can live together without discrimination and hate. This firsthand account happened in the late 50's and early 60's in the deep south of the United States. It took place in several cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana and Jackson, Mississippi. It was experienced when the US was having racial problems such as the assassination of a Negro leader, and the morbid conflicts between the two dominant races. This book keeps the reader interested by making you wonder what will happen next, strange settings, and unbelievable encounters with racists. By embarking on this journey with Mr. Griffin, the reader feels as if they were rig! ht there, and they may even feel sympathy for him. At the end of the story you feel as if you know John like a close friend. After all, he shares with you an experience of a lifetime. I recommend this book to anyone interested in true stories and history. Though, I would not recommend it to children because of its profane language. Overall, I enjoyed this book because it tells of a man's pain and triumphs dealing with this hatred of the south. It also tells of a man's struggle to defeat this terrible fear that Negroes had to deal with. Finally, this story touched the depths of my heart because it made me realize that people really do endure this kind of unfair and unjust treatment."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Although some of the things that Griffin faced as a &quot;black&quot; man have changed (we no longer have separate drinking fountains or different lavoratories for blacks and whites), the subtleties of racism still pervade our culture, so Griffin's book remains pertinent. I was intrigued, among other things, to see Griffin changing shades of skin color to flip back and forth from the &quot;white man&quot; to &quot;black man&quot; appearances, recording the marked differences in the way apparently polite people displayed their true feelings when they suddenly saw him as a member of the &quot;other&quot; race. This is an easy book to recommend, and I only wish Griffin were still around to update his comments and give his observations of how America appears now compared to four decades ago; (his experimentation as a negro took place in 1959)."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"WEB DUBOIS PREDICTED THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE 20TH CENTURY WOULD BE THAT OF THE COLOR LINE.

Though the events in the book happened over 50 years ago, there are still whites who have the attitudes portrayed within the pages. I recommend this to anyone wanting to see the truth. This really happened folks."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me is an incredible true story. The author, John Howard Griffin, conducted an experiment in which he found out what it was like to be a black man living in the south in the 1950's. Griffin went through some medical procedures to turn his skin color from white to black, and traveled to the south with no plans but to examine the day-to-day life of an African American, and to keep records of his experiences. Griffin's experiences are educational and very shocking. I read about aspects of African-American life that I never even would fathom. For instance, Griffin often saw examples of African Americans who obviously despised their God-given skin color, and this was evident through the choices they made and the ways they treated other blacks. The accounts were so real that I was scared to think that parts of our country, namely the Deep South, were so corrupt only fifty years ago. Also, it was riveting to read the comparison between how the same people without knowledge of Griffin's experiment would treat him first as a white, then a black. The \\"African American Griffin\\", if you will, was treated with complete hatred and contempt from the majority of the whites he associated with. Griffin also became a target by white supremacists once they found out what he had done, calling him a traitor against whites. Not only was Griffin's experiment was just as physically exigent as it was mentally. Griffin was constantly under an immense amount of stress in the mental power struggle between whites and blacks at the time. I would recommend this book for anyone readers interested in African American literature. This book was definitely an eye-opener for me and was an incredible depiction of Southern America's views on African Americans in that era."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I loved black like me. It was a wonderful story that really opened my eyes to what life used to be like, and made me thankful that life has changed so much since then."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Here's something that often makes me laugh...People who seem to have no Black friends, don't know any Black people other than at a distance (say in another department at work), have none in their social circle and who have no knowledge of 'Black' history, the history of racist thought and practice or its persistent legacy of discrimination are quick to say those magic words:'I'm not racist'.I've observed this many, many, many times. It often precedes 'but...' and someone saying something that often reveals staggering ignorance. Now I'm no mind reader but I would ask the question of anyone who says 'I'm not racist' - how do you know?We all have opinions that we would do well to examine from time to time. I've heard people from different ethnic groups, countries etc say the most stupid things imaginable about 'other' people and even themselves. Men say stupid things about women, women say stupid things about men. Let's face it - stupidity is common currency all over the world.This book, if honestly read and understood, is an antidote to the abject stupidity of racism."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I picked this up completely on a whim after hearing someone mention it online. It is absolutely an amazing work. To really get a feel for how far this country has come in 50 short years, and to really understand how far we have left to go, you need to read this.As a white male, I've always been offended by the term 'white privilege', because it implies that I somehow didn't work for what I have. But having read this, I can finally appreciate it. My 'white privilege' has nothing to do with me not working hard and not deserving the things that I have accomplished. I have worked hard, and I do deserve those things.But these are things that blacks never had the opportunity to do. No matter how smart they were, no matter how well dressed, or well spoken, no matter how *white* they tried to appear to blend in, they would never be given the opportunity to prove themselves on their own merits. Their opportunities were taken away before they ever had a chance to even attempt to do grab them.And while I can definitely appreciate how far we have come in a relatively short time, I am now able to see with a fresh new perspective the things that are still wrong with our thinking today."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"As I write this review I have my old copy of Black Like Me in front of me. It's a Panther paperback, printed in 1964, bought by my parents, and found by my sister and myself on their shelves a few years later. I can still remember the shock when I read this, at the age of perhaps eleven, at realizing just how inhuman people could be because of something as seemingly trivial as skin colour.Griffin spent a little over a month--parts of November and December, 1959--with his skin artificially darkened by medication. In that time he traveled through Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, finding out at first hand what it is like to be treated as a second-class citizen--or, as he says, as a tenth-class citizen. Everyone now know the story of the big injustices, the lynchings, the civil rights cases, and for most people those are now just another page in the history text book. Griffin's experiences take the daily evils of racism and thrust them in your face, just as they were thrust in his--the rudeness of the clerk when he tried to pay for a train ticket with a big bill; the difficulty he had in finding someone who would cash a traveler's check for a Negro; the bus-driver who wouldn't let any blacks off the bus to use the restrooms; the white man who followed him at night and threatened to mug him.I've heard people worry that this is the white experience of racism: that whites can read this book and feel good because a white person felt the pain too. I'm white, so I don't know that I can judge that argument completely impartially, but I can tell you that this book profoundly shaped my views on racism, and that any book that can do what this book did for me is a book that is good to have around.One more thing. I've said a lot about how powerful, and how influential the book is. I should add that it is also a gripping story. Though Griffin only spends a month with dark skin, by the time you finish the book it feels like an eternity.A wonderful read, and a truly amazing story."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"John Howard Griffin offered one of the most important contributions to the Civil Rights movement when his work Black Like Me was published in 1960. Griffin approached his study on race relations in the South by asking a very poignant question: &quot;If a white man became a Negro in the Deep South, what adjustments would he have to make?.&quot; To answer this question, Griffin shaved his head and had his skin temporarily darkened by medical treatments and stain in order to travel through parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia as a black man.Griffin had a deep understanding of discrimination even before he began this ambitious project. As a medic in the French Resistance Army, Griffin helped evacuate Austrian Jews away from the advancing Nazis. During the Second World War, Griffin lost his sight and was forced to live with this disability for over ten years. By 1959, Griffin was a published author and a specialist on race relations. Despite such credentials Griffin &quot;really knew nothing of the Negro's real problem.&quot; Only by becoming black did Griffin understand what it was like to live as a second class citizen in &quot;the land of the free.&quot;As a black man, Griffin described the variations and similarities of race relations in different areas of the South. Although some states were more &quot;enlightened&quot; than others, blatant acts of racism were found almost everywhere Griffin went.In Alabama, where Martin Luther King first introduced passive resistance, Griffin endured the hate stares from whites and observed that even graduates from Tuskegee Institute would not be allowed to climb the social ladder in the South because, &quot;whites cannot lose to a traditionally servant class.&quot; Finally, while traveling to the otherwise enlightened city of Atlanta, the simple act of a bus driver saying &quot;Watch your step&quot; as his passengers filed out was only reserved for whites.Even more interesting than these experiences was the way in which Griffin was allowed to converse with blacks and whites on racial matters. Understandably, blacks were highly suspicious of whites and were often inclined to play &quot;the stereo-typed role of the 'good Negro'&quot; when around whites to survive in white southern society. As a &quot;black&quot; man, Griffin enjoyed a rare glimpse of how blacks really regarded segregation beyond the white propaganda. He also discovered the ways in which blacks assisted and supported each other against the perils of racism. In other cases, Griffin observed blacks who were ashamed of their race and who would denounce other blacks for their darker skin or shabby clothes. As a &quot;black&quot; man, Griffin also saw a side of whites that would otherwise be hidden if he had met them as a fellow white man. His experiences with whites while hitchhiking through Mississippi are particularly intriguing.Despite his experiences, Griffin was surprisingly fair in his analysis. While the reader may despise the hate-filled whites in his story, Griffin did not stoop to the racist's level by denying them their humanity. Instead, Griffin made it a point to see the whites in other roles-as a parent, grandparent, church leader, and loyal neighbor. He also realized that whites who may have been sympathetic towards their African American neighbors, were pressured by southern society to continue segregation. In his epilogue, Griffin was even critical of fellow white freedom fighters who often failed to consult with black community leaders on the race issue.Griffin's work was a landmark for his time, but weaknesses in his study were present. Griffin visited the larger cities of the South; however, a comparison of race relations between the major cities and the countryside may have created a more complete study as would a visit to other states in the South. A better explanation was needed regarding Griffin's practice of alternating his role as a black man and a white man by scrubbing the stain off his skin. At first, the reader may assume that the author could no longer handle the discrimination and longed to enter the South as a first class citizen again. Later, Griffin maintained that he was studying how the reactions of blacks and whites reversed themselves as he changed his skin color. Both reasons are valid; however, if a need to be white again was the primary explanation than an important point was made: An educated and worldly white man could barely survive in six weeks what a black person must endure every moment of his life."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"It is said one cannot understand or empathize with someone else unless &quot;you walk a mile in their mocassins.&quot; John Howard Griffin did just that, darkened his skin and took a walk into the Deep South to see how it would feel to be a member of a despised minority during 1959, the height of the Jim Crow years, when water fountains and rest rooms were separate for the races, when a black man or woman couldn't eat in a restaurant or get a hotel room. (It is said Bessie Smith, the great blues singer, died after a car accident because she couldn't be treated at a nearby hospital, for whites only.)The book is of course dated, but it is unique in that it is a viewpoint that is undeniably credible. Here is a white guy, saying: &quot;It happened to me, just because my skin was dark. Believe it.&quot; He suffers the indignity of finding everyday tasks that become almost insurmountable--to find a restroom, a bus seat, a park bench, someplace to eat, to be left alone with out fear of harrassment. And it's this harrassment and outright fear that changes Griffin to the point he had to finally abandon his project. He was changed by it.The question I have is what would someone who chose Griffin's experiment find today? While Jim Crow is gone, the cultures still have a gulf between them. And since today, you won't see the &quot;whites only&quot; sign on drinking fountains that I saw as a child traveling in the Deep South, you should be sure to read this to get perspective on our history and culture. This is a brave book."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Originally published in 1961, Black Like Me is the account of how white journalist John Howard Griffin had his skin medically darkened and traveled through the Deep South as a black man in an attempt to explain the hardships black people in the South faced. It also covers the backlash against the publication of his story.Black Like Me is a concise, fast and engaging read. The reader is often able to see things through Griffin's eyes, even as Griffin tries to see things through the eyes of others. He does an excellent job communicating the cultures of fear and despair he encountered. The entire account of his travels as a black man is riveting.If there is any nit-picking to be done, let it be for this: at times, particularly early on, Griffin's descriptions of mundane, everyday objects and details seem forced and do not aid the narrative.While today's racial tensions are much less overt (and much less publicized), Black Like Me still has quite a bit to say about the universal elements of human nature and the culture of racism.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"There are only a few books that have really given me a deeper understanding into the issues of the world around us. This book is one of them.John Howard Griffin penetrates into a world that seems almost beyond belief and yet is undeniably and startlingly real. Realizations await on every page to show that the generally sheltered cultural perspective of the typical white (like myself) could not conceive the situation which confronted blacks in the south every day just a very few years ago -- as experienced by a white man who changed his skin color and dealt with the consequences.The book is made even better by a series of stories about his experiences after returning to the world of caucausions and going on the lecture circuit about the plight of blacks in the south. He demonstrates the rationalization and close mindedness that characterizes even those who consider themselves &quot;good people&quot;.This book would probably be too much to accept if not for the authors remarkably unassuming and explanatory style. Rarely has such a sore subject been confronted so directly and yet so plainly.Highly recommended.

It challenges and troubles the reader. Mr. Griffin's bravery in embarking upon such a strange quest is most appreciated yet puzzling. The information he gleaned about the deeper aspects of African-American life in racially-divided America is on target. Instead of glossing over the realities of the plight of a brown-skinned person in America, he confronted it head on.

Recommended."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"&quot;Black Like Me&quot; has to be one of the most accomplished books of all time by John Howard Griffin. This nonfictional piece of literature begins with Griffin, a Caucasian, pigmenting his skin to a darker brown, a color resembling that of an African-American, in order to feel what it's like to be an African-American. His destination proceeds throughout the South where he records his real-life experiences and encounters with other African-Americans as well as Caucasians. The transformation of his skin pigment leads him to face the discrimination and prejudice from Caucasians yet allows him to feel a sense of unity among the rest of the African-Americans. The differences of Griffins &quot;two lives&quot; (one being white and the other black) contrasts greatly. As a white, Griffin automatically had the opportunity of entering restaurants, shows, and other places without a problem. He remained healthy, physically, emotionally, and mentally. On the other hand, his life as a black made him lose the opportunities of a white, and therefore, Griffin became emotionally, physically, and mentally unhealthy. What does the large contrast between two lives of the same person with a different shade of skin show about human beings? Even though Griffin's experiences took place forty years ago, this book allows us to question whether society has improved and changed or not. In some ways, I believe it has, but in others, the traditional ways have dominated improvement. Unless you are a victim of prejudice today, one can finally perceive how brutal and painful prejudice and discrimination are through the mind of a white man battling the everlasting war of racism within society. -A.H., 16, IL"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read Black Like Me because the picture on the cover intrigued me. I think now I am a better person for having read it. Just like Mr. Griffin confronted his own prejudice when looking at his reflection in the mirror, I realized too that I might be harboring baseless stereotypes. The fact that a white man darkening his skin color meant that he had to walk miles to eat or drink just forty years ago is astounding and sickening at the same time. People that are easily angered by acts of segregation or intolerance may not want to read this book because there are several instances of blind hatred. White truckers would offer John rides at night only to ask inappropriate questions about his sex life. A bus driver refused to let the black passengers off to use the restroom on a trip. I am not sure I would want to experience what life must have been like for a black person in those times. However, I am glad that John Howard Griffin did. The fact that the author happened to be extremely talented at his practice makes the reading that much better. I think everyone should read this book at some point in their lives...black, white, brown, old, or young. There are few books that can alter your day to day living, and this is one of them."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"John Griffin takes a big step in braking the barrier between the blacks and the whites. He put his life on the line in an attempt to bring the two races together. What Griffin learned quick as a black man was, \\"An important part of my daily life was spent searching for the basic things that all whites take for granted: a place to eat, or somewhere to find a drink of water, a rest room, somewhere to wash my hands.\\" When a white person is using the rest room or washing their hands, they never think about how hard this is for a black man. Another thing that the white people do not realize is how hurtful their stares are, and how much those stares say. Griffin learned that the color of his skin was the only thing that made a difference.John Griffin formatted this book in the form of a day to day journal. This helped show a day in the life of a black man. Black Like Me showed what it was like in different areas of the Deep South, and how actions changed in different areas. This book was a lot different from other books about the Deep South because the author experienced it from both sides. Not only did John Griffin's skin color change, he was also changed on the inside. One thing that makes this book even more startling is that he could have been killed in this whole process."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read Black Like Me for an American Literature class at my boarding school and really enjoyed it. The reason I picked this book was because the very concept caught me and interested me and I had not heard of something like this before, so I chose it to find out exactly what it was like. The topic was interesting, which right away can account for a good book but that is clearly not the only reason that I thought that Black Like Me was good. John Howard Griffin, the author, Narrator, and main character of the book goes further than most people would even think to go, especially for someone in his period of time. After the publication of the contents of Black Like Me Jack was terrorized by people who called him a 'traitor to the white race'. John Howard Griffin is a writer who decides that the best way to show people that there is heavy racism is to experience it for himself and then report on it. So he does, at probably the most dangerous time period to do so, and with permission from some magazine people undergoes a process to become black and then travels throughout the south, experiencing black life.The part that sets Black Like Me apart from other novels like it is some of the points it makes clear to the reader. The most noticable of which to me was the idea that no matter how aware a person thinks that they are in regards to racism in the south, they will never even begin to fathom such a horrible experience unless they go through it themselves. And the reader comes to notice that even while John Howard Griffin is a black southerner he cannot completely understand the pain that black southerners experienced as a result of racism. From the start of the book Griffin at least aknowledges the existence of racism in the south and even believes that he might have a grasp on what it would be like to be a black person living in the south. But what he finds is what makes this book interesting, the things Griffin experiences just as result of the change of pigmentation in his skin are startling and shocking and provoke some pretty startling revelations. I would probably reccomend Black Like Me to any one who thinks they know what happened in the south in regards to african americans, and I also would reccomend it to anyone who has any doubts as to what kinds of horrors african americans experienced in the south. People who read this book will probably need somewhat of a sence of empathy in order to be able to understand this book, and the people that need this book the most would probably not care or not understand that any of the events in this book should not have occurred, so this book's purpose may be long lost. This book will probably change the way you look at life and increase your respect for other people."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I live in the midst of Detroit, a white male, and I cannot imagine the horrors that this book reveal.

It brought to many people's attention the extream condition of segregation, and discrimination. Griffins way of getting into this inside world was something that no one had ever done, this in my eyes took a lot of guts and not to mention research. Like a few other authors Griffins way of explaining this owrld to his readers was astonishing. Griffins use of dialect and blending in with the local color was the first think that cought the readers attention. Right away to blend in with the Black community Griffin took on their dialect, he began using slang and other forms of speech. Also he started to blend in culturaly, Griffin attempted to find the places in the French Quarter of New Orleans where the locals went. This right away brought me into the story because it made it so real and life like, you almost forgot that he was originally white and just assuming a role to get a story.Another interesting part of John Howard Griffins novel was his ability to define sybolism. He would find little things along the way that would mean something to him, and even in the end he would never forget them. For example the shoe-shiner who on the first day of Griffins being in New Orleans made him feel right at home by sharing with him the little food he had with him and teaching him how to grill it. To Griffin this symbolized the black communities ability to allow any person in to their culture unlike the white who shuned that kind of behavior. This showed how well Griffin was at looking at things deeply which helped the reader to further understand what was going on in Griffins novel.Finally John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me showed realism extreamly well. He was able to take a story plot that most people could not think of being real. I mean come on, someone dying their skin to become black and blend in with their culture, ya right. But Griffin did, and did it well. It was almost too beleivable, he fit in like a real black man visiting on vacation. He acted like the townspeople, spoke like them and yes looked like them too. He looked so much like a black person that when he went home his family could not recognize him, and his neighbors began to treat him poorly because they believed he was black. I have never read anything as amazing as this novel.John Howard Griffin I believe started a revolution and helped further the compleation of the civil rights movement by proving to people further just how bad our society had gotten about discrimination.

This book provides a place to start, however. Without it, I think many may be tempted to say, \\"surely that never happens,\\" or \\"I'm sure it's not that bad.\\" It is a sad testimony to our country that it took a white person writing a book like this (instead of just listening to those already experiencing racism) to wake us up, but at least it has served its purpose. As I read the book (which is a very quick read) I felt like I was riding along with Griffin in the South and walking the roads with him. I don't know how he maintained his composure during some of the situations he found himself in. I respect what he did, especially considering the hate he experienced both during and after his \\"experiement.\\"In conclusion, I wonder what would happen if someone did this again, in the year 2000.

This book really shows it how it is. It is a true story of a real man who temporarily turns himself black. During the book so many people treat him like dirt, and it's all because of his skin color. They don't even know him, they just take one look at him and categorize him. I never realized how much of a problem racism was. Mr. Griffin goes to so many different places, and I thought that was the hardest part of the book. I got confused on where he was and when. I don't think where he is, is as important as the experiences though. I think that this book is great for any race and gender. It teaches you valuable lessons.

While on the other hand I thought why what are we (black people) a science project.Clearly as you read the book your questions change and your initial emotions are either magnified or remain the same. One question blanketed me throughout the book, why leave your privileged life to walk in the shoes of a black man or any minority?This classical non-fiction journal of the writers experience was captivating and educational. Walking behind Johns' eyes allowed me to see my people and the actions of others in a different light. The author captures the accents and slang in such a way I could hear the characters speaking.It is my hope that many different people will read Black Like Me, and realize that people are \\"human individuals\\" the actions of some or one does not represent the total race.Missy"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"The intro of this book was quite slow, but the pace started getting faster as it got into the experiment and the problems got harder for this author. It is so realistic how this is the only way to learn about another race. That is if you actually become the race."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me was an incredibly true story about the auther, John Griffen, who decided he wanted to find out how black people live. So, he changed his skin pigmentation to black. Then he went down south to places like St. Louis, and all over Texas and Louisiana to see how southerners have changed there opinions about racism. Every three pages showed a new story on how his life was changed and how people judged him about his color instead of his character. This is a classic novel, and it obviously takes a real dedicated author to go through changing his skin, leaving his family, and moving from the rich life to the poor life, to write good book. Although sometimes it droned on, it usually caught my attention enough to keep on reading. I would recomend this book to anybody who enjoys American History and Biographys."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"The astounding story of a white man who chose to walk in the world of a black man, Black Like Me explains what it was truly like to be a black man during the Civil Rights movement of the 50's and 60's. I found the plot to be interesting, but if your mind wanders while you read, don't read this book. The plot of Black Like Me takes very careful thought and comprehension, but to the reader who can shut out all other thoughts and sounds, this book will be excellent!!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I just finished Black Like Me. When I picked up this book I thought that the title was a very strange thing. I know Griffin is white so why would the book be called that? Well after I read the book I can totally understand why he did what he did and why the book is called what it is. I think that the book is a way to really show what it was like for blacks in the US so long ago. It is a horrible thing. The book teaches a lesson of horrible brutality on the part of Americans. Why be horrible to people just because of the pigment of their skin? Well that is what happened. When I read the book I thought this discrimination is horrible and I am hope it never happens again. Then I realized we have discrimination today all the time. The biggest example is gay people. When you read this book think of why Griffin did this. He turned his life upside down just to tell people what the blacks had to live through. All I had to do was read the book but he lived the book. If you read it then think about that. It was an eye opener and is very well written. My advice for the book is to read it slowly and you will love it. Believe me, I did."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I have read a lot of books some I liked, some were okay, and other I would never tell anyone to read it. I feel that black like me goes into all three areas. Some parts more then others I really liked the book. It showed how life is different between blacks and whites. John shows that it has to take a lot out ofa person to change their life like that. It must have taking a lot of weeks even months to come to the decision of changing your skin color, home, and family. Near the middle of the book John really starts to show how much he miss his family, and mainly miss his old life. Threw out the book John meets all different people. Some white, but must are black. The reason for John doing this is because he wants to find out why blacks and whites do not get along mainly so must in the south. Really going down and digging up dirt. After John is there for just a few weeks he starts to see all the hate with in the whites. Hate on how blacks can only go into a few restaurant, and only use bathrooms that have signs on them saying that blacks cna use that bathroom. The real challenge comes when John get back from his trip. It starts right before the book is going to come out. John wanted everyone to know what he did and how he felt and get through it so he want on talk shows to talk about everything. John get a lot of support for all around the world. The one place that you think would gave him the must support did not, his town. John's town hated him for what he did. the people threaten him and everyone in his family. Local stores would not help or serve him. People in the town, neighbors, and some friends will not talk to John. One group of people planned to attack John ans his family. So they had to stay with one family who would still talk to them. At John's daughter's school the same group lite a cross on fire. John saod that he wishes they would have burned the cross when he was home just so that the children would not have to see that. John trys to get on with his life but things just keep on going. No matter what he does he can not get passed it. there caomes a time when John has had all he can take so him and his family moves. I think that the book is good. I feel that everyone should read some part of the book just to see how things are different. A lot of thing have changed from that time and our time. It is good to see just how hard it was for people to get along."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book gives a reminder look at civil rights history.It is amazing that the author was able to \\"pull off\\" his unusual experiment."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Nobody can deny the social importance of Griffin's novel Black Like Me. Nobody can deny that it is priceless, a first-hand historical account of what it's like being black in the Deep South--by an outsider, a white man turned black by artificial and deliberate means.

The major downfall, however, is that it is in diary form at not as poignant and moving as it could have been."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book was hard to get into. I was surprised at the difference in how people treated him when he was white vs. when he was black. I think it is so sad that racism is still alive. I know we don't live in a perfect world, but I just don't understand how people can continue to treat certain people with less respect only on the basis of skin color.This book was recommended to me by a professor from my graduate program. I think everyone would benefit from reading this book and taking time to reflect on your own beliefs, attitudes, and actions."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book offers a unique perspective of racial tensions in the 1950s. John Griffin did the only thing that could be done, in order to capture views from both sides. However, the concept was more interesting to me than the actual story. Of course the main reason for this was that ,as Griffin mentions, he decided to stay out of the most hostile areas of the deep south so he wouldn't be risking his life. Anyone would have made the same decision, but I believe the choice to stay in better areas also cost him parts of the story. The last couple of chapters of aftermath are also disjointed and lead up to a weak conclusion."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book was very compelling read, it really helped me understand what it was like to be black in the 50's.

How could these products be safe! Where there after effects?2. Sometimes the book comes across as an endorsement of Catholicism. Griffin often argues that blacks were more accepted in his view in Catholic communities in America. Although I disagree with this argument, as evidenced by Catholic communities in New York and Boston."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This is not a very good book. It was advertised to be an account of a white man passing for black in the 1950's south. It is a fraud. At several points in the book the author would have one believe that he was able transform from black to white and back to black again in a single day with only the help of some dye and some soap. Not believable at all. This is just one white man's perspective about what it was like being black in that time and location.

I thought it was pretty good. I never knew that there was that much racism in America. I liked the book because it is uncut and really full of history.

How would life be, if people treated you differently because of your color? ... This man made a big sacrifice, but at the same time a discovery. He left his everyday life, family, and home to go and see what it was like to be treated differently because of race. He didn't go walking down the streets just as he was.

In the book Griffin, a white middle-aged journalist and specialist in race issues, chooses to leave his plush and privileged life-style in Texas to tour the Deep segregated South as a \\"Negro\\". His quest: to find out, \\"What is it like to experience discrimination based on skin color, something over which one has no control?\\" (p.7).Griffin, the protagonist in this true story, undergoes a medical treatment to temporarily darken his skin in order to disguise himself as a black man in hopes of \\"learn[ing] the truth\\" and \\"bridg[ing] the gap\\" (p.7) between the two races. Making several stops in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia over a six-week period of time, Griffin chronicles his enthralling saga and gives his readers his personal, firsthand accounts of the struggles and prejudices that he and many \\"nameless Negroes\\" encountered in the infernal world of racial segregation in 1959.Griffin's nonfiction prose is one that cannot fit precisely into any particular category: His knack for turning a rather didactic documentary into an engrossing \\"non-fiction novel\\" ebulliently fortifies my love for him as a writer and entices me to read more of his work.Noting the author's creative writing style as a definite strength, I would have to say his weakness was the usage of big ambiguous words, which did not contribute to the author's message. For example, on p.68, the author writes, \\"Canned jazz blared through the street with a monstrous high-strutting rhythm that pulled at the viscera.\\" Viscera, is just another way of saying gut or intestines.

Griffin was white and he decided to medically darken his skin (and smooth out the rough spots with dye and shave his head) and go as a black man. His plan was to see if things truly were different on the other side of the color line.The book is a novelization of his experiences (meaning things were edited and re-arranged to make the story work better) and it starts with him pitching his idea to a publisher and his family. Once he gets funding and permission from his family (after a lot of serious talk about how dangerous this could be) Griffin heads off to New Orleans for his medical treatments. He picks New Orleans because of its more liberal racial attitudes, figuring that it would be easier for him to learn the new rules and expectations (if there were any) in a more forgiving environment. He tours the city, both black and white areas as a white man and once his transformation is complete he makes the same trips as a black man.Griffin discovers that the world was indeed a different place for a black man in the south in 1959. He was denied entry to most places. He was routinely given what he called the \\"hate stare\\" by complete strangers, and had great difficulty with the basics of life such as getting something to drink and finding a restroom. He was coached in the basics by a shoeshine man named Sterling that he had befriended as a white customer. Sterling was astounded by the change and fearful for Griffin's life if he was ever found out. But, Sterling's lessons become the first real introduction that Griffin and the readers get to the differences between life as a black man and life as a white man.Griffin spends quite a bit of time in New Orleans and details a lot of inequities in housing, eateries, stores, hotels and so on. In fact, just about the only place that gives Griffin an even break is a Catholic book store. Griffin decides to travel to Mississippi to visit an area that had had a recent lynching. He also hitchhiked across Alabama, visited Atlanta. He experiences city life, rural life and everywhere there is the pervasive presence of racism. Griffin's prose is oftentimes moving. He commented at the beginning of the book that this book was written quickly and not very polished. Griffin completely underestimated the power of his writing - it may have been quick, but it was very well done.This edition includes an epilogue written for the 2nd edition of the book printed in 1977. The epilogue details the dangers suffered by Griffin after the publication of Black Like Me in 1961 and his usefulness as an intermediary between white and black members of communities throughout the U.S. However, the epilogue does not end on a hopeful note as Griffin is quite frustrated with the slow pace of racial reconciliation in America. He died in 1980 so we do not know what he would have thought about how things have gone in the last 30 years.The audiobook reader, Ray Childs, does a masterful job with dialects, creating new voices (voices of different races and different sexes from different regions - all done perfectly). He reads the text with great effect and helps to make many poignant scenes even more profound.With the exception of just a few minutes of the description of Atlanta (not being from Atlanta, I found the recital of African American neighborhoods and the lengthy listing of their community leaders a bit dry) this is a moving book that pulls the listener in and keeps the listener listening."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book was read by a teacher to the class when I was in elementary school. Never did I forget the impact this book made on me. When I found it for my kindle, I had to have it. So pleased to have this and to reread it again."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This is a view into a world that I cannot know any other way. Sadly, although there have been many improvements since this was written, the same struggles remain. I wish every adult in the USA would read this and refelect on the changes that they can make, within themseleves and the community around them."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"The events in this book happened in my lifetime. And in my country.That a little bit of dye could turn a productive, accepted citizen into a sub-citizen is just amazing. John Griffin's tale of his life in the South as a white and black man gives the best glimpse of what life was like for blacks that I have ever read. His impressions of New Orleans and Mobile as a white and black man are the simple words that will pick up the reader and shake him.Even more shocking- after all the books I was forced to read in high school and college, this was never on a reading list. I have been assigned books and articles that dealt with man's inhumane treatment of his fellow man in Germany, Africa, Asia...but never stuff that happened right in my own back yard.So if you are interested in this topic, read this book. If you are not interested in this topic, definitely read this book.The kindle edition had a few pictures that added to the experience, and a few essays added in more modern times that I could have just as soon skipped. Not that they weren't of a high quality, but they paled in their ability to communicate when compared to the main text."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Growing up in a small rural all-white Missouri town in the 1960s, I had no experience of understanding of racial issues. Blacks, or \\"Negros\\" as the polite word was then, weren't a part of my world other than showing up occasionally on flickering TV images. In fact, I can remember a grade school field trip to a larger city about 40 miles away that marked the first time some of my classmates ever saw a black person. (One even posed the question \\"Are they that color all over?\\")So what was it that inspired me to pick up a copy of John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me back in junior high school? My memory is a little hazy, but I'm sure it must have had something to do with the TV coverage of the Civil Rights movement. I remember the scenes of marchers being beaten with batons and having police dogs and fire hoses turned on them. Like many people, those are the images that first introduced the struggles of blacks in the Southern U.S. Black Like Me was the first encounter many of us had to the horrible injustices of segregation.On its surface, Black Like Me is the story of one white man who, with the aid of drugs, sunlamps and dye, managed to turn himself black and find out first-hand what it was like to travel through the Deep South as a black man. On a deeper level, the book was an indictment of the soul-killing system that turned blacks into second-class citizens and forced whites - even those who understood that segregation was wrong - into a silent complicity with the bigots.Griffin's book can still inspire today. I was afraid that the book would not stand up well over time, but it remains relevant. In fact, it's difficult to read the book and not feel echoes and reverberations from the days of segregation even today. To read it again is to simultaneously feel pride at how far we have come and shame at how far we still have to go.Besides Griffin's powerful journal of his time spent as a black man and the immediate aftermath of his story, this edition of Black Like Me also contains a 1976 epilogue by the author that focuses on the Black Pride movement and black separatism and the author's 1979 essay, Beyond Otherness.What I found most revealing was an afterward written in 2006 by Robert Bonazzi that outlines Griffin's fascinating life story (of which Black Like Me was only one facet). I had no idea that Griffin, who studied in France as a young man, was active in helping refugees escape the Nazis. I also wasn't aware that he lost his sight during the war in the Pacific, but after several years of blindness his sight returned. Griffin's life sounds epic in scale and almost mythic.Black Like Me is one of those books that stand out as a watershed in the history of the Civil Rights movement. It can - and should - be read today and into the future for all those wanting insight into what that terrible time was like."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This was a fabulous book! A great read on race relations and the experiences of both black and white. Great learning tool for a class or for your own personal knowledge. It really puts things into perspctive!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like MeBlack Like Me is a story of a white man living in Texas, who decides to go far into the Deep South. He wants to experience and write about what it was like to be a black man and how white people treated them. As a person who is of mixed race, I found Black Like Me an interesting book because it was like I could understand from both sides. What I liked about this book is that he as an individual white man actually wanted to be black and wanted to show his own race how it was like for them to treat black people that way. What I also liked about this book is how the friends that he had before did not look at him in any different way even though the color of his skin was darker then theirs. The things about this book that I like the most is that he was okay with everything that would come at him regardless if it was bad or good. He also didn't really let white people talk bad about black people. I believe that he realized that even though he is white he also believes that he is black too. For me being a mixed race with both black and white I feel he knows what its like to be a mixed race as well. What I didn't like was how some white people would try to be his friend and then after a certain discussion point they would say something ignorant or nasty about a black person. What I also didn't like was when Griffin (the main character) had gotten a ride from a white man and while they was talking the white man says that white people think that they are doing black people a favor by putting some white in their blood. Other than some down falls in the book where it was racist a lot, I believe that this was a very good book. I would recommend this book to seventh graders, because when they get into middle school and start realizing that they are from different social statuses that racial comments start to interact. I would also recommend Black Like Me to older people who want to read an interesting book. I don't think that I would change much of anything in this book because everything is real and talks a lot of how they used to live and how they were treated back then in the Deep South. I also don't think that much had changed since the 1960's up until today."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This non-fiction book is based on the experiences that John Griffin had in the deep south in the late 50's early 60's. He was a white man that had his skin artificially darkened to the point that he look like an African American. This was a very bold move of him considering how \\"tense\\" things were racially in this period of time.He wanted to see if and/or how he would be treated differently by his friends, family and strangers if he looked like a black man. Also to see if a white man could learn the truth about Negro. This book is kind of like a journal that he kept day by day describing his trials and tribulations. He finds it more difficult to find a job, find somewhere to eat and sleep, traveling around and even cashing his travelers checks was even becoming hard to do. People that he talked to all the time and saw just about everyday didn't even recognize him as one of their friends.Griffin was very glad and kind of amazed that he got along well with the other black men and even started to take a liking to them.If you like books about racial discrimination and personal events this book is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Scooter Jones' (age 13) Review of Black Like Me\\"Rest at pale evening...A tall slim tree...Night coming tenderlyBlack like me.\\"--Langston HughesIn 1959, John Griffin, the author of Black Like Me, used ultraviolet rays and stain to make his white skin darker. He shaved his head, took some traveler's checks, bade his wife and children goodbye, left his Texas farm, and boarded the nearest bus to Mississippi. Griffin wanted to learn whether African-Americans really had a \\"'wonderfully harmonious relationship (p.7)'\\" (as the Southern legislators put it) with the white people of the Southern states. He visited Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Georgia. Griffin was amazed at the things he discovered. He traveled as an African-American man for about half a year before returning home and writing Black Like Me.When I read this book in 2005, I was blown away. I had always assumed our country is one of the world's most advanced in treating all citizens equally-and I had believed that it had been this way for a long, long time. You know, there had been slaves and everything, but we'd taken care of that, like, 150 years ago. But John Griffin showed me that I was dead, dead wrong. It was like he took me by the hand and we both plunged into an alien world, quite unlike the one I know now. He led me into the segregated South. Along with him, I felt the \\"hate stares\\" on my back. I felt the discrimination. I felt the loathing faced by African-Americans just 45 years ago. People in America today need to read this book so that they can understand a shameful, but educational, piece of our nation's history.I really liked Black Like Me. I experienced powerfully how segregation made so much of our society off limits to to the African-American Griffin. I analyzed people's true natures based on how they treated Griffin first as white, then as black. I learned how young children had their hopes for the future robbed from them, just because of their skin color.As a white upper middle class man, Griffin never had to worry about finding simple public things such as a bathroom, a water fountain, or a park bench. After darkening his skin, Griffin asks a black man about where to find a bathroom and a church. The man says, \\"'Well, man, now just what do you want to do-[pee] or pray?....Lordy, Lordy...if you stick around this town, you'll find out you're going to end up doing most of your praying for a place to [pee]...you can go in some of the stores around here, but you've almost got to buy something before you can ask them to let you use the toilet (p.24).'\\" At one point, Griffin has been walking all over town and needs to rest: \\"My legs gave out. At Jackson Square, a public park, I found a long, curving bench and sat down to rest for a moment...I looked to see a middle-aged white man across the park...get to his feet and amble toward me...With perfect courtesy he said,'You'd better find yourself someplace else to rest. (p. 45)'\\" At this moment, Griffin and I are both amazed at how white people feel that black individuals are lower class, and forbid them to do something as simple as sit in the same park as themselves.As a black man, Griffin quickly learns that people will not give him the same courtesy he has taken for granted before. People he had always interacted pleasantly with when he was white now refuse to speak a civil word to him, and sometimes even try to hinder him. When Griffin tries to cash one of his traveler's checks, he becomes painfully aware of the discrimination. \\"I took the bus to Dryades and walked down it, stopping at the dime store where I'd made most of my purchases. The young white girl came forward to wait on me. \`I need to cash a traveler's check,' I said smiling. \`We don't cash any checks of any kind,' she said firmly...I went into one store after the other along Dryades and Rampart Streets...It was not their refusal-I could understand that; it was the bad manners they displayed...they would have cashed a traveler's check without hesitation for a white man. (p. 51)\\" Griffin feels upset that these people will treat the exact same person differently just because of his skin color. As a reader, I feel the same sense of outrage, and though painful, this remains my favorite part of the book--because it show the \\"double face\\" of racism so acutely.Growing up, Griffin had always assumed his right to hope for a bright future. If he was smart enough, he could get into a good college, earn his degree, get a good job, and make a lot of money. He hadn't realized that African-American children could not do the same. One black man says that the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the African-Americans become postman or pastors, and that is only if the family can raise enough money for the child to go to college. Today's generation needs to understand the hopelessness faced by African-Americans just one generation ago.After reading Black Like Me, I see why it is a classic. I recommend it for people ages 13 and up, because this book showed the injustices from an insider's perspective. In 2005, when our society hasn't left racism as far behind as many of us would like to think, people need to learn how it feels to face segregation, discrimination and hopelessness. John Griffin was a brave man; he could have been killed by hate groups for writing this controversial book. Americans everywhere should honor his efforts by having this book in their bookcases. It will remind us of the shameful irony in the statement: \\"all men are created equal.\\""},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"&quot;Black Like Me&quot; by John Howard Griffin is truly a magnificent book. All his life, he has seen the ridicule and hate towards African - Americans, but no he decides to journey into the life of a black man. With his skin tempoaririly darkened due to medical treatements, he says goodbye to his family and journeys into the life of an African American in the deep South. This book truly touched me. Me, being a young black woman, have exerienced minor events such as recorded in this book, but nothing ever this major. This is a book that all people need to read, wether you be white, black, chinese, asian.... ANYTHING!!! This book may only seem to focus on the love / hate relationship between whites and blacks, but really it reaches out to all types of racism.... girl / boy, chinese / japenese.... evendog / cat! This is definitely as must - read, page - turnin, &quot;gimme just five more minutes, mom&quot; type of book. I definietly give it two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"You only have to be human for a short period of time to know the unjustice out world has. Black Like Me takes John Howard Griffen's life and puts it in an inthralling and delicious true novel. An unbeliecable tale that is inpredictable in nature and thought.John Howard Griffen was born a white man. In the late 50's he darkened his skin through the use of creams, sun and medication to become a black man. During this extremly scornful and racist filled society, what was Griffin's thought process for this life-altering change, albeit a short one? To see how the segregated black man lived, communicated and were treated. But, most of all, he wanted to know the truths and the false accusations placed upon 'their people'.What John Howard Griffin found was more than a group of people who were treated unfairly; he found people treated disrespectfully and with unjust fear. Above all, Griffin found a community of people who understood one another with a smile, touch or with few words spoken. As Griffin explained, it is obvious that a black man is deeply changed inwardly when subjected to conditions as the ones he lived in.Griffin chose the most southernly places in which to reside, as the Southern blacks were treated the worse. Griffin wanted to get to know the culture and later referred to himself as mulatto.His writings posess great tragedy, heart, horror and happiness. To have done this was very brave. Something that many more persons should have done. The horridness of then American democracy was clearly shown. It takes a brave man to do what Griffin did. He speaks of the squalor with such despise and love. What you read, you wish was unreal and was a piece of fiction. Although we do not 'see' segregation today, this is a chilling book making the reader look at people differently and with due respect."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I'm in the middle of reading this book right now and it is amazing! There are things in this book that I've never heard of through history books. This is a true story about this man that decides to color his skin and go to Alabama &amp; Mississippi in the 1950's to write a book of what it is really like down there. He finds out things are worse than he even thought. I'm about half way through and it's just wonderful! So interesting to see how things were that could only be told in this way."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I found the book Black Like Me a great example of how the color of skin can change the world for a person. Griffin did a great job of keeping his accounts intact. His stories of how he travled as a black man in a white mans body display the sometimes harsh consequenses for a black man in the South. I would recommend this book for a person of either race and of any age."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Yes I am A 14 Year Old. I have Been a avid book reader for the past 7 years.

Griffin's experience opened my eyes to what life is really like for someone who is black in the South. Everyone should read this book. It will change their way of thinking."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me showed the plight and injustice done to African Americans as I never saw it before. John Howard Griffin made me realize how much discrimination a person can go through just because of the pigment of his or her skin. He made me realize that the \\"colored people\\" were oppressed to the point where they couldn't trust anyone of the white race. Griffin makes it clear of how it felt being denied things others take for granted, such as getting a cup of water or even the privilege of using the bathroom. His honesty is what I enjoyed the most in reading this novel. The way he describes how it feels to be given the \\"hate stare\\" made me feel as if I felt the anger and frustration that had boiled from within so many others. It's hard to understand how the mere sight of a person's color could repulse others so violently. However, Griffin doesn't try to cover up the \\"evils\\" of American society. He doesn't try to defend the actions of his white counterparts either because he suffered the same injustices that only the colored could understand. Unlike other books, Black Like Me has given me a different perspective. His experience made me see a part of America that I could have never imagined existed until now. It saddened and shocked me of how inhumane humans can treat one another. It also saddens me that this racial inequality is still prevalent in today's society, although not to the same extent."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book was assigned to me for an English essay, and I did not expect it to be so fabulous. John Griffin walked the streets as a completely different pigment, yet he was always the same man. He made startling discoveries of how tough it actually was to be a black man in the deep South, and how almost equally hard it was to be a white man."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"black like me is my all time favorite book. when i was in fifth grade, my teacher recomended it to me. ever since he gave me his copy because i like it so much, i have read the book over eight times. i have an original copy, and every time i see a copy of it, i buy it and give it as a gift. it is a wonderful work of art. being a wealthy white girl, always interested and totally apposed to slavery, this book helped me to really see how people just like me could be so vulgar, and dusgusting. i really recomend you read this book, if you have not. it is a wonderfully true story."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"my literature class just finished reading this book i was not sure if i would like it or not but i really did.

I did not want to put this book down. I was horrified to learn of his experiences. How I wish that everyone, regardless of their colour, would read this book."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me, I just finished reading in my 8th grade English class and just today we were discussing it. The book was wonderful and I never knew that is what went on in the South back then. I only knew little bits and pieces until I read the book. I cannot believe it was a real account. I really think that everyone should read this book becuase it deals with racism and prejudice towards people of an &quot;inferior&quot; status. I mean, they are talking about racism against blacks, but it is not really that much different than if it were racism towards a Jew or Hispanic. This book is must read to anyone who has ever wanted to know what really went on behind closed doors in the South way back when."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me is a powerful book which reveals the small, hidden bits of racism in all of us. Griffin, a white journalist, undergoes an amazing transformation which allows him to experience and understand racism throughout the South in a whole different light and an entirely new degree - he becomes black himself. By changing his skin's color, Griffin experiences first-hand the stunningly different, and often hopeless, world on the other side of the racial barrier. A book that makes you both sad and angry, but ultimately opens your eyes - changing the way you see the world. Powerful!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read this book 20 years ago and found it to be very impactful. I have recently rediscovered it and incorporated it into my sons' homeschool program. Synopsis: The author, who is caucasion, wants to discover first-hand the experience of African Americans in the south. He finds a way to actually physically appear to be an African American. It is an essential and very enlightening book. If you haven't given too much thought to civil rights issues; this book will leave you with a new appreciation for those who experienced racism. I would recommend this book for seventh graders and adults. In my opinion, this book is truly a classic and deserves to be rediscovered!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I have wanted to read this book for over ten years, but never made it a priority. I knew the basic premise of the book as being a white man making himself look like a black man to see how bad racism was at the time. I was fortunate enough to find an old copy at the local Goodwill, so I figured it must be time for me to give it a read. I had high expectations of this book, but they were far exceeded.This book is raw, almost terrifyingly so at times. The tales told on many of the southern whites made me ache inside and out, and really made me check myself for any hints of racism that may be lurking in the dark recesses of my own heart. I fear we are all guilty in small ways of this, though I wouldn't have believed it before reading this book.I will say it may be a good thing that I didn't read this book when I first heard on it. As a high-school student, I'm sure I was probably too immature to appreciate the depth of man's hate. Life experience has proven invaluable to my understanding of this book and Griffin's project."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"having dealt with walking while black, department store while Black, driving while Black and just being a Black Man in America any place, anywhere here this book speaks the truth and always will because there is still a divide and if more people went on the journey that this man went on, then they wouldn't think that things don't still exsist and still happen because they still do very much so.there is still privledge and acceptance in the United States based on the color of your skin. the author felt a month was too long, imagine a year or longer? the naiveness and Priviledge is still mind boggling and is very real, because without proper acknowledgement and other factors you can't ever Enslave a race of People and then call them free without understanding the Pshycological and physical damage that has happen and how it still has impact and effect to this very day, but Props to one very daring Soul to expose the reality within the reality.a must read for all and when i see the Fox Network or the Tea Party or the Dixie Democratic party its a reminder of how powerful of the past still has pressence on the now."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book had a profound effect on me as a teenager back in the 70's as part of a psychology class in high school. I've just listened to it - all 7 hours. I am moved once again.It is amazing to think about the courage that John Howard Griffin had in order to turn himself in to a black man so that he could truly experience the racism of the South in the late 1950's. His writing is powerful as he details in diary-form his journey and the people that he encounters - both good and bad.It is also amazing to think about how far we as a country have come in our race relations. Although there are still serious injustices and inequalities in the US today (2011) as it relates to blacks and whites, we as a nation have come a very long way. This book is a profound reminder of how far we have come.I strongly encourage anyone who wants to develop a keener understanding of the human psyche and to develop a stronger sense of empathy to not only read but to listen to this book as I have just done. (Note: I was not able to find the audio version on Amazon. I found it at my local library - a pleasant surprise.)"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me was a great book and taught me how the black person who lived in the South had such a hard life especially in the Deep South of Mississippi or in New Orleans, which is the setting of the book. In New Orleans the white person is nice to the black man but the white man does not respect the black man just tolerates him. In Mississippi the white person is very degrading to the black man. You cannot even look at a white woman in Mississippi without getting lynched. John Griffin who was on a bus ride in Mississippi was not allowed to get off at his stop because the bus driver was a white man and a horrible racist and he just wanted to mess with John Griffin. John Howard Griffin was a courageous journalist because he was a white man who wanted to turn himself black to see how the black man lived in the South. He wanted to see what the real hardships were for the everyday black man. For example how hard it is to find a job or a place to live; everyday things that we take for granted in today's society. The book showed me that racism is a real thing that blacks even in today's society have to deal with. The book was great and I would recommend the book to anyone who wants to learn about the South and how black people really have to live their everyday lives."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"In the novel, Black Like Me, the author, John Howard Griffin, temperaroly changes his white skin color the the hated color, black, to research in the Deep South what it is really like to be hated for the color of your skin. The theme of this non-fiction novel is hate. Griffin recieves the &quot;hate stare&quot; from many whites in the bus stations and other businesses that he tries to enter. &quot;Then came again, the Hate Stare.&quot; (129) Griffin goes into businesses as a Black person and is refused service and bathroom facilites, but he returns to these businesses as a White person and is treated with dignity and respect. This is exact proof that people hate other people just because of their skin. It is also ironic when Griffin finally returns home after going public with his project. Whites in his hometown that once repected Griffin, wouldn't even talk to him and white supremisists hung a dummie of Griffin painted half black and half white to ridicule him. It is ironic because he is White, but they still hate him just because he was trying to help the Blacks. Americans are overflowing with hate and disgust for all the wrong reasons. Hate is a disease that infects the ignorant minds of young Americans and grows inside and is spread to their young. It is almost uncurable and in some cases is fatal. I recommend this novel for any person, Black or White, that has a heart and cares enough about America' citizens to try to unite the different races to make our country a better place to live."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"John Howard Griffin's Black Like Me is the best book that I have read in years. I admire his nerve for being so gutsy. He now knows what we dark skinned people have been putting up with for 400 years. I learned something valuable: The white people were more afraid of their friends, peers and family members than they were the dark-skinned people. He took a risk of losing his health to feel what we have always felt.I admire him for his courage and compassion for the love he had for others.This book is a great book. It describes the way a white man feels when he switches from having a normal life in the late 1950's to being a black man in racist situations. It has an important lesson along with this book: it says that blacks in the 1950's should have been treated with the same respect that white men were. White men picked on the blacks, not letting them even share the same restroom, simply because they didn't think they're skin was the right color. This is a story about a man who discovers that color isn't an object to place racism on, and that people can get along when there's no prejudice.This book recounts one of the most exciting sociological experiments of the 20th century. The Caucasian author undergoes chemical and physical changes to appear as an African American, to document the bias and social injustices of the white American society from personal experience."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"What better way to discover what it is like to be someone than to become them? This is exactly what John Griffin did in 1959. John was a writer for an African-American magazine, Sepia, who wanted to discover what it was like to be an African-American in the Deep South. By medication and ultraviolet rays he turned his skin a rich brown so he could pass for an African-American. He decided he would not change his name, the way he talked or the way he dressed and with two hundred dollars and a duffle of close he was off to New Orleans. John immediately was amazed at how only the change in his skin color made him hated by whites but in the same way it made him loved by African-Americans. He traveled through the south looking for a job. Normally a well-dressed, educated man would have no trouble finding a job but that's far from the truth if you're an African-American living in the Deep South. After three months he had more than enough and could not stand that quality of life any longer. He changed his skin tone back to the old milky white went back to his home in Texas. Here he would encounter the same hate that he did as an African-American. Now simply changing his skin color cannot free him from this hatred. Black Like Me is a definite must read. It is an eye-opening experience for the reader. It is important for every American no mater age what to read this masterpiece. It lets one see the horrific crimes we committed against an innocent race because they were different. It lets the reader fully understand the conditions if you were an African-American living in the South in the 1950's. When something is understood it can be prevented from every happening again."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black like me is a journey into the depths of human emotion and prejudice. Griffin chooses under his own power to brave the hate of a world in its own and an existance that is not fit for human survival. He wishes to know how and why our society is destroying itself with inconsequential arguements. Griffin discovers that some would prefer the truth remain hidden, and that this danger and intolerance can hit quite close to home. Griffin endangered his life, and also that of his family, because he believed his experience was one that needed to be told, and his story upset a generation to enlighten the next."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I just finished a class at school on black/white relations, and this book drove to the heart of the issue in a dramatic and truthful fashion. The book is the true account of Griffin, a white man, changing only the color of his skin so as to experience first-hand the life of a black man in in the very openly racist Deep South of the late 1950s.The account becomes particularly revealing when Griffin describes how towards the end of his investigation he &quot;switched&quot; back and forth between black and white on a daily basis, noting the negative reactions he received from both black and white communities based on the color of his skin.Additionally, the epilogue by the author is incredible. He bemoans how people, particularly northerners, have tokenized him, seeing him as the only white person capable of communicating with blacks. Specifically, he describes one situation where a city task force brought him in as the &quot;liason&quot; to their black community, yet they had not even taken preliminary steps to communicate with its most outspoken representatives.I don't typically read books in their entirety at one sitting, but this book drew me in by its interesting topic, and I wasn't able to let it go until I had finished it. This book is a great book, and I recommend it to all. Specifically, I would imagine this book to be particularly helpful for a white seeking to better understand the nature of race in this country, but there is nothing about the book that would preclude enjoyment by another demographic."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me is an \\"eye opener\\" to what it was like to be a black person in the deep south in the 1950's and the 1960's.

Great book and a great writer!"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Five stars for the author's courageousness, four stars for content at the time of publication, three stars for content when read today.No white man - no matter how well-intentioned - can satisfactorily explain the social or emotional climate faced daily by blacks, a fact that was even more true a half-century ago. Coupled with the relatively brief period Mr. Griffin spent posing as a black man, it is understandable why I, or another reader, could be left asking, \\"Is that all there is?\\" But Griffin placed his family on the line during this project, put personal relationships to the test, and had to maintain his wits to maintain his facade. At a time in our history when the only exposure whites had to blacks took the form of media coverage of early civil rights demonstrations and a \\"daring\\" television program hosted by Nat King Cole, Griffin performed a true public service in helping to explain, albeit in surface terms, what it just might be like to be black. That would be contribution enough, circa 1960. Looking back now, \\"Black Like Me\\" can almost be viewed as a stunt, as something we might associate with Geraldo Rivera or someone from \\"Dateline\\", but it was a daring technique for its time, a selfless act by a man with newly-restored vision who could have played it safe.If you want raw, unvarnished narrative on the black condition, try \\"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\\". If you desire a window into the \\"white\\" side of the civil rights movement and a first-person narrative on personal courage, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I first read this book in 1965 as a junior in high school.

Mr. Griffin's book will remain a timeless classic and a primer for we who are not of color as we try to gain some understanding on life for those who are people of color. I believe that reading this first in 1965 made me a better man and able to at least attempt to stamp out tired stereotypes in my own heart. I am certain it helped me look upon ALL humankind as worthy of my kindness on an equal level. May God help me continue this as I live out my life.

I was mesmerized by the hateful encounters that the Black people went through just because of their skin color. I was also amazed about how my ancestors, the white man, never gave the Black people one iota of respect.Another angle of the story showed how far a journalist of the fifties would go for a story. Through the book, I saw Griffin go against all morals of his time for a story. I saw him become an outcast of his society. On top of that he put his life on the line, with the skin change and the crazy white men, for a story. This seemed to me to be a dumb mistake that eventually cost him his life.I enjoyed the book and will read it again.

I saw the moviesWatermelon ManandThe Spook Who Sat by the Doorafter taking a racism class in college, interested in the evolution of black power in America. Many years later I got Griffin's book.It's a quick read, only 200 pages (including epilogue & afterward), yet is enough to fill the reader with enough information to show them that there was still deep-rooted racism in the south. You must understand, though, that this takes place during '59-'60, so much has changed as far as laws & many incidents of blatant discrimination. The civil rights movement started, and in some aspects continues today. And recently the country's first black president sits in the white house, something no one could have thought of in the '60s. Despite all this we can still see forms of discrimination & racism today.Griffin's experiment proved a point that no matter what color we are, we can discriminate, hate, judge, and these things are what keep us back as a species. They prevent us from making any real progress because we always divide ourselves by color, class, caste, race, sex, culture, instead of realizing that we are humans first, and that's the perspective we should come from when handling issues that trouble us...at least that's how I see it. I understand that we all have different needs & they might not apply to everyone, but we also have the same basic needs that everyone cannot live without.We can understand, though Griffin's book, how black people might feel towards whites, or towards their own people. The frustration of being overlooked, chased away, ridiculed, or immediately classified as \\"not good enough\\" just by the pigment of your skin. We've made SOME progress over the years but I doubt that much has changed since the books' publication.Griffin's book is one of many (The Spook Who Sat By the Door,Malcolm X,Soul on Ice,Nigger) that have tried to understand the struggle of blacks from the times of slavery up to present-day.

It is an autobiography about a white man who explores The Deep South as a black man by changing the pigment of his skin. This is a terrific book and I strongly recommend it.Mr. Griffin's purpose is to find out how African American's are treated compared to Caucasian American's. To achieve this, Mr. Griffin travels to The Deep South. He finds himself in the middle of two cultures who accept or reject him merely because the color of his skin. He finds the discrimination gets worse as he travels farther South.The book takes place in the late 50's and early 60's. It is set mainly in New Orleans and The Deep South. The mood of the book is depressing and poignant.I think Mr. Griffin proved his point by telling America and the rest of the world how badly black people in society were treated. His writing is fairly easy to read with a few difficult words. I would have liked the book more if Mr. Griffin was not so verbose. Overall, the novel is very moving and John Griffin vindicates himself. I would recommend this novel because it tells a lot of history and Mr. Griffin speaks very eloquently and from his heart.The novel taught me some history along with how African American's were restrained from having a normal life."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I received this order very quickly and it showed up in great condition.

I really enjoyed this book because it shows u how the black people were ridiculed because of their skin color which is like wrong, i think, um the thing that stood out to me was that, if a person was black and wanted to like eat in a resteraunt, they would have to eat in the back of the building and not at a table. Anyways i recommend this book to whomever wants to read this book."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me is a great book to read. It described life in 1959,when blacks had no happiness and little freedom. Life was like prison, but a prison for life that blacks couldn't leave. This is shown by John Howard Griffin who went through a medical transformation that turned his skin color black. The outcome shocked him and me. I felt the pain of his mistreatment, and the shame he went through. The people that he knew gave him no respect as a black man. For example when Griffin went back to his hometown New Orleans, he went to a restaurant that he ate there all the time as a white man, but now that his black they won't even lit him use the restrooms.This book is one of the best books I ever read; it will show you that one man wanted to see what it is like to be a black man in the Deep South. Griffin had to live the life of a black man, and be what whites thought he should be. This book is GREAT, you should read it."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"As an avid reader, I have long wished for a book that would in some way enable white Americans to feel the pain of hatred based on something that one has no control of. The history of African-Americans and their struggle for equality is seldom discussed in schools, homes and churces of the majority group. This is not simply a matter of not caring, but a matter of not knowing the courageous struggle of an entire race of people which has gone on for over 400 years and continues today. As a black southerner, I can empathize with the bigotry that Mr. Griffin encountered, I can also testify that it still (in less obvious ways) occurs today. I only wish that he could still be here to document the often unbelieved fact that the hands of racism still choke opportunites for minorities in this country. This book is a must read for any person who wishes to become more enlightend, more aware and more understanding of the plight of minorities in these(almost)United States."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book really makes you think about the United states in the era of segregation. This book is extremly honest and I think everyone should read it, so people will know the horrors of extreme discrimination. I found the most important theme in this book was trust, there was none. There was no trust between blacks and blacks, whites and whites, or blacks and whites. I suggest that if you need something to read you really should consider this book"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read this significant book in one day. John Howard Griffin did something most whites would never even dream of, especially when segregation was thriving in the Deep South.

I highly recommend this book to those who are intolerant of racial injustice."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I was 12 when I read this book for the first time.

He wanted to see what it was really like to be a black man in the Deep South. So he is basically under cover going to experience the treatment and life of a black man in the Deep South.To me this book was pretty good. The only bad part about this book was in the begining it was kind of confusion, because they were talking about how the plan was going to work, and it was kind of hard to understand.My recommendation for this book would be to peole who like to learn about history and how things were back then. If you are a person who doesn't know much about how things were in those rasis days, then this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"We simply cannot experience everything. There are too many options to choose between. Our only hope to understand all that is out there is through books. Vicariously we can at least partial understand the suffering in our world. Black Like Me is one of the better inside looks at a particular reality. Griffin sunned and dyed himself black and went into the deep south to experience life as a black man. The book is a revelation of human nature. Written as a diary it is hard not to symphathize with the situation described. Everything should read."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I can say that at 50+. I still remember this book from reading it at High School at 12years old and how significantly it touched me. it gave me an understanding the was reflected in all my life versus culture shocks. I have noted that in black and white towns that children who have no black in them but with meditteranean colouring is treated as a black derivative by white people. until they see that their mother is white and obviously so then the attitude changes to a better behaviour. So many years and people do not change.I think this book covers the attitudes of people of all races to other races. I have noted as a white person that some coloured women in my country in specific area of the country will not speak or will speak in a unfriendly way to others not of their culture.I hope I have written this respectfully as information not as to judge. I think this book was a courageous act by the author and respect him highly for it. without these people, undercurrents go by secretly instead of out in the open. Nothing can be denied from this action by one man concerned."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me should be required reading for every American, young and old. It is especially fitting at a time when our country is still in the grips of racism."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"When we learn about history we seem to only learn about the events themselves and never their context. One thing I didn't know about Black Like Me is that Griffin was only black for like six weeks and the book is mostly his journal notes. That, of course, changes the entire context and reading of the book.I've done some research for Robert Greene, and I wish I had read this when I was researching for The 50th Law Publisher: Harper because it is much, much better than Native Son and says most of the same things. (Two sidenotes, if Griffin was able to successfully fool people into thinking that he was black using the resources available in 1950, how incompetent were the makeup artists on Black White? Secondly, the best part of the book is the editor's note at the end where his biographer basically admits that after John died he married his widow and took over his estate, including the book he happens to be writing the epilogue to.)"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"The book Black Like Me by John Howard Griffin is about how the author, John Howard Griffin, goes from being a white, honorable journalist to a black journalist. He transforms through a series of aid medication and dye. He changes his color pigment from white to black. In the book, he transforms completely. He keeps a diary on his daily experiences, experiences hard to imagine. The diary documents his experiences as a black male trying to survive the crucial racist reality in the Deep South in the late decade of the 1950's and early 1960's. He transforms from a man who is able to get what he wants when he wants it, to someone who faces restrictions when going into places and doing what he wants.This book is an excellent way to show people of the United States the crucial reality of, not only the experiences of a black male, but of the whole entire ethnic group. I think this book is an excellent way to portray and show racism at a first glance. John knows the risk he is taking when he decides to go undercover as a black male in the Deep South, but he still goes ahead and does it. The truth is very harsh, but he still writes it. He opens a discussion among people of this crucial reality: that Blacks face discrimination in the simplest forms of life. He opens up the dormant eyes of every American in the country. This is an excellent book. -by OlgaThe book Black Like Me talks about a lot of discrimination. John Howard Griffin is the author and he writes about himself and the reasons why he changed from white to black. He wanted to be black and he decides to change how he looks and go to other places where nobody will know him. When he is black, he tests racism because he isn't like the other white people. The racism in the book Black Like Me is against black people for how they look.The book makes me question why people discriminate against other people. Everyone is human, everyone has feelings and everyone should have the same rights in this world. When he is white he is able to do what ever he wants and when he is black, he is restricted from doing a lot of things. People look at him differently for how he looks. People make racist comments and he feels bad for why people are like that. -by ArtemioThe book Black Like Me is very interesting. It is about a white man named John Howard Griffin that wants to change his skin color to black. He changes his white skin color to black because he wants to experience how black people were treated around 1959. It is something brave to do, because when he changes his color he goes through a lot of discrimination. He actually feels how other people from a different race are treated so badly.John Griffin is a businessman but he is no one when he changes his skin color. He has a wife and kids that he loves very much. He leaves that behind for some time just to feel how black people are treated. He is known as a black person and it goes really badly because he can't do what he would do if he was a white man. After being black, he finally realizes it is not easy being a black person. He feels bad for blacks; he can't believe they are treated so badly.In my opinion this book is very interesting. This book shows a good example of racism. It also shows that there are white people that care about black people because of what John Griffin did. John Griffin is a man that understands what black people were going through and it was something brave for him to do.These are three examples from the book that support my personal statement. One of them is that John Griffin tells his friend about what he is going to do with his color skin. His friend says he is crazy but John doesn't care. He still does it. Second, when John changes his color, people treat him badly but there are actually other people that help him out. The third example is that John has to get used to being black because he can't do what he used to do when he was a white person. These are my three examples that support my personal statement. -By MarielaThe book Black Like Me is about John Howard Griffin, the author, and his life. It all starts by him wanting to change his skin color through treatment/medication. He wants to change his color to a black person because he wants to see how people from his opposite color are treated. While he is living like a black person, he sees many differences between when he was white and then black. When Griffin was first white, he could go anywhere he wanted like fancy restaurants, sit on the buses with no trouble and stop where he wanted. He could also change checks into money. When Griffin changes his color to black, he can't sit in the park comfortably without being criticized by a white person. He is discriminated against, and he can't change a check into cash like he could when he was white. The main idea in this book Black Like Me is that black people are and were discriminated against currently and in the late 1950s while doing the same acts that white people do.I thought this book was interesting. I liked learning about John Howard Griffin's opinions/thoughts/experiences in his life. He goes through being black and seeing how blacks are treated. At the same time, I think he is the kind of guy that didn't judge people based on color. He cared about everybody, no matter what. For him, everybody is family. When Griffin was white he could go to fancy restaurants, stay in nice hotels, and have a great time outside without being discriminated against. After Griffin's medication darkens his color, he has to get comfortable with the reality that blacks get treated differently. John Howard Griffin was white and wanted to see from his own perspective how black people were treated. -by Marisol"},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I bought this book after reading Uncle Tom's Cabin, because I wanted to see a man's point of view on the treatment of Blacks.This was very informative, and gave a view of a white man's life as a Black. However, as an African American, I could not help but feel sad by reading this book. This man had the opportunity to go back and forth as a Black, but many that he came in contact with did not. I wish that there was more written about how this affected the author's home life, and also how the author felt about the experience once time had passed.This is a highly suggested book for one who would like to know about the race relations of the 1950's."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me was not written in the interests so much as to move and startle the reader as it was to inform him; yet it has accomplished both. I know it has touched millions, and the common feeling of these readers, including me, is that this story needed to be told. I believe it didn't need to be shared just with the people of that time, to help them understand, to begin closing the gap between races. I feel it was meant to be shared with those who have come later, and those who have yet to arrive. It is often said that if one doesn't learn from history, it is doomed to repeat itself, and this book will be needed to remind generations far beyond of the tragedies of that time, and how never to let them happen again. John Griffin wrote Black Like Me in working for the dream of black and white equality, in the hopes of getting the truth to people everywhere. He needed to uncover the real story behind racism in the South for himself, but with his quest came persecution and hatred of another kind; anger directed towards him and his ideas and truths, not senseless anger like the racism he encountered in his travels. I admire and enormously commend Griffin for taking such a great task on himself, in spite of the fires he knew he would spark with his enlightenment."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I'd been meaning to read this book for a long period of time but somehow never got around to doing it. Because of the extended time since the book's publication, my philosophy, hopefully, matured quite a bit. For this reason I found the book mildly disappointing but still generally interesting.From the standpoint of a Black man I found the author's assessments of race condescending while attempting to place myself in his shoes in 1959's racially charged southern culture. No Black man or even woman could have had the author's dual perspective but I found his descent into self-hatred compelling. His evaluations seem elitist because of the ease in which he navigated the culture as a Caucasian - the differences stark and extreme. Blacks knew only one experience - so his experience can only be described as an anomaly."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"The author was born and raised in Texas, went to France to study psychiatry, and became embroiled in World War II while working with the French insurgents against the Nazi-installed sham government there. His insurgent work became known to the Gestapo and he had to \\"leave France in a hurry\\". He joined the Army Air Force as an Intelligence Officer, was badly wounded twice, and suffered from temporary blindness. He underwent a spiritual conversion and became a Catholic.He returned to Texas and pondered doing covert participant observation on racism in the Deep South employing his skills developed through his experiences in the French Resistance: \\"For years the idea had haunted me, . . . If a white man became a Negro in the Deep South, what adjustments would he have to make? What is it like to experience discrimination based on skin color, something over which one has no control? . . . How else except by becoming a Negro could a white man hope to learn the truth?\\"Indeed, Griffin made a sound case for the benefits of covert participant observation as a method of sociological enquiry. \\"The Southern Negro will not tell the white man the truth. He long ago learned tht if he speaks a truth unpleasing to the white, the white will make life miserable for him\\", he explained. People behave differently when they know they are being studied. Through covert particpant observation, it was possible for Griffin to experience what goes on, to see who or what is involved, to note when and where things happen, how they occur, and why.With the help of a doctor, he darkened his skin in order to pass as a Negro in order to experience white hostility towards blacks: \\"The transformation was total and shocking . . . who is this large, bald Negro\\"?, he asked.\\"In the bus station lobby . . . She answered rudely and glared at me with such loathing I knew I was receiving what the Negroes call 'the hate stare'. It was my first experience with it. . . I realized I had done nothing - my color offended her\\".A pioneer of the growing sociological field of covert participant observation, Griffin's own experiences as a Negro in the Deep South are repeated in this volume \\"in all its crudity and rawness\\". Griffin provides a beacon in which other ethnographers might frame covert particpant observation research and illuminates some of the obstacles and dilemmas they might expect to encounter along the way. \\"It traces the changes which occur to heart and body and intelligence when a so-called first-class citizen is cast on the junkheap of second-class citizenship\\", he said.This book should be read along with Jack Douglas's \\"Investigative Social Research\\" and Erving Goffman's \\"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\\"."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read this book a while ago. But even now, I still remember how good of a read it was. Griffins way of showing how it is to be black in those days was a major leap in trust. Not many well-liked white men would dress up as a black man to show the injustice in america. I would have a hard time changing my skin color to become a black man. I think that showing the injustice was just as scary as almost anything you could imagine. Throwing yourself into a world that might kill you, and all the while gathering information to show the rest of the world was daring and gutsy. I admire Griffin for his ability to do that. The plot was a gripping one that kept me reading and wanting to know what was goint to happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"The story is well described in all of the other reviews so I will not rehash it yet again.A very interesting look from a unique perspective at the very start of the civil rights movement in the southern US. Forty + years later one has to wonder what it would be like for a new JH Griffin to repeat the experience. What would he find different? What would he find the same? In all honesty, a great deal has changed and great deal has remained unchanged. It would be even more interesting to have a white become black and a black become white. I'm sure that would be quite an eye opening report from the both of them.The book just goes to show that a person can never really know what something is like unless they themselves have experienced it. Watching &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; doesn't make a person know what combat is really like although it can give an idea of it; a white person can never really know what it is like to be black although they may some idea, it is never authentic."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I think that this is a great book for people to read, many people who were not aliv during these time periods do not understand the intensity of racism that occured. The stories that are told are so vicious and so cruel that sometimes we choose to not &quot;hear&quot; these stories. I think that this was a good book for people to read because I feel like this man did a great thing. It's hard to go from something to nothing but to want to understand what black people had to go through was something special. I know had it been me i would have given up as soon as I realized how bad it truly was for people, in this book white people wouldn't cash his checks, serve him, and white people tried to beat him up. He went through a lot and could have given up at any time but he chose not to. Then even after his experiment was over and he started doing all those different tv shows and interviews and he started being hated for what he did he still stuck with it and just moved away to another country. I look up to him for being strong enough to do this, but I also look up to him for taking the time to do it, even when he lightened up on his medicine so that he could go back and forth from black to white to compare how he was treated he knew that when he was black he was treated wrong, and also at the time when he went to Mississippi and the courts would put a lynch mob in jail just because they killed a black person and not a white person, it was things like this that showed him how bad black people really had it during these time periods....But overall this is a great book, people always say that you never really know a man until you have walked a mile in his shoes, I feel that John Griffin has walked states...."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This book made a huge difference in my life and understanding of racial issues in thes country in the 1960's.

It's indicative of the mistrust society has for the black person, that a white person must darken his skin and witness the injustice firsthand, before it's believed to be true.

The force behind racism is blunt stupidity which can't be negotiated with, can't be dealt with, must be avoided as much as possible. It is dangerous as it knows no respect for the laws of either nature or civility.To launch ones self headlong into near-certain risk of personal harm, with no easy or sometimes no means at all of escape, all in the pursuit of knowledge for the betterment of one's fellow man, is the definition of a hero. Racism does not produce, it is a fire that consumes. John Howard Griffin is the firefighter who was willing to run into a burning building to search for a child who might not even be there, willing to risk his life and unwilling to face the prospect that he didn't give it all, didn't do what it would take.Or, maybe the man was just crazy.

I've never, and after reading this book, I am truly amazed by the courage John Griffin had to do such a thing. In his book, Black Like Me, John uses medication and ultraviolet light to change his skin color for journalistic purposes. His goal was to see how blacks were treated now in the 1950s. What he sees is shocking: blacks are constantly insulted, beat by white men, and very obviously segregated. I would definitely recommend this book, because it shows the large difference between how whites and blacks were treated. Also, from this book, you see the contrast of how people treat John when he is white or black.

Griffin darkened his skin and changed his life to be able to see what it was really like being a black man in the segregated South. The things he heard, felt, and saw are things that will forever be impressed upon my mind as a reader. The way he told his story was very simple and straightforward, which almost seems to bring the messages home even harder. You can easily see him struggling with concepts that were everyday for the people he encountered: segregated restrooms, segregated water fountains, sneering, baiting, hatred, and disdain.

He took medication that darkened his skin and exchanged his live as a privileged white man for the world of an unemployed black man.

When he needed shelter, he was taken in; when he needed food, a black lady fed him; and when he needed a friend, every black person he met on the street would talk to him."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"How far would you go in order to see life from another person's perspective? Of course all of us would change if it meant that we would have a better life, but how many of us would put ourselves in a new lifestyle that would station us at the bottom of the social and economic system? John Howard, the author of Black Like Me, did just this. He found a way to change his skin pigmentation so that it was dark. He went down to the deep south during the late 1950's. This was a time of great oppression, humiliation, and segregation of colored people. This book follows his life before, after and during his life changing activities. We see people who are sympathetic to blacks and we see people who are ready to kill every last colored person alive. This book was truly moving and yet it was saddening. I suggest this book to anyone who thinks they have a grip on reality, because this book is sure to shake them up a little bit."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This is a superb and moving book.

Griffin whom has written many compelling books such as: \`Encounters with the other', \`Forgive My Grief' and many others has captured investigating writing. He not only gives writing its purpose but also defines it. Within the novel Black like Me he explores the life of a white man, but as a black man as well. Griffin uses his remarkable investigating skills and truly walks in the shoes of a black man. John H. Griffin walks in the shoes of a black man literally for he transforms himself by dying his skin. This novel is quite the read, for it deals with the struggles and hardships that African Americans faced in the 1950s.The novel gives one a taste of the never-ending discrimination African Americans face during this time. One can not help but be compelled to John H. Griffin and his profound determination upon the subject of racism. This is a well-written novel, which is filled with America's history of hate and degradation. But John H. Griffin uses his writing expertise to bring this to light."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Although it was written nearly forty years ago, this book points squarely and unflinchingly at unpleasant racial realities that are still too much with us. Taking to heart the axiom about &quot;walking a mile&quot; in the other guy's shoes, the caucasian Griffin altered his appearance in the late 1950's by the use of skin dye and hair treatment, so that he could spend a few weeks on the other side of the curtain of segregation that was an undisputed fact of life in the South. What he learned was not only profoundly eye-opening for him, but can be so as well for anyone who reads him sensitively today.As a light-skinned African-American who has spent much of my life among whites, I have often observed that perhaps only their becoming black could convince most whites of the reality, the pervasiveness and the persistence of racism in America. Short of that, I would heartily recommend this venerable classic by Griffin.Especially valuable is the Epilogue, in which the author recounts the experiences he had following the book's initial publication, when he was invited numerous places to expound his insights into America's &quot;race problem.&quot; Time and again, he is exasperated to find that those seeking solutions to racial unrest and animosity ignore the perspective of knowledgable blacks, preferring the views of a white man who has briefly experienced blackness over those derived from decades of such experience. In this section of the book, Griffin also offers a superb brief for the value of the perspectives presented in black newspapers and other black-controlled media. His own brief sojourn into blackness had shown him that such perspectives on events are no less valid or &quot;objective&quot; than those coming through the mainstream (white) media, and often provide a healthy and necessary corrective to the latter. It remains true that no American can consider him/herself fully informed on the issues of the day without exposure to a variety of viewpoints, and Griffin's admonitions on the dangers of ignoring black perspectives are as true in 1998 as they were in 1958.A sobering read, highly recommended to anyone seeking insight into the still-troubled world of American race relations. It would be a grave mistake to assume that the realities Griffin describes in this book ended with the Jim Crow laws. The only reason I would not rate it a &quot;10&quot; is that Griffin is no longer alive to give it a proper updating."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Black Like Me delineates the experience of John Howard Griffin, a white writer who specialized in race issues, who desperately wanted to know what it was like to be an African-American in the Deep South in order to experience discrimination based on skin color, something over which one has no control. In 1959, Griffin risked everything, including his career, his family, and his reputation. With the support of an African-American magazine and the help of dermatologists, he took medication that darkened his skin to a deep brown. He changed nothing but the color of his skin, and witnessed on a first-hand account what it was like to be a Negro. He began his journey in New Orleans and was shocked to discover how the whites treated him like scum, and all African-Americans treated him like their brother. He immediately found that he had to walk across town just to find a caf&eacute; that would serve him food and water, or that he would have to walk around a building in order to find a \\"colored\\" bathroom that he could use. Despite his education and qualifications, he had trouble finding a job. He traveled all throughout the Deep South, stopping in Alabama and Mississippi, which made New Orleans seem like the North. He began to feel like he had truly become an African-American, and felt bitter towards the Southern whites. His experience completely opened his eyes to what the real definition of racism is, and he hoped that his book would do the same for millions of people throughout the world. Black Like Me is John Howard Griffin's attempt to reveal the truth about discrimination and racism, and in my opinion that is exactly what it did. I recommend this book to those readers who usually can't stay interested in a book. You will not want to put this one down."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"This was a compelling novel that showed the true struggle African Americans in the Deep South went through against racism. It was commendably written. At times, I felt as though I could smell, feel and taste the events that Griffin described. With each new experience every detail was given. Black Like Me is a true story of a man, John Howard Griffin, who used medication and dye to change the pigment of his skin from Caucasian to African American. He went to the southern United States to find out if African Americans were actually treated differently. He then wrote an article revealing how differently he was treated when his skin was dark. This novel depicts what it was like for a black person living in the south in the 1950's. It shows the hatred, and disgust that was directed towards them for no other reason than the colour of their skin. It discusses the obstacles that they had to overcome as a race and the problems that they had within their race. Black Like Me tears at your heart. It shows how far we've come since then but also how much farther we need to go. The book ends with a fairly long epilogue explaining what has gone on since he wrote his article. It talks of great men such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and what they did for the black movement. A book like this is a must read if we will ever as a human race fully judge people by who they truly are and not by the colour of their skin."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read this book in the 70's while in high school.

At the time there were no people of color (any color) in my small town. Most were of Irish/German/Polish ancestry. I never saw any form of racism UNTIL I picked up this book.This book opened my eyes and made me understand a LITTLE bit of what life was like during the 50's and still are like for some to this day. We need to take a lesson from this man. If I could I would give this book 1000 stars."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I grew up in the south (Atlanta and Athens, GA) in the 60's and 70's, went to public schools in which we had serious racial tension, and I've only now just read John Howard Griffin's outstanding book of investigative reporting, Black Like Me. I honestly don't understand why this book was not required reading in my junior high school; in fact, it would be a service to America even today to make it required reading for everyone. Living in the suburbs and going to newly integrated schools, black rage was inexplicable, unavoidable, and terrifying to my friends and I, but this book would have helped us by giving us a real context. There will always be minds closed to the truths presented here, but if a more vital call for compassion toward those who seem different to us but are united in humanity exists, I don't know what it might be. And herein lies the true worth of this book--not only that it documents the constant oppression of blacks in the South under segregation, but also that it documents the distances that build up between any oppressor and oppressed. Black Like Me makes completely clear that the oppressed of any class, race, ethnicity, religious orientation, sexual orientation, etc., cannot &quot;rise above the problem&quot; without a lessening of that oppression; and that even the best willed of the oppressors are scarcely able to even recognize the extent of the problem. The mythologizing of the &quot;other&quot; so overwhelms our commonalties that they are almost completely obscured. Although many whites in the deepest South spoke of blacks as &quot;subhuman&quot; (or at best did not speak out against such grotesque characterizations) Griffin documents the fact that many blacks in the segregated South were astonishingly and universally civil toward one another, sharing what little they had with complete strangers. This generosity of spirit was practically unknown to most whites who had no real point of contact with the black community, as black relationships with one another were decidedly different than black-white relationships.Although the story of Griffin's changing his skin color to live as a black man in the south is totally compelling, ultimately I regretted that it wasn't longer or more detailed. Griffin was an absolutely extraordinary man, yet entirely human himself, and occasionally when situations turned too extreme he felt it necessary to retreat. At one point Griffin decides that he must go to Mississippi and so he gets to Hattiesburg immediately after a Mississippi county court rules against indicting anyone for the kidnapping from jail and lynching of a black man accused of a crime in spite of evidence gathered by the FBI. Once there, Griffin immediately finds the tension intolerable, the constant threat of violence overwhelming, and the degradation absolute. Rather than sticking with the story he calls a white friend and stays with him for a few days, then leaves. I can't fault him personally for this decision, and it certainly speaks to the horrifying environment in which he found himself, but a chance for some important journalism was missed. Similarly, the book feels truncated--after visiting Atlanta (which came off rather well at least in comparison, I'm pleased to say) Griffin winds up the project rather abruptly. He continues to suffer the consequences of his project for some time, facing threats and ostracism from his white neighbors to the point that he and his parents move elsewhere.Griffin rather casually dropped in some shocking autobiographical statements without any follow-up: &quot;when I was blind&quot;--he was blinded in a bombardment and his impairment lasted for 10 years; and &quot;It reminded me of the nagging, focusless terror we felt in Europe when Hitler began his marches, the terror of talking with Jews (and our deep shame of it).&quot;--he's not writing in the abstract. as he worked in Resistance France helping rescue Jews. Perhaps Griffin's humility causes him to omit some of these details, but I would have liked to have understood Griffin himself a bit more, to have known how he came to the decision to live as a black man. Regardless of its minor faults, Black Like Me, a veritable cry for compassion toward one another, is a true &quot;must-read&quot;--it has my very highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I just read an incredible book. It is called, Black Like Me. The author, John Howard Griffin tells about his accounts of taking skin pigments to change his Caucasian body to African-American. This is one of the few books out there in today's literature that gives a true account of what life is for an African-American male living in the south in the late 50's early 60's. Griffin, a journalistic man, went out on this experiment to get a story but instead of getting a story he got a life long lesson. This is a story where it is more then putting yourself in their shoes. You are they, you live their life and you understand what they always talk about. The details in this book, come out and grab you. While reading this book you will not want to put it down because you as the reader are always waiting to see what happens next. This may shock you because it cannot be found in any history or biographic book. It is a story you can understand because it comes from a person who entered a life they never experienced before. It makes you believe that you were there and maybe now you have a little more understanding of what African-Americans deal with then and now. This is a must read book because you will not find this anywhere else and it is a fact that we need to learn. We cannot hide from this any longer, we need to come to reality and face it."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"I read this book in the early 1980s when I was a teenager and recently picked it up again. While not having quite the impact and eloquence of Richard Wright's \\"Black Boy\\" or anything by Ralph Ellison, this is an interesting contribution to the essays and commentaries on race in the Deep South in the early 1960's.The premise is something of a gimmick in some ways, although very seriously intentioned, but one that works like this: a middle aged white man, who also happens to be a writer and commentator on race, \\"blackens\\" his skin with medical pigmentation procedures and stain. It all sounds quite rudimentary, but it appears that this combination allowed him to pass for a black man for a period of about six weeks in the deepest parts of the American South. He actually switches back and forth between white and black society over that period, and the differences in treatment are astounding, but also expected.While this is a useful part of writings of the 1960s race issues, I could not help feeling that the plight of the black race was deeper of course than Griffin was able to go: he could always opt out of his situation and reappear as a white man. While he experienced some of the feelings of hopelessness and violation that was part of the daily life of the black person in 1960, he also could escape it at any time. This book is arguably superficial in that respect since it deals with race on an emotional level - how Griffin felt, how people felt about him, what he experienced while temporarily black. While this is a valiant and noble effort, I doubt that anyone who has not completely walked for a lifetime in the shoes of a race victim can truly feel the impact of racism. I say this as someone who is white. In the end, I admire what Griffin set out to expose, and he probably has done much good by so doing, but the impact to me was considerably less than from reading Wright or Ellison."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"John Howard Griffin, after convincing a doctor to make his skin darker using a combination of pills and tanning beds, lived for a month in various places in the South as an African American. When this book, which is essentially his journal of that time, was published in 1959, I imagine this was groundbreaking and also extremely controversial. Griffin's simple descriptions of the way he is treated as a white man and the way he is treated as a black man speak volumes about race relations in our country.By its nature, the book/journal meanders a little, but I found Griffin's musings after the story is publicly known particularly thoughtful and incisive: \\"The mail poured in, hearteningly favorable and moving. Most people in other areas, including the Deep South, understood, though the situation remained uncomfortable at home. Our townspeople wanted to 'keep things peaceful' at all costs. They said I had 'stirred things up.' This is laudable and tragic. I, too, say let us be peaceful; but the only way to do this is first to assure justice. By keeping 'peaceful' in this instance, we end up consenting to the destruction of all peace - for so long as we condone injustice by a small but powerful group, we condone the destruction of all social stability, all real peace, all trust in man's good intentions toward his fellow man.\\"Recommended for its unique and interesting perspective on the lives of Americans."},{"Title":"Black Like Me","review":"Being a Black man and reading this and not having lived during that time period, I now understand my parents generation and my grandparents as well. People tend to get caught up in the idea that this was only the South. The issue is that the South was the worst place you could be. People who often write reviews neglect the fact that Black people experienced these things all over the country to varying degrees. Of course there were no Jim Crowe laws or Whites only signs but subtle racism or hidden racism can sometimes be worse than the blatant. At least in the South my ancestors knew where they stood and if they fought the system, they knew who to fight.With that said, this has tremendous bearing on today's African American. You cannot excuse the crimes of 50 years ago as simply history. The affects on my granparents and parents generation has played a major impact on what is happening today both with Black people and White.

It had me hooked when the first few pages contained some very cool concepts: Super beings looking in on a collapsing universe and rooting for the hyper-evolved intelligences contained therein to achieve a sort of godhood--I'm loving all that. Somewhere near the middle I realized with dread that the author was going NOWHERE with any of it.The book changes reality frames so randomly and often that I just couldn't believe any of it. That kind of thing can work if the author lays the groundwork to make it feel plausible (so masterfully done in John C. Wright's \\"The Golden Age\\"), but Broderick just doesn't bother with the legwork. The tech is never explained or even differentiated from fairy tale magic. The characters hardly have a chance to interact before they're hurled off into another reality and have to deal with it. It's hard to get involved with any situation when you know the carpet can be pulled out at any second.If someone asked me to explain the plot I really couldn't tell them. It's one of those books where a bunch of stuff happens and the characters react to it. The main character certainly has no plan other than exploring and scoring with babes, and the superintelligent players of \\"the game\\" NEVER explain what \\"the game\\" even is. This is actually what kept me slogging throught to the end. Surely he'll tell me what \\"the game\\" is since that's the very reason the characters even exist. But I guess that was asking too much. I had a feeling it involved apposing the \\"K-machines\\", but the book pretty much ignores that angle in favor of jumping around \\"Sliders\\" style.Most frustrating of all was the main character who I grew to hate passionately. He gets hurled into a multiverse of super beings and acts like he's at a neighborhood barbeque. He NEVER asks the kinds of questions an actual person would. At the rare occaisions when he gets a chance to talk with friendly characters I'd be mentally screaming at him, \\"Ask what the hell is going on, you fool!\\" but he always managed to find other distractions more important than the things crucial to his survival. By the end I was rooting for his death. If we had a Darwin award for fictional characters, he'd be a shoo-in."},{"Title":"Godplayers","review":"Godplayers is an extremely energetic and engaging novel, one in which the author is obviously having fun, and just as obviously a work by a writer who knows and loves the SF field.The main action of the novel follows a young man from Australia named August Seebeck. His parents disappeared, presumed dead, when he was a boy, and he was raised by relatives, in particular his Aunt Miriam and later his Great-Aunt Tansy. He comes home to Tansy's house after herding cattle in the outback, to find that she claims dead bodies have been showing up in her bathtub. She's a bit dotty, and works as a psychic, so he tends to discount this, and goes to wash up. And naturally a dead body shows up soon after, carried through the mirror by two women, one of whom, Lune, is sufficiently beautiful that August is drastically smitten despite the unfortunate circumstances of their meeting. Especially when he notices that she has the same curious metallic design in her foot that he has. But Lune and her companion inform him that they will have to wipe his memory, and out comes the \\"green ray\\"...Mysteriously, the memory wipe doesn't stick. Quickly August is involved in some very strange doings indeed. He tries to follow the mysterious women through the mirror, and in very rapid order indeed he is jumping from universe to universe. It soon comes clear that August is part of a family he has not suspected (the other members have significant names like Maybelline, and Juni, and Marchmain... see the pattern?), and that the family is engaged in something called the Contest of Worlds.And so the novel goes, recomplicating again and again, as August desperately tries to make sense of things, to find his Aunt Tansy, and to learn the secret behind his new family and his parents' disappearance. He's also trying to forge a relationship with the beautiful Lune (one that develops perhaps just a bit implausibly quickly). In the process we visit numerous parallel worlds, and several different \\"levels\\" of the universe -- mostly based on real (if perhaps not precisely mainstream) physical theories. It's all great fun, very fast moving, clever stuff.The afterword mentions as influences Fritz Leiber and Roger Zelazny. \\"Destiny Times Three\\" is the Leiber story Broderick mentions, while the obvious Zelazny parallel is Amber. And indeed the novel recalls those writers a bit, as well as perhaps Charles Stross' new series that has also been compared to Amber, The Merchant Princes. But Broderick's work is not simply hommage, nor is it derivative -- it is original SF that happily nods to its precursors. And it is, put simply, purely fun, and at the same time intriguing speculative SF."},{"Title":"Godplayers","review":"After reading the last hundred pages of this mess of a book, I am slowly attempting to reassemble my sense of coherence. It will no doubt take some time and some therapy to do that...along with perhaps some gallons of fruit punch drunk in sight of a midget. Does that make a great deal of sense? Of course it doesn't--as does the book GODPLAYERS. There are so many self-contradictions, acts of illogic and downright reams of rants that the book gets lost in itself. Then there is how the book is so full of itself that the plot gets lost in the sauce. The lack of sense and sensibility in this book is enough to make a grown man scream for his mommy--or another glass of fruit punch.Now, a glass of the red stuff down my gullet, let me try to at least begin to make sense of the senseless. This book begins with a young adult-ish character named August--muddling through life and living with his aunt. Corpses start appearing in the aunt's upstairs tub. The aunt disappears in one of the least coherent two paragraphs ever to appear in a science fiction novel. August takes it upon himself to use the mystical hieroglyph-thingy on one of his ankles to pull an Alice-in-Wonderland stunt and ends up dealing with a hoarde of incestuous flesh-robot relatives that have as much sense in the head as Paris Hilton and Britney Spears combined: a group of space-faring, metaphysics-ranting, zebra-hunting, gourmet-cooking psychotics who seem more obsessed with fashion and etiquette than they do in dealing with the threat at hand due to some never-defined contest. Oh, did I fail to mention that this book switches between the first-person narrative and third-person for no good reason other than variety? Again, this barely begins to make sense as a plot--if there WAS a plot. Even after drinking a liter of fruit punch--the powerful red kind--it does not make too much sense.Not only has the plot been beaten into a senseless melange, but it also moves at a truly constipated pace. So what happened after August meets his relatives? What happened was pointless. After the first hundred pages, the book steeps into a drool-inducing series of chapters with August and his inbred flesh-robot-clone relatives doing nothing but wining and dining, ranting about the multiple universes and mucking up big time. Some other critic hereabouts said to not skim. Guess what? A person could chop out the middle hundred and forty pages and not miss much. In short, the plot progression hits a major blockage for the center of the book. I ought to give away the equally pointless ending just for that...including the fact that the main character dies a pointless death and is resurrected to find out that a pet is a petty god or something.The book's plot was senseless; the book's progress was constipated... On top of that, it should be noted that the writing style fails. The language is nearly incoherent to anyone who didn't take any philosophy or physics cognate courses at the college level. There is little to no neutral narrator to actually explain the drivel. There is very little in the way of a narrator at all. No, the writer of the book pretty much just let the characters talk their trash without bothering to make a great deal of sense about it. It generates the impression that the writer himself probably did not know too much about what was going on--not that much was happening in this book at all.If anything, this is an example of what happens when a person acts without forethought--or at least without a plan. GODPLAYERS is an example of a book written without an outline. Now I have heard of people doing such things, much as I have seen an Internet video of someone dressing up like banana, shouting \\"LET'S ROCK AND ROLL!\\" before setting himself aflame in front of his videocamera-holding relatives--expecting to be unsinged. A decade or so before this act of astounding human wisdom, there was also a movie director some years ago who made movies without scripts. I remember one of his films somehow involving ninjas, midgets and a triple-decker birthday cake... Then there are the irate Neanderthal husbands who insist that they can navigate hundreds of miles of highway without maps. The book GODLAYERS is nowhere close to being as amusing as setting oneself alight in a banana costume or making movies with midgets fighting triple-decker ninja birthday cakes, but it maybe makes just about as much sense. Now I'm off to consume the remainder of my red fruit punch before some psychotic robot clone-girl with hairy legs threatens to wipe my memory. Better yet, I wish that she would as so I could forget this book all the more sooner."},{"Title":"Godplayers","review":"I don't have to understand every single scientific principal in an SF novel, and I certainly didn't understand the ones in Godplayers!

In the \\"story\\" (and I use that term loosely), the young slacker protagonist finds himself mixed up in a violent mess of clashing universes, as he has some vague connection with an annoying group of demigods (who are also somehow his lost interdimensional relatives) who are in a videogame-like grudge match called \\"The Contest\\" in which multiple universes are played like chess pieces. This is a fairly serviceable premise, and Broderick gets a few points for ambition and creativity, but his construction of the ensuing \\"story\\" is nonsensical to the point of pomposity.Broderick's unbelievably amateurish method of creating suspense is for the other characters to refuse to explain things to the protagonist until finally doing so, obscurely, near the end of the book. And not only is that amateurish, it doesn't even make sense for this book's plotline, as the other characters need the protagonist's help in their epic battle. If you desperately needed someone's help, but he had trouble figuring out what the problem was, wouldn't you explain everything to him precisely and immediately? You have to wonder if Broderick himself even knew what was happening while he wrote this claptrap. But don't despair because the amateurishness continues unabated. The characters nonchalantly fail to ruminate on all the vast implications of their violent multiversal struggle (which nobody else even notices, by the way), characters understand their own words after they say them, and vague subplots and entirely new concepts keep popping up before the significance of earlier ones are explained - all with diminishing connections to the main storyline.And regardless of all of the above flaws in logic, this book is a rapidly deteriorating mishmash of disconnected explorations that subsume the already directionless plot. Broderick goes absolutely nowhere with contrived big ideas on cosmology, cyberpunk, alternative philosophies, programming languages, and even Norse mythology - not to mention the lifelike robots, talking animals, conspiracy theories, and mystical ancient tomes. All the while, the characters converse in faux-ironic loquaciousness and frequently interrupt their eternal struggles with over-described gourmet wining and dining. And Broderick didn't even try to wrap up this \\"story\\" in one book, as we have to (not) wait for the sequel to get even basic explanations of how all these characters and settings originated. Illogical storyline construction, nonsensical character interactions, disconnected subplots, and a hodgepodge of malnourished philosophical musings do not make a novel. Not even for a veteran. A high school creative writing workshop student would flunk for this.

Its sequel K-Machines came out a year later, and I am reviewing the two together because I suspect they are intended to be one novel split in two.For me the most delightful post-modern intertexuality in Godplayers is the fact that the book intertwines two of Broderick's short stories - one very recent (\\"Schrodinger's Catch\\", from Agog! Fantastic Fiction) and one very old (\\"The Disposal of Man\\"[1], which you can probably only find if you stumble upon a copy of the early short story collection A Man Returned, of which I have a first edition from 1965, published by Horwitz Publications Pty. Ltd.) The latter story begins:\\"Every Saturday night,\\" said Aunt Tansy, her eyes wide and blue and honest, \\"there's a corpse in my bath.\\"The main plot of Godplayers starts out remarkably true to this sweet juvenile short story: August Seebeck comes home from some time-out in outback Australia and his Aunt Tansy (who's looked after him since his parents went down in a plane crash over Thailand) tells him he can't have a bath because of this inconvenient fact. August is a little perturbed by this, but while Tansy is a bit odd (she's a remarkably effective psychic) she's very down-to-earth, so August decides to camp out in the bathroom and see what happens. What happens is that a beautiful woman climbs in through the impossibly high window, carrying a corpse, followed by another woman. And so the adventure begins.When I first read \\"The Disposal (of) Man\\" I thought of it as a piece in the vein of Philip K Dick or early Heinlein, but from reading the novel's afterword it may be that Roger Zelazny and Fritz Leiber were more direct influences. In any case, neither of the Broderick source stories are credited in the novel, which is a shame. The afterword does list a considerable number of influences, however, including cutting-edge science galore. The story zooms through alternate worlds, and August finds out he's a member of a very powerful world-striding family participating in a world-spanning Contest, the details of which remain fuzzy. In fact, a lot remains fuzzy and for much of the time August irritates the reader by storming out of the room or interrupting characters' attempted explanations, wanting nothing more than to jump back home and make sure Tansy's alright. Fortunately he's head-over-heels in love with the beautiful woman, Lune, who's a member of a different family of Players (but on the same side), and this along with his developing realisation of his powers keeps him mostly on target. Things only get more complicated as the book progresses, and as is a danger with Singularity fiction (see Charlie Stross's hilarious Tough Guide) it becomes hard to see what differentiates the awesome weapons, destinies, birthings-of-Gods (or Angels) and so on from fantasy. To be sure, there's lots of mind-bending scientific speculation here, and the underlying Big Idea of a computational cosmos is one that hasn't been explored in such an audacious way before, but it is hard to work out where to place the book (although perhaps not so hard in the context of its sequel).In the end what it is is a perfect piece of Damien Broderick: post-modern sf to a T, with resonances of everything from Lewis Carroll to Charlie Stross himself (see his continuing Merchant Princes series), Shakespeare to Eliezer S. Yudkowsky, the kabbalah to the tarot. Broderick knows his stuff, and it helps if you know some of your stuff too. Still, it's a honking great yarn even if you're not up on the latest in computational physics, AI and neuro-linguistic programming. Anyone who's enjoyed just about any science fiction from the last century is likely to be taken in by this tale.By the end of Godplayers, the reader still remains considerably in the dark. There's a big, strange (although not unexpected) Deus Ex Machina, and the whole Contest is merely sketched in the background. Meanwhile a very bizarre book keeps turning up, called SgrA* - and eagle-eyed readers recognize the excerpts as a pulled-apart version of \\"Schrodinger's Catch\\", one Broderick's strangest and most evocative pieces. Does SgrA* stand for the Sagittarius A* radio source, associated with the galactic centre? Or is Sgr an abbreviation of Schrodinger? Why is this book a sacred text for the K-Machines, the off-stage villains of the Contest? These questions lie on rather different levels, but they're only half-answered by the end of the book.And that, of course, is where K-Machines comes in. It pretty much flows on directly from Godplayers, and it's worth reading the two together, if possible. There are nice structural devices that hold the two together (Godplayers starts with a framing chapter which is mirrored at the end of K-Machines, for instance), but there are also distinct differences. In particular, the excerpts from SgrA* in K-Machines are quite unlike those from Godplayers; in these ones we get a spread-out biography of someone who could be an alternate August, unaware of his nature as Player in the Contest of Games. This subplot has many, many potential meanings, some of which I'm sure I've missed: its early sections could be mutated from Broderick's own life, and have a wonderful down-to-earth Aussie veridicality to them; and indeed its later sections have the same ring-of-truth as they follow their viewpoint character into an increasingly stranger future - and there's the second meaning to these sections, because they follow this timeline's progress towards a Singularity that may or may not ever eventuate. What else these sections may mean is undoubtedly tied up with the gradual revelations of the rest of the book. As August finally (albeit slowly) works out what makes everything tick, various meta-mysteries are explained for us, the readers, as well. And also intercut between these sections and the main narrative are a series of \\"Exegetical Analects\\", sort of Zen dialogues from the K-Machines' perspective, which may well explain a lot upon a second (or third) reading.I'm not sure whether it's because I read K-Machines some 9 months or so after Godplayers, but for some reason the sequel feels like a more mature, stronger book. I look forward to re-reading the two at some stage, back to back. These are very dense pieces of work, and the frequent humour and riffs on juvenile adventure sf shouldn't be allowed to obscure this fact. All of Broderick's strengths are on display here, and the SgrA* sections in both books contain many very fine passages of writing. There's a lot of fun to be had unpicking the threads of intertextuality through the books too (Arthurian legend being one of the more obvious references); names are very carefully chosen, and little significances often explode in the careful reader's brain scant pages before they are made clear.Those familiar with Broderick's earlier works will be amused by his further adoption and adaptation of favourite themes here (apart from the already-mentioned short stories). The Judas Mandala (a book which made a huge impression on me as a teenager, and is credited with the first use of the terms \\"virtual reality\\" and \\"virtual matrix\\"), The Dreaming Dragons and The Black Grail also featured humanity juxtaposed with another \\"species\\" (whether mechanistic or reptilian), battling for dominance of the universe, rewriting history as they go. The Sea's Furthest End, meanwhile, features cosmic Players for whom reality is a circular (but evolving) game. These earlier works also draw extensively on stories as diverse and powerful as Hindu mythology, and the myths of Oedipus and King Arthur (for starters), while also extrapolating the most cutting-edge science and philosophy of language available to the author.In 1998, Russell Blackford wrote a fascinating chapbook called Hyperdreams: Damien Broderick's Space/Time Fiction that explored the threads that link Broderick's writings together. Methinks it's time for an update in the light of these two novels: if The Black Grail inverts the expected position of human/Arthur/Excalibur as hero, Godplayers/K-Machines perhaps goes further, questioning the dualisms (human/machine, hero/villain etc) themselves. In any case, taken as a single novel, Godplayers/K-Machines is a formidable work that will reward multiple readings, a fecund gift to fiction geeks and science geeks alike.[1] Actually, the author mentioned to me in an email that this was intended to be titled \\"The Disposal Man\\" but both on the back cover and inside my edition it's got the unnecessary \\"of\\" in the title."},{"Title":"Godplayers","review":"At the beginning, I really thought I was going to enjoy this book. Sure, it was self-referential, name-dropping the Matrix, Sliders, Men in Black, etc., which seemed to be a forecast that the reader could expect some similarities to those works. Will this be too much of a copy, I worried. I needn't have. Because in those stories, something happens. In this book, well... The main character is August, who discovers that there are multiple universes besides his own and that he belongs to a family of people who are, dum-dum-duh! Players in the Contest of Worlds! And then, for the next 200 pages or so--I admit I only made it to 216 out of 328 pages; this is the only book in years that I have not felt like finishing--August does a whole bunch of nothing. His family constantly hints about the Contest and their roles in it, with frustrating frequency, but never quite actually share anything substantial.For all its modern science and references, the dialogue and plot remind me of some of the more over-the-top cheesy drama of E.E. \\"Doc\\" Smith or early Heinlein. Sort of golly-gee chauvinism, with people falling in love (and bed) at first sight, big man protecting little woman who is actually a rocket scientist, but she kind of likes it when he acts like that... You get the picture.The Contest of Worlds bit, from what I gleaned of it, reminds me much of Moorcock's multiversal war that is clearest in his Blood/Fabulous Harbors/The War Amongst the Angels trilogy. But unlike in those books, where we witness the war between factions that runs throughout the multiverse, in this book people mostly just talk about it.Bottom line: This book was not my cup of tea. If you enjoy pages filled with what sounds like cutting-edge physics and philosophy, this book might fit your tastes. For me, I need a little more action and a little less 30's-era attitudes with my sci-fi philosophy. Maybe I should watch the Matrix again...."},{"Title":"Godplayers","review":"Broderick tries to be original with his idea of idea of godlike beings stuck in weird dimensions, but his writing comes across as forced and his characters are overall not very interesting. Read Roger Zelazny's Amber series if you want to see the same idea done by a better writer (although with fantasy and not science fiction aspects)."},{"Title":"Godplayers","review":"I love books where someone discovers that they are way more important than they have ever imagined. I suppose that says something about me yet I'd rather not dwell on it. Anyway, this book is great, funny, fresh. Many of the sci-fi concepts in this book have been used by others before, and he brings them into use again. The note from the author at the end basically says it's a shame we throw away these little chestnuts of sci-fi ideas.Despite the sense of humor and adventure, and what feels like a rather intellectually staisfying journey, it starts to feel like the author is simply beginning to create a big list of concepts from other books he liked and throw them at the main character. At the end of the book, neither the reader or the main character has a clear idea what is going on. An evil race of machines, the K-Machines, is constantly referred to but rarely encountered, without a big showdown.Perhaps this book will have a sequel, and the author doesn't want to reveal the complexities of the world he has created for the hero. Or perhaps this book is a patchwork of other books and there isn't a deeper level than that.Whatever the case, I enjoyed following the bewildered hero through a wacky mutliverse, and this book is leaps and bounds better than its current \\"Zelanzy inspired\\" competitor on the new bookshelf, \\"The Family Trade\\"."},{"Title":"Godplayers","review":"This book was too short. Literally. It seems as though Mr. Broderick ran out of space to write, and tried to compress highly complicated material into a single volume in order to get to a \\"tying off\\" point. That said, I still enjoyed this book immensely.The characterizations are deft and fast-paced. It wasn't long before I was completely wrapped up in these character's lives - and that's what kept me going through the last third of the book.Without too much of a spoiler, let's just say that Mr. Broderick explictly states his indebtedness to Mr. Zelazny's _Chronicles of Amber_. If Mr. Broderick had expanded this work (and the explanations of the backstory) across several volumes, I'd call it equal. As it stands, _Godplayers_ is a worthy tribute, not quite meeting perfection, but standing far above much of the offerings of the field."},{"Title":"The Best of Finnish Cooking","review":"Hi Taimi!

Mr. DeVos is a highly respected person of impeccable character whose message of freedom and hope is becoming more acceptable to business leaders worldwide. The DeVos and Van Andel (co-founder of Amway) families have quietly become two of the wealthiest and influental families in America today. Their philosophies of fufilling financial obligations to one's family, friends, charities, etc, through helping others acheive their goals is refreshing. Although not an active Amway Distributor myself, I can't help but marvel at the number of media-driven attacks on Amway Corporation. This company, through the vision of both it's founders and distributors, is THE model for today's company attempting to balance an innovative spirit with corporate and social responsibility. This privately-held, debt-free, multibillion dollar corporation has put billions of dollars into the pockets of hard working people worldwide.

Rich Devos has a huge heart and he is more generous than most, for he is willing to share with the world what beliefs and habits put him into the positions that he is at now. Rich Devos has been able to help milliions of people find hope and rekindle their dreams by using a direct selling method that many other companies alike can only wish they had. This book has great stories about success and failure alike, for one does not come without the other. If you are looking for a book with strong priciples and beliefs then this is the book for you. I would recommend it to anyone building an amway business or not, simply because of what it will teach.

This is largely because they aren't fulfilling a higher purpose with their businesses, they're simply out there trying to survive in the often cutthroat business world. DeVos explains what it takes to make your business a positive force in the world; &quot;positive&quot; by virtually any standard.Contrary to a lot of advice you may have heard out there on how to successfully build a prosperous business, DeVos claims that integrating compassion for your fellow man with lucrative opportunities is the real secret to security and happiness. It's the knowledge that what you're doing is making a difference that makes you feel worthy of the privilege and comfort of wealth. And even before the wealth comes, having a compassionate attitude along with sound business acumen (which can be learned) goes a long way towards increasing your chances of attaining wealth and influence.A great book written in a language anyone can understand.

I suppose I'm always on the lookout for new ways of doing things and new ways of thinking. \\"Compassionate Capitalism\\" provides some real meat for a hungry world in need of just that - new ideas. Economics is a complicated field (so I've been told - I'm no expert), yet Rich de Vos has managed to demystify it, at least as far as this reader is concerned. His ideas seem to be free of any real political ties or religious taints (religion doesn't enter into the book at all) - he seems just to be genuinely interested in people (I wish I couldn't hear the sneers, but unfortunately I do). I also admire him as an American. Goodness knows America has the driving force and energy to influence the whole of this world one way or another, but it doesn't really seem to have the will (nor, perhaps, the imagination) to do anything really creative (sure they have introduced fuel efficient motors - a relative concept at the best of times - but have you seen the size of the 1999 and 2000 models? ). So learning that there are ideas out there which do not just mean more of the same, and bigger and meaner (whether from the auto industry or the rest of the military-industrial complex) is somewhat reassuring.One thing I'm sure of: every American (those who can read) should digest this book.

Thankfully, he does not go far back to the days of Emperor Constantine and the Byzantine Empire.The book centers on three Greek heroes, Kapetan Zaharias, Kapetan Nikolopoulos and Kapetan Barbitsiotis. These brave, Greek patriots were pivotal in the role they played before and during the war. He covers their background, their family lineage, and some of the major battles they fought. It is a very personal book and well documented. My main concern is that it could have used better editing. In spite of this, I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Years of Silence Are Past: My Father's Life with Bipolar Disorder","review":"This is one of the best books on any topic I have read lately. Anyone who knows anyone with a psychological problem (that's all of you with a pulse, by the way), should read The Years of Silence are Past. The title refers to the silence that descended on Stephen Hinshaw's family in the face of his father's bipolar illness (manic-depression). The book is so resonant because countless families with a mentally ill family member live with the same deafening silence. Hinshaw manages to tell the story of his father's battle with bipolar disorder in a compelling, compassionate, unflinching way while also communicating clearly and thus educating about this devastating illness. This book puts a human face on a problem that is too often still stigmatized in our society. I hope this book will help put an end to the collective silence that amplifies the stigma and associated pain for people with mental illness and their famlies. I also hope it leads people with mental illness to seek and benefit from treatment."},{"Title":"The Years of Silence Are Past: My Father's Life with Bipolar Disorder","review":"As the other reviews here accurately explain, this slim volume encompasses much more than an insightful look at how his father's long-misdiagnosed mental illness affected the author and his family. That would be quite enough.Yet, while some scholarly writers have one idea and puff it out in volume after volume, Dr. Hinshaw deftly delivers much more than the title suggests, weaving autobiography and biography, this country's checkered history in diagnosing and treating bi-polar disorder, the genetic and environmental factors of brain disorders, personal insights and scientific data, and much more.That Dr. Hinshaw pulls this off so cogently and compellingly for the layperson strikes me as remarkable, given that he is a highly respected academic, clinical scientist, and professor who chairs the prestigious department of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley.As a lay volunteer in the AD/HD community, I first learned of Dr. Hinshaw through his contributions to a landmark study on ADHD in children. In my experience, it is rare to find a psychologist who can help the average person bridge the knowledge gap between behavior and neuroscience, and I am grateful for this window to understanding.This is the first in Dr. Hinshaw's outstanding trilogy examining stigma around mental illness--and how our society might go about easing it. The other two books areThe Mark of Shame: Stigma of Mental Illness and an Agenda for ChangeandBreaking the Silence: Mental Health Professionals Disclose Their Personal and Family Experiences of Mental IllnessGina Pera"},{"Title":"The Years of Silence Are Past: My Father's Life with Bipolar Disorder","review":"Stephen Hinshaw demonstrated exceptional courage and scholarship in this passionately written portrayal of his father's struggle with bipolar disorder. Blending scientific perspectives with personal insights, Hinshaw provides a tour of his father's obstacles and triumphs. It is a compelling story about the far reaching implications of severe psychopathology yet it is firmly rooted in inspiring messages of hope and resilience. Hinshaw somehow manages to find the appropriate &quot;voice&quot; with personal accounts narrated within a larger context of science, philosophy, and public policy. It is exemplary in its passion, analysis, and vision for the future."},{"Title":"The Years of Silence Are Past: My Father's Life with Bipolar Disorder","review":"This is an excellent book that anyone interested in bipolar disorder or mental illness in general should read. Hinshaw is an excellent writer and brings the details of his father's struggle with bipolar disorder richly to life. The effects of the disease on his father's entire existence are profound and complex- many details and nuances of the illness are described. The book is partly an indictment of the entire mental health field for not providing better care for his father. An interesting and complex read. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"The Years of Silence Are Past: My Father's Life with Bipolar Disorder","review":"Picked up some valuable insights from the author's experiences, views, and recounting of his father's life. Much of it was quite dry and wordy (written by a Professor) so it took a while to get through. Inevitably, his father's story is tied to the history of diagnosing and treating bipolar and schizophrenia. I found this interesting. I was intrigued and inspired by some ideas...such as the importance of speaking openly about such things so as to destigmatize it. it was helpful to me to see that his father had been driven to psychotic states, identifies himself as \\"a psychotic,\\" but had also managed to live a useful life. The author's conclusion that medication can help manage symptoms (not cure the disorder) and may not stop an episode but make it manageable...well I appreciate that insight very much. It helps me to frame my own goals for my life. I wish i had read this book 15 years ago. I have never been in the severe states as the subject...but have experiences a degree of them. For the author to take the time to tell his story and conclusions is a great gift. My only criticism is that it isn't an easy read...it often feels like a textbook, extremely clinical and at times overly scientific. As a layperson just looking for that most personal recounting it's a challenge. Worth it to wade through but at times I had to force myself to plod along and finish."},{"Title":"Biomedical Photonics Handbook","review":"Biomedical applications of light are expanding dynamically. This handbook does a good job of organizing a mass of information on dozens of cutting-edge technologies. The articles by leading experts are aimed at professionals but do not, in most cases, require specialized knowledge to understand. The clear graphics appropriately support the text, while the chapter bibliographies are extensive.So this handbook can be recommended to any scientist, medical doctor, engineer, or graduate student in this or related fields.However, this book suffers from certain flaws that it shares with many other English-language books in this field. Scientists in Russia and other East European countries are very competitive in certain areas of biomedical photonics. They lead the world in the centrally important field of low-intensity laser therapy (LILT). Yet the book's discussion of biophotonics and its almost totally monoglot bibliographies do not come close to incorporating their findings.Even the sole article on LILT states that it will not discuss whole body responses to this therapy. Why not? They are very relevant in a handbook of this sort.What's more, this article omits any mention of Biophotonic Therapy (Photoluminescence, Quantum Hemotherapy), the treatment of the blood with a low-intensity laser via an intravenous waveguide or, in extracorporeal mode, with UV and visible light. The reader would never learn from this handbook that thousands of practitioners throughout the world use Biophotonic Therapy every day for a wide range of indications. The mechanisms of BT are well characterized, and more than 400 scientific articles and a dozen books are devoted to BT's clinical track record.These are unfortunate omissions in an otherwise admirable handbook."},{"Title":"Environmental Ethics: Duties to and Values in the Natural World (Ethics And Action)","review":"Environmental Ethics, by Holmes Rolston III, represents one of the most thorough and provocative works in the field of environmental philosophy to date. In addressing the essential question of the intrinsic value of the natural world Rolston is laying the groundwork for a new understanding of humanity's place in the world. Beginning with the simple premise of responsibility, Rolston argues that it is the duty of all humans by virtue of our existence as reasoning beings to protect and conserve the biodiversity and environmental health of the plant. This vital responsibility is intended to inform, not only for our relationship to the world vis a vis own consumptive needs, but in a way that enriches the existential potential of, not only all other forms of life, but the nonsentient ecosystem as well, i.e., mountains, sky, rivers, oceans, earth and rock.The importance of this kind of radical subjectivity is that it represents the necessary acknowledgement of the interconnectivity of all being. You may be asking yourself, but what does this mean to me as an individual, and why should I care about deforestation taking place in a remote part of the world? The answer Rolston, puts forth is both complex and elegant, in which he argues that the individual values of nature cannot be isolated, due to the inherent connectivity, in a simple pragmatic approach to life. Because since the earth is one great system of interrelationships, with all of the individual constituents relying upon the others in order to function. Thus, if one part is disturbed or destroyed, for example the elimination of predators such as wolves and bears in a forest, there are serious repercussions that will eventually effect the entire ecosystem from, from the overpopulation of deer, increased spread of disease, loss of habitat due to overgrazing, which results in increased starvation of wildlife and the eventual loss of biotic diversity. These are things that are not apparent at a glance, nonetheless they do represent some of the most serious problems facing the health of the Earth, and it is precisely these nondescript consequences that makes understanding these relationships so important.In Environmental Ethics, Rolston puts forth a new ethical paradigm that responds to this void in our consciousness. By illustrating the vital importance and necessary interplay between of all aspects of nature, and the aesthetic, economic, religious, recreational, scientific, historical, cultural and dialectical values that nature represents for humans this book offers many important insights useful to addressing today's environmental crisis."},{"Title":"Butterflies of Southeastern Arizona","review":"Basics: 1991, softcover, 342 pages, 90 species in color, nearly 300 species in b&w;, no range mapsCovering the southeast 1/6 of Arizona, this book illustrates and comments on nearly 300 species either found here or are suspected, possible, or claimed to occur here. Including two counties and portions of four others, this book focuses on a unique geographic area known for both its butterflies and birds.As noted by the authors, this black-and-white book is meant to be used in tandem with other color field guides. All of the southeastern butterflies are illustrated with multiple (usually two) b&w; photos. The two photos are typically dorsal and ventral and often of male and female. Four color plates showing dorsal views of 90 species are included in the appendices. The b&w; photos create some difficulty with identification of some species, especially the blues and skippers where the shading and hues of the colors are important.The text for each butterfly varies from one paragraph for vagrants to half a page for the expected species. Four categories are typically offered for each butterfly, which are: General, larval foodplant, flight period, and distribution. I've found the very brief descriptions mixed into the \\"General\\" section to be a bit too sparse at times and lacking sufficient comparative information between similar species. As an example, the only description offered for the Mylitta Crescent is \\"the nearly uniform orange DS ground color is usually diagnostic.\\"The format and content of this book seem to be a cross between a reference and a guide. It will be welcomed by more engaged butterfly enthusiasts but might be a little less friendly to a novice when trying to identify an unfamiliar specimen. This book certainly is a solid reference on AZ butterflies - and, the first to do so; however, I would recommend the more recent book, Butterflies of Arizona by Stewart and Brodkin if identification is the key focus.I've listed several related books below...1)Butterflies of Arizona: A Photographic Guideby Stewart et al.2)Butterflies of North Americaby Brock/Kaufman3)The Butterflies of North Americaby Scott4)Butterflies through Binoculars: The Westby Glassberg5)National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Butterflies"},{"Title":"Butterflies of Southeastern Arizona","review":"Butterflies of Southeastern Arizona is an extraordinatilly complete and well researched guidebook to the butterflies of this rich and diverse area.

You won't get anything useful out of it except how to ask a patient to open or close their mouth. Most of the phrases taught here will be useless in a real dental office visit, and for some reason they added menus and information about fiestas as page fillers. It's really my fault for buying a book on dental spanish that wasn't even written by dental professionals.

It has more information on Audio and Video than most in-depth books on either respective subject. It is well-written, easy to read, and the explanations are detailed, yet easy to understand. He could have left out a little of the THX bias, but it is understandable, everyone lets some personal bias slip a little now and again. Note-he does admit many manufacturers of the best equipment and best values on the market do not participate in the THX program for various reasons. This book cuts through almost all of the misinformation this industry is notorious for being saturated with.

It was written just as DVD's were coming out and Dolby Digital was an emerging, but as yet, unestablished standards, but the author's views and forecasts of these products have been right on, so there's not any misinformation.He clearly favors high quality equipment over mass merchant stuff (e.g. Rotel over Pioneer), but doesn't provide specific opinions or guidance on individual brands or pieces. The author merely suggests what to look for in a quality AV equipment (e.g. binding posts for speaker connections on receivers rather than simple push clips), then suggests that you read reviews in his magazine, Fi. &lt;I>This review refers to the first edition.&lt;/I>"},{"Title":"Home Theater for Everyone: A Practical Guide to Today's Home Entertainment Systems","review":"For someone who is new to A/V and Home Theater and wants to ramp up the initial learning curve quickly this book will come in very handy.

At the back of the book Harley provides a fairly comprehensive glossary and scattered throughout are warnings for what to watch out for when looking at various specifications. However if you are looking for really in-depth information this book is not the place to look and I'm not even sure such a book exists.

Updated for the latest technology (e.g. THX Ultra 2 - 7.1 discrete channels), this book is pretty much all you need to help you through the complex maze of today's home theater. Not only did it help me understand the technology for the front projection system I'm design for a dedicated home theater system in the basement, it helped me understand more about my current HT set up. For example, I *finally* was able to fix that persistent buzzing noise that appears intermittently for the past several years in my front and rear loudspeakers. I also learned (to my great horror!) that my DVD player wasn't set up correctly, so all these years I thought I was listening to Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound (unless I was watching a rare DTS movie), I was actually listening to it in Dolby Surround! My gosh, a few menu items to change on my DVD player and my system went from sounding pretty damn good to completely awesome!If there is anything missing from this book it's that I'd like to see a chapter on room design (e.g. room size, recommended projection screen size for viewing distance, more information on acoustic treatment, etc.) Otherwise, this is all you'll need for understanding all those home theater magazine reviews. Make sure you get the version that's been updated for 2002!"},{"Title":"Home Theater for Everyone: A Practical Guide to Today's Home Entertainment Systems","review":"Home Theatre for Everyone? Well, maybe. I didn't like the fact that the author ignored the reality that most \\"home theaters\\" are actually dual-purpose living rooms, family rooms or bedrooms, and are not dedicated rooms that can be set up according to exact specifications. In this sense, the book is less than \\"A Practical Guide.\\"This book did not include discussion of using direct-radiating speakers (normal speakers) as surround speakers rather than dipolar or bipolar speakers. I'm quite certain that most home theaters are using direct-radiating speakers as surrounds, but this is not addressed and is not shown in the speaker setup diagrams.I also found it extremely annoying that the author would say things about how certain speaker or component companies produce inferior products, but then refuse to mention names! Example from 'Build and Sound Quality: How to Spot Overpriced Underachievers': \\"The company that makes Speaker A is marketing-driven. They don't care what the speaker sounds like, only that it offers perceived value and sells in large quantities.\\" And in that same section: \\"Speaker B is made by a company founded by dedicated enthusiasts who strive to create the best-sounding speaker possible at a given price level.\\" Now how is that helpful? I'm guessing that the Speaker A company is an advertiser in Robert Harley's home theater magazine and he doesn't want to [make them mad]. This book would be so much more valuable to someone new to the hobby if they were told which brands to avoid and why (but I guess that wasn't the author's objective).One last problem I found was that the author would quote very specific prices or price ranges for certain components, but not mention that this was \\"as of December 1999\\" or even \\"2000 prices.\\" Someone reading this book in a few years (or even now) could be very misled by this. Example from 'How to Choose a DVD Player': \\"Budget machines start at about $200, with most players falling in the $400-$600 range.\\" Obviously, a mass-market electronics product such as a DVD player is going to fall in price over time, and in fact budget players now go for $99.99, with most players falling in the $150-$300 range.Despite the few flaws mentioned above, this book is actually a very good, detailed introduction to the world of home theater. I was especially impressed with the descriptions of the various audio formats that exist (which can be confusing), and also with the discussion of front projector technology.Note that this is the 2000 edition which is probably fine to buy through the year 2001 or so (since relatively recent technologies such as progressive scan DVD players and DLP projectors are discussed), but the book will probably be showing its age and due for an update by 2002."},{"Title":"Home Theater for Everyone: A Practical Guide to Today's Home Entertainment Systems","review":"Robert does have an opinion, and he's entitled to that. He believes VHS tapes should not be THX-approved, and, along that subject, shows strong favoritism for the THX home program, although many excellent home theater brands do not participate in this program that tends to cause great confusion in the industry. I also believe that Mr. Harley should have included set-up diagrams which could at least help clarify some possible confusion and frustration in initial home theater set-up.

He provides a lot of good down-to-earth facts and keeps it going with his opinions and backs them up too! He is experienced and should be concidered an expert. I am hoping one day he writes a book (hint hint)on recommended system configurations (including brands/models) for room sizes. He provides a wealth of system configuration suggestions already just needs to put some models (besides the pictures) of what is recommended to that configuration. As an example, I would like to see that if you have a 15 x22 standard room and want a 5.1 configuration, name the top 5 receivers with the top speakers for the fronts, center, rear surrounds, and a sub-w layout.

People are not generally ambivalent regarding Dr. Falwell; they either hate him or love him. Those who knew him loved him. Those who hated him hated his influence and what he stood for; but most never got to know the man. This is the story of a man who was first and always simply a pastor at heart. It is a man who dared to dream big dreams and believe God to bring them to past. Liberty University, the largest Evangelical university in the world, is a living testimony to his dreams. Anyone who has visited Lynchburg, VA where he made his home knows the impact this man had on the community where he lived. That is the probably the greatest testimony to his life; that those who really knew him, loved him and were better because they knew him. This is a fascinating book about the life of one of the greatest men of the 20th century and I guarantee you it is not what you are expecting. Whether you loved him or hated him you cannot deny the impact his life had on this country. Liberty University, the largest Evangelical university in the world, social programs too numerous to count, the famous Elim Home for Alcoholics, and the Liberty Godparent Homes for unwed mothers are just the beginning of a living testimony to his dreams. Few men have touched so many in their lifetime; and left a legacy that continued to touch future generations. He was the also the founder of the Moral Majority which gave birth to the contemporary \\"Religious Right\\" in this country, a force every politician now has to contend with. An individual cannot be a cognizant student of 20th century America without reckoning with the impact this man's life had on this country. I have heard it said the true measure of a man is the number of his enemies. If that is true then Dr. Falwell is one of the great men of the century. How much do you really know about Jerry Falwell? He did not come from a legacy of faithful Believers. The history of the family he grew up in is a tale of violence, atheism, illegal bootleg whiskey during Prohibition, dance halls, bars, illegal cockfights, and murder. Jerry speaks honestly about his family and his own personal struggles that were part of his journey in life. Have the courage to leave your preconceived ideas behind and come know the man, Jerry Falwell; learn what made him the man he was and what passions burned in his soul. Don't accept what you have been told; you owe it to yourself to know who this man was for yourself and to know why he was who he was."},{"Title":"The presidency of James K. Polk (Library of the presidents)","review":"Polk is frequently ranked in the top third of US presidents. The years of his presidency fall between Jackson and Lincoln - a period where the presidents around him were generally considered among the worst in history. Polk clearly learned lessons about management and control from the failures of Tyler before him and these lessons led to a most effective presidency. While sectionalism begins to tear apart the preceding presidency and those that followed, the Polk presidency sees a chief executive who manages to be in charge of events during his 4 years. This book was a good read about an import man in a dangerous and exciting time and perhaps a lesson in not promising only to serve one term."},{"Title":"The presidency of James K. Polk (Library of the presidents)","review":"There are too few treatments of one of America's most significant presidencies, that of James Knox Polk. A friend asked \\"what was the deal about Polk\\" while I was reading the book. The answer is: \\"well, do you like the American Southwest and Washington state?\\" Polk was responsible for both being gained for our country in their present forms.Bergeron's book is a good academic telling of this most significant of times. Arranged by major topic, his biography covers the crisis with Mexico and the war; the crisis with Great Britain over setting the boundary of the Pacific Northwest; the cabinet members Polk chose and worked with (significant because at the time the precedent was for presidents to govern with and through their cabinets; giving secretaries much greater veto power over issues in their sphere than now exists), his relationship with Congress and his emergence as a politician.Polk's fascinating political personae as well as the personalities he had to deal with are well described. Particularly on the Texas question, the war with Mexico and the negotiations with Great Britain, the reader is given a very good step-by-step picture of the cabinet debates and perspectives surrounding the president's eventual courses of action. I came away feeling the author had researched the topics thoroughly enough to present a fairly complete picture of all three crises; allowing the reader an enjoyable bird's-eye view as the action unfolded. The details of life as a mid-1800's American president are also told. It is hard to imagine in this day and age a president holding twice weekly office hours for any person to visit with their problem (or more often request for office) or cabinet meetings in an age where secretaries had to be dealt with as their own political forces through wooing, placating and managing. In these details, Bergeron helps to paint a presidency that has disappeared but also an environment that exerted strong influences on the way a president executed his office.This is very much a political-presidential biography. Although a chapter does try to capture his essence as a man, the focus is squarely on the pivotal four years in which he came to epitomize manifest destiny and draw our map to something that would be easily recognized by today's Americans.The work is told in somewhat of an academic style. For a student of history and politics, it is a fascinating story. One gains a sense of the issues Polk confronted as well as the issues he helped create and successfully dealt with. This is a well documented and enjoyable treatment of a president more should know."},{"Title":"The presidency of James K. Polk (Library of the presidents)","review":"Looking at the structure of the United States in the twenty-first century, your first impression of the presidency of James Polk would be that he should be ranked in the top five presidents of all time. In the short span of his single term in office, Texas was annexed, Mexico defeated in war and the entire American southwest minus the relatively tiny Gadsden purchase annexed and a treaty splitting the Oregon territory between the United States and Great Britain finalized. The area taken from Mexico after their defeat alone is 2/5 of the territory of the continental United States. However, while the Louisiana Purchase under Thomas Jefferson is consistently mentioned in classes in American history, Polk, the architect of the greatest expansion, is rarely mentioned.Part of this is Polk's own personality, as he is commonly portrayed as a humorless man who seemed aloof from his political peers. His time in office is also considered to be the point where the sectional differences that led to the civil war began in earnest. Both are mentioned and downplayed in this book. While he personally could have been much more sociable, given the strong political personalities of that time, it is unlikely that it would have made a difference. Bergeron is quite correct in emphasizing the strained relationships that Polk had with people like former president John Quincy Adams, and congressmen Henry Clay and John Calhoun. These were powerful men who represented deeply held sectional interests and who had dramatically different visions for the future of the country.Given the force of the western expansion of the United States, it was inevitable that the only thing that could stop it was the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, the war with Mexico was probably an historical inevitability and once the territory was acquired, it was also inevitable that the question of slavery in that territory would be raised. Therefore, the argument that Polk's policies led to the great break between the states is nonsense. Bergeron takes a position against this nonsense, but it is not made as forcefully as it should have been.One point about Polk that was not made and that should have been included deals with the comments of Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant. In 1848, Lincoln rose in the House of Representatives and delivered a fiery speech against Polk. In it, he accused Polk of being a liar, abusing his power as president and assuming the role of a dictator. As he was slowly dying, Grant, who was an officer in the American army during the war with Mexico, said Polk forced the United States into an unholy war against Mexico. He considered the destruction of the civil war to be \\"God's punishment for Polk's sin.\\" Neither argument was necessarily correct, but their status as being involved in the war and president means that they should have been mentioned.I consider this book to be an honest appraisal of the presidency of James Polk and first read it over five years ago. I recently made the choice to read it again because it is a case where a successful war planted the seeds for widespread destruction twenty years later. At the time I am writing this review, the United States is one year into the invasion of Iraq, a war that has generated rhetoric similar to that of Lincoln's. Many experts on the Arab world have argued that a victory now may lead to a much greater disaster later. I don't quite agree with that, but certainly consider it a possibility. Without question, like the presidency of Polk, that of George W. Bush will largely be measured by the consequences of an aggressive war launched despite a great deal of opposition and dubious points of justification."},{"Title":"The presidency of James K.

It seemed to me though that the author, who wants to be complimentary of Polk and his presidency, has a difficult time being consistent with his appraisal.

He remarks that Dreyfus is not a computer scientist. This is true. But many 'cognitive scientists' aren't either, cognitive science being an interdisciplinary pursuit engaging philosophers, psychologists, linguists, neuroscientists, anthropologists and sociologists. It is unfortunate that Dreyfus allowed himself to polemicize by using the word 'alchemy' to characterize his opponents, but he has, by far, been the victim of unargued diatribes against his work. The fact is: most of the salient issues in cognitive science are logical and conceptual, NOT technological. Here, Dreyfus broke new ground (although I would have preferred his treatment to have been more Wittgensteinian than Heideggerian). Phil Agre's brilliant book on computation and human experience (Agre IS a computer scientist) shows that SOME AI-workers have found aspects of Dreyfus's work very telling. But, of course, the issues are, again, not empirical but logical in this field. See, for example, Graham Button et al., &quot;Computers, Minds and Conduct&quot; (Polity/Blackwell, 1995) which picks up where Dreyfus left off. Shallit remarks that Dreyfus has been 'refuted': where? by whom?The fact is that cognitivism is hotly contested by serious thinkers in many disciplines, but Shallit's name-calling (and the comparison of cognitivism's serious critics to creation scientists) smacks of an abdication from serious engagement and argument.Dreyfus's revised edition is a fine piece of work, worthy of serious intellectual discussion and confrontation. His many aarguments against Fodor, Chomsky, Simon and others have great merit. It is unfortunate that some folks simply close their eyes and argue from authority. But appeals to (even 'scientific') authority wear thin when left to stand alone!!"},{"Title":"What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason","review":"This is an absolute classic that everyone interested in or working in AI should have read. It is one of the very view books on a computer related subject that is over 25 years old and still useful today. That alone might tell you something. I find it interesting that many AI-workers seem to be actually afraid of this book. They should not. It may give the reader a far better sense on limits, use and future of AI work.I would also recommend this book to people outside the AI world and who are interested in what role the digital computer may play in our lives. But the book is not about bits, so if you don't like technical mumbo-jumbo, this is still a book for you.The book is very well written. Some readers may find it a difficult book, as it also contains some philosophical issues. But some readers may find themselves in a bookstore asking for the work of Wittgenstein or Heidegger and actually understanding what they read (and like what they read) after having read this book.I have only one complaint. The introduction to the 1992 MIT Press edition is in fact an afterword. It assumes that you already are familiar with the history of the subject. So, if you read this book, you should start with the Introduction to the 1979 edition instead and keep the Introduction to the MIT Press edition definitely for last"},{"Title":"What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason","review":"It goes without saying that this book remains a landmark in the history of AI research: a sobering antidote to all the research hype.But what a patchwork it has become. Every ten years, the book has a new section and a new introduction bolted on to it. But not just bolted on to the end, or on to the beginning.No reader is given an easy path through the text: neither the reader who is new to the material (and who wants to read through the text in chronological order), nor the reader who has read the previous incarnation of the book (and who wants to pick up just the new parts).The message of the book, too, is unfortunately weakened by its subjective stance, and its invocation of the personalities from the debate.However, the book still remains a refreshingly different contribution to the world of AI research, an important warning, and a greatly worthwhile read."},{"Title":"What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason","review":"I first read Dreyfus' critique of AI back in the 1970s, when I was an undergrad studying computer science. At the time, I rejected Dreyfus arguments, believing, as did most AI researchers, that all we needed to do to create a true artificial intelligence was a fast enough computers and enough information about objects, symbols, and representations. From that, intelligence would arise from the \\"emergent properties\\" of the system.A few years later I was a grad student in cognitive psychology, and thanks to my cognitive studies and a careful reading of Wittgenstein's writing on language, my opinion of both Dreyfus and GOFAI (good old fashioned AI) had changed radically. Meaning is not just labels and symbols. As Wittgenstein observed, meaning can only arise from a shared experience, something that a machine and a human cannot have- at least given our current level of hardware.The AI community has since come around (largely) to accept most of Dreyfus' critique, while never actually acknowledging his role in shaping the aims of AI, so the AI or cognitive sciences student reading Dreyfus today may wonder what much of the debate is about. But this is a book that all AI and cognitive science students about read, both to understand how the AI paradigm changed between the 1970s and the present, and to get a better idea of the philosophical issues that Dreyfus raised that still are salient today."},{"Title":"What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason","review":"I would love to see a working \\"HAL\\", and still hope we progress in the development in AI. However, the discovery of a General Problem Solver has always been elusive, and never matched the corresponding development for the raw physical abilities our computers now have. Why is that? And why is this still true?Mr. Dreyfuss attempts to answer this with a refreshing accountability of the scientific method. He compares the historical development of AI to the theoretical expectations, and apparently not without resistance. He manages to challenge the \\"salesmanship\\" of following trends, and thus avoiding assumed results.The book provides many examples of its logic, and carefully draws the conclusions. When I first read it I was tremendously impressed with its (if I may) \\"insights\\". I feel it is a must read; not just for those in the AI world, but for those interested in the scientific method as well."},{"Title":"What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason","review":"Dreyfus' book is about the history of failure of Artificial Intelligence researchers such as Marvin Minsky to embody intelligence at the human level. It is easy to read, but is rather exasperating. It is like riding in a truck driven by Minsky, and other AI researchers, where they are trying to make a long trek across a country without roads. They keep getting caught in swamps, blowing tires, and hitting trees, all the time shouting &quot;We're almost there!&quot; Meanwhile Dreyfus is a dog in the bed of the truck continually barking at dangers, and the folly of the drivers. Amidst Dreyfus' continuous cacophony of sarcastic cynicism there are some important points on what assumptions are doomed to failure, which he made quite clear by tedious repetition.Basically there are two types of mistakes made by Minsky and many others:1. believing they were getting close to understanding human thought,2. repeatedly announcing same to the world.The philosophy of Dreyfus in the first 300 pages is largely concerned with fallacious assumptions made by AI researchers. Finally in the last 50 pages (350 page book) he settles down and gives us some interesting concepts that should be understood if we are to seek AI at the human level. He develops the concept of &quot;nonformal behavior&quot; - which we humans usually learn by generalizing examples and following intuition without use of formal rules. Examples: chess at the gestalt master level, and disambiguation of broken sentences.Dreyfus acknowledges the possible importance of neural network architectures, but dismisses them as outside the scope of his critique. He touches on the poor idea of AI trying to program a full functioning adult, and further carries out a critique of machine learning (&quot;reinforcement learning&quot;).The most important point he makes is that of nonformal behavior -- the non-logical almost Zen-like process that humans must go through. The irony is that we have to struggle with our nonformal thinking to do simple formal tasks such as long division; whereas the computer must struggle with its built-in hard logic to attempt nonformal tasks such as pattern recognition.The book is for the most part quite dated, but nevertheless, it is very worthwhile reading for anyone in a serious pursuit of machine intelligence. My criticism of his style is just that. I have only a minor criticism of the intelligent content and his restrictions in scope."},{"Title":"What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason","review":"Berkeley Professor Hubert Dreyfus assesses the predictions and subsequent failures of artificial intelligence from its inception in the 1960's with innovators like Turing to the present day with a detailed and honest account of why higher level AI is impossible. After evaluating the history of AI's minuscule progress, Dreyfus provides a compelling analysis of human intelligence, drawing on the philosophies of Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and Merleau-Ponty in order to demonstrate that higher level cognitive faculties are not reducible to computational representations. This book is an important reversal of commonly accepted assumptions within the cognitive sciences, from linguistics to psychology. It is also an important example of why the cognitive sciences would benefit from paying greater attention to the achievements of contemporary European philosophy."},{"Title":"What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique of Artificial Reason","review":"Mr. Shallit, in a previous review, sounds exactly like a throwback to the previous era when glorified computer technicians started to take themselves seriously and bestowed upon themselves the bogus title of \\"computer scientists\\". When Dreyfus critique of strong AI came out they were enraged that someone was trying to punch the air (and as it turned out it was full of hot air) out of their over inflated clown balloon. After decades of sheer nonsense, and of confusing metaphor with the real thing (their preposterous proposition of the \\"complexity critical mass\\" for intelligence is akin to thinking that a sufficiently complex computer simulation of an atomic explosion will actually explode: I guess we should all be really worried...) strong AI proponents just gave up. Now they are much quiet and many have given Dreyfus some concessions after being proven completely wrong (old habits die slowly).

I suppose this is because it combines the agonizing aspects of history with the frightening notion of critical thinking and argument analysis. However, &quot;The Canon and its Critics&quot; is an excellent step towards making philosophy clear to the average college student. The book is very broad and complete, and a reader could easily feel as if he's grounded himself in every aspect of philosophy. From metaphysics, artificial intelligence, epistemology, ethics, and political philosophy, The Canon and its Critics attacks the most pressing problems which plague today's perception of philosophy. This book is excellent for the intelligent student who wishes to learn philosophy as it should be learned: in a complete, detailed, and historical as well as modern aspect.The book can be difficult to read; but this is through no fault of the authors. The styles of some of the great philosophers can be overwhelming at times, which is why the book may be difficult as a stand-alone source of knowledge. In a classroom setting, it is invaluable. A student can be content with his teacher's explanation of the text, or he may read further to truly grasp the material as an expert would. The book has much depth, and much can be learned from it. I have had the pleasure of attending Dr. Furman's classes, and can assure anyone that the book was written by a very talented, intelligent man who seems to genuinely enjoy teaching and helping others to understand. I highly recommend this book as a teaching tool.If I were in a position to change this book to better fit my tastes, I believe I would enjoy more writing from the authors, Furman and Avila. Most of the book is a necessary compilation; however, the authors are so talented that I would enjoy a fresh perspective on the information in the form of philisophical commentary. Nevertheless, it stands that the book is excellent as is; no book can completely satisfy the thirst for philosophy.

The story's entertaining and compelling, the characters interesting, but there was, in my mind, one flaw.The basis of the book is that, even before the Native Americans migrated to North America thousands of years ago, a race of supernatural beings called the Shonokins lived there, and a band of Shonokins in modern times want to reclaim their &quot;rightful place&quot; as the rulers of the land. Certainly, the Shonokins' intention to use black magic to rule by force makes them villains, but no one in the book seems to even consider that, when all is said and done, the Shonokins really do have some cause for retribution. No one expects the heroes to sympathize enough with the villains to allow them to win, but a little extra time given to the Shonokin perspective would have made the story even more interesting.

Silver John felt like a reflection of himself, or a re-creation.Those interested in Wellman's best work would do better to read \\"Who Fears the Devil?\\" especially its wonderful inter-chapters.Nonetheless, I will continue to follow Silver John's trail of wonders in Wellman's other books."},{"Title":"Le Francais Courant I","review":"The book is well bound, and all pages are there and in good condition.

The writing is accessible even when some of the concepts are more complicated (gyroscope, UTM vs Lat/Long), etc. I found the sections on navigation in other cultures (such as Micronesia) especially refreshing since so many other books on the topic are limited to a Eurocentric view.by Nadine Slavinski, author ofLesson Plans Ahoy!: Hands-on learning for sailing children and home schooling sailors"},{"Title":"Tools of Navigation: A Kid's Guide to the History & Science of Finding Your Way (Tools of Discovery series)","review":"I am a U.S. Navy Officer and avid offshore sailor, and wanted a book to get my young kids as excited about navigation as I am.

I have even used some of the references and historical facts found in the book as a reference for navigation training on my ship!"},{"Title":"Golden Paradise","review":"I have read most of Susan Johnsons novels and I add this as one of my favorites next to her novel &quot;Forbidden&quot;. I own the first edition which was published by Harlequin which explains why this novel is more discreet in sensuality writing compared to her other novels (Touch of Sin, Silver Flame..). I very muched enjoyed this novel, it was very heartfelt if one enjoys deepfelt love and romance without the interruptions of the hero pursuing &quot;other sexual affairs&quot;. I highly reccommend this book it is rich in Russian and Turkish history (without being heavy) with the witty and beautiful love story of Stefan and Lisaveta that in some parts made me weep and smile."},{"Title":"Golden Paradise","review":"Being of Russian ancestry I have loved every one of S. Johnson's Russian series books. But Golden Paradise wins the prize of all of her books! The love scenes and their profession of love are beautifully poetic. I could see that mountain top hideaway it was described so well. Along with the romance the action and suspense is wonderful. The hero is tdf and the heroine is strong from the first page. Gorgeous book."},{"Title":"Golden Paradise","review":"Usually I pick up a Susan Johnson book expecting loads of sensual scenes and more hot and steamy than romance. With a setting during Russian Turkish wars and with a Kuzan involved even more so did I expect this. Not so with Golden Paradise - this was pure romance - and you truly felt the romance. Lisavitta was a naive young lady when she accidently meets Prince Stefan in the middle of a war. Stefan is on a month long furlough expecting to go back to his mountain retreat and spend days with his Gypsy lover. He is almost irritated when he comes upon and rescues Lisavitta, thinking she is annoying, educated and does not appear to be a looker. Well, is he wrong, back at his palace he finds she cleans up into a diamond of the first water and he immediately seduces her, well she was very willing so not sure who seduces who. Yes, these two start off in lust, but through the next month and fiances and gypsy lovers they spend much romantic quality time together at Stefan's mountain retreat. Lise is fighting her feelings of love since she knows Stefan is a rake and never ever falls in love - in fact since love destroyed his own personal family he fights against any feelings of love. They seperate and he goes to the battle of Kars which is to be the battle to end the war. Lise goes off to St. Petersberg and is presented to court and is a total success. She becomes the darling of court. Word of her success reaches Stefan waiting for the battle to begin. He is outraged and sets on a pace to claim Lise for himself in some manner - he takes off in a rage to St. Petersberg. This part of the book, absolutely is beautifully written, it is so heartfelt, so packed with emotion, I cannot give the last part of this book more of a higher rating! In fact the end of this book is what gives this book 5 stars. THis is a just so emotional. It reminded me of Dr. Zhigavo - the rugged weather, the emotions you can just picture the handsome Stefan. For the first time ever Stefan is allowing his feelings to run his life. There are too many wonderful details to share here as it would ruin this part of the story I believe. But certainly, this is a very romantic book for Johnson. You don't need the erotic scenes because you feel the love between Lise and Stefan. And the dialog between these too, also get very very high marks. So take this book, get your box of kleenex handy and enjoy one of Johnson's best!"},{"Title":"Golden Paradise","review":"I love to know an author actually researches & knows what they are writing about.

The Kuzan family is Russian Royalty, wealthy beyond belief, entitled, worldly and sophisticated. Their stories will sweep you off your feet!1. Seized by love - Prince Nikki's and Alsia's story - year 18742. Love Storm - Prince Alexander's and Zena's story (son of book 1) - year 18993. Sweet Love Survive - Captain Apollo's and Kitty's story (son of book 2) - year 19194. Golden Paradise - Prince Stefan's and Lisaveta's story (cousin of book 1) - year 1877I agree with reading books in order following three generations of Kuzan men; starting with book 1 about Prince Nikki, then reading about his son and grandson. Then lastly reading book 4 about Nikki's cousin Countess Lisaveta and friend, Prince Stefan Bariatinsky. But if you prefer reading books strictly in chronological order, then read book 4 second as it takes place 3 years after book 1.GOLDEN PARADISE (Book 4)Hero: General, Prince Stefan Orbeliani-Bariatinsky/34 years old/Prince-General-playboy/$$$$/black hair/black eyes with golden flecksHeroine: Countess Lisaveta Lazaroff, Princess Kuzan/22 years old/Princess-Countess-scholar/dark brown hair/amber eyes/virginIt has been over two years since I read this book, but the story and its characters have has stayed with me. Prince Stefan Bariatinsky and Countess Lisaveta Lazaroff are, for me, one of the most beautiful, mesmerizing and sexy couples - ever. Typically either the hero or the heroine has a strong personality, but in this book you will find two amazingly strong characters and together they are simply unforgettable!Prince Stefan has everything I would want in a hero. He is handsome as sin, sexy, wealthy, entitled, and successful in his own right - a playboy, a true alpha male hero. It should be noted that several historic people served as inspiration for this book:Prince Stefan's parents and family background was inspired by Prince Alex Bariatinsky's and Princess Elizabeth Orbeliani's liason. The character of Stefan was inspired by General Michael Skobeleff (Mikhail Skobelev) aka the \\"White General\\" who rode in battle on his white horse dressed in white uniform and diamond studded sword so that his men would see him and know where to follow...***It's 1877 and Russian General, Prince Stefan Bariatinsky (friend of book 1) is on a month-long furlough from the Russo-Turkish War. He is riding at breakneck speed through the Turkish desert, heading back home to his mountain retreat to spend time with his Gypsy mistress when instead he finds himself having to rescue Countess Lisaveta Lazaroff.Fiercely independent scholar Lisaveta (cousin of book 1), is traveling through the desert covered up in traditional native clothing and Stefan assumes her to be a bluestocking/spinster. When Stefan realizes that underneath all that fabric is a stunningly beautiful lady his journey takes a detour.Strap on your seatbelt because these two are electrifying together and they have so much to overcome - a malicious fianc&eacute;, jealous mistresses, Prince Stefan's womanizing ways and Lisaveta's determination not to fall in love with a rake. But more importantly, Stefan is the Tsar's General fighting a war and ultimately their story is contingent on Stefan's ability to lead his army in battle. The suspense will keep you on your toes to the very end.***Hero rating: 5+ starsHeroine rating: 5 starsSex scenes rating: 5 starsSex scenes frequency: 4.5 starsStoryline concept rating: 5 starsStorytelling skills rating: 5 starsStory ending rating: 5 stars******************************Overall rating: 5+ starsWould I recommend this series: Yes.Would I re-read this series: Yes.Would I read future books by this author: Yes."},{"Title":"Golden Paradise","review":"Ihad been searching for this book, a part of a trilogy.

It seems they may have tried to organize by subject matter (lion, girl, etc.)but this system is erratic. Secondly, they have obviously not taken into account the market fluctuations due to online auctions. I have seen mint inkwells sell for $250 where this book estimates values at $300-$500. On the other hand, I have seen an estimate of a $200 inkwell selling for $400. These examples are not a &quot;one time&quot; situation, they are consistant.

One thing that distinguished General Kidd throughout his long military career was his ability to 'think outside the box', and come up with original, practical and fiscally sound solutions to problems. He originally showed his skills as a young B-17 pilot who rapidly rose through the ranks of his bomb group. After the war, he continued to rise through the ranks due to his practical problem-solving and leadership skills. When Gen. Kidd retired, he did so as a Brigadier General. In this book, Jack Kidd makes a strong case for the peaceful solution of world problems instead of war. He spells out in detail just how this could work, culminating in what he calls his Starlight Intitiative, and I would not do it justice to try to outline it in a brief review. The final chapter of the book is by far the strongest, and would stand alone in its eloquence and persuasiveness. Now past his eightieth year, this great American has left his nation one final legacy, and it could quite possibly be his most important. He wants to see war as he knew it and fought it rendered obsolete. Don't think it's possible? Read the book first, digest its arguments, and then decide.

This well researched biography reads like a novel. Peter Aleshire presents her as a hero to her people. He researches every battle and skirmish and reveals Lozen's known or most probable role in them. He shows that her warrior exploits took up the bulk of her life.He attempts to write from an Apache viewpoint. I'm not sure if he succeeds, but he does choose Apache sources of information over others, and admits his limitations as an outsider, even as he felt compelled to write this book.This book desperately needs maps and photographs. There are none. Lozen's life criss-crossed much of the Southwest and Mexico. Mr. Aleshire mentions a famous photograph of Lozen without including it in this volume.

I found this book to be well worth reading, as well - it's one of those history explorations that seem to take you back to the time and place of it's account, and spark your imagination to what the life of the people of that time might have been like. I hope more people read this book so that Lozen's name is not forgotten (as so many great, historical women in other cultures are) I would love it if one day her name were as recognizable as Geronimo or Crazy Horse.

A Mathematician Looks at Voting","review":"First, I'm a physicist, so the math was fine for me, but some people might find it frustrating. However, if you're willing to sink your teeth into it you'll get the important ideas.Second, Saari's insights into the role of symmetry in three-person elections are beautiful. He shows that even if none of the three (or more) candidates can beat all of the others head-to-head there is still interesting information present. When resolving cyclic ambiguities (George beats Bill, Bill beats Ross, Ross beats George) Saari's mathematical insights may be quite useful.However, I have to take Saari to task for his criticism of Approval Voting (where you simply indicate yes or no for each candidate). He points out that the Approval winner cannot be predicted based solely on people's preference orders (e.g. I might like Ross better than Bill or George, and Bill better than George). Saari sees this as a defect, because \\"anybody could win.\\" Approval, however, makes use of different information. Which of those candidates pass your threshold? Vote yes for all that you find acceptable.Seen in this light, Approval is a perfectly rational policy.Also, Saari doesn't think too highly of the Condorcet criterion: If one candidate can beat all others in one-on-one contests then that candidate should win. It is true that sometimes no candidate meets that criterion, and in those cases Saari's analysis provides important insights on how to resolve the situation. However, sometimes there is in fact one person who can beat all others one-on-one. In that case, no amount of analysis can change the fact that the Condorcet candidate is preferred over all others, and should win.Finally, Saari gives short shrift to strategic considerations. If everybody is honest his analysis gives excellent advice on running elections. However, his methods have loopholes that voters and candidates can exploit, trying to get the best outcome even if it means indicating an insincere preference order.Ultimately, the study of elections has to balance two different approaches: Understanding what the people want based on the info they give, and understanding whether the system gives them incentives to give insincere info. Saari has great insight into the first part, but he doesn't seem as interested in the second part."},{"Title":"Chaotic Elections! A Mathematician Looks at Voting","review":"Saari has put together a small but useful book on the trickiness inherent in voting and the potential paradoxes that can get minor candidates elected. In races with more than two candidates, the method of vote counting is extremely important, and it is possible that by changing the counting process, you could have any candidate you want winning. Theoretically, an election could be rigged without a single dishonest vote.The obvious solution is to choose the counting method before the election, not afterwards, but there are perils to watch out for nonetheless. Saari goes into depth about these dangers.This depth often gets very technical, something Saari is up front about. Less than half the book is really aimed for the lay reader; the remainder is aimed more towards mathematicians. Nonetheless, I recommend this book for everyone interested in the democratic process; even if you can't get into the math, there are still enough important insights to make this book more than worthwhile."},{"Title":"Chaotic Elections! A Mathematician Looks at Voting","review":"This book makes some of Saari's most important research into the mathematics of voting accessible to a general audience for the first time. Personally, I greatly appreciate this book. With very little math background, I have tried in vain for the past year to comprehend some of Saari's research articles, with the assistance of a math professor. The result was very little comprehension, and a lot of headaches. This book has, for the first time, enabled me to understand some of the things I had struggled with in vain for months, and greatly increased my comprehension of many of those things I saw only dimly before. I thank the author for the mercy he has shown towards me, and similarly interested readers of his work.At this time, Saari seems to be the world's leading researcher in the mathematics of voting and group decision making. While most of the general public, in the US at least, has remained almost entirely ignorant of the paradoxes of voting, mathematicians have recognized and struggled with them for centuries, since they recognized that the widespread rule that 'a plurality shall elect' can result in the election of the voters' least preferred candidate; for example, when there are 3 candidates, the plurality winner may be a candidate who is the last choice of up to two-thirds of the voters. Saari's recently published research papers, which resolve many of these profoundly difficult mind stumpers, and the recent US Presidential election, not to mention the begging and pleading of mathematical simpletons like myself, combined to motivate Saari to write this book.If you are at all interested in having your vote properly accounted for in everything from selecting your group's next officer, to future national elections, I recommend this book to you. I guarantee that you will learn something worthwhile from it.Let me add one last personal note for Wisconsin readers. I am briefly cited in this book in regard to the use of an alternative to the plurality voting procedure, called the 'Second Choice' procedure, in state primaries of Wisconsin's 'Progressive Era.' The use of such alternatives in the history of Wisconsin, and other states, proves that such electoral reforms are actually possible, given a sufficiently educated and motivated electorate. Saari has done the analysis, and made it accessible. Now, it is up to us to educate ourselves, and other voters, and then, in the light of our newfound knowledge, to demand more democratic election procedures.Also recommended: Principles of Electoral Reform"},{"Title":"Chaotic Elections! A Mathematician Looks at Voting","review":"Saari's book, as he states in the title and his introduction, is very mathematical. This does not bother me; my own background in science gives me strong enough math to handle this book, though more purely social-science-oriented people may find the book too heavy on the mathematics to help them.The book analyzes a number of voting systems, and makes a good case for his point that the procedure of casting and counting votes will often determine the result more than the actual preferences of the voters. And he comes up with some conclusions with which I agree: the weakness of approval voting (though his reasons for disliking it differ from mine) and the insufficiency of Banzhaf's method of calculating power in a weighted voting system, for example.But he generally makes one assumption which does not adequately reflect reality. This assumption is that an ordinal sequence of preference is an adequate representation of a voter's wishes (and that, in consequence, how much a voter prefers candidate A to candidate B is measured by how many candidates are between them on a list of preferences). In fact, with enough candidates in a race, there are bound to be several that a voter likes almost equally well, others that a voter dislikes equally well, and probably others about whom the voter is indifferent (possibly because he knows nothing about them!) Thus, there may be a huge gap between a voter's opinion of, for example, his fourth and fifth preferences, while he may like the fourth one almost as much as his top preference. As a result, Saari ends up favoring a system, the Borda count, which gives absolutely equal differences between the values assigned to consecutively numbered preferences, with no recognition (at least until the next-to-last page of the book!) of the idea that voters' preferences might not work that way. And consequently he fails to see the great advantage of cumulative voting (if one has enough votes!) compared to a Borda count. This is the one serious weakness in Saari's analysis.At a couple of points, Saari points out that (in an election with enough candidates) if you want to assure the election of a candidate, you can design the election procedure to yield that result even if the candidate actually has little true support. In a sense, Saari does the same in the question of choosing the best voting system. He obviously favors the Borda count, and thus emphasizes the criteria which will make the Borda count score high (and de-emphasizes, or even declares valueless, criteria like the Condorcet criteria that the Borda count violates); other criteria might point toward other methods. But this methodology is subject to the same objections that he raises to some voting procedures!"},{"Title":"An invitation to arithmetic geometry (Graduate studies in mathematics)","review":"Arithmetic geometry, a subject of vast importance both in mathematics and in applications such as cryptography and telecommunications is defined in this book as essentially the study of the solutions of polynomial equations in n variables with coefficients drawn from a ring, where this ring is typically the integers, the rational numbers, or the integers modulo a prime. The author gives the reader a fine overview of this subject that he views as a kind of \\"unification\\" of number theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry.Most importantly, the author emphasizes that this \\"unification\\" is based on analogies between these areas. That these are only analogies will become readily apparent as the reader is exposed to such concepts as the dimension of a ring and the tangent line of an algebraic curve. The dimension of a ring is not analogous to the notion of the cardinality of a basis of a vector space, as some readers might expect, but rather is analogous to a measure of the complexity of the ring. Fields are considered to be \\"simple (i.e. have dimension zero) while principal ideal domains are more complex in that they have dimension equal to one. On the other hand, the concept of a tangent line to an affine curve is very analogous to what is found in elementary calculus, involving taking the familiar partial derivatives.The author gives historical motivations throughout the book, especially for such core ideas as the integral closure and the ring of integers. Readers are expected to approach the book with a good background in modern algebra, with familiarity with such concepts as field extensions and the field of fractions. The field of fractions is exemplified in the book for example as the field of rational functions of the ring of polynomials in one variable.The integral closure of a ring is motivated as a ring that arithmetical properties that are \\"most like\\" the ring in question, with emphasis based on understanding the roots of monic polynomials. If the ring is a principal ideal domain (PID), then its integral closure is not necessarily a PID, but it does have the property of unique factorization of ideals. Also, ideals in the integral closure of a PID are finitely generated. This motivates the notion of a Noetherian ring, wherein every ideal is finitely generated. Thus Noetherian rings are analogous to vector spaces with a basis, and this fact makes them much easier to study.A \\"geometrical\\" analog of integral closure is obtained by studying nonsingular plane curves. In algebraic geometry a plane curve is defined by an irreducible polynomial in two variables, where the polynomial is monic in one of the variables. Taking the integral closure of the ring of polynomials in the remaining variable in the function field also gives this curve. The connection between the ring of functions and the concept of integral closure is illustrated very clearly in this book by first looking at injective maps from the field of fractions of the ring of polynomial functions on the plane curve. The author shows that this latter ring is integrally closed if and only if it is a Dedekind domain. From the standpoint of geometry, this ring is integrally closed if and only if the plane curve is nonsingular. The author gives some helpful examples illustrating this.In elementary calculus and in more advanced fields of mathematics such as differential topology, singular points are detected by the use of derivatives. In this book, and in algebraic geometry in general, singular points are detected by using the concept of localization. A point of the curve will be nonsingular if and only if the ring of rational functions that are defined at the point in question is a principal ideal domain.Localization is a straightforward concept to understand, and even more so due to the clarity of the author's presentation. Motivating it by the example of the rational numbers as arising from the integers by adjoining the inverses of all non-zero integers, the real interest lies in local rings, i.e. those rings that have a unique maximal ideal. In particular, the localization of a ring of functions at a maximal ideal has a geometric interpretation, namely the maximal ideal corresponds to a point, and the ring of functions localized at this point is the ring of rational functions defined at this point. The point is a nonsingular point if and only if the maximal ideal of the ring of functions is generated by one element.Noted in the examples of integral closure and singular points in plane curves is that the integral closure can be viewed as a \\"removal\\" of the singular point. This is usually referred to as \\"resolution of singularities\\" in more advanced texts and the actual process of removing the singularity is called \\"blowing up\\". The author discusses this process briefly in the book. Readers familiar with the theory of differential equations will recognize the process as being very familiar to the use of Puiseux series to solve these equations. Historically, Isaac Newton introduced the first algorithm for doing resolution of singularities in the context solving equations in two variables. His algorithm has been extensively generalized in the context of the theory of resolution of singularities in algebraic geometry.An entire chapter of the book is devoted to determining which domains have the property of unique factorization of ideals. He proves that such a domain must be Noetherian, Dedekind, and have dimension equal to one. The factorization into ideals is of course a generalization of the usual fact that any integer has a unique factorization into primes. Of great importance in this discussion is the notion of ramification, which will be familiar to those readers acquainted with the theory of Riemann surfaces. The author brings out nicely the fact that ramification in the context of factorization has a geometric interpretation that is very similar to the one in the theory of Riemann surfaces.Also discussed in some detail in the chapter on factorization, which as the author remarks is very important in a subject called class field theory, is how primes factorize in various ring or field extensions. For the case of a Galois extension for example, the ramification indices are equal, as are the residual degrees (the residual degree is the degree of the field extension of the integers modulo a prime p by the algebraic number field modulo the prime ideal \\"above\\" p). The Galois group will act transitively on prime ideals \\"above\\" p. This notion of being \\"above\\" p, is made clearer by his construction of a map from the spectrum of the integral closure B of a Dedekind domain to the spectrum of the Dedekind domain itself. If the latter is denoted by A, then if P is a prime ideal in Spec(A), then the inverse mal of P is a collection of maximal ideals which can be viewed as being \\"above\\" P.In the context of this discussion, and of great importance in areas such as the Langlands program, is the notion of the \`decomposition group' of a maximal ideal M, which is essentially all elements of the Galois group that have M as a fixed point. The author devotes a chapter to this subject to this in the context of discriminants. Also of interest is a normal subgroup of the decomposition group called the \`inertia group.' It is the kernel of a map from the decomposition group to the Galois group of B/M over A/P. The maximal ideal M is ramified over A if and only if the inertia group is not the identity. The author proves the fundamental result that a prime ideal is ramified in a number field if and only if this prime ideal divides the discriminant of the number field.Zeta functions, which not only arise in arithmetic geometry and number theory but also in areas of physics such as quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, and wireless communication systems, are studied in Chapter 8. Of particular interest is the Dedekind zeta function of a number field K, and the author shows how this function is constructed from local information at each prime ideal, how global information on the corresponding ring of integers K can be obtained from the Dedekind zeta function from its residue at a simple pole, and to what extent the Dedekind zeta function determines K (it does not uniquely, but it does allow the determination of the minimal Galois extension of the rational numbers Q that contains K). The author also shows how to relate the zeta function of a projective curve to its associated affine curve. The most valuable discussion is this chapter is how to express the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields to a simple expression involving the zeroes of the zeta function of a nonsingular plane projective curve. This discussion sets the stage for the eventual proof of this hypothesis in Chapter 10.There are many topics of great importance in Chapter 9, which discusses the Riemann-Roch theorem, and the author gives the reader a brief sampling of sheaf theory, the latter of which is of great importance and power. The Riemann-Roch theorem is basically a result that relates the number of poles and the number of zeros of nonconstant (rational) functions on a nonsingular complete curve. The author's treatment of this theorem is interesting in that he uses the language of valuations and the valuation ring to motivate it. It is quite amazing that one can reach the generality that the author does in this chapter without using elaborate mathematical machinery, even though he restricts himself to curves. The author remarks that the proofs could be considerably simplified if sheaf theory is used. It is the opinion of the reviewer that the reader's intuition would probably be sacrificed if this were done at this level.Chapter 10, which discusses the famous Riemann hypothesis is very useful in that it gives a detailed discussion of the Bombieri proof of the Riemann hypothesis for nonsingular complete curves over a finite field (the case for the complex number field is still an outstanding problem). The inclusion of this proof is convenient in that it is understandable and concise, saving the reader considerable time which otherwise might be spent combing through the literature in order to distill the proof to manageable length. In discussing the existence of bounds for the number of rational points on curves over finite fields, the author points to the topic of desingularization of algebraic curves. This topic is of extreme importance to applications of algebraic and arithmetic geometry to such areas as error-correcting codes, bifurcation theory, and cryptography. The desingularization also allows a definition of the genus for singular curves, and the author devotes a few sentences alerting the reader to the fact that the Riemann-Roch theorem does hold for singular curves if the geometric genus is replaced by the arithmetic genus.Although short, the last chapter on \\"Further topics\\" gives and effective overview of some of the exciting developments in arithmetic geometry that were in play at the time of publication of this book (1996). The Langlands program are mentioned, and this area, which could be viewed as a grand attempt to follow the Weil program of unification of number fields and function fields has been subjected to considerable development since the time of publication. Readers interested in conducting research in this area will find this book ample preparation. In Arakelov geometry in particular, readers will put to good use the author's introduction to valuation theory in this book. Arakelov theory allows one to do a kind of \\"unified arithmetic geometry\\" wherein both non-Archimedean and Archimedean valuations are treated on the same footing. A version of the Riemann-Roch theorem for arithmetic curves can be accomplished in the context of Arakelov theory, and the author spends a few pages motivating how this could be done in the context of number fields, and his summary is extremely helpful."},{"Title":"Walk in the Spirit","review":"This lucid and concise book will cause a paradigm shift in your spiritual walk.

Canney explains that he does not seek to replace, but to complement Chapelle's book with its meticulously executed ships' plans. And Canney well succeeds in this goal.All of the ships built for the American navy before the era of steam are covered, most of them in considerable detail, showing the original lines plans where available (it should be noted that due to the age and physical condition of these plans, some lack clear detail). These are supplemented by paintings and, especially for the vessels built after the early 19th Century, photographs. Special attention is given to design and construction considerations, although the full career and ultimate fate of each vessel are summarized. Furthermore, in the course of discussing the individual ships, Canney develops a more general history of design trends and employment.While Paul Silverstone's \\"The Sailing Navy, 1775-1854\\" is a useful quick reference to the ships of this era, Canney's book provides a much greater in-depth look. \\"Sailing Warships of the US Navy\\" does not mean that Chapelle's history is obsolete, but you should make a space on the bookshelf next to it for Canney's volume. This is a book which is truly a \\"must have\\" for anyone interested in the US Navy during the Age of Sail."},{"Title":"Sailing Warships of the Us Navy","review":"We all know the frigate Constitution, but what about other US sailing warships? This book answers it all. I bought it especially for the chapter on ships-of-the-line, although the section is not as big as i would have liked, it was the first time i read accounts of these big ships that never saw action. Every ship has a litte history on it.Missing are the steam warships which are covered in another book by the same author. Only reserve is the focus on seeking the primary source of information, which maybe a noble goal but may leave out some valuable secondary information that we may have liked to see anyway. There are still great pictures, though."},{"Title":"Sailing Warships of the Us Navy","review":"This is a great reference book for naval history buffs. I bought it as a companion to Ian Toll's \\"Six Frigates\\". The many reproduced artworks and line drawings give the reader a clear picture of not just what our frigates looked liked, but also the lesser known 74's, brigs, and sloops.Unfortunately, Amazon's service was a disaster. The first \\"new\\" copy that I ordered from Amazon was damaged (ripped dustjacket) so I returned it and asked for a replacement. The replacement was so poorly packaged that it arrived in worse shape than the first copy. I returned it and wound up buying a clean, used copy from an independent online bookseller."},{"Title":"Sailing Warships of the Us Navy","review":"I am always fascinated by historical importance of ships and how far they've come. This book gives a great historical perspective, but is a little narrow in its scope since it only covers naval ships. I recommend checking out Sailing Ships of New England by George Francis Dow. It has recently been reprinted and is full of wonderful illustrations of the kinds of ships us civilians used to sail."},{"Title":"3e Bccp, Indochine, 1948-1950: 3e Bataillon Colonial de Commandos Parachutistes (French Edition)","review":"A \\"must\\" for any serious historian of the French Paratroops in Indochina, Cyril Bondroit's history of the 3rd Colonial Paracommandos complements both Jean-Pierre Pissardy's \\"Paras d'Indochine\\" and Paul Gaujac's \\"Histoire des Parachutistes Francais\\". But whereas those are broad overviews, more finely tuned in Pissardy's case, Bondroit's work is a combination unit history, veterans' reminiscences, and photo album that tracks the 3rd BCCP from its very beginnings to its tragic destruction along Colonial Route 4 in October 1950, and the aftermath. No aspect of the 3rd BCCP's professional existence is overlooked. Its recruitment, enlisted base, officer base, training, armament, deployment, and employment across far stretches of Indochina, both as separate companies and as a battalion, are meticulously documented. More than a history, it a labor of love. A testimony of respect by a son to a lost father, who survived the 3rd BCCP only to die when the author was 13. This ancillary fact is highly important, as it gave the author intimate access to his father's old comrades and commanders. We thus get insights that they would not have shared with an outsider, and which illuminate the strengths and weaknesses of both the battalion and its legendary personalities. Captain Bigeard's consuming ambition, occasional pig-headedness, and tactical daring. Major Ayrolles' personal war with Captain Escarpit. The high respect accorded by the troops to Captains Cazaux, Mollo and Nguyen Van Vy. The occasional unfairness as some blunder, or mere bad luck, leads to the dismissal of platoon and company commanders. Cazaux' loyalty to the battalion, staying on after his relief and replacement by MAJ Decorse. The deaths of lowly enlisted men, as well as that of a count of France, in combat as well as in accidents. In summary, this book is rich in details that cannot be found in official histories and overviews. Bondroit even includes an opposing commander's point of view. Thus we have a photograph and extracts from an account by Viet Minh Colonel Dang Van Viet of the fighting at Dong Khe after the 3rd BCCP's famous combat jump to recover that post in May 1950. If any criticism can be leveled at this work, it is that occasionally, it goes into too much detail, giving us confirming or conflicting views of minor incidents that a professional historian might have only mentioned. But again, this is minor. Bondroit is a professional graphic illustrator and his talent shows in the books presentation. Maps, photos, cartoons, and drawings all richly illustrate the narrative, making it very easy to follow. If you want to know what it was like to be a paratrooper in French Indochina, this is as close as you will get without actually having served there."},{"Title":"No turning back","review":"About fifty years ago, I knew this author so was very interested in her story. I was not disappointed as I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"A perfect stranger","review":"This is a beautiful story, a smooth read as well as being a very relaxing book. Danielle's art of depicting romance shines through in this story of an much older man being married to a much younger woman. As with real life, in this relationship Raphaella's husband was old and sick as well as dying. She met a man and even though she developed feeling for him, remained loyal to her sick husband and stayed by his side, genuinely loved him.

And more so as the story kept going. The story itself isn't new.. beautiful young woman married to a much older man finds herself tied to him indefinitely as the old man is an no hurry to die after a series of strokes. Then a woman's slooowly developing affair with a young and handsome lawyer and a moral battle between a loyalty to a gravely ill husband and newly found love. I mean, come on! Everything about this book is predictable and boring. The setup itself - woman's rare beauty (are they ever ugly??), rich and noble family, lawyer's career-oriented wife that left him for her career when he wanted babies etc, etc. And to add insult to an injury, the main heroine just can't get a backbone and tell her father to go to hell when he forces her to leave US and come back to her family which means the end of her oh-so-important new love (is it really?). Bleh!!! Don't waste your time like I did, do something meaningful instead or read another book instead.. read reviews first :)"},{"Title":"A perfect stranger","review":"The setting and much of the characterization are great, and parts of the action; but the logic of the plot is awful--three likable people behaving irrationally and giving each other years of anguish through not talking about important matters that they would have been half-witted not to discuss openly.

Coming from Spain she had always had duennas to look after her. At the age of 18 she becomes married to a business partner of her fathers by the name of John Henry Phillips. John is much older then Raphaella and although the marriage is not arranged the father allows it because John Henry is one of this business partners and a great man. John Henry Phillips is her life, he treats her wonderfully and she in turn loves him unconditionally.Her love for John Henry does not die when he becomes incapacitated. She keeps her bounds to marriage very well until meeting a complete stranger. Alexander Hale becomes infatuated with Raphaella. Alex wants nothing more then to make Raphaella happy. As she tries to hold on to her husband she finds herself drifting into the arms of the perfect stranger.While John gets worse Alex becomes more persistent in pursuing Raphaella. She eventually gives in, not forgetting her love for her husband but needing love from another who can interact with her to keep going on. She is struggling for what's right and wrong, to define the line between living and dying.Personal Book Review:This book gets 4 stars from me. It's one of Danielle Steels better books. It's not as pearly as some of her work, but it's not as devastating as others she's written. At the same time it's the same as her classics. It's the perfect balance, something that could really happen.She describes the love a woman for a man that is so strong it can't be broken. The thing's Raphaella denies herself because she is married is amazing. She doesn't attempt to give into temptation until Alex starts pursuing her hard. Even after he tries his best Raphaella can't let go of her husband until he is gone. She is strong but becoming weak with all the loneliness she is facing.The characters and the plot are both very realistic. It would be something awful to go through, but there may be people out there who have seen it happen. I think this is a wonderful book to inspire someone who may be down and out. It makes you think things have a good outcome sometime down the road, even if you have to bend to get there.Other Novels by Danielle Steel:MaliceLeap of FaithDiamondsJohnny AngelHouse on Hope StreetNow and ForeverDating GameLovingOther novels relating to the theme of:Passion's Promise by Danielle SteelOnce In a Lifetime by Danielle SteelTo Love Again by Danielle Steel"},{"Title":"A perfect stranger","review":"This is the greatest book I ever read.

She says Marxist critics had issues with these films for being too \\"decadent.\\" Pasolini's growing disillusionment with Marxism led to his later movies having different styles than his earlier ones: instead of reaching his audience through dramatic social tales of Italian peasants, he tried to convey his themes by playing up the subtle \\"decadence\\" of his earlier realistic films with more over-the-top metaphor and myth.Films that the author discusses include such varying titles as \\"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\\" and the highly controversial \\"Salo.\\" The later films are all quite interesting, as most of them deal with some sort of taboo or controversial topic.A lot of the author's commentary on Pasolini's works deal with his Marxist beliefs and struggles with his religious convictions and sexual orientation.The chapter dealing with Pasolini's film theory writings is not for the beginner in this subject looking for an easy read. Greene gets into things like free indirect discourse, semiology, and linguistics, which can be a little tough to grasp if you haven't studied film theory before.The book also includes a section of 24 pages of B+W photographs, mostly from Pasolini's movies. Overall, this is a good introduction to a complex director, but the chapter on his theoretical writings gets a little technical for the beginner."},{"Title":"Micronesia under American rule: An evaluation of the strategic trusteeship (1947-77) (An Exposition-university book)","review":"I'm impressed with Dr. Nufer's first-hand experience with the islands and the islanders.

On my book cover there is a full and detailed image of Kal Kr&uacute;h, the terrible creature in the story.As I'm in the process of translating this into an audio drama, I shoudl say some things. Merrit comes from a far earlier age, closer to HG Wells, for instance, than Asimov, and this is rather apparent in the voice of the dialogue. It comes a litle too fast in the book to begin with, though there is a way of making the material slightly re-ordered in time to fit modern tastes. Far, far better is his descriptive imagery, and here Merrit easily equals any of the contemporary fantasy authors. Given that he could probably not afford the long drawn out creative proces per book as such, he could no doubt have drawn even larger illustrations of his post 1st world war world of unexplored paradises and mysteries. We probably have enough, though. In this book, Leif, a young adventurer with an Indian companion, goes north after a family dispute to hunt for a while. Finds some strange geography and a confrontation with a single bizarre incident from his own past, something he only dreams about. Read on if you can get the book. Contact me if you can't. I'll be announcing the release of the audio drama in a year or two,"},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","review":"After taking a brief respite--in the hardboiled yet outre crime thriller &quot;Seven Footprints to Satan&quot;--from the tales of adventurous fantasy at which he so excelled, Abraham Merritt returned in fine form with &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; (1932). In this terrific novel, Merritt revisits many of the themes and uses many of the ingredients that made his first novel, &quot;The Moon Pool,&quot; such an impressive success. Like that early work, &quot;Dwellers&quot; features a lost civilization (of the type grandfathered by the great H. Rider Haggard), battling priestesses, civil wars, and otherdimensional creatures (in the earlier book, a light creature; in &quot;Dwellers,&quot; an octopuslike nasty named Khalk'ru that dissolves whatever life-form it touches). In this marvelous fantasy, we meet Leif Langdon, who is hiking through the foothills of the Endicott Mountains in northern Alaska with his Native American buddy. Years before, Leif had witnessed an arcane religious ritual in Mongolia, and been told by the Uighur tribesmen there that he was a descendant of Dwayanu, an ancient Mongolian king. Leif and his buddy discover a hidden valley covered by a freak Alaskan mirage, and meet the golden-skinned pygmy peoples and the Mongolian descendants that reside therein. Before long, in an instance of extreme atavism, Dwayanu takes over Leif's mind and personality, and aids him in his upcoming trials. Leif must eventually encounter a civil war between the valley's inhabitants; the storming of the fugitive city of Sirk; the charms of a witch woman with the most appropriate name of Lur; giant leeches; AND the aforementioned Khalk'ru. The book is just brimming with marvelous imagination and endless wonder, and the reader will never guess what outrageous incidents will pop up next. Merritt was truly at the top of his form with &quot;Dwellers,&quot; and threw in great detail to keep the whole conceit afloat. There are amusing side characters, interesting species of flora and fauna, some historical and metaphysical speculations, and bits of unusual anthropology. The tale proceeds with great drive and purpose, and concludes most satisfactorily, indeed. &quot;Dwellers in the Mirage&quot; has been included in Cawthorn &amp; Moorcock's excellent overview volume &quot;Fantasy: The 100 Best Books,&quot; and I can well understand why. It is a tale that Haggard himself may well have enjoyed, and if you knew me, you'd know that this is high praise, indeed! Seek this book out, by all means; it's a winner!"},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","review":"Simply put, this book is what other writer strive to achieve. It has a little of everything: Fantasy, Adventure, Exploration, Mythology, Romance, and Scientific Theory of the day. Fascinating exploration of what is really in the unused 90% of the mind."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","review":"Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","review":"Well, this is one of those &quot;walk out of the world and into someplace very different&quot; novels, put into an exploration of exotic (to the 1920's person) locals.It ought to be a classic of the Genre, but it seems that nobody reads it and nobody publishes it either. A shame. I'm NOT going to say much, except to beware the monstrous Dwanyu."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","review":"This is surely one of the finest fantasy/lost race novels ever written. Back in 1969 during a parade I ran into a boy of 14 in the crowd and we somehow got on the subject of Merritt. He was an enthusiastic fan and told me that his friends shared the same tastes. He said that there was a paperback bookstore near his school where the kids hung out, and that was the place to find Merritt books. It would appear that in the 42 years since then, this fondness of boys for Merritt has somehow evaporated completely. It is their loss! The style of this book is taut, sparse, no-nonsense. Merritt comes right to the point. The action never lets up. There are two different endings to this novel, one forced on Merritt by his editor, and one by Merritt himself. I read the 1962 paperback and fear that this has the editor's ending, but in any case I liked it. I have no idea what the alternate ending is like. This title was included in Moorcock's list of the 100 best fantasy novels, and it deserves to be there. People whose idea of literature is realistic novels would find this book silly, childish and low-brow, a pulp thriller for teenagers. Well, they are partly right, but those of us who go for this sort of thing must consider this a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","review":"This book employes many of the themes one would expect from a pulp adventure story, particularly one written in the 1930's: exotic locations, treachous villains, wicked cults, bizarre civilizations and two mysteriously seductive heroines - one a Madonna-type the other a witch queen. The hero, Lief Langdon, is handsome, athletic, intelligent and fully versed in survival skills. Regrettable he has a split personality; sometimes he is the reincarnation of the ancient cult leader Dwayanu and sometimes the fearless soldier of fortune Lief. Complicating matters is that Dwayanu has the unfortunate ability to conjure from another dimension a kraken-like being called Khalk're that has a taste for human sacrifice.Lief/Dwayanu is summoned to the land of the Mirage and becomes a troublesome focus point in the conflict of two totally different cultures; one of warrior women led by an exotic witch and the other a race pygmies and their revered human queen. Somehow the author has Lief/Dwayanu become the lover of both ladies!On the surface this story has all the elements of a lurid, dated piece of hackwork. Rest assured Abraham Merritt[1884-1943] was no hack. He was intelligent and knowledgeable of his subject matter but did not neglect the desires of his audience. Certainly this book was written as an entertainment and a grand one it is.Merritt, through the use of introspective asides, ruminates on the issues of scientific explanations for apparent occult manifestations, a familiar theme if your have read any of his other novels particularly \\"The Moon Pool\\".This novel was first published in 1932 and last reprinted in paperback in 1991. It is regrettable that Merritt's novels has not been re-printed and re-popularized like those from Robert E. Howard and H.P. Lovecraft. Fortunately there have been numerous editions of Merritt's novels and many copies are available for sale on Amazon."},{"Title":"Dwellers in the Mirage (Avon Fantasy, S271)","review":"Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort. Well it did feel twisted, but not in a good way.Claus Kellermann2006 April 15Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"},{"Title":"Harvest & Song for my time : stories","review":"Having read this book for a course in American Cultural History, I have learned a great deal from Le Sueur. This book offers a wonderful collection of Le Sueur's views on the social, cultural and economic disparities in America during the late 1920s to around the 50s/60s. Brought up among activists and radical groups like the I.W.W., Le Sueur's strong background and active role in reforming America is reflected in Harvest &amp; Song for my time: stories by Meridel Le Sueur. Her stories show the parts of America the school-age student is not usually taught--the truths of a more conformist, racist America. Le Sueur's standpoint in this collection of her stories and essays portray her personal views in an indirect manner. Rather than using literature to express her personal viewpoints, she basically tells her readers what she sees, with an emphasis on the points she is trying to make. The reader is then left to absorb what they have read to form their own views. Anyone interested in reading &quot;real&quot; history of the United States, including the topics of racism, radicalism, and immigrants in America should read and reflect upon this author's work. Meridel Le Sueur does an excellent job of bringing this not so public view of America to light."},{"Title":"A Bedouin boyhood","review":"Isaak Diqs recounts his early childhood in Palestine prior to the creation of the state of Israel. Poignant story of a people who live close to the land and how their removal from that land disrupts family ties for generations. I have read many books about the political history of the Middle East spanning the last 150 years but this is the only book I have read that dealt with how the tremendous changes that have taken place in the last fifty years have deeply and personally impacted the common people. It helped me appreciate how Native Americans relate to the land and what impact the separation from their traditional way of life has had upon their culture. I recommend this book highly to anyone not only interested in the Middle East but to anyone interested in the tremendous changes all traditional cultures are facing into today's rapidly changing world."},{"Title":"A Bedouin boyhood","review":"Racism works by--and racism consists of--assuming that the despised people are not really people. Racism bolsters this crazy view by preventing evidence reaching them or anybody else that \\"these people\\" are just like them or you or me.Palestinians are almost always characterized as crazy people. This book lightly chronicles a boyhood in rural Palestine in the mid-20th Century: a bunch of relatives, adventures in the rural neighborhood, school, etc., and only tangentially mentions the establishment of the state of Israel that was happening during this time. Suddenly people had to move. That's about it. Maybe the publisher advised against any mention of Israeli affairs as being sure to attract unpleasant comment.So the book is just what its title promises. Donkeys, wadis, tents, cousins, village school, trips to town.

Is doomsday near? How is it that all the best books are out of print? Mencken's &quot;Bathtub Hoax&quot; is one of those books which every educated person should read. That it should be out of print is testimony enough as to sorry state of contemporary culture. Every college Freshmen should be forced to read this book under penalty of law. Why do I take so extreme a position? Simply because there is no better antidote to the maudlin idealism that afflicts so many college students these days. Mencken, always the arch-realist, proves that human beings, far from having any interest in the truth, are in fact determined foes of veracity. What most men want is not truth, but comforting lies. Human beings simply cannot tolerate honesty.That is the trouble with Mencken, and why so many of his books are out of print. Mencken told the truth. For this reason, people (intellectuals especially) can't stand them. They hate it when he pricks their bubbles of illusion and self-deceit. Mencken is also despised for being the very antithesis of political correctness. In fact, it would be no exaggeration to suggest that in today's dismal cultural climate, no &quot;respectable&quot; newspaper or magazine would dare publish his work. Why? Because Mencken had integrity: he wouldn't just write what people wanted to read. That is the main reason why so many &quot;right thinking&quot; people find him offensive. Mencken told the truth, and he is damned for doing so."},{"Title":"The Bathtub Hoax, and Other Blasts and Bravos from the Chicago Tribune","review":"If anyone doubts the sagacity of H. L.

He wanders the world an outcast, with his companion Dubhain, a pooka who appears sometimes as a dark-haired youth, sometimes as a black horse. In a valley where things are somehow terribly wrong, they meet a beautiful young couple who need their help...a couple who may not be what they seem.Though set in a Celtic fantasy world reminiscent ofThe DreamstoneandThe Tree of Swords and Jewels, this book is more like Cherryh's \\"human among the aliens\\" SF, such asHunter of WorldsorForeigner. The aliens, in this case, are the Sidhe. These aren't J.R.R. Tolkien's elves. They are like forces of nature, unmoved by, perhaps even unable to comprehend, the things that are important to mortals. Yet one gets the feeling that they are fond of Caith, in their inhuman way. Poor Caith.Cherryh has a knack for hard-edged fantasy, and it's on fine display here. As inRusalka, magic works in this universe according to rules and limitations that make it seem almost like science. The characters also have more of an edge than you commonly find in fantasy. Cherryh's characters are always interestingly flawed, but Caith and Dubhain are especially so. Caith has had an exceedingly rough life, and has good reason for carrying the chip on his shoulder he does. He's basically a decent guy, but his hot temper and stubbornness often get him into trouble. As for Dubhain...well, he's a dark Sidhe, a pooka whose job it is to take horse form, lure men onto his back, then drown them. Talk about having a dark side! Nevertheless, he has a sort of elemental innocence that makes it easy to forgive his mischief.What Pat Nussman called \\"the magic circle\\" - a situation where a pair of characters are forced to rely on only each other for trust and friendship - is quite literal here. Caith has been damned by Faery, more because of the family he was born to than anything he did to deserve it. He avoids human company for fear of bringing his misfortune on others. Dubhain is similarly damned for the crime of doing a good deed. In a moment of weakness, he rescued Caith rather than drown him, and for this failure, he was bound to Caith by geas. They are each other's punishment...but also friends, as much as human and Sidhe can be. Dubhain is wicked and feckless and not entirely trustworthy, but humans need companionship, and he's all Caith has - the only being it's safe for him to be with. Dubhain is a loyal friend, as much as a dark Sidhe can be, but he's not human, and doesn't live by human rules. He can't give gifts without strings attached; every kindness must be balanced by a cruelty, however small. It's just his nature, and Caith understands this, even as he curses it. They are devoted to each other, but neither will ever admit it. They taunt and tease each other incessantly, using sarcastic terms of endearment more suitable for lovers than friends.This book is a sequel to \\"The Brothers,\\" a story from Cherryh's 1986 anthology,Visible Light. (The story can also be read in the omnibusThe Collected Short Fiction of C.J. Cherryh.) However, the book stands alone. The key points from \\"The Brothers\\" are covered in Faery In Shadow, in flashback. (The events of Faery In Shadow occur five years after \\"The Brothers.\\")Faery In Shadow is one of my favorite books of all time. If the Sequel Fay appeared and gave me one wish, this is the book I'd want a sequel to. Alas, barring such magical intervention, it's not likely. Faery In Shadow didn't get much notice when it was originally published. Cherryh says that her publisher thought it was too dark and depressing. Many reviews and readers have said the same. Part of the reason for this is that these days, people just expect fantasies to be fluffy. And part of it is that, like many Cherryh books, the ending of this one wasn't really meant to be \\"The End\\" but \\"To Be Continued.\\" It becomes quite different when viewed in that light.UPDATE: In 2009, CJ Cherryh self-published a re-write of \\"Faery In Shadow\\" under the title \\"Faery Moon.\\" It's a $10 electronic download in multiple formats, including plain text, PDF, and Kindle. (Google it, and it should turn up.) Included is the prequel, \\"The Brothers,\\" some new art, a glossary, and an explanation about why she felt the need to re-write the book and why it go so little promotion in the US.I've read both versions multiple times, and they're not that different. She says she put more emphasis on the dialect, particularly the difference between Caith's relatively modern speech and Dubhain's much older language. However, I found the difference quite distinct in the earlier version, and didn't really notice the changes. The difference I did notice is that there's a bit more explanation of what's going on...in particular, that the crime that got Dubhain bound to Caith for punishment was doing a good deed, and that (in Caith's view, anyway) compassion is a sin for a dark Sidhe.Should you buy \\"Faery Moon\\"? Yes, if you don't have a copy of either \\"The Brothers\\" or \\"Faery In Shadow\\" and want one, if you want Kindle versions of either of those stories, if you just want to support the author or self-publishing, or if you're a really hardcore fan of Caith and Dubhain. Otherwise, there's probably not enough new material to make it worth the price."},{"Title":"Faery in Shadow","review":"First...dear lovers of the Sidhe (Faerie Folk),... it is only fair to reveal that years ago when this book wasn't even available in the U.S.A. we wrote to the author and she very kindly gifted us an autographed copy, so we were already inclined to love it, particularly because we already loved her book(s)The Dreaming Tree. C. J. Cherryh is one of the few modern writers who has a genuine understanding of the Sidhe, who in this work are equivalent essentially to Virtues, Powers, or Dominions in angelic hierarchy.

Certainly, the immense financial institutions, the extravagant city lifestyle, and the old shipping and railroad dominance of the city come to mind when we think of New York City's amazing economic influence. But Professor Kessner also makes it clear that other New York trademarks would have been impossible without it: the parks and the Brooklyn Bridge; the philanthropic endeavors and museums (sparked by such men as John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, and J.P. Morgan); even its consolidation of all five boroughs into Greater New York in 1898 is seen as a reflection of the corporate consolidations going on in the business community. This is a fascinating thesis that is easily proved by Professor Kessner's impressive research.What holds the book together and keeps the reader's attention (well, this reader at least), is the cast of irascible characters and their single-minded purpose to make lots of money. Not surprisingly these men progress from the merely greedy to the mercenary and cold-blooded. Compared to Carnegie, Gould, Morgan, and Vanderbilt, men like John J. Astor, A.T. Stewart and Moses Taylor come off looking like Cub Scouts. Carnegie's vicious anti-labor practices, Morgan's tyrannic disposition, Gould's unabashed attempts to own everything, and Vanderbilt's contempt for charity, are brilliantly captured, warts and all, by Professor Kessner. Of course, not everything these men did can be viewed as self-serving greed. Gould did what he did because they system as it existed allowed him to. And had not Morgan reined in the wild and wooly railroad industry, the larger economy would suffer. And his creation of US Steel--which greatly profitted Andrew Carnegie--set the standards for 20th century corporate culture in America and the world.Cementing these tales of unchecked love for Mammon are the stories of labor's attempts to share in the profits or, at the very least, earn a fair wage. The selfless quests of remarkable men like Andrew Green, Samuel Gompers and Henry George make the picture whole. &quot;Capital City: New York City and the Men Behind America's Rise to Economic Dominance, 1860-1900&quot; is a brilliant study, and a testimony to Professor Kessner's dedication and research. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Capital City: New York City and the Men Behind America's Rise to Economic Dominance, 1860-1900","review":"This book is highly readable, although written by a history professor, and reads like almost like a novel, with plots, sub-plots and a great story.The book describes the psychogeography of New York City in the last half of the 19th century and the brilliant, eccentric and many times shady: businessmen, politicians, civic reformers, professionals, labor leaders and others who formed the character of the great city while working out the structure and basic methods of corporate capitalism. The author explains why new york was aptly disposed for this formative role, versus other potential suitors such as Boston or Philadelphia. It also gives some insights into the urban development of new york, which, in spite of sincere efforts and unique achievements (e.g. Central Park) by many of its more inspired civic doyens, seems to reflect the requirements of business and the vestiges of political corruption: vertical growth and size were the main criteria, versus the more human dimensions dictated by a residentially-focussed city such as Paris.

It is more like a short think piece than a robust book. It is very short, very lyrical, and worth (just) the price of admission. In many ways it is more of an essay on Lauren Bacall than on Bogart. I think Thomson overplays the differences between Chandler's Marlowe and Bogart's -- a good example of the &#34;bitter witnessing hero on the streets&#34; motif is the little Harry Jones scene (with the immortal Elisha Cook, Jr.) where the little man sacrifices himself in a nothing room in the middle of nowhere for a nothing woman.

He has done his research on the director Howard Hawks-who seems to have molded Lauren Bacall on his second wife Nancy \\"Slim\\" Hawks (who is a sophisticated looking lady who seems to have been blessed with with according to legend). Furthermore, he talks around the plot and goes into detail about how the studio wanted more Bogey & Bacall and sacrificed exposition for it and it worked! Thompson talks about what a \\"happy\\" film it is, but I agree with him and was attracted to all the alluring females that throw themselves in Bogey path throughout the film, which Thompson suggests reflects Hawks' reputation as a lady's man.

Unlike most other Schaum's outlines that are well-written by authors who appear to know their subject matter, this one seems to be written by someone who does not understand what a student is looking for in an outline on computer networking and doesn't seem to know the subject matter that well either.For example, the first chapter, entitled \\"Data Communications\\", launches into a discussion of communication theory including wave division multiplexing, time division multiplexing, bandwidths for various applications, and modulation techniques. This is going to be very confusing to the average computer science student who has probably picked up this book to learn about the architecture of computer networks and instead begins his or her studies by reading a poorly written chapter on senior-level electrical engineering communication theory topics. To top it all off, the illustrations don't even make sense. For example, on page 5 there is a figure labeled \\"Typical Wave Division Multiplexing System\\". This figure consists of nothing more than 4 computers and two multiplexing devices with no connections shown. I'm sure if I was told to install a multiplexing system and this is what I gave the client, I would surely either be fired or promoted to management. The entire book is like this.Rather than take the typical approach and explain network architectures in the context of the seven layer OSI model or some derivative thereof, the author just launches into discussions of miscellaneous topics without tying them all together in some kind of structure. For example, the chapter on multiple access is just plain baffling. The author talks about the different applications that need multiple access, and never bothers to define the term. Then the author discusses the three constraints of multiple access implementations, one of which he just labels as variable \\"a\\" without every properly defining what \\"a\\" really means, just how to calculate it. All calculations and examples shown are very elementary and poorly explained. There is a very sparse use of figures also. After reading through the outline, I can only figure that this lack of detailed diagrams and rigorous exercises is due to the author's lack of knowledge on the subject and thus his inability to produce them.I would say that this Schaum's outline is a complete waste of time. Don't bother yourself with it even if someone gives it to you for free - you'll only end up more confused. It's not that the subject matter is just poorly presented, it is often wrongly presented. If you are taking a class on computer networking, more than likely you have been assigned Tannenbaum's \\"Computer Networks\\". If so, it is a very good book, if not you might want to bite the bullet and consider buying this rather expensive but complete and essential book. Tannenbaum can be a bit theoretical, though. So you might also want to also purchase \\"Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet\\" by James Kurose. That book is more applied than Tannenbaum's and has many network programming labs in the Java programming language to help hammer home certain concepts."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Computer Networking","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer that person who wrote this book does not seem to have a deep knowledge of the subject.

I recommend it to all!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The things that disturb us the most are those that we, as human beings, can relate to on a personal level: the memories of childhood -- bullies; sports; friends, and groups of them; adults' attitudes toward us. Toni Morrison uses some of these to wrench out of us feelings from our past. We may not be a Pecola Breedlove, but maybe we were a schoolmate, or someone who teased her. We did not think then how powerful our words were. Sticks and stones may break our bones, but names will kill us.This is an emotionally tough book, and if Toni Morrison wrote it specifically to get a reaction out of the reader, so be it. If you're depressed about the idea of a Pecola Breedlove, don't shoot the messenger. Reexamine what kind of a world we lived, and live in."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison has done it again. She has reached into the veryheart and soul of the black female experience and brought out deeplymoving tale of life in poverty-stricken,Black America. This tale makes you shiver with its images of racism and intra-racism. I was left speechless after reading this novel. I was unable to finish it all at once because it brought tears to my eyes and I had to remove myself from it. Like many books written by Black female writers it brought back images from my own youth experience and not that all the images are bad, but the book shed light on the hardship of growing up poor, black, and female in America. It is not always a pretty picture and Toni Morrison, like Alice Walker and Gloria Naylor does a good job of depicting this experience with brilliant and believable writing. This definitely gets two snaps up, in a circle!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"of all of morrison's books, i like this one the best (though it seems to be her least read one). anyway, the tragedies that pecola breedlove suffers opens the readers eyes to the true darkness of hopelessness. this is one of the saddest books i've ever read, but it is one that everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"the book is a joy to read. it is refeshing and inspirational at many levels. however there is a weird differentiation between 'out' and 'outdoors' that this reader doesn't agree with.

But The Bluest Eye really spoke to me. This story is hearbreaking and painful, yet I still couldn't put it down. It's been a long time since I first read it, but the image of a young girl wishing fervently for something so attainable, and the commentary on racism and beauty that Morrison is able to make through the girl is truly breathtaking and demonstrates that Morrison is one of the finest writers of the 20th century.If you want to read Morrison, but was put off by her other works or becasue you never really figured out &quot;Beloved&quot;, read this one. In my opinion, it's her best."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was wonderful to read, and I am now reading the rest of Tony Morrison's books.

Pecola prays for blue eyes so she too can be beautiful. Pecola's own mother even seems to love the little blonde girl whose house she cleans more than she loves her own children.

Perhaps the only drawback I see to this novel is that there are a few too many shifts in perspective, and by the time we are ready to have the story end, we get introduced to new characters and have to read all about their history. But that is a small complaint. The rest of this first novel is vintage Morrison. Granted, her voice is still rather new in this book, and the elements don't quite gel as well as they will in future novels, but we get to see Morrison at the beginning of her writing that will eventually lead her down the path to the Nobel Prize in Literature. Of course, this is not always an easy read. In fact, this story is full of ugliness and horror that leaves the reader in need of a long, head clearing walk afterwards. However, many people label this story as being just too depressing, or a real downer. I don't see it that way. Perhaps this is because Morrison tends to distance us from the events at times by telling the story partly through the perspective of so many different narrators. I hardly think this story is too depressing to read. After all, just a few short years ago, Americans (and the world) were lining up to see a movie about a ship that sinks, killing over a thousand. This book is far more developed, and engrossig than that film. Don't listen to the naysayers, read this book, not only for the craftsmanship, but to read the first novel in what becomes for Morrison a brilliant career."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Author: Tonni Morrison Title : The Bluest Eye This book is about a 12 year old girl named Pecola Breedlove who was raped by her dad Charlie Breedlove.

With that said, I warn you that this is not a 'feel good' story. I could probably count the times on one hand that I actually found anything to feel pleased, reassured or even vaguely satisfied about while reading it. Pecola's story is rooted in so many terrors. I wanted to cry, to smash something, to cry...the emotions roused while reading this tale by the divine Ms. Morrison are ones that in some ways come from an understanding of what it feels like to sometimes doubt your worth-especially as it relates to growing up as a black girl in America and the unsubstantiated notions that 'white' is the epitome of beauty. However, in the differences between Pecola's and Claudia's upbringings, we see the importance of involved and nurturing parents. We see the importance- no the necessity- of building our children's self esteem at a young age. Here, the book satisfied, pleased and reassured me as a parent and as a mother. I recommend this book especially for parents who have kids who may be reading this for school. I think it opens the door for many difficult discussions- especially those on race. The subject matter is heavy and oftentimes graphic but the story is excellently crafted."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book isn't one you can say afterward \\"I really liked it,\\" but I doubt that it was Morrison's intent to write some joy-filled easy reader. The themes are highly disturbing - severe child abuse, parental dysfunction and neglect, and racism based upon light and dark African-American skin color. I spent two months analyzing, discussing and reading this book for a senior-level college literature class, and it was an experience I won't ever forget. There is no \\"happy ever after\\" ending, and certainly, Morrison breaks with literary tradition by revealing the \\"surprise ending\\" in the very first pages of the book.What's fascinating are the unlikable characters. Pecola's mother, for one. It's difficult to ever feel sympathy for this woman and the bad life choices she made, specifically about returning to an insanely abusive husband, to the detriment of her two young children. After reading \\"The Bluest Eye\\" and spending so much time with the book, I understand why it is considered a modern classic in American literature.I almost went to war with a tenured professor who disagreed very strongly with my assertion that the dysfunction in the Breedlove family (including Pecola's mother and father) was economic and cultural rather than being completely rooted in their ethnicity. No matter what race Pecola's family happened to be, the tragic ending to \\"The Bluest Eye\\" would have probably been the same. The violent argument between Pecola's mother and father transcends culture and race - if you had crazy parents or dysfunctional caretakers as a child, you'll be both laughing and crying while you read that part of the book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago and loved it then. I loved it so much that I knew I wanted to read it again. Reading this book again with a more mature mind made me think about what the story is really about-- How we treat people. Based on if they are light skin, dark skin, pretty, ugly, educated, uneducated, rich, poor, dignified or unkempt. It's not just a mattered of the shade of skin. The main point, in my opinion, is that the majority of people will despise and condemn others because they are not \\"beautiful\\" enough. All the characters in this story were victims of being unwanted, unfulfilled and neglected, therefore when it came to relating to Pecola, she became their victim.This book made me think about how I consider people and maybe I should reach out to others around me more because we are all dying inside, one way or another."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It is no secret that I am a huge Toni Morrison fan. I read this book years ago in high school or my freshman year in college. I know that this book has been reviewed and analyzed time and time again but this is my take on it.Our narrator Claudia MacTeer makes known that she and her sister Frieda are often overlooked by the adults around them. The sisters are listening more closely than the adults know. Through their eyes, we discover the tragic story of their friend eleven year old Pecola Breedlove. Pecola is a child with a melancholy spirit. She is growing up in a home with no evidence of love while being reared by parents that knew very little about the emotion themselves. Pecola's innocence was snatched from her by her drunken father, Cholly Breedlove. Cholly is a character that is very easy to hate. He is a horrible drunken beater and child molester. Morrison tries to give us some insight to Cholly's madness by describing his background. Left on a garage heap by his mother and rescued by his aunt who constantly reminds him of his horrible beginning. On a quest for his father, He was rejected for a dice game. After all this, I still could not muster up any empathy for ol' Cholly Breedlove. Mrs. Breedlove is a bitter woman who would rather wallow in her situation than love and pay attention to her own children. She nurtures the little white girl whose home she works at and never reciprocates it to Pecola. Pecola and her brother addresses their mother as, Mrs. Breedlove. Everyone in the Breedlove family seems to be detached from each other. There is no connection in this family besides abuse and neglect.Claudia and Frieda try to protect and befriend Pecola but their efforts don't even penetrate the surface of her pain. Pecola thinks that \\"blue eyes\\" will solve all her problems. She thinks that \\"blue eyes\\" will get her accepted. She even consults the town \\"spiritualist\\", Soap Head Church, to see if there was a way he could \\"grant\\" them to her. Pecola and Mrs. Breedlove try to fill their emptiness with vanity instead of love. We come to find out that vanity leads to madness.I could not pick a favorite character from this novel. I feel like I never really got to know any of them in depth. I finished the novel feeling like someone was telling me this story in a gossip session. I suggest that Toni write an entire novel about Soap Head Church. Church's character would make for an interesting read. This is an epic novel that deals with a lot of issues and this review just skimmed the surface. Considering that this was Toni's first novel it still holds as much literary weight as, A Mercy."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The humidity rises off the dirt roads as Frieda and Claudia begin to walk home from school. Their journey home however, is interrupted once a couple of boys start bullying a girl named Pecola for being too black. With every might, the boys push her onto the ground where suddenly, Frieda and Claudia run to help her. This incident is only a spectacle of the eye-opening trials Pecola and the characters face in the novel The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. Morrison depicts the life of the young girl, Pecola who struggles with domestic violence as well as accepting and embracing her African-American descent and color rather than her desire to have blond hair and blue eyes. With the use of 1st person narrative that is not the main character and simple diction, The Bluest Eye captures the country life style of these girls in the 1960's and the importance to love your-self.Morrison tells the novel through the character, Claudia, a young, adventurous girl who holds the objective opinion. With her perspective, Morrison shows the trauma of violence and social acceptance. When Claudia had to comfort Frieda after being molested by their neighbor, Morrison illustrated the emotions and effects that all experience during such horrible events and how that leads to the desire to be someone else. The Bluest Eye also contains extremely simple and unfinished phrases. Morrison uses this to depict the young girls' innocence and how that changes throughout the book. For example, when Claudia says \\"hereisthefamilythatmotherfatherdickandjanetheyliveinthegreenandwhitehousetheyareveryh\\", she shows how family life is not well and how she wishes otherwise.Overall this novel contains an interesting view on life as an African-American female and female insecurities.

At times difficult, at times you have to put the text down and think about what you have just read. A beautifully written story that really hits home and really makes you think. As a white man, reading this book at this time (a time when we are close to electing a black man as president), it made me realize how far we have come as a country; and yet it made me think about how far we have yet to go.

The Bluest Eye tells such a tale with jealousy, hatred, and prejudice to give insight into a life unlived by most. It is an engaging, interesting story involving a girl who desperately desires blue eyes in order to make herself acceptable to the white population of Lorain, Ohio. The novel is beneficial to read, as it creates a world that they could most likely never know, but can later recognize, after reading, when another person is subjected to similar prejudice, and thus allow the reader to be compassionate towards all others. Though at times, the focus and perspective changes, the purpose and message of the book remains clear: prejudice is as widespread as humanity, and all people should be given the opportunity to show who they truly are and be accepted, otherwise, intolerance and discrimination spread like a disease. To read The Bluest Eye is to better one's character and make them a better person. Intricately woven and subtle, The Bluest Eye is an entertaining yet deep and influential read that will leave you pondering the world and its ways. It provides an afternoon of enjoyable relaxation, while also providing an afternoon of insight and perspective."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is one of my favorite Morrison books - it was the first one I read that convinced me of her power as a writer.

DO NOT MISS!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I remember reading this book my senior year in high school; my teacher kept reminding us that this was Toni Morrison's *first* book. It was hard to believe then and still is. Although Ms. Morrison has gone on to write many more beautiful and powerful books and win the Nobel prize, this one is still my favorite. I think it is because of the characters -- the four young girls who make up the juxtaposed visions of what is beautiful, what is good, what is desired. It is also simply a powerfully moving story. Part of what makes it so good is the insights we see of ourselves as individual people and as a people. Pecola Breedlove haunts us still, and perhaps she always will."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is the story of an 11 year old victim ofcircumstance--the circumstance being her ugliness. Heart-wrenching inparts, Morrison writes of the importance of beauty and to what lengths a person would go to achieve the stereotypical &quot;beauty.&quot; This book is the first that I've read that deals more with this social issue of what is beautiful than with the issue of race relations. Not to say that race isn't talked about, but it isn't the primary focus of the novel.

I like that in a book. It was very hard for me tobelieve children were treated in a way that they were afraid to live.

I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read very powerful real life stories."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In the novel The Bluest Eye, by Toni Morrison, the text evades many themes that develop throughout the book. The novel does a good job of developing the themes, such as hope, racism and coming of age. Pecola Breedlove, an 11yr. old girl, grew up in a neighborhood where racism was much more vigilant that current day racism. Pecola encountered many grotesque experiences throughout her life. Pecola would pray and hope for blue eyes everyday of her life.The text dragged at various times in the book but still kept my attention by the use of depression description of the book. Personally, I thought that the novel compared to the novel Avalon. Both books similarly give specifics on the theme of hope. Pecola hopes to gain the acceptance of her society and the book Avalon describes the hardships of struggling family trying to find the perfect place to stay in their new home, America."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm no fan of Toni Morrison, but this, her first novel, broke my heart. More like ripped it out, stomped on it and mangled it. This book contains within it the germ of ultimate despair and sadness; a tale that goes beyond any kind of sorrow I've felt before. I don't know what else to say, except that I selfishly wish Pecola Breedlove and people who have felt her pain had never existed, so that I wouldn't have to think that anguish like theirs had ever been felt by any person. All I could do after reading this book was cry for the whole damn human race. Ignore every other book Morrison has written and read this one. You won't enjoy it, but you will be a wiser human being because of it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"...Frankly, it would be hard to find a more hopeless, depressing, dark novel. There is no redemption here for any of these afflicted characters. There is only sorrow, nihilism, and desperation. As a portrait of such it is well written, but yikes. I don't mind a book being depressing, but I like to find some shred of hope for change or life affirmation even among the suffering, and I do not find it here."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I, as a white, middle-class woman, was reluctant to read this book. I thought it would be a book about black women that would be difficult for me to relate to. I was very much mistaken.The novel painfully shows us the life of an innocent little girl who is totally a victim of her circumstances. The little girl is abused and neglected by her family and neighbors who are also the victims of their circumstances. The well crafted story is told in such a way as to give the reader the background of all the major characters. The background gives us great insight into each of their motives and what has made these people into the people they are.Toni Morrison's novel left me thinking about race relations and poverty and children. It would be a kinder world if everyone read this book and thought about how each of us is connected. I wonder how different this little girl's life would have been if she had encountered kindness and caring in school or from a neighbor. I wonder how her life would have been affected if her parents had encountered kindness and caring in their lives."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found this novel very difficult to comprehend at first. What helped me was to read the author's \\"Afterword,\\" and then go back and read the novel again. Parts of the book were so dead-on that it was frightening, but other parts I could not connect with. After Morrison revealed in her \\"Afterword\\" why she wrote as she did, the story became clearer and more compelling.It is a little bit like a puzzle; Mama's ranting on about the three quarts of milk, the description of Geraldine, the affection Mrs. Breedlove sheds on the pink and yellow girl, and her soliloquy of how she and Cholly got together and why they stayed together. You sometimes forget that book is about Pecola, but then, when all the little pieces fit together, you are left with a complete picture. Or maybe it is like Cholly's life, \\"coherent only in the head of a musician.\\" (p. 159) The Bluest Eye is like a musical composition; each instrument playing their own unique part, but combined, they create a symphony. Definitely worth a repeat read. Recommended for a mature audience."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison says in her Afterword that the Breedloves are not supposed to represent the typical black family of the 1930's and 40's. What the Breedloves do represent is the effects of racial self-loathing on each member of the family with the final destruction of its youngest member, Pecola Breedlove--age 11.Pecola is the little girl who longs for blue eyes--blue eyes like Shirley Temple, blue eyes like the blond haired child in the house where Pecola's mother Pauline is a servant. Maybe if she has blue eyes, her mother will love her, other children will like her. Blue eyes represent to Pecola the idea of being. She feels worthless. She feels invisible.This book is absolutely gripping in its portrayal of black life. There is no sentimentality here. But there is also a rough realism and gritty humor in the dialogue.The author understands her characters with a completeness that is astounding.I don't know if Toni Morrison was a mother when she wrote this book, but I found that Pauline Breedlove's rejection of her daughter very harsh.Still, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand that the most vulnerable in our society deserve our compassion and our respect."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison is my favorite author. I first read this book in the late 70's and it stayed with me. I decided to read it again last year and was surprised that it was even more more moving than the first time. I suppose that, having gained some maturity, I saw it in a completely different light. By the end I was crying. I wanted to take Pecola in my arms and tell her that she was beautiful. It isn't an easy read -- none of Morrison's books are -- but that's what makes them so wonderful and worthwhile. She is a true genius."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is one of those books that people ignore because they assume they already know what it stands for and what it's going to say. It's their loss.The Bluest Eye, the tale of a community's problems as reflected in the microcosmic life of a troubled young girl, is not a perfect book. Morrison herself, in the afterword, acknowledges some of its imperfections. But it is a rich, involving, sometimes terrifying, and from a technical standpoint, deliciously written first novel that most contemporary writers would be proud to call a mature work.If I had any problem with the book, it's that I found it somewhat overwrought and maybe relentless in its brutality. But don't let me scare you away, because it wasn't all about brutality. And I found the negative aspects balanced by my enjoyment of the power and precision of the writing. Morrison's prose really takes off as the novel progresses, combining incisive observation with lucid description, presenting unusual characters and fine dialogue as it takes us to places that alternately entertain us and make us uncomfortable. It knows exactly what it's doing, and there's a definite feeling of literary \\"greatness\\" at work.I find the more reactionary reviews interesting--those who call it \\"outdated,\\" as though it weren't set in the 1940's, \\"simpleminded,\\" as though Morrison simply presents a scenario of white evil/black good (nothing could be further from the depiction in this book, which examines its characters with the same complexity that's taken for granted in books that aren't about black people), or vulgar and too sexual, as though it were pornography of some sort with lots of drawn-out and gratuitous sex scenes. I guess these people have never experienced the guilty pleasures of much less serious books where the sexual content is indeed gratuitous, and presented with much less intent to ask serious questions about the characters involved and the society around them.A lesser writer would just thrust the \\"what\\" in our faces without asking \\"why\\"--that is, without diving beneath the surface to emerge with universal human truths. People are justifiably afraid of this material--afraid of thinking, afraid of feeling. \\"Sometimes I'm afraid of what I write, but I can't look away,\\" Morrison has said. If you don't look away either, the Bluest Eye will reward you anew every time you return to it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I don't think Toni Morrison could ever dissapoint her readers... Her writing style is so beautiful and poetic and although this might not be her best work (it is her first, after all) it is definetly a touching story that's worth reading. This novel will make you think about the notion of beauty: isn't society really the judge of what is beautiful & doesn't that notion change as society changes? The protagonist, a young black girl bereft of love from basically everyone, Pecola, wants more than anything in the world to have blue eyes, because she believes that blue eyes would make anyone beautiful. Her fate is a sad one & when she finally gets some \\"love\\" from a member of her family it leads to tragic consequences. The story is mainly told from the point of view of a child of around Pecola's age & I thought this was beneficial to the story because often very disturbing things are discussed with the innocence/naivete of a child. Then again, at other times the author does not go easy on the imagery when discussing very disturbing things. This book is not for everyone, but the prose is beautiful (as always in Ms. Morrison's works) and the story will teach the reader a thing or two about one of its main themes: the notion of beauty."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"i read the book &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; by Toni Morrison and was both enchanted and devestaded with every paragraph of this sad story. I enjoyed this book very much. It is written beautifully with every character and every thing described to a tee. All her life, young Pecola Breedlove had wanted to be noticed. She saw other kids getting everything they've ever wanted yet she is just left behind is the dust of her family's failures and ugliness. She pines for the one thing that she thinks will help her stand out to the people who ridicule her every day as not just an ugly girl, but a person with real feelings. When Pecola's first experience at being noticed comes, it is by the wrong person with the wrong ideas. This person's drunken decisions soon turn Pecola's life upside down and she must learn to live life and face her downfalls, even when they hurt her so badly on the inside."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison was an interesting and creative novel. The book is based in Lorain, Ohio which was Morrison's home town. The books focal point is about a little black girl named Pecola who believes that the only way she can be pretty is to have the blondest of hair and the bluest of eyes. She also believes that all of her problems would be solved if she accomplishes this. She is abused mentally by the society that she is in and even physically by her father who rapes and impregnates her.It is not just Pecola in the book that falls subject to the feeling inferior and abuse, but most of the black community in her town as well. Claudia is another protagonist in the book that witnesses all that happens to Pecola. Claudia lives with her sister Frieda and her mother in a house that is poverty stricken. Claudia narrates the book as an adult looking back at the past when she was nine years old.The main enemy of the book is not a tangible object or person, but is more of a way of thinking back in the time. Internalized racism is this way of thinking. The black community is targeted by this idea and begins to believe their own inferiority to whites. Pecola being the main character suffers the most from internalized racism.This was the first book that Toni Morrison ever wrote and the reader can tell by her styles of writing. It almost seems as though she is testing writing styles and speech. From reading the book I can tell that Toni Morrison was experimenting with fiction because the content form is sometimes fleeing from the main idea.Pecola's experiences throughout the book leave her insensible, a product of her own ideas of herself based on racism in the town. This book was poignant with a depressing tone and at the same time very interesting and informative. Morrison's writing is creative. This book requires interest in a different kind of writing and an open mind. I enjoyed the book, but would not be interested in reading another one written by Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book offers extraordinary insight into the color-complex dilemma that has plagued the African American community since the beginning of slavery. Any black girl who has ever been ridiculed simply for being darker should relate to the protagonist Pecola's unfortunate predicament.

From season to seaon, this book imprisoned every page with as much unabashed complexity of the human spirit as possible. The way Morrison encircles each character with their own individuality is unmistakable and without pretension.

I personally didn't think it was that good of a book. Since Toni Morrison is such a good writer, when I tell people I read her book and I didn't really like it they are surprised.It took place in the 1930's and was about an African American girl who wanted to have blue eyes and blonde hair. She thought if she had blonde hair and blue eyes she would be loved by everyone more than she was before.The part of the book that really threw me off was when the other focused almost a whole chapter on a lady who was a maid and her foot! I kind of lost interest in the book at that point.The book also changed subjects too frequently so it was hard to figure out what was happening.The main characters also changed so frequently. Often I had to go back in the book to find out who someone was.Even though I didn't understand the book I think it was very descriptive, which didn't make it as hard to understand what the book was talking about."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Pecola Breedlove has only one desire in her life: to possess the blue eyes which were considered beautiful by society.

Morrison's authorial style is among the best of our modern writers. Why then would I give this novel only one star?The Bluest Eye is brutal in its portrayal of Pecola Breedlove and her pathway to mental insanity. Not only does it perpetuate outdated racial stereotypes, but it also depicts with glaring detail episodes of sexual perversion and disturbing domestic abuse. Indeed, quite often while I was reading this book (for my 11th grade honors English class) I felt as though I would be sick. This kind of filth should not be taught in classrooms. There was no need for Morrison to paint her story in such rancid vulgarity.The only reason a book of this sort has even ONE star is because Amazon doesn't let users rate products any lower."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is an ugly book with ugly characters that are hard to like and even more difficult to root for.

I am still amazed that this author won a Nobel or Pulitzer prize for her literature, as I found this book totally disgusting and full of filth.There is so much better literature to spend your time with. Find something more fulfilling and uplifting. It's fine to read a bood about suffering, but Toni Morrison really should take some writing courses before she attempts to write another.

It's not a horribly written book or the worse book i have ever read. It's very well written, and very poetic. However, that doesn't make the story any more or less interesting or good than a novel that isn't written in that form and style. Knowing the author's reputation, i was expecting to really enjoy this book and to feel the essence of Toni Morrison and see finally why she's deeply acknowledged and respected. I can see why of course, but nothing about The Bluest Eye made me truly see the whole picture. For one, the narration was very confusing, and at some point it feels as if the narrator is rambling too much. And the sequence of events wasn't very coherent either. And the story itself, although tragic and sad, is not great or spectacular. At the end it was just depressing, and I just didn't get any type of emotion, insight, or feeling after it. I was just expecting much better from all the hype of this very talented author and this book. Sorry, I just don't see what was the big deal about this book.

You will laugh and cry. Feed your soul and food for thought."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison is such a depressing and sad book that makes it very good and interesting. I recommend this book because it can make a person realize how physical appearance can mean so much to one person. This book relates to reality in different ways, such as incidents of being raped by a family member does happen, and some people aren't satisfied with their looks. It can change how a person behaves and treats another because of their appearance and race. This book can help you understand how a person that is being convinced that he/she is ugly feels. It's sad because there are people in this world that long so much to become pretty, but I believe that each person is beautiful in their own way.I liked this book because it relates to situations that actually happen in the outside world. Toni Morrison has described the hardships and problems Pecola faced just because she's black and physically unattractive. People in this world do get treated unequal and different just because of their race and how they look like. It is less likely that people who have better features are being teased and made fun of.I have a friend who always thought she was ugly because she thinks she's fat. She'll be down and upset about how sometimes guys treat her different from other girls and sometimes they would call her mean names. But she has a super-great personality and that just makes up for everything.Another reason I liked this book is because Toni Morrison seem to describe Pecola as a strong person. Even after that horrible incident she went through, she still kept herself alive and lived on. This part of this character made me realize it's not easy to live with something like this and always being teased. Being laughed at and unaccepted is hard and painful. Also, this character teaches me to not give up so easily when difficult situations occur.Overall, I think The Bluest Eye is an outstanding novel that I highly recommend. It's not too long and it easy to understand. Not only this book have a sad and tragic story that makes it good, it can teach a person something valuable."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"All has been said re: plot.

Inequality. Inferiority. Toni Morriosn included this and more in her book, The Bluest Eye. Pecola Breedlove is an 11 year old black child living in the same small town of Lorain, Ohio that once held the presence of the books author. Presented with obstacles beyond her young ability to overcome, Pecloa Breedlove looks for an open door, a way out. Cholly Breedlove, her drunken excuse for a father, is of no use to Pecola. She feels his hurt more than his love, and his figure through Pecola's eyes isn't what the typical American father should be. The perfect American family would consist of a mother, a father, \\"Dick\\", and \\"Jane\\", a dog, a house with shutters, and love glowing from inside. The one thing Pecola wants more than anything, more even than to be accepted by her father for who she is, are blue eyes. Blue eyes, blond hair. That's the perfect American girl. Pecola struggles within herself, as well as with decisions forced upon her. She looks for a way out, a way to see the world from blue eyes, but she just can't. It's as if she's overcome with the sheer disillusionment of it all. This book was a puree' of fantasy and truth, serenity and mere weakness. It's a dark look at the true reality, and ways of the early 1900's.When Toni Morrison wrote this book, she wrote from deep within. Anyone who can use words to make someone shiver as read, has to have some type of related experience from their past. Personally, I believe that she was faced with a few of the same roadblocks as the characters that appear in her book(s). She's a talented author, and after reviewing her, an amazing woman. Though I don't fully understand it all, maybe her writings are just at a level that she can relate with.

It truly demonstrated the style of writing that Toni Morrison uses and how well she is able to use imagery and symbolism in her writing. At times it is confusing because she skips around a bit with the use of time as she does in most of her books, but the plot is fairly easy to follow because it is so intriguing. She displays the life of a young African American girl in a way in which most people can really understand and feel the pain of this young girl. She contrasts the life of a white family and an African American family in a truly realistic manner. This was how life was back then and she is able to describe that so beautifully in her book. Perhaps this may have reflected her own life and hardships she may have entailed as a young girl. It made me cry at times to think how badly this girl wanted blue eyes and she simply could not have them. I never realized the significance of some things that I take so much for granted.

What is black? Does anyone not Black truly yearn to be Black? Come on, honestly? But White, as in Caucasian, that is the desire, the passion that graces magazines covers. Count the White faces, the colored eyes, the blonde hair and then look at the irony of the suntanned skin. Present in shade...slightly but denied in form.Pecola yearns to be White, not just for the physical form, I think the title distracts the initial reader as too literal, she yearns for it working out, for life being fair, for being eligible to be on magazine covers, one day television, in movies, in power, in control. Hair and eyes are just the ink on the admissions ticket.Children today, this day, teenagers across the country, play at Black. The slang, supposing that they are speaking jive, that rap music makes them down, that knowing, touching, dating Black makes them the tabooed Other. Baggy pants, name brand plastered clothing. We shall overcome? Ha! We shall succumb, succumb to a hypocrisy that is as twisted and amazing and mazed as the beauty in all shades, from chalk to chocolate.Perhaps my children, whatever color or combination of colors they may will look up at me with blue eyes and they won't be alien, they won't be strange, they won't be the Other, they will be embraced. For ultimately Pecola wants to be embraced. Embraced by parents, friends, love. And yet she is in America, a country which is still divided over which children to embrace, which faces to spread white, brown, yellow...etc, etc..And still I, ME! ME! Still I rise everyday. And thats the built in irony to being Black, knowing that tomorrow whether you're in the South or the North, poor or rich, pretty or ugly, you must get up, get up, get up even if your hair isn't blond eand your eyes aren't blue. But like Pecola, sometimes, on the fringe of a day, on the edge of a glance of suspicion, or a clutched purse as wealth bulges silently in my wallet, or someone who tells me how incredible I am but that they would never date or be attracted to Black as if I am a Martian, as if I lack humanity enough to be considered, I wonder as I wander about having eyes of azure and hair the color of urine."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is definitely the work of literary genius.

For her first book, Morrison managed to incorporate the elements of race and gender injustices and wove it with the reality of social stratification during that era for an unforgettable story. Pecola Breedlove is the tortured main character whose life is peppered with the pressures of falling short of the glory and the repercussions of being on the cusp of society's sometimes cruel and unforgiving standards of beauty.

I found myself laughing outloud at some of the comments made early on. It reminded me of my own southern roots as a young girl in awe of the adult conversation that I was not aloud to overhear. The story was very realistic in that I feel many of my African American sistas can recall the desire to want to be &quot;better&quot; given what we were taught to believe was elite.

It was hard to get into the story and to fully understand who the narrator was talking about at first. Once I got past that, I easily finished the book. I found the scene where Mrs. Breedlove, Pecola, Fredia, Claudia and the little white girl were in the kitchen to be the most striking part of the book. When Pecola knocked the pie on the floor, Mrs. Breedlove hit her and heartlessly yelled at her. She then ran to console the little white girl. Mrs. Breedlove showed no love for her own daughter. She reinforced society's opinion of black people by showing more concern for a white child than her own black daughter. At the point I fully realized how sad of a character Pecola was."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is the first time I actually picked up any of Toni Morrison's books. And I am very grateful I finally did. What actually prompted me and my book club members to choose this book was because of the movie &quot;Beloved&quot;. &quot;The bluest eye&quot; is an engaging story of a young black girl who wears her &quot;ugliness&quot; in such an astoundingly depressing way, it was terrible. Toni Morrison showed how she came to believe such nonsense from her surroundings, people, her dysfunctional parents, and the list goes on. I was very much engrossed in this book that I knew that the author would make a shift to a metaphoric ending. Yes, Pecola went crazy, but we must remember that the society is not only to blame. She is to blame also. After all, Claudia and her sister, Frieda, were raised in somewhat the same socioeconomic background (minus the riotous behavior of the parents)and still had a very strong sense of self. Toni did a marvelous job weaving the lives of all of these people. It was written very plainly as well as poetic, suttle as well as violent and filled with many truths. As a Nigerian living in this country for the past 12 years, I have learned and experienced a lot from this society that it sometimes shocks me. Toni Morrison showed me more and confirmed many of what I already knew in this book. It is a crying shame that many human beings still thrive on such nonsense as skin color and good/ bad hair in this day and age. After all even when Pecola got her blue eyes, she still worried that someone out there had eyes bluer than hers. So we have to find beauty within ourselves first before we can experience it. I believe that is what &quot;The bluest eye&quot; is all about."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison writes well, but why she chose to use her skills to write this hopeless bummer is beyond me.

I would have put the book down because of the cruel situations, but I knew that the situations the young one endured were the reality of childhood for many children despite their innocence.

She always mentions that this book by Toni Morrison called \\"BLUEST EYE\\" changed her life, so I decided to pick up a copy. It's just too good and too sad. I cried all the way through Pecola's tragic life, not just for her, but for ALL BLACK PEOPLE. This story is really about skin color prejudice and how black people don't value black children, so it is very painful, but after reading in depth about colorism in Kola Boof's love story \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" (a must read for every black man and woman who WANTS to be black), I am finally beginning to see that our worst enemy as blacks is ourselves. I beg anyone who reads this review to stop what you're doing and read \\"BLUEST EYE\\" by Toni Morrison and \\"FLESH AND THE DEVIL\\" by Kola Boof. They will change your life forever."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"To be completely honest to Toni Morrison, I had no expectations for this book at all. The title sounded boring, the beginning was slow, and the words were a bit difficult. However, at the end I actually got a lot out of it, realizing that people view ohters many times for the wrong reasons. I never thought about the way people wished they looked like a certain person for just a few physical characteristics.The Bluest Eye, is a sad story about an ugly 11-year old black girl named Pecola Breedlove,who grows up surrounded by racism and heartbreak. The young girl and her friends go through many different hard ships and struggles because of racial descrimination. Pecola feels that by having blonde hair and blue eyes she will be noticed and accepted by society. On top of her being physically unattractive, her family is dysfunctional and poor. She feels her answer to all this is looking like Shirley Temple, or just having blonde hair blue eyes.This novel upset me because I do not view anyone by how they look. Like the saying goes, &quot;dont judge a book by its cover&quot;, I firmly believe in that. I have never, nor ever will chose a friend by how they look. A good personality is one of the greatest things in the world. When I finished reading this I was angry and depressed at the same time. I can understand how people feel when they are being stared at for their physical appearence. I was always one of ridicule because of how small I was,my red hair, and braces. But I had something that everyone should always look at first, a terrific personality. I would retaliate by lauging it off and then coming back with a nice comment myself about them. People respected me for who I was and how I made them feel, not just the way I looked.All together this book hit me emotionally, and really captured the prejudice that goes on everywhere. Morrison did an excellent job with this book and really surprised me at the end. I actually handed my mom the book and told her to read it. I don't do that very often, so she figured it must be good to keep my attention."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was very disappointed in this novel. I found it incredibly depressing, or perhaps it was the fact that my class read this novel right after September 11th. I felt bad for the main character, Pecola, and the incredible pain and sorrow and suffering she endured throughout the book. However, I feel Toni Morrison *overdid* the pain and suffering a bit. One thing after another after another kept on happening to her, resulting in one of the most depressing works I have ever opened and read from cover to cover. I cannot see, nor do I believe I will *ever* see how this was an award-winning novel. Sorry Miss Morrison, but you flopped on my list."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If beauty is skin deep then you'd have to love the skin you're in to fully appreciate it. And how do we learn to love our, skin . . .by having its beauty validated by our families, friends, community, and society at large. Is there any question why Pecola's quest for the bluest eyes (what she believed to be the ultimate measure of beauty) became so totally consuming, to the point that the child drove herself mad? In The Bluest Eye, Morrison points out that beauty is as beauty does. She challenges her readership to re-evaluate our own notions of beauty. I have known for some time that this country's standard of beauty (the physical at least) is absent of anything reflective of an African presence. Morrison has validated that knowledge and through this novel, shares it with the world.Like all of Morrison's work, The Bluest Eye uses music, spirituality, and familiar language (from an African-American perspective) to deliver a powerful message about the African-American experience. The fact that the novel is had for some readers to digest is indicative of the truth that it reveals for truth is always hard to swallow. I was not surprised that the book, when originally published, was banned in some parts of this country. The novel reveals a raw and ugly truth on our perception of beauty that that would certainly be rejected by mainstream America. This novel is recommended reading for the world. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is an artistic portrayal of the harsh realities facing three young black girls struggling to make their way through an unforgiving white world. Toni Morrison's prose is as achingly beautiful as it is devastatingly sad. She weaves powerful imagery and symbolism throughout her exploration of the complex layers of experience that shape her characters' sense of self-worth, dignity, and pride. This novel encourages a tremendous amount of introspection, which was actually Morrison's intention (according to her afterword). Such introspection is crucial in order to come to terms with such disturbing themes as rape, domestic violence, and abject poverty.Readers are also presented with a dramatic look at the profound impact that parental love and support (or lack thereof) can have on the growth, potential, and ultimate success of a child. Feelings of frustration and contempt for many of the adults in the novel are somewhat transformed into sympathy upon understanding Morrison's message regarding the parent-child dynamic. I think this particular message regarding the victimization of innocent youngsters also translates well into everyday life. The heartless, soul-less, deceitful, womanizing, hedonistic alcoholic or drug addict evokes great pity when understood in the context of an equally selfish, philandering, criminal, mentally ill father or ignorant, neglectful, oblivious drug-dealing mother.Overall, although the book is extremely heart wrenching, I believe the most tragic element of The Bluest Eye lies not within the novel itself. The true tragedy lies in the fact that the underlying injustice, cruelty, and sheer hatred presented in a decades old book still rings loud and clear today....The isolated events that unfold in Morrison's small town in Ohio have far broader and deeper implications. Such inherent abuse, mistreatment, discrimination, and symbolic \\"rape\\" of the most vulnerable members of society persists unchecked-almost sanctioned- well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison's depiction of the hardships of a young minority girl life is deeply influential. Morrison repeatedly pounds the reader with trials the young Pecola Breedlove must face. Toni Morrison shows that she is insightful and carefully chooses every situation to compound a higher meaning. This is an extremely thought provoking well-written piece of art that allows us to, no forces us to do a self-evaluation and comparative analysis to what society, media, outdated ideas mean to us on a deep personal level.It is these harshly real facts of life that make the book so difficult to read. While reading, I had to consciously tell myself to continue. I would have put the book down because of the cruel situations, but I knew that the situations the young one endured were the reality of childhood for many children despite their innocence.I was especially struck by the actions of Claudia as she received her white baby doll. I felt proud of her; I could feel along with her. The fact that Morrison so eloquently and convincingly paints the portraits of Claudia and Pecola that _anyone_ can feel along with her proves that Morrison is an author not soon to be forgotten.This is for the reader that wants to be challenged and is capable of constant mental action: not just a passive activity. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to better understand the mentality of child abuse and realize that children are resilient to a great degree, but there are limits."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I finish reading a book, I often go to Amazon to read some reviews and see what some other people thought. Naturally, I enjoy reading the 1-star reviews first because they often look past the hype of a particular work or author and get down to what might be amiss. However, I was amused to read the poor reviews this book received--it's described as vulgar, racist, sex-obsessed, disjointed, outdated--I don't think it's any of these things.This is the first book I've read by Toni Morrison and I was very impressed. Anyone who thinks this is a vulgar book should stick to more \\"happy ending\\" type books. (Although, I will admit it is graphic [what's wrong with graphic? the world is a graphic place]. I was surprised to see that a reviewer read this for a 9th-grade English class. I would recommend this as reading for an older crowd.)The writing is far from disjointed. Morrison injects different points of view, making for a more varied and interesting narrative. (As any avid reader would probably agree, overly linear narratives can easily get boring) Granted, I'm not a \\"casual\\" reader so I'm used to reading fragmented stories but I thought THE BLUEST EYE was pretty easy to follow. (It only takes a little practice to get the hang of reading non-linear stories.)My last gripe: OUTDATED? Anyone who thinks the racial issues in this book are outdated has a very narrow suburban view of the world indeed. Besides, the book was published in 1970; do people expect the story to magically alter to conform post-70s views on racial inequality? It's a moving, gritty portrait of an American community at a particular time. Sadly, racism was and still is an important and relevant issue. Ms. Morrison's handling of racism is mature and realistic. The text is not preachy, sentimental, or propagandistic--it's real.Anyway, I just wanted to put in my two cents and support Ms. Morrison's first novel (even though she obviously doesn't need my support). In short, THE BLUEST EYE is a more-than-worthwhile read and far from a waste of time. I'd especially recommend it for fans of writers such as the fantastic James Baldwin and Alice Walker."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye was one of the best novels I have ever read. But the fact that it was written in the 1960s, well before Alice Walker and other writers told similar stories, made it particularly noteworthy. Morrison dealt with a number of subjects that were rarely discussed in novels, but have since become more common themes:The inner lives of black people, particularly black girlsThe class struggle among blacksChild rape (almost uniquely portrayed from the perpetrator's point of view)Perhaps Morrison was just years ahead of her time, because the book has been almost constantly in print during the '80s and '90s. Morrison made abusive parents sympathetic by introducing the reader to their inner lives, to their needs, wants, and cares. While it was not a simple task, Morrison accomplished it to great effect by telling each character's story in turn.The Bluest Eye is a thrifty and evocative novel, shifting from the world as presented by a standard primary reader, to the world as seen by a number of black girls in the poor Cleveland suburb of Lorain, Ohio in 1940. But even if Claudia and Frieda's family are black and do not have much money, they were not at the bottom of the social ladder. That position went to their friend Pecora, and her family, who &quot;...did not live in a storefront because they were having temporary difficulty adjusting to the cutbacks at the plant. They lived there because they were poor and black and they stayed there because they believed they were ugly. Although their poverty was traditional and stultifying, it was not unique...&quot;Pecora had only one desire in life - to have blue eyes. The popular culture in the 1930s, as represented from candy bar wrapers to primary readers, used little round-cheeked white girls as the supermodels of the day. Since the culture promoted the &quot;Shirley Temple look&quot; as the ideal for little girls, black girls in America could not help but to have felt left out. Nowhere was black called beautiful, except by millions of internal, quiet voices.Claudia and Frieda did not buy in to the belief that they were ugly because they were black; Claudia rebelled against it by destroying her white baby dolls one Christmas. Claudia and Frieda were both tough enough to survive living in a bigoted, sexist world. They even helped to rescue Pecora when some boys were taunting her. But they could not rescue her from the violence in her own family, and, ultimately, Claudia felt guilty about it.The quiet, particular madness of a girl who wanted blue eyes to blot out the misery of her life was striking. Pecora's life became so impossible that the only thing that mattered was this dream of blue eyes. Ultimately, Morrison's novel presents the tragedy of racism and abuse as mirrored in the downcast black eyes of a poor young girl."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The book is deep and thought provoking. YOU WILL FEEL! This is one of the shorter titles from Oprah's bookclub but certainly not a light read. I am not a black woman but I am a woman, I do not want to think of how it had to feel and be for black women. Sometimes truth is so hard to take in not because we do not believe it but rather because we do not want to accept it. This is a powerful and important story. Sometimes I feel I have read enough of the black history and do not want to hear yet another story but this book was more than that. What drives us all to our heart and to our most inner place is universal. VERY WELL written and a must read!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"As a senior in high school, I read the Bluest Eye over spring break last year. Having read several of Morrison's novels, I expected nothing less than excellence. What I found exceeded all my hopes and wishes. The Bluest Eye is a novel that, much like Beloved and Song of Solomon, captures the spirit of its main character so tenderly and emotionally that one cannot put the book down. Any reader will empathize with young Pecola's ultimately unattainable want, eagerly devouring the pages of the supporting story. Morrison set the standard of high-quality, strong-character, delicately-drawn writing in this first novel, and does not disappoint in later offerings. A perfect book for a first time reader of Morrison or a long time fan. Obviously, anyone interested in the African American experience MUST read this novel--it depicts the emotional landscape of the soul better than any of its predecessors. Read The Bluest Eye and savour Toni Morrison's rich language and emotional commentary!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"if you've never been through this? Ok, a lot of the things that happened in the story don't blatantly occur today. I, however, enjoyed this book, despite its sexuality. For me, this is a life that's not far from the truth.I grew up on the Mississippi Gulf Coast (God bless my lost home), and I *definitely* know about racial disparities and the desire to be something you aren't. I remember being in the sixth grade and believing that my eyes would be blue one day. I really did.The brainwashing of beauty still exists. There are still blond-haired, blue-eyed white women plastered all over just about everything. And there are still easily-influenced black girls who struggle with their images of themselves and what they \\"should\\" look like. \\"The Bluest Eye\\" describes this well.Someday my daughter will read this book, and prayerfully she won't have to deal with some of the issues in it. As a black woman, I've come a very long way. I've learned to accept every part of myself, and this book showed me that--even if in fiction--others have similiar experiences.I read a previous poster's comments about Morrison portraying blond hair/blue eyes as negative, evil. The reviewer even said that some black men consider white women to be more beautiful than black women, hence why they often go for them. I chuckle at that. The last time I checked, it's not *black* women who are getting lip injections and even *butt* injections. It's not the black women lying in the sun trying to get darker, only to look like a leather handbag at the age of 40. Oh, so much more I could say about this, but I'll end it there.\\"The Bluest Eye\\" was a good read. It takes a level of maturity to overlook the sex and understand the deeper meaning of its issues. The turn of society is ironic. Thank the Lord that I was born with everything now so desirable. Maybe someday brainwashed--or \\"whitewashed\\", to be more literal--girls like my former self will realize their worth."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I bought and read The Bluest Eyes yesterday at the bookstore and today it was announced as Oprah's new pick. I have read and enjoyed Toni Morrison before so I was anxious to read this short story. I was not disappointed and did not go to sleep until the book was finished. What struck me in the story is that beyond the prejudice of color the characters lives are all touched by some element of &quot;being looked down upon.&quot; All the characters face the pain of not being respected and treated decently by others. Pecola unfortunately happens to be the one that is at the bottom of the heap so to speak. This story touched me because so often people look for the &quot;ugly&quot; in others to make themselves feel better and don't stop to think how deeply hurtful that is to others. Haven't we all wished for something to make us more beautiful, more loved like Pecola who dreams that merely changing the color of her eyes would change the direction of her life."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I believe that Toni Morrison is one of the most challenging authors America has ever produced. She fails to ever talk down to her audience, but rather, challenge us to aspire to higher levels of meaning by writing challenging literature of the highest quality. Thus, &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; falls into that category.As her first novel, Morrison herself suggests that at the time of her writing this, she was not advanced enough to handle the language, and therefore, finds it somewhat clumsy. The book I read was incredibly rich and deep, inspirational and chilling.We find one narrator of the story, a little girl named Claudia, retelling the events of a another black girl in her small Ohio town, and the horrible things that Pecola had to endure. Described by nearly every character in the novel as &quot;ugly&quot;, Pecola's only wish is to have blue eyes, so that she can attain the societal expectation of &quot;attractiveness&quot;. Pecola comes from a warped, unsupportive family, which thereby shapes Pecola's viewpoint and outlook on her own life.One thing Morrison does so efeectively in her novels is switch narrators whenever she sees fit. At times, Claudia tells us the story; at others, a third person narrator allows us to soar above the story and get more important information that a little girl may not be privvy too. At at times, we even learn about the events of the story through women who merely gossip the story. The effect allows us, the reader, to garner more informaton, some of it in personal ways, to allow us a grander sense of this story.Morrison's literature, in every sense of the word, challenges the reader at every turn. This is not a book to read lightly, or just dabble in. Because of her writing, and her writing style, she is able to make grand stories out of the most ordinary people; to give voice to those characters in literature most often overlooked or marginalized in our culture. Morrison must keep writing to allow those voices to ring clear, and add to the cacophany of voices that make America as strong as it is."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye by Ms. Morrison is a heart-wrenching, and thought provoking novel. This novel was a perfect example of fully developing the characters in a book. Pecola was never described like the other characters in the book like her mother and father, and the people in her community. Her direct description of herself and her life were not necessary because Morrison described the people who had a direct impact on her life. We see why her life is the way it is because we get a good in depth look at why her parents treat her the way they do. After reading some of the more negative reviews of this book given by other Amazon readers I have to wonder did they actually read the same book that I did? The only thing that I can say I agree with is the fact that the book does move slowly at times. One could even argue that this is not one of Morrison's more polished works. She herself even tells of the flaws that she feels are present in the novel. But, can we remember that this was her first published novel.Pecola is a product of her environment. Her parents are an example of why people should not have children until they have dealt with all of the garbage and bad things that happened to them as children. The bad childhood experiences in parents lives will undoubtedly shape their children's futures. Pecola also represents the psychological damage done by a media and a society that has for centuries held up the image of white, blond hair, and blue eyes as the standard of beauty that even some whites can never attain let alone a young, poor, black girl. Pecola is a prime example of why African-American parents must always instill in their sons and daughters a sense of pride in their heritage, culture, beauty, and talents. Without this teaching our young African-American children are doomed to be Pecola's- individuals with low self-esteem who will always place their beauty and self-worth in abstract things or people."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Like my title says, The Bluest Eye was not quite what I expected. I read this book for my AP Lit class during the summer and when I skimmed the summary, I thought it might be a lighthearted book, but I was wrong. Before my Lit class, I'd never heard of Morrison or read any of her books, therefore I didn't know that she was a great and powerful writer- whose stories deal with various issues. The Bluest Eye, was no exception.The book was confusing to read at first, since it switches point of views, at at some parts, readers aren't sure who is narrating or whose story is being told. Pecola is a sad character and I feel highly sympathetic for her as she is abused and eventually goes mad. It is the obsession of bluest eyes that drive Pecola to her desperate need for beauty in the terms of bluest eyes (whiteness).The insight into the lives of little girls shows that adults do take advantage of children and in their authority, forget that they are dealing with precious beings that are dependent on them, such abuse spirals and repeats itself-- sins of Cholly's father repeats in Cholly, as he abuses his family.Very powerful book but definitely not something you should expect a HEA from."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"My book review is also posted on my blog at [...]. Here is the text from that review:I recently read The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison. I chose to read this because of an article that I read about a parent who was attempting to ban this book from her child's school library on the basis of it being \\"pornographic.\\"The Bluest Eye is the fictional account of a young black girl in the years following The Great Depression. It deals with racism, incest, and child molestation as well as issues surrounding our culture's obsession with beauty and how it's defined.The same week that I read this book, which is fiction, I also read the real-life stories of Jaycee Dugard, who was held captive by a child rapist and pedophile for 18 years, and Melissa Moore, whose father was a serial killer who tortured and murdered women. I talked about these books in my Readin' post here.So, all three books deal with the difficult issues of child abuse, rape, incest, and pedophilia among other things. But two of the books are based on real, actual events, and one was a fictional story. I'll let you guess which stories were the most horrific. As I said in my Readin' post on the two non-fiction books, truth is stranger than fiction.The Bluest Eye was published in 1970, and was Toni Morrison's first novel. It is a beautifully written little book that deals with difficult issues. There is a scene where a young girl is raped by her father, but that is representative of the culmination of a myriad of issues that swirl around the characters. Incest is not the primary focus of the novel, but the brutality of the scene brings all of the issues faced by this one little girl to a crushing denouement.In 1970, I was in the 8th grade and was about the same age as the characters in this book. I compared my life and experiences as a young, middle class, white girl with blue eyes to those of the young black girls growing up in Ohio in the early 1940s.The black girls in this book compared themselves not only to the white girls (and white baby dolls), but to each other. Your beauty, i.e. ugliness, was defined by the darkness of your skin and the nappiness of your hair. The lighter the skin and straighter the hair, that is the closer you were to the white girls, the prettier you were deemed to be. The ramifications of these definitions impacted your ability to be loved and to love.Our culture continues to be obsessed with often unrealistic definitions of what constitutes beauty - anoxeric looking women with long legs and large busts. Barbie dolls. For a mother raising five daughters, this is the theme in the book that resonated the most with me.I can see why this book is on high school reading lists. In just 200 pages, you are provided with innumerable teachable lessons. My kids read it for an assignment, and I would recommend it to others especially if you want to generate great dialogue about real life issues.It is very difficult to sit down with your kids, cold turkey, and say let's talk about racism or sexism or beauty and conformity issues. It just does not happen that way. They shut down. If you see what they are reading at home or in school, you can open the door to talk to them. I have often picked up a book that they have read (if I haven't read it before), and then talked to them about it. You will be surprised how quickly you can generate a lively conversation. You might learn something new about a book that you had not considered before, and the bonus is that you might even learn something new about your kid.My nephew, after seeing the last three books that I read, suggested that I read something a little lighter next. Like a physics book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"An utterly stunningly picturesque slice of life in a cold and cold-blooded, capitalist, racist, male dominated society. Told at the periphery of our collective consciousness, as if were a daydream -- as a collection of vignettes about a family of women, a \\"stand-in\\" for any black family; indeed as a \\"stand-in\\" for any poor family (of women) in America.It is a story so carefully and stealthily told -- at the speed of everyday life -- tucked away in the subtext beneath the techniques of a skilled writer -- that the very act itself is the definition of pure genius.As American art goes, this is the work of an intellectual magician, a literary and societal --indeed a psychological sorcerer. It is work reserved only for the elite of even the elite of literary geniuses; and told only as a genius could tell it: without lashing out and without the palpable and expected rancor; without even a semblance of conscious intent: There is no need for a hidden agenda, as the pure truth (even when it is imagined) can tell no lies.(Now I understand why we need fiction. The truth hides between the lines, in the crevices of everyday life. Occasionally we need to coax it out into the light of day.)There is no need to scream in the face of American society -- even when it is a powerful scream that is needed. There is no need for \\"calling American society down\\" for what it is and for what it has done to our collective humanity; the everyday details of Frieda, Claudia and Pecola's lives speak so eloquently for themselves (and for us all). There is no need to single out the complexities of politics, for life on the ground \\"vectors\\" directly into the politics above.The writer of fiction gives us the litarary evidence at the level of everyday consciousness of the interconnectedness of the brutality and inhumanity of our cultural system as that brutality and inhumanity is written in the background of the script of society's drama, and as it gets played out daily in the lives of everyday people.

Overall I really enjoyed it and I was interested in reading another book by her. The Bluest Eye was her first book published and received much critical acclaim. I really enjoyed reading this novel. It was very graphic and very intense which added to the greatness of it. Ms. Morrison is a wonderful writer and the imagery and the symbolism that she uses is amazing. The Bluest Eye was an emotional rollercoaster ride. At points I was laughing and amused and at other points I was depressed. The most overwhelming emotion that I felt was sympathy for Pecola. I felt for her and it was very sad to hear about how she was treated and how she was raped by her father, Cholly. I thought that Claudia was a great narrator, and that she was very reliable. I recommend this to anyone who is interested in a great read, despite it not being an overly happy read. I am now a fan of Ms. Morrison's and I look forward to reading more of her work."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison is known for giving light to the isolation of many blacks due to their internalized white values through symbolism; however, the symbolism may be hard for some to understand. For example, the novel opens with a distorted and almost confusing narrative from a Dick-and-Jane reading primer. The less experienced reader may find this narrative difficult to understand, but the more experienced reader should pick up on why Morrison distorts this narrative when she runs its sentences and then its words together.Symbolically, the gap between the words in the Dick and Jane narrative represents the gap between the idealized world of whites and the often dark and ugly world of blacks. Still, the reader is left to wonder if the ideal white Dick and Jane life is better since blacks have internalized it, yet they still are unhappy. In this way, the Dick and Jane narrative and the novel are ironic.It is through symbols and motifs like the Dick and Jane narrative that Morrison best demonstrates her concern with the state of blacks in The Bluest Eye. Not often is the truth about the black experience accurately demonstrated; however, readers can count on Toni Morrison to write about stories as complex as Pecola Breedlove's. Not only does Morrison write these stories, but she paints the words on to the page. Her constant use of imagery in addition to symbolism and irony create a clear picture for the reader to understand The Bluest Eye in a deeper manner."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was very confusing to me. I didn't like how the author jumped arouind from person to person, it made the book very hard to follow. Like others have said also, many areas in this book are quite disturbing. Some of the stuff quite frankly just didn't need to be in the book. I understand that the author wanted to be discriptive and let us know what was going on, but i feel that in parts it was too descriptive. All in all i don't think that many would be able to understand the context of this book. It just goes too deep. but if you like description and can be mature about somewhat disturbing passages, you might enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am a student at Mercy High School and I take AP English. Toni Morrison novels always give readers insight into other ways of life. This painstakingly truthful novel was sad, but it told the many sad facts of everyday life. For example, it dealt with issues like body image, racism and self value. These things were not highly valued by Pecola Breedlove, the main character. Pecola breaks down physically and mentally and by the end of novel, she is still in a million pieces. Although this novel did not have a happy ending, I'm glad that Morrison revealed the hardships of African-American life in the 1960s. Those racial barriers are still being overcome today and this book gave me a new perspective on life. I learned to not take things I have for granted, like my color and my past. These things can't be changed, they should only be cherished. Great novel!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"An indictment of racismThrough the slow descent into insanity of Pecola Breedlove, the 11yo protagonist of The Bluest Eye, Pulitzer and Nobel prize winner Toni Morrison shows us the evidence of racism in the Midwest in the 40s. Pecola, who can?t resolve or understand how and why her life is so miserably different from Dick and Jane?s (the eponymous characters in the primary readers of 1st grade classrooms), and she prays for blue eyes which are, to her, the ticket to privilege and happiness. Her tormenters, including many from her own family, are presented not as monsters but as fully-rounded humans with their own scars and stories and sympathies.This was Morrison?s first book, and it?s not her best. But it?s well worth a read, not only to realize how good she was when she started, but also to appreciate how far she had progressed by the time she wrote Beloved."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"There are things in life we hide from each other to protect the nobility of our angers and resentments. So, that they may survive instead of finally dissipate due to common grounds and understandings. It is only by reading this book and any other of Toni Morrison's outstanding literature that we may begin to chip away at the wall we have built between each other.

It has a lot of sexual scenes in it, and some swearing, which might be offending to some people but to most is really no big deal. The author has an incredible writing style, awesome way of describing things, and is just over all brilliant. I actually thought that the last page and the afterword were the best parts of the entire book, because it made me appreciate the book more and made me realize that it actually was a really cool novel.

Morrison begins the novel with a clever use of a textresembling that of a Dick and Jane primer (&quot;See Jane. She has ared dress.&quot;), pointing out that we all grow up with Dick andJane. We all learn that Dick and Jane - whoare both blond and white,mind you - are the children we should be.What happens, do youthink, when a child can't stop comparing herself to Dick andJane?...As relevant today as it was when first published,&quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; is a cautionary tale, reminding us that thevalue a society places upon a woman often becomes the value she placesupon herself.A good beginning for a reader unfamiliar withMorrison's powerful, award-winning prose."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am not much of a bookreader, but a friend recommended this book. From the moment it started I found myself feeling like I was in the environment. Morrison writes very detailed, and precise even with the natural language.That is another thing - the language. I was suprised at how she was able to incorporate the slang, horrid southern grammar, etc while still being tactful.It is a drawn out book therefore I have managed to put it down, and weeks later come back and feel like it is a whole new book again. There tends to be a lot of characters toward the middle of the story, and therefore gets confusing if you stop reading it for weeks at a time.I'd still recommend the book if you want to learn about the southern life relating from a younger aged women perspective. I even found that I was laughing at a few parts of the book, then a few pages later I'd be almost crying."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Our book club picked The Bluest Eye to read because Oprah had said it was her favorite book club pick. I really did not enjoy reading this book but was forced to finish it because of my book club obligation. Although this book made me extremely uncomfortable, I am glad I read it. I have read a few of Oprah's picks and they always depress me but they are stories that I would not normally pick myself and they always show me a side of life that I have not experienced.

The Bluest Eye, when it was originally published, was probably the African-American equivalent of Portnoy's Complaint. The airing of the dirty laundry - quite literally - that many thought better to be kept hidden... at least from outsiders, who have so little respect for us anyway. Obviously some Amazon reviewers are repulsed by the scatological descriptions. No, it is not pretty. And it is not really &quot;about&quot; Pecola Breedlove or her family or classmates other townspeople of Lorain, Ohio. It is about America. That dirty little underside of American history, like dirty underwear. It is the aftermath, the results of slavery, the deep and profound self-loathing that comes from everybody hating you, that in the year 2000 we are finally beginning to shed. Forget blue-eyed baby dolls. Today we have the Williams sisters (you go, girl) and other shining models of beautiful blackness. Maybe The Bluest Eye, obviously required reading in many American Lit classes, helped bring that about just a little bit."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is the second inspirational novel we have read by Toni Morrison. Our first eye-opener by Morrison, Beloved, has a fast moving and detailed plot. The Bluest Eye, on the other hand, brings you face to face with the African American's view of &quot;perfect&quot; in a predominately white society. This is an alarming and moving story that is not the typical novel on predjudism.

Every time I read it, I find some emotion hidden in the work that I somehow missed before. This was one of the most moving books I have ever read, and a real eye-opener as well.Having grown up white in a stable, middle-class, 1970's and 80's home, I was unaware of the diversity of life. I had never imagined the type of life Pecola had to endure. By the time I read this book, I was very aware of such conditions, but the novel didn't simply tell about the conditions, it made me feel them.I was especially struck by the actions of Claudia as she received her white baby doll. I felt proud of her; I could feel along with her. The fact that Morrison so elequently and convincinglypaints the portraits of Claudia and Pecola that _anyone_ can feel along with her proves that Morrison is an author not soon to be forgotten.This book has the power to change people; this is the little book that, if read with an open mind and heart, could truly allow people to see that inside we are all the same."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book and the rest of her work is far overrated. Toni takes the attention span of her readers for granted. She wastes far too much time setting up a scene or with description that the reader is no londer interested and becomes irritated.

No, racism against blacks is still very strong today and reading this book will give you a momentary glimpse into what it is like to face prejudice and torment simply because of the color of your skin.This book is about a black girl named Pecola, who would be pretty if only she had blue eyes--or so she thinks. Actually, if she lived in Kenya, everyone would think she is a cute child. But she does not live in Kenya, she lives in the United States, where a person is automatically disregarded simply because of the color of his skin. Remember Rodney King back in '91?Pecola is warm and tender-hearted. However, she has trouble making friends due to being shy--as well as the color of her skin. There is subtle racism against her throughout the book. You thought your high school bully was bad? That was nothing compared to what Pecola faces in this gripping novel.Pecola also has a troubled family. You will read about her father Cholly's upbringing, and the torment he went through at the hands of the white man. Then you will understand why he does what he does near the end of the book. (Hint: it involves Pecola)Read this book.

RileyTennessee"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"While Toni Morrison is more than worthy of her status as a Nobel Prize Laureate for Literature, her first novel here is somewhat of a disappointment to me. The story is about an eleven year old girl, Pecola, growing up in 1941 with World War II and the end of the great depression in Morrison's hometown of Lorain, Ohio. While I applaud MOrrison's attempt to create the atmosphere by using realistic devices such as a dialogue, slang, and cruel truths of life. Pecola leads a very bleak life with a father, Cholly. The book first states that she is carrying her own father's baby. I got confused while reading this book about Cholly's role as father. I'm not quite sure what happens to Pecola. The book is disjointed at times with different narrators and not a single voice. I felt lost at times and confused by the situation around Pecola's life. While I applaud anybody who writes a novel, this book was somewhat disappointing because I still felt that MOrrison was trying to find the right voice. Regardless, Morrison does write a powerful, grim, bleak novel but I still hold hope for Pecola's life."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"this book was kind of hard to understand. I had to go back and reread a lot of the time. I also didn't like how it jumped around from person to person. It confused me and some of the times i didn't know who they were talking about half the time. Toni Morrison is a very very descriptive author. I can tell she wants you to visualize it the way she sees it so she describes everything to the max. The only problem with the whole describtive thing is the sex scenes. That was way too graphic. You would have to be mature enough to read that. If your not then this book is definetly not for you. I like how this book tells you about the racism and how the ideal girl is blonde hair and blue eyes, and how they deal with it.All and all this book was pretty good"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is often advertised/promoted/raved as the story of a little black girl named Pecola who wants blue eyes and her struggle with identity. But it's not about her at all really. It's about people around her, mostly her parents. Pecola is barely even in the book. A little in the beginning, very little in the middle and a little at the end. Her wish for &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; isn't even an issue with this book really. Pecola's not really an issue with this book. No more than her parents Cholly and Pauline Breedlove. I feel that it should have been MORE about Pecola as advertised. One problem is that this book is too short. Only 215 or so pages and it mostly focus on Pecola' s family and friends and we're left wondering just WHO Pecola is. WHY she wants blue eyes, WHAT events that happened to HER that makes her feel this way (aside the fact that white and half white girls seemed to get treated better, like the half white Maureen Peal).This book doesn't go into the depths of Pecola's mind &amp; heart and she becomes just another character in this book and not even one of the main ones! I think the author, Toni Morrison, should have written ANOTHER 215 pages or atleast 115 pages mostly on Pecola Breedlove, so we could have gotten to know her better!It's a decent book as far as a story goes about blacks struggling in 1940s Ohio. But if you've heard Oprah Winfrey's rave reviews and other rave reviews talking about the story of Pecola and her struggles, you will be disappointed because that's not what this book is about."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"The Bluest Eye\\" is Toni Morrison's first novel, a Nobel Prize winning classic that captures the untold and too often ignored history of pervasive, institutionalized racism in the United States- the personal side.Focusing on a girl named Pecola, Morrison follows the lives of several African Americans as they deal with living in a world where black is most definitely not beautiful. Feelings of self hatred- of both themselves and their race- dominate their emotional lives, resulting in decisions that let fathers abandon families, women abandon their self-dignity, and friends abandon each other as they all strive to make it in a white man's world. Pecola captures this sense of worthlessness in her quest for blue eyes, in her desire to become more white so that the world, her family and so called friends included, will find her more beautiful.Toni Morrison's characters drive the book, appearing in the early stages of the book as cliches- no good fathers, whores, drunks, broken famiilies- presenting African American stereotypes common in American society. As she explores each character's past, however, Morrison chronicles the struggles and adversity that brought these characters to their present condition, paths fraught with violence, poverty, hopelessness, and racism.Toni Morrison should be required reading in every high school and college. History prefers to ignore the harsh truth of America's racist past and books such as \\"The Bluest Eye\\"- well written, compelling, engaging stories of people living at society's margins- remind us all of what it was really like living in the United States in the early twentieth century for African Americans. This book is an undeniable classic."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is an intimate and oftentimes startling look into the African American experience. But what's so unique about this book is that Whites never make an appearance. These characters woes are caused by their own inner tightly knit community.

Their own inner demons are the culprits.I have to say this book has remained at the top of my all time favorite books."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was the first book to ever make me cry. This book is incredibly intense and not one to be read through quickly. It has to be read and then contemplated in small sections(just like most Toni Morrison books). If you are looking for a light hearted story with a happy ending this is NOT it and you should probably steer clear of Toni Morrison all together. This book is meant for a more experienced reader that prefers a lot of substance. You will be moved."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this book years ago and I thought it was a very good book. It has curse words, but it is done in taste. There is nothing wrong with a word and there is nothing wrong with talking about sex.

It's reality."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have loved this book since I first read it 6 years ago. It is so much more than racism/poverty/incest. This book is the story of a girl's infinte desire to be someone other than herself. I think this book would be good for young women to read because we all have these thoughts. And wether she wanted to be Hispanic looking or Purple looking isn't the point. To me it's the fact that she doesn't want to be herself.

Naturally I read the book to prepare for the role and was deeply moved by it. Despite the subject, I have always been rather mature and found the book to be intrigueing and well written, despite the sometimes uncomfortable nature of the material. Performing the play probably was the best way for me to experience this book because of the analysis that went along with rehearsing. I am now 14 and appreciate this book more than ever because of the personal experiences that I had with it. Be assured that even if this book leaves you a bit perturbed, you will have read an astounding piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This novel was the first Morrison book I read, and I was amazed at how complex she could be in a pool of simplicity. Very well written, deeply felt, and thought provoking. \\"The bluest eye\\" is certainly a masterpeice in it's own right."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"After reading The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, I was truly impressed by how she conveyed the stereotype that surrounds blond haired blue-eyed girls. She showed them as being an icon to others not just as someone to be jealous of, or someone that is not worthy of getting attention. She makes Pecola Breedlove, drink milk over and over again because she likes the Shirley Temple cup so much, if Pecola was so jealous of Shirley Temple than she would have not wanted to drink out of the cup. But instead pecola idolizes her and drinks out of it to feel closer to being the ideal body type. I think that Toni Morrison's intention for this book, was not to make people feel guilty for having this stereotype, or to make people sympathize for those that do not carry this \\"burden,\\" but to prove to everyone that this type of stereotyping not only exists but it effects many people around the world.Having this book be told by a small African- American girl, with a whole lot of family problems can make it seem a bit odd that she believes having blue eyes will solve all of her problems, because her appearance is not the only thing that needs to be fixed. If I were her I would be more concerned with not ending up like either one of my parents, do to their past history. Instead she has a worse fate brought on by the selfishness of her father, and the lack of love from her mother. But, in her mind none of it matters because she has blue eyes, or so she thinks.I also really enjoyed this book, due to its time period and diversity in the characters Toni Morrison chose. I found it interesting how none main characters, could have such a huge impact upon the readers feeling toward this young girl. It made you feel sorry for her and confused at why anyone would treat her the way some did for how she looked. It gives you the feeling of sympathy for her so that you will understand her reasons for wanting blue eyes, and her need to be excepted.By reading this book I hope that everyone walks away with a feeling of self-esteem, because I have realized from reading this book that everyone wants to be something they are not. Everyone wants to change something about themselves. This book emphasizes that nobody is perfect, and we should celebrate each person's individualities, not similarities. I myself understand wanting to be something that I am not, but I also sometimes feel that being different can be good also. While reading this book I wanted to tell this to Pecola, tell her it is good to be different. But I can see by the end of the book being different in her time period and living in a ghetto such as hers can only mean pain. I guess it is easier for me to say this, than it was for Pecola to realize, while she was getting picked on for being physically \\"ugly,\\" Meanwhile on the inside she was one of the sweetest most innocent girls ever.Toni Morrisons use of metaphors in this book is amazing, Toni describes life through flowers and how Pecola's father planted bad seeds in his own soil, which lead to Pecola's horrible fate. She also related the story of that summer to why no marigolds grew. This made me think about how everything in life happens for a reason. But if everything happens for a reason why was this happening to Pecola, all she ever got from her life was pain and hatred from others. All she ever wanted was blue eyes why could she not get what she wanted? She hadn't done anything wrong. Did she deserve any of this? I had no answer to this question and still don't that is another reason why I enjoyed this book, because it got me thinking about things that could not be answered and although I hate not knowing why? I hope that this question will come in handy later on in my life when I am feeling down, and I will tell myself that everything happening has a purpose. Toni emphasizes every detail of every characters life using imagery, it makes you feel that you are in the book along with the characters. That you are part of the story and that keeps you reading because what happens to them happens to you to. That is what is so fascinating about this book how many emotions you can feel all at the same time. You feel sad for some people, angry at others and even happy when you know that Pecola thought she got what she was longing. The majority of the book is depressing but in a positive way. At the end of the book you finally see what has become of Pecola Breedlove's life and her family, It makes you want to do something about all the things you see wrong in our world today.I loved this book Because of how I could relate to it, I would recommend this book to everyone, although It can be a bit gruesome at times. It has an energy to it that most books do not have, it inspires hope and gets you thinking about how great and awful life is at the same times. It is a great book for people to read especially teens."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am a blue-eyed blonde woman, and, to me, this book is important to people of all colors.

We also dealt with the prejudice in both families. I am now married to a Jewish man and we're still dealing with the cultural differences and prejudice. His grandfather pats my head and talks about how he can wait for his dark-haired, dark-eyed, olive-skinned grandson to have \\"beautiful blonde babies\\" with me.

Her work is filled with harsh realities and gritty descriptions of everyday life. The characters do not get the happy &quot;Hollywood&quot; ending.

However, I think this is Morrison's weakest work, as she often slips into explanations instead of letting the story relate us these ideas on its own."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Picked this book upon hearing good things, only to discover a story that is poorly weaved together and disturbing at times. Definitely would have been better if Morrison had focused on one point of view, but instead jumps around, making whom is speaking difficult to dicipher."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was the second Morrison book I read, after first reading Song of Solomon. Not only did I read it but also listened to the audio version. As with most of her work, it is a mix of the normal with the mystical, natural and the supernatural. But at the heart of the tale, is a little girl who wants to be accepted, who wants to be seen or noticed. I, growing up, sometimes wished I was White, thinking that life must be better in a different skin color. That concept is wonderfully fleshed out the narrative of the story. And the revelatory narrative in the last chapter is quite moving. If you enjoyed Song of Solomon or even Sula, you will enjoy The Bluest Eye!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was the first novel I read by Ms. Morrison and it just walloped me. I thought the dialogue between the two sisters was touching, wry, and as true to the way close siblings talk to each other as anything I've ever read. In this book, it is the humanity of the children that emerges, and that is the beautiful part of it. Of course, evil wins in the end, but we know it - it's so blatant - that we come to hate evil, and that is the true value of the book. I am in awe of writers who can portray evil in such a vivid manner. Stephen King did it in &quot;The Stand&quot; with the &quot;Walkin' Dude&quot; and the clown in &quot;It&quot; and Dostoevsky with Stavrogin in &quot;The Possessed.&quot; It's a rare and exciting thing to find, and I applaud this poetic, highly skilled writer.&quot;Beloved&quot; and &quot;Sula&quot; were my other favorites by Ms. Morrison. &quot;Beloved&quot; was certainly the most seering depiction of slavery I have ever come across in the writing I've read. A real consciousness-raiser for me - &quot;plantation life&quot; without a drop of that gussied-up &quot;some-slaves-were-happy&quot; routine. I really appreciated that. She's a great storyteller, no matter how you slice it. Can't wait for her next book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is a book that deals with many sensitive issues, including, race, sexuality, and incest. It is about a young black girl who develops the idea that beauty is to be blonde with blue eyes. The development of her way of thinking is explained through the background of her parents and her own upbringing. This can be confusing to the reader because the plot will start and stop in a completely different place, and it can take awhile for the reader to get on track with what the author is thinking about. This is a different and interesting way of presenting the plot; and although it can be confusing, it gives the reader an inside look at why the girl's life is how it is. It shows how deeply experiences of an adult's childhood can affect them when they are grown and their children. This book gives a sometimes disturbing look at reality, and things that happen that we would never want to beleive. Everyone can relate to the girl's wish to have a different appearance and the thought that everything would be so much easier if you could just change one thing about yourself. This shows the danger of not teaching our children that they are all beautiful in their own way and how important it is for them to love themselves for who they are. The reader gets a first hand look at the effects that racism and racial superiority can have on a person. A major lesson can be learned from this book, and the reader might find that they have more of an understanding of racial beleifs. Despite the gruesomeness of reality, The Bluest Eye is good, but can also leave the reader quite disgusted."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I did not care for The Bluest Eye. I had heard so much about Toni Morrison I thought I would read this book (my first by Toni Morrison). It was difficult to read; very disjointed; the writing did not flow. I almost took it back to the library before I was half-way through but decided to stay with it until the bitter end. When I finally finished it, I returned it to the library and then went among the stacks to locate some more of Morrison's books, thinking perhaps I could find another that would strike my fancy. I stayed at the library for a time and tried to interest myself in some of her other writings. It's no use. When she isn't being obtuse, she is being plodding. There are altogether too many other outstanding novels out there for me to read; no more Toni Morrison, thank you, even if she is a professor."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I recently read this book because I know what a brilliant writer Toni Morrison is. She is one of the few writers whom can keep you mesmorized with such vivid descriptions and attention to detail. However I think she fails in 'The Bluest Eye'. The writing was completely fragmanted and disjointed. The charactors who were the focus in this book were so poorly developed. There were also charactors who were irrelevant to the story. Why all the description of Mr. Henry when he really did not have anything to do with the plot? Yet the other charactors besides the main charactor named Pecola never quite unfolded.I am dismayed that this book ever made it on Oprah's Book Club collection. I assume they have somewhat of an alliance as Oprah starred in the doomed movie production of 'Beloved'. I do not expect all books to have a redemption factor or constantly pleasant circumstances. The novel 'She's Come Undone' was at times painful to read. However the author was able to write the horribly flawed main charactor with such love and empathy. I felt that 'The Bluest Eye' chronicled the hideous treatment of Pecole in such a rushed and gratuitous manner.One positive aspect of this book is the ending. It was not predictable. The last chapter really left me heartbroken. Unfortunately, the ending could not come soon enough. I certainly hope Ms. Morrison's next book comes from the heart rather than a sensationalistic idea to yet publish another book to be featured on Oprah."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; to be yet another work of art by one of the greatest authors alive. In a lot of the book I felt for Pecola, mainly because she didn't know, nor was she told of the beauty that was deep inside of her. She lived in a kind of dysfunctional family, in a time when there were no real avenues for knowledge. It only made her a victim, but not a monster. Ms. Morrison portayed this very well. Sometimes we can be so self absorbed in becoming something we deem better until we lose all site of who we actually are. In this we end up living a made up lifestyle and losing out on the real person.This is Pecola Breedlove."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison is one of the best fiction writers of this era, and she has proved it again and again. The Bluest Eye, Morrison's first novel, is a rich and heart-wrenching story with language so exquisite and beautiful that moved me in many ways.The story is about Pecola, a girl whose only dream is to have blue eyes. Her perception of beauty is somewhat deluded, but that's the sad reality African Americans have endured for decades. The novel emphasizes self-hatred, but the focus in the story is not how one perceives one's beauty, but rather how others perceive it. The secondary characters are essentially important in the novel. Pecola, the focal character, is not quite as developed as the others. I think Morrison wanted the reader to comprehend other people's perception of Pecola's beauty -- or lack thereof. It is sort of an outsider looking in type of thing. Pecola's story is both tragic and thought provoking. One might wonder: how do I perceive beauty? Is beauty really in the eyes of the beholder?This is -- without a stretch of doubt -- a thinker's novel. Oprah has picked an excellent book. Toni Morrison is a gifted storyteller. I strongly urge to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read this novel long ago, and was happy to see that it has recently become much more popular. Toni Morrison realistically taps into the desires of children, such as the desire to feel acknowledged by one's parents, or the desire to feel beautiful. Sadly, her characters fail to see the beauty they already possess, and instead seek validation from people who might hurt them.The language of this novel is both poetic and gritty. Morrison is too honest to let elegance keep her from depicting the tragedy and betrayals in many families. But she is also too gifted to simply present a tragic situation without using language that elevates its characters above that situation. She allows her characters to affect our lives, no matter how helpless they might seem in shaping their own lives.I would recommend this book to anyone who has dealt with abuse, rejection, or internalized racism. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants an example of great black literature, great women's literature, or just plain great literature."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; after I finished &quot;Song of Solomon.&quot; As soon as I finished the last page of &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;, I flipped to the beginning and reread it.

I commend Oprah's selection of another of Toni Morrison's classics."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have read most of Toni Morrison's books and as an Eng teacher, I wanted my students exposed to her as well. Last spring, I decided to try The Bluest Eye for class reading in a novel course. It was one I hadn't read. The students enjoyed reading it. The book is the type that promotes extensive discussion. It's thought provoking. The high school seniors were glad to finally read a piece of literature by Toni Morrison and to &quot;become aquainted with&quot; Pecola. We read the book as a class this past Jan., and we were thrilled to hear that it's a news Oprah choice. Thank you Ms. Morrison. I hope these students enjoyed the book enough to keep reading."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm surprised at the hostility towards Morrison's first novel. I've read and taught almost all her later novels (Song of Solomon, Sula, Beloved) which are much better, but it's worth reading the Bluest Eye to see where Morrison has come from and where she was going. In fact, it's one of the more interesting projects for any author/s: read their later masterpieces and then go back and read their very first published work. One can at least see the power of her writing and her vivid descriptions which come back in a much more mature form in Beloved. Morrison has grown a lot since 1970, and if you read her own feelings about the novel (posted in the critical reviews), you'll see that she herself would probably only give 2-3 stars to this book. Still, as an early novella and certainly her most accessible book, read it as an introduction to her later and better works."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's \`The Bluest Eye' originally published in 1970, is her first novel. It displays an abundance of talents of a great writer who later (1993) won the Nobel Prize for Literature.The novel is set in Lorain, Ohio, in 1941. It is the story of 11 year old girl, Pecola Breedlove. This is a powerful story which draws from several themes such as historical memory, racial hatred and several other important themes. Pecola who is a black girl and attracted to blond, blue-eyed children and prays for her eyes to turn blue like the children she adores. The journey of Pecola 's agony is powerfully portrayed and crafted aesthetically.It is a poetical examination into the beauty of logic and irrationality behind an American family and how and why this innate beauty gets wasted and overlooked in the World's most democratic society.It is not just a story of Pecola Breedlove, a young black American kid. You may find similar characters all over the world. I have heard stories similar to Pecola in many countries where I have lived including Australia!No wonder why it is a best seller and resurfaced again winning the attention of thousands and thousands of readers. It may be the reason why it was selected for Oprah's book club in April 2000."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"&quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; is a heartbreaking look into one little girl's world. Morrison brings to life the inner voice of a girl desperately seeking love and acceptance in a society that is all too conditioned to withhold it. I first read this book in college and it has stuck in my mind ever since, especially Pecola and her journey. Beautifully written, it actually works on many levels for readers of all ages. Don't let its simplicity fool you -- within Pecola's story is a profound and searing message that we should all take to heart."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye is a wonderful book with a beautifully illustrated depiction of life. Morrison employes words in her novel better than Fitzgerald to emit the resounding voice of poetry. She delves into the minds of characters and explores the reasons for the characters' present personalities. In addition she constructs the novel in such a way that you can not be quite sure of anything until its end. Although she broadly explains everything that will happen within the first chapter, it is not until the end that the reader completely understands what she means by &quot;there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941&quot;. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is the story of an 11 year old victim of circumstance--the circumstance being her ugliness. Heart-wrenching in parts, Morrison writes of the importance of beauty and to what lengths a person would go to achieve the stereotypical &quot;beauty.&quot; This book is the first that I've read that deals more with this social issue of what is beautiful than with the issue of race relations. Not to say that race isn't talked about, but it isn't the primary focus of the novel. This was a fantastic book, an interesting and thought-provoking read, and a reason to read more of Morrison's work."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"If there is any novel that is a kaleidoscope of emotions: pain, love, hatred--this is it. If there is any novel that is exquisite and disturbing, it is this novel. It is the story of a little girl that doesn't know how to love herself and is therefore uncapable of loving. Her environment is one of violence and pain and longing. She longs to be loved. I found myself wanting to actually reach out to her and hug her, to show her what love is like. It is a shame that she is never aware how truly wonderful love can be and how it can make her feel--how it can make her self-hatred and low self esteem evaporate. The language--as I always find in Toni Morisson's writing--is beautiful but subtle. The plot is not hard to grasp and stretches itself wonderfully throughout the book. Truths are told; things that society needed to hear then and still need to hear now. But I warn you: this book will rip your heart out."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I bought and read The Bluest Eyes yesterday at the bookstore and today it was announced as Oprah's new pick. I have read and enjoyed Toni Morrison before, so I was anxious to read this short story. I was not disappointed and did not go to sleep until the book was finished. What struck me in the story is that beyond the prejudice of color the characters lives are all touched by some element of &quot;being looked down upon.&quot; All the characters face the pain of not being respected and treated decently by others. Pecola unfortunately happens to be the one that is at the bottom of the heap, so to speak. This story touched me because so often people look for the &quot;ugly&quot; in others to make themselves feel better and don't stop to think how deeply hurtful that is to others. Haven't we all wished for something to make us more beautiful, more loved like Pecola who dreams that merely changing the color of her eyes would change the direction of her life."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I had never read Morrison until I accepted a challenge to read more books by women and by minority or third-world authors. This was just one of the books I agreed to read -- and I'm very pleased that I did.The tragic existence (can one really call it a &quot;life&quot;?) of Pecola Breedlove is a disturbing slice of reality. Morrison has shown even me, a white American male, the horror of growing up a poor black girl among a people who could not recognize her precious value. Convinced that the bitter, ugly world would be changed if could see and be seen with blue eyes, Pecola's tragedy is felt by the reader, who can see the emptiness of her hopeless wishes.Since reading &quot;The Bluest Eye,&quot; I have read other books by Morrison and had similar moving experiences. As I mentioned -- it took the challenge of a friend to introduce me to this book -- thanks, Kristine!"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; for a college class in American Literature. While the basic emotion of the story is important, I did not care for the writing style; it's too disjointed. Pecola is never the speaker. Too much of the book is devoted to descriptions of other characters. The basic theme is a black child looking to be loved in a world that equates love with beauty, and beauty with blond hair and blue eyes. It's very sad. But Pecola is a victim of everyone, including her family, and the storyline jumps around too much. I was also extremely put off by the nauseatingly graphic ways Toni Morrison describes physical living -- from food to illness to sex. This is not a book you can read with a snack in your hand. If you like reading descriptions about snot, phlegm, vomit, swallowing globs of Vicks salve, child rape, animal abuse by angry children, sexual satisfaction produced by loose sanitary napkins, dogs choking on poisoned meat, and preachers who can't resist female children's blossoming bosoms, and an unhappy ending, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although many of her novels can be complicated, Toni Morrison's Bluest Novel is very simply put. However, your thought may be complicated relating to the story. Explaining the struggle a little black girl faces when she decides she wants her eyes to be blue, Toni depicts a struggle that everyone faces at some point in their lives, striving for the impossible against all odds, and then having to come to an compromise. We can be our own worst enemy and our most encouraging supporter all at the same time"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am not afraid to look the reality of colorism in the eye and acknowledge that it does exist within the black community. It is my greatest hope and dream that someday the dark skinned black and the light skinned black will be seen as one family in the future. I want so much to love the lightskinned sister and brother as my own reflection and not be divided from them or made to feel that one is treated better than the other, but sadly, that day is not here and this book bravely and powerfully illustrates that point to the fullest.I am a medium brown colored woman, my mother was very dark skinned and I have witnessed the evils of skin color prejudice all my life. In most situations, it was Black Men who were prejudiced against myself and the women around me beccause of our coloring. These men felt no shame or limit in their racist intra-family prejudice and measured their entire lives by how many light skinned or white women they could attain and how light brite their children could come out. It's everywhere and anyone who denies it is both a fool and a liar.That is why I highly recommend THE BLACKER THE BERRY by Wallace Thurman. There is no truer portrait of the self-hatred among our people than the one extolled in this book, and what makes it even sadder is that this book was written in the 1920's. So that only shows how deep this kind of evil runs.Lately, I have become very interested in this subject and I have searched for other books that explore this subject with intelligence, honest, beauty and wisdom and I have found several that I consider to be classics on the subject of Colorism.(1) MARITA GOLDEN'S book \\"Don't Play In the Sun\\" is definitely the most modern up to date book of the bunch. It expertly weaves the story of her life experiences in the 1960's Black Power movement with the current struggles of women like Serena Williams and India Arie to find their way in the world, even in the midst of being shunned and ignored by the black community itself. The book's analysis of the Hollywood casting system and the \\"Mulatto Follies\\" of BET and MTV is priceless.(2) \\"The Bluest Eye\\" by TONI MORRISON is by far the most riveting and painful book that I have read on this subject of colorism. I believe that her book, more than any mother, gets to the psychological and historical root cause of the problem and exposes the mode in which we pass the problem on generation to generation. The destruction of an innocent black girl named Pecola Breedlove will leave you heartbroken and shocked as you see the bold naked truth unfold right before your eyes. You can't ignore this book, because the story being told is the one that you are all too familiar with no matter what color you are.(3) \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" by African novelist KOLA BOOF is another deeply powerful book that examines colorism, but not out in the open. This book is unique in that it focuses on a very enchanting love story between a Black Prince and Princess and follows their reincarnations through history as they struggle to find their way back to each other. Through detailed moments in black history, both in Africa and the United States, the provocative author highlights the way that black people originally viewed their beauty and humanity and then juxtuposes it against the way they see themselves now in the modern world. The result is nothing less than devastating. I love this book so much, because the storytelling is so rich and the depth is so sweeping and grand. Anyone who loves good writing and is proud to be descended from the Black race will find themselves literally changed forever by the powerful images depicted in this very poetically moving story.(4) \\"The Color Complex\\"--VARIOUS AUTHORS, is a very simple, straight forward analysis from a sociological point of view. Much research and statistical facts are used to illustrate that our communities are infested with these issues.(5) \\"The Darkest Child\\" by Dolores Philips is another great novel that shows us the poor blacks who live under the poverty line ingesting these complex social hierarchies based on color and how they not only expose their children to them, but force the entire community to live by the \\"color code\\". Everybody is used to it from slavery and the system goes on and on unchallenged. In this book, Tangy Mae, the darkest of 10 children by the white-looking mother Rozelle, struggles to find her dignity and confidence in the midst of her evil light skinned mother inflicting one horrid abuse on top of the other. One thing I will say for the evil white-looking mother, Rozelle, is that she treated all of her children hiddeously and with contempt, from the whitest to the blackest. But she killed the child who was born looking"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye tells the tale of so many African American children. This particular child, Pecola Breedlove, believes that all her troubles will go away if she only had 'blue eyes' like the white girls, and blonde hair. She believes she would be loved if she had 'blue eyes'. The want of 'blue eyes' may not be the desire of all African American children, but it is a symbol of how systematically we brain wash our children into believing being just who they are isn't good enough. Who are the WE that I am speaking of....Black People, White People, Human kind. However, I can only speak from experience. This story struck me so deeply when I read it, when I finished I was depressed by the fact that we think we have moved so much farther than we have. Having help raise three girls who were of varying skin tones, I know what it is like to be in a mall and have a white person come up to you and say, \\"Oh, isn't she pretty!\\" to the light skin child and you have 2 dark skin children standing there beside you also. How do you reply? \\"Yes, thank you, all my girls are beautiful.\\" What good does this do...the damage is already done. All the explanations in the world later can't undo the damage that was done to the dark skin children as well as the light skinned child who then begins to believe that \\"I am different\\". Morrison has written a powerful story, and I have heard many say they don't understand it...maybe it is because you just have to live it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was so engrossed by this book I could not put it down. Ms Morrisons style of writing is captivating. Pecola thinks that if she only had blue eyes her world would be better. Her hard home life makes me want to take care of her myself. I loved the way each chapter opened, with the words all running together. Like thoughts that are too much for one to take in. I highly recommend this book, it is one of Ms Morrisons best. You will not be able to put it down,especially when you learn how Pecola believes she truly does have blue eyes."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye by T. Morrison deals with a lot of themes: Racism, the idea of beauty, sexual desire, and self-hatred. One clear thing is that all of the latter themes are indirectly caused by the first one.Many of the people in this book hate themselves because they are black and dark-skinned, which they deem as ugly. The ugliness they perceive in themselves influences the ugliness they show towards others, especially the protagonist, Pecola.Pecola wishes for blue eyes because she sees a direct connection between acceptance and the \\"blue-eyed, blonde hair\\" image. A connection reinforced by her own mother who basically abandons her own family for the neatness, cleanliness, and simplicity of the white family she works for.One thing Morrison seems to want to convince the reader of is the idea that the destructiveness of blacks by other blacks should be blamed mostly on whites. While racism and white oppression are certainly a reason for certain behavior from minorities, it can't be used as an excuse. In the end, we all have choices. We all still have a will. If there were no free will, punishment would be worthless and useless. You face adversity, and you choose to go left or right. Responsibility has to come down to the individual. Nothing Cholly experienced, whether it be his sexual humiliation by two white men or his parental abandonment, can justify the rape and inpregnation of his own daughter. Toni Morrison tries to FORCE our sympathy on Cholly and Pauline, but I have none for them whatsoever. Their behavior destroyed their daughter, who was one of the only TRUE innocents in the novel. It's possible to UNDERSTAND people's reasons for things, but we still can't EXCUSE them for those reasons.One thing I can look at in The Bluest Eye to justify my claim that being a victim of racism is not an excuse for self-destruction is the way Claudia rejects the idea of the \\"white equals beauty\\" message. She hates the white baby dolls, and she is confident in her own self-worth. Anyone with a brain can decide to reject destructiveness rather than embrace it, if they want to. It just amazes me a 9-year old could, but not grown people.The idea of blackness and dark-skinnedness as less attractive is still prevalent today. Who are the black women who are exalted as representing the ideal? Halle Berry, a mulatto woman, and Beyonce, a woman who seems to not only be getting lighter and lighter, but her hair seems to mysteriously be getting blonder and blonder. No black woman seems to be acceptable unless she has straight, long hair even though none of our ancestors in Africa had a perm. Even B.E.T., a station created to celebrate blackness perpetrates this \\"ideal\\" image of what shade, figure or design a black woman should be.This is a bleak book not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of depth here. I could talk about it for days."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I recently had the privilege of reading Toni Morrison's book \\"The Bluest Eye\\". It is a not a lengthy book, but it is a powerful book. The story takes place in 1941 in a small town in Ohio.As a reader, this book is subject to my own perspective; that of an incest survivor who was impregnated by my father, as was Pecola Breedlove. Both Pecola and I \`lost' our babies; Pecola's failed to live, mine was not permitted to live.Incest is common. Far too common. Incest is no respecter of persons. It has no socioeconomic preference. It is found in the poorest homes, and it is found in king's palaces.I love the way the author begins to tell Pecola's story. In the first paragraphs of the book, she discloses the \`secret'...one of the many reasons for the shattering of little Pecola Breedlove. She later shares how Pecola responded to a lifetime of being used and abused by the adults in her world. Toward the end of this book, there is a brilliantly written conversation that Pecola has with an alternate personality. In the foreword of the book, the author calls this \`hallucination'. I suppose it is a hallucination of sorts, although I see it as dissociation, a child-like attempt to survive in a world that fails to nurture. Most young children who are sexually molested suffer from what was formerly known as \`multiple personality disorder', now known as \`dissociative identity disorder'. This conversation allows the reader to have a close look at this personality disorder.The story begins with its own ending, allowing the reader to be \`in' on the secret which was kept and exposed at the same time. The exposing of the secret early in the book prevents the reader from being later assaulted by its strong truth.Pecola's lifelong desire to have blue eyes is a heartbreaking indictment against mankind. Who among us has not, in one way or another, sent the subtle message to a black person that being black is less than desirable? We may think our message doesn't show, isn't heard or seen, but the young Pecola read the message clearly as the store clerk first ignored her presence and then, finally after serving her, received her coins of payment without touching her tiny black hand. His refusal to fully \`see' her shouted the unspoken truth that Pecola had heard too many times already. Pecola really believed that she was ugly. She really believed that if her eyes were blue instead of brown, that she would be beautiful and acceptable in the sight of mankind.The author states, \\"One problem was centering: the weight of the novel's inquiry on so delicate and vulnerable a character could smash her and lead readers into the comfort of pitying her rather than into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing. My solution-break the narrative into parts that had to be reassembled by the reader-seemed to me a good idea, the execution of which does not satisfy me now. Besides, it didn't work: many readers remain touched but not moved.\\"I found this breaking apart of the narrative to be one of its most powerful points. It is in this breaking that the full impact of incest is realized. Incestuous homes are homes filled with fractured people who continue to break themselves and others again and again. By going back in time and filling in the earlier details of the lives of Pecola's parents, the reader begins to see a pattern and a reason for the many routine, exceptional and monstrous rejections that became a part of Pecola's \`unbeing'.By likening the death of Pecola's baby to the loss of Marigolds in September, the author skillfully and beautifully provides the reader with \`a skip in the natural order of things'. The book is about racial injustice, but it is just as much about the tragedies of incest, which are not related to race. Incest also causes the \`unbeing' of its victims. Incest also teaches the victim that he or she is \`ugly' and \`unacceptable'. Pecola's story is a compounded tragedy, since she was forced to endure both racial injustice and incest.In the end, Pecola fully believed that she had the bluest eyes of anyone in the world, and that was the reason people could not bear to look at her. In a futile attempt to undo her \`unbeing', she fabricated a truth that explained and eradicated her ugliness and unacceptability by society, at least in her own blue eyes."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was required reading for a student.

I recommend this book and above that recommend reading it with a group."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This is my second time reading this book and my first time truly understanding it. Each of the characters evokes some intense reaction and emotion. Toni Morrison is truly deserving of all her accolades."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"\\"The Bluest Eye\\" describes a story that takes place in the early to mid-1900's, which revolves around three African American girls named Frieda, Pecola, and Claudia. You will be able to experience the joyous and tragic moments of these three girls lives, and witness the struggles they approach through the harsh racism and segregation acts of their time. The story starts out as your typical African American family living with little money and living with some troublesome neighbors. Although there are some enjoyable events at the beginning, things go downhill as the girls start to get older.The audience I would recommend this for are young adult African American students, or students who are interested in African American culture The story is quite alright for the male audience; however, I highly recommend that females read this story due to them having the ability to understand the emotion of the characters a whole lot more."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I'm a high school student at Highland and our first assignment in Ethnic Literature class was to read and analyze a book. My group decided to read \\"the bluest eye\\". This book is about a colored girl named Pecola she is told her and her family are ugly people. Pecola is put in someone else's home because her dad is a drunk and her mother can not take care of her. Pecola is very entertained at the house because she meets Frieda and Claudia. Pecola goes back to her home when everything is considered to be in order. One Saturday afternoon she is home and her dad comes home drunk. Something happens that marks Pecola forever. Pecolas journey through out the book is intense sad and interesting. I recommend this book to adults and teenagers not children under then sixteen because there are some sexual and bad words."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This story is about three African American young ladies being raised at a time where whites had more respect than anyone else. Pecola Breedlove dreams and prays for blue eyes,she wants people to socially accept her and wanted people to look at her with acceptance as they do on to little white girls. Pecola's father sexually abuses his daughter and gets her pregnant.While I was reading this I noticed the girls were always being told they were ugly. Pecola always wanted something she could never have. Something to make her feel beautiful. She would be bullied by older boys. She would hope and pray for blue eyes she wanted the bluest eyes. She always desire true love but it was taken away from her when her father sexually abuses her multiple times and she became pregnant and she was the \\"talk of the town\\". Leaving her all alone her friends turned away from her. I believe this story should be read by juniors and seniors in high school. Its an eye opening story of oppression and adversity that many Americans have had to overcome, it is a story to remember."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is about black people who don't have much money but still are surviving. Where they live they are treated bad because where they are from black is considered ugly and this made the characters insecure and want to look like something they weren't. Since The Bluest Eye is mainly about black people's view of themselves, I recommend that African Americans read it to understand other peoples' perspective on how they feel about themselves. I don't recommend this book for children under the age of 15 due to the scene of rape and sex references. This novel is definitely something that parents need to read so they can be informed on who they let around their children. I believe that the hard cover book is better to buy because this novel is something that should be passed down from generation to generation."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Pecola and her family were poor and black and lived in a life of misery where there was much racism. Pecola wanted blue eyes so bad that she would do anything for them. She was the the one that suffered the most out of her entire family. I encourage teenage girls especially from the age of fifteen to eighteen to read this because I believe most girls can relate to the story. Girls are never satisfied with themselves and this book is a great example of this situation.People would really love this book.

It has stuck with me to this day. There is nothing in the book to \\"enjoy\\". It is exceedingly and extremely gut-wrenching.This novel does not follow the usual format for fiction. The plot is not very complex, there is only subtle character development. Instead, Morrison spends a great deal of time examining a variety of characters and how they got to be who they are. So, rather than seeing characters change through a complicated plot, as in most good novels, you instead are taken on a journey into how the characters got to be who they are.This novel is a tale of the horrors of segregation, racism, and brutality. There are strong sexual themes, so it is not appropriate for children.While I cannot imagine that anyone would \\"like\\" this novel, I think it is something everyone should consider reading.

But it's not about her at all really. It's about people around her, mostly her parents. Pecola is barely even in the book. A little in the beginning, very little in the middle and a little at the end. Her wish for &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot; isn't even an issue with this book really. Pecola's not really an issue with this book. No more than her parents Cholly and Pauline Breedlove. I feel that it should have been MORE about Pecola as advertised. One problem is that this book is too short. Only 215 or so pages and it mostly focus on Pecola' s family and friends and we're left wondering just WHO Pecola is. WHY she wants blue eyes, WHAT events that happened to HER that makes her feel this way (aside the fact that white and half white girls seemed to get treated better, like the half white Maureen Peal).This book doesn't go into the depths of Pecola's mind &amp; heart and she becomes just another character in this book and not even one of the main ones! I think the author, Toni Morrison, should have written ANOTHER 215 pages or atleast 115 pages mostly on Pecola Breedlove, so we could have gotten to know her better!It's a decent book as far as a story goes about blacks struggling in 1940s Ohio. But if you've heard Oprah Winfrey's rave reviews and other rave reviews talking about the story of Pecola and her struggles, you will be disappointed because that's not what this book is about. I was going to buy this book but instead borrowed it from a library.

I actually read some of the paragraphs out loud just because they sounded so beautiful.....I don't agree with the authors conclusion in the &quot;afterward&quot; that she, the author, should not have assembled the narrative into &quot;parts that had to be reassembled by the reader&quot;. I thought it worked extremely well. I usually get bored reading about the characters' family, their parents and grandparents, etc., but in THIS book, I was in awe of the author that she could make me enjoy reading about every single character in the book. I believe that Toni Morrison actually DID lead her readers &quot;into an interrogation of themselves for the smashing.&quot; That outweighed the pity we felt for the character. This book deserved the Nobel Prize - which it won. This book is worth the price and was a pleasure to read.

The first, Beloved, had a animated and charged plot. However, The Bluest Eye steered in a different direction. We were put inside the life of a struggling teenage girl striving to be a part of the &quot;perfect society&quot;. The novel touched us because we are two teenage girls reading about the hardships of prejudism through the eyes of young women. There are not many novels that send a message through the lives of young women. That is what places this novel in a class of its own. We recommend this novel to all young women who are mature enough to handle the realities of prejudism and the sexual scenes. This book will be an eye-opener to all who read it. This was written by two students of Mercy High School."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is very engaging from beginning to end. It is a sad commentary on the life of this poor back child who's life's dream is to be Shirley Temple.I finsished reading it a week ago and it is still with my mind. I lay in bed at night and think about the converstaions that I'd like to have with Toni Morrison about it. One of my principal thoughts is: do whites really treat blacks so poorly as to create that extreme lack of self esteem? The novel gives me the idea that even though the framework is white society, that the abuse and self loathing is perpetuated amongst the blacks themselves. I ache with the pain of their suffering.I am so captivated that I've just started reading 'Tar Baby' another by Toni Morrison.

It very powerfully illustrates the waypeople can internalize self-hatred. The conversations between the children and the powerlessness they feel in the adult world are also masterfully described.

There is very little fiction out there now that is worth the time it takes to read. This is not only a meaty, moving story but an excercise in beautiful use of language.

And to think, this was her FIRST novel..."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although the subject matter is troubling, this is an excellent work of literature. Her use of language, mood, characterization, etc. truly show a gift which I haven't seen in a long, long time in any recent books.Transitions are seamless and the story flows easily from one character to the next; her text invokes deep feelings - an art which seems to have been lost.This was a 'down' story - and I felt disappointed that such a writing gift was used to stereotype black families - but I enjoyed reading such pure text."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison has a reputation for writing stories that stand for something besides fictitious. The Bluest Eye delivers on this account, with the issues of racism in classism in early 20th century America being pushed to the forefront. This gripplingly graphic narrative tells the tale of young African-American girls growing up in the south. The impoverished girls struggles with the adults around them represent the struggles that every adolescent faces, magnified a hundred times over by the impossible situation in which they live. The average child argues with a parent; young Pecola, one of the girls, is raped by hers. Eventually, a sense of self-hatred develops in each of the girls as they gain an understanding of the fact that society views them as just not good enough. This self hatred opens the door for the cycle of poverty to continue as the girls do not respect themselves enough to pull themselves out of the hell they occupy. Only one of the girls comes to terms with her feeling of inadequacy by convincing herself that she has been granted blue eyes by a local magician.Toni Morrion is one of the best writers of the past century and The Bluest Eye flexes her considerable literary muscles, exhibiting interesting and creative uses of viewpoints and timeframe. The transient journey through poverty is both chilling and magical."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is well written but a little too tragic for me. I have read many of the books on Oprah's Bk Club but my only complaint is that many of the books she chooses are tragedies.

Morrison, though sometimes difficult to understand has a beautiful way of writing. Her storyline deals with one of the most prominent issues of American life, racism. She tells the story of a poor black girl, whose only wish is to have blue eyes. Morrison shows racism from the point of the victim, not of the one using the racist comments. It's a completely different perspective from what I have grown up seeing. Morrison definitely did well on her first piece of work. I would recommend the book to anyone, it will definitely teach you a very important lesson... to know a person you must look inside their heart, not at their face."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I was also a bit reluctant to pick up this book, as Morrison is a bit daunting in reputation. I'm glad I decided to read it though. The writing style Morrison brings to the pages is very descriptive, and yet very understandable. The story itself is easily followed, and is touching. She uses several narrators throughout the book, and each one helps us understand the situation. She shows the history of the hate..the roots that brought them here...but not in an annoyingly verbose way that sometimes occurs. The book is so well written with a plot that is very touching...it's a shame not to read this."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This was a great but simple read by Toni. It was moving and captivating. I found it easy to follow and passed it on to my teenage daughter.

It takes place in Ohio over a span of four seasons and depicts the struggle of a young black girl. Pecola is only eleven years old and has been throw worst hardships than most of us have gone throw our whole lives. Her father is an alcoholic and her mother is a mean abusive hag. The people in the neighborhood abuse and use her while calling her ugly repeatedly. This little girl has nobody to care for her and is persecuted by black people for being black and looking black. They call her the ugliest thing walking, because she does not measure up to beauty standard set by icons like Shirley Temple. She lives in poverty and blames herself wishing that she could have blue eyes so that people will love her. The story ends with Pecola convincing herself that she has the Bluest Eyes.This fictional story is all too realistic and possible. Toni Morrison does an excellent job of dealing with a very sensitive topic while getting a very vivid point across. This was her first book and she wasted no time dealing with race and the horrible and lasting effects if has on people and their perception. This is an important book, however, its not a book one should choose to read for fun. The Bluest Eye is heartbreaking account of a little girl's life brought about by racism, physical and mental abuse not only by her parents but also by the entire community."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Morrison uses beautiful language to describe a not so beautiful story about some not so beautiful people, at least according to a society that judges a person harshly on their looks. Symbolism is on every page, with the underlying theme of self loathing evident beneath the many changing narratives. Morrison can sometimes be pretentious, but she always leaves the reader questioning the world around them. After reading this a second time, it is easy to see why weird celebrities like Micheal Jackson can grow up to hate their own skin color so destructively. Here's a good example of how such a possibility can begin. The scene where Pecola tries to overcome her shame buying three pieces of candy is as painful and heartbreaking as any passage in a Richard Wright novel. Before Alice Walker's The Color Purple came along, this story was already out there, as part of an all too slim and overlooked genre: the black female experience. Morrison deserves awards for all her books, if only by refusing to shy away from life's brutalities. Disturbing moments in a fictional story are nothing compared to the disturbing histories of many black americans, and it's important that their lives be given a voice. In fact many voices, which Toni has always been skilled at putting to paper. She is truly a gifted talent. If you're going to write about heavy subjects, you can't gloss over them to make the reader comfortable. That would be a cop out to both the truth and the creative process. Let's hope with under less than ten published books Morrison still has more stories inside her. The human race and literature need her."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was interesting. It draws you in, and you yearn to know what happens with this little girl. I thought this was a really good book."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This wonderful novel is a story of an eleven year old girl, Pecola, who goes through the hardships in life such as being raised in a ghetto neighborhood, how it is like to be treated when your African-American, wishing you could be beautiful like the blue-eyed white girls in school, and growing up physically as a girl.Pecola grows up in a big family and her family suffers through many hardships because they are not wealthy; they eat leftovers and buy cheap groceries. Pecola prays that she could be one of the little girls who sleep in their extravagant beds with little Raggedy-Ann dolls with pictures of their family all by their bedside (Morrison 20). She just wishes her family was normal, which they are far from it. Her father got drunk every night and would have weird rants, her brother has a traumatizing experience (almost like being raped), and the mother is just a little on the \\"loony\\" side.Not only does Oprah recommend this book, but I do because you could easily relate to Pecola personally. If you have ever lived in a poor neighboorhood or knew someone that went through hardships in a neighborhood like that then you would really enjoy this book. The author, Toni Morrison, uses amazing detail and imagery that makes the story really easy to picture in your mind.The reader would like this book because it shows what a pre-teen girl in the 1960's had to go through in everyday life."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book has received more reviews than I can count.

Understand or be confused by.

After reading Beloved, I saw the similarities in the novel also by Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eye. This novel was a very strong and influential one. Morrison portrayed the harsh racial differences that occurred in 1941 by describing the life of two young poor black girls, Claudia and Pecola.I can relate to this story. Pecola focuses on her imperfections throughout the whole book at the age of eleven. She believes that her ugliness is the reason why her parents don't love her. She wishes for blue eyes because she thinks things would be different if she had them. In this society, many people try changing themselves to be someone there not. It's a huge problem today, and we all have to learn how to accept who we really are.

It's better than the too-long SONG OF SOLOMON, but still not as good as JAZZ--her best novel, if you ask me. THE BLUEST EYE is amazing, though, and at times deeply depressing. I found the incidents with the cat and the dog to be particularly horrifying, and the rape scene is written so horrifyingly well that I practically felt guilty--as though I were the rapist. It's an incredibly powerful story with a very sad ending...and the mysterious, lengthy conversation that Pecola has with her \\"friend\\" near the end still has me wondering who she was talking to.

Each time i read a new chapter i was moved by the language, it was really a sort of poetry.

The Bluest Eye was well-written, creative, and thoughtful. However, I thought it was a bit hard to get into. There was so much stuff going on, so many different perspectives to take into account, that at times it got a bit confusing for me.

This book has been banned in several places because of its contents, for various reasons. I had thought I read this book way back when in high school ~~ but whatever I read then didn't compare to this book. This book is totally unforgettable and tragic.This is not just one story. This is a collection of stories of different people in different times of their lives and their stories lead up to the tragedy of poor little Pecola Breedlove, an ugly girl (I suspect that is a metaphor that Morrison is trying to say about the ugliness of poverty and racial tensions) who is not loved. The stories are of her father as a youngster; of her mother who was a totally different person who married for love only to be brow-beaten by poverty; of people around Pecola, and about two sisters who tried to befriend her but got swept away by circumstances created by the adults in their lives. This is a novel that depicts humanity at its worst. This is of a time before civil rights were fought for ~~ perhaps dreamed of but it hasn't been swept to the point where people are actually standing up and taking note of it. This is a story about poverty and how it dehumanizes the characters. This is a story about neglect. Pecola is set in the center of the storm that she has not created herself but is too young to resist and too ignorant to ignore.This is an eye-opener of a novel because even during my \\"poorest\\" days as a student, I never had to worry about finding enough to eat. Pecola is not a sheltered nor were any of the characters coddled (except for Mrs. Breedlove's charge in that fancy house that she's the cook at). Yes, there are crude moments in the book but for some reason, it just emphasized the poverty of the people's lives. Yes, there is rape. That is the tragedy. But it was not explicit like a lot of the soft-porn novels floating around out there. It is a very sad and tragic book ~~ a disturbing look into reality portrayed in a time that I don't know of.Would I recommend this book to anyone? Yes. Would I \\"love\\" this book? No. There is nothing lovable about this book ~~ there's no happy endings. It really should not be portrayed as a novel because most fiction ends with a happy ending ~~ not this one. And this book would definitely provoke thoughtful conversations among friends.9-11-07"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye is truly an inspiring and a moving story. Through a child eyes, Ms. Morrison takes us on a journey to the most innocent and perverse thoughts every human being has, including violence and despair. This book will make you think and feel. I applaud the author for writing about our misinformed society. This book is a must read for every person that has an interest in our social conditions."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In this tale, Morrison recounts the destruction of Pecola Breedlove, an African-American schoolgirl in 1940s Ohio. (Morrison reveals the ending - in brief - at the beginning, so I haven't given anything away here.) The author uses narrative from various points of view (Pecola herself, one of her classmates, her mother, and her father) and spans several decades to tell the story.Ultimately, the story is a powerful illustration of how experiences and viewpoints (in this case, mostly negative) get passed on from parent to child. Morrison further reveals in her afterword that this novel (her first) was an exploration of \\"the damaging internalization of assumptions of immutable inferiority,\\" and \\"something as grotesque as the demonization of an entire race could take root inside the most delicate member of society: a child.\\" These lessons are well taught through Morrison's adept storytelling.The prose is gorgeous. I regularly relished Morrison's beautiful diction, phrasing, and narrative technique. In that regard, the book is a fine piece of art.Morrison laments that the story \\"didn't work: many readers remain touched but not moved.\\" The goal was that the readers would, rather than pity Pecola's destruction, be led into \\"an interrogation of themselves for the smashing.\\" Although the book may not lead to as much introspection as Morrison wished, it still managed to evoke deep emotions."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison's \\"The Bluest Eye\\" accurately identifies how females are treated by men and their female peers. The characters in this novel reflect on a low income family that was considered ugly. This was the Breedlove Family.This novel also portrayed how Pecola Breedlove was misused by family and friends. For example, Pecola was talked about negatively by her classmates. As a result, no one wanted to hang around her. The reality of this novel is African-American children all over the world are treated in the same manner.Cholly Breedlove, the father of the Pecola, was an alcoholic. As a result, one night Pecola's father molested her while washing dishes. Moreover, Pecola told her mother but her mother didn't believe Pecola's accusation.In conclusion, I recommend this novel for anyone who enjoys a novel that has comparison to real life scenarios. This family is a great depiction of how African American families were treated by both whites and blacks."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I read The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison in one sitting. I was hooked from the first page by the author's beautiful prose, a sing-song melody of the written word that I have never before or since experienced from another author's work. Then came the story, a heartbreaking tale of a young black girl who wants to be someone she is not, blonde haired and blue eyed because of how she sees herself, how others talk about her ugliness and worst of all, how she is violated by her own flesh and blood. I was so moved by this book; the words stayed with me long after I put it down.

Morrison herself has written several books like Sula (1973) which won a lot of criticsm, Song of Solomon (1977) was a best seller and culled several prestigious literary awards, Tar Baby (1981), etc. In 1993 Toni Morrison became the first African-American woman writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. The Bluest Eyes is her first novel which was published back in 1970.The Bluest Eyes is a heartbreaking story of a little black girl who is longing for a pair of blue eyes. Racism is the main issue of the story. Toni Morrison asks the reader to see how painful it is just to be black because a black woman, unlike a white woman, has to struggle against gender discrimination and also fight against racism at the same time. So, in this book we can see clearly that a black woman experiences double oppression, one for being female and one for being black.The story is about a little black girl named Pecola Breedlove. She is convinced by the community that only blue eyed girl is beautiful. Blue eyed girl gets the best in life. So, Pecola who does not have blue eyes feels inferior. She was inundated with talk and images which asserted her inferiority in terms of physical beauty and the superiority of white girls like Shirley Temple. Her inferiority grows more and more when several bad things happens to her especially when she was raped by her own father.Beside racism, the story tells about the oppression or violation of children, especially poor children. Here we can picture that children are granted no voice. Pecola's mother never listen to her, even when she said she was raped by her own father. As the result of her oppression, Pecola learns to identify the oppressors and begins to believe that the oppression is just and proper.What is great about the story is how the writer wrote the story. The story of Pecola is not narrated by Pecola herself. We, as the readers, only get pieces of information about Pecola told by other people - Claudia, Pecola's mother, and Pecola's father. We only have her narration when she was talking to herself, when she became insane. Besides narration, Toni Morrison also writes the story in a unique way. At the beginning of every chapter there is a part of the story which is found completely in the beginning of the book about Jane and her family. It is a brilliant way to contrast the story of Pecola which is miserable with the story of Jane and her happy family.Yet, The Bluest Eyes is a good way of spending a spare time. It is very beautiful, tragic, and don't bother opening the dictionary because we don't need any. In addition, this book is written in a marvellous way that we could laugh to the nave and silly children's way of explaining things and at the same time burst in to tears, feeling sorry for Pecola Breedlove."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"How can I begin?This is probably one of the most intense, most haunting, and one of the greatest novels I have ever read. It is also one of the most controversial ever written, with many different opinions. However, mine is that the universal message as well as the themes within this novel are deep and beautiful.The characters in this story are within all of us. Every person has longed for love and to be loved, to be accepted, be be viewed as beautiful. We have to plant our \\"seeds\\" carefully, to find this love and to see ourselves as beautiful. It is a testament as well as plea to all races and genders that we must put aside our fears and differences of each other to find the beauty within all of us.As I said in the title, The Bluest Eye could pass as a poem. The writing is so free, and so smooth; and the voice is amazing. I am in awe of the poetry of the words, and the richness of each character. Toni Morrison truly pours her heart and soul into developing every aspect of her storyline, and the end result is wonderful.I know that the imagery in this story can be incredibly intense and that there are some bits that are very disturbing. However, you have to think that it is her superb writing style that creates these emotions and responses to this book. It is a very gifted and amazing writing who can cause such images and gives so much emotion to the reader. I am throughly amazed.I strongly suggest reading this with a group. Some of the things you read are SO strong and often disturbing that it is very good to dicuss it, even chapter by chapter with others...NOT a beach read by any means!However, if you want something amazing and a story that will stay with you for days, read this. You will feel incredibly rewarded that you stuck it out and will certainly have some interesting things to talk about with you literary friends!However, if you want something light and fun for a day at the beach or the coffee shop, stay far away!Finally; if you enjoyed The Bluest Eye I recommend Sula, another very good read by Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I personally liked this book because Toni Morrison's writing style is just incredibly beautiful. As I read through the book, I felt like reading a collection of poetry whenever new characters came out. This sad story of a poor, young black girl made me meditate what truly is the standard of beauty and how people judge each other only by their outer appearances. I was impressed while I was reading this book because it showed how people can make a person realize how physical appearance can seriously influence one person's life. I thought this was really true because these days, many people judge each other by their physical appearances. Also, it is easy to find people who are dissatisfied with their looks. Thus, the perception of beauty is a massive issue that people change their behaviors to different people, different gender, and different race. I believe that each individual is beautiful in their own way if they have pride in their identity. This is a general statement but I want to mention that inner looks are so much more important than outer looks. This book gave me various lesson by meeting different kinds of characters and mostly I learned valuable lessons from viewing Pecola's life. It was also interesting to read an afterward which was written two decades after the book was first published. Toni Morrison had made many comment on what she has done and what she was trying to make the readers think about this novel. I highly recommend this book and I think it is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I would DEFINITELY recommend The Bluest Eye to my peers. While reading this book I felt that Toni Morrison was trying to get her audience to realize that \\"Love\\" is the answer, and also instead of judging someone help your brother or sister in need no matter what the circumstance is.Because you never know how you could change their life. Eventhough the book takes place in the 40's it identifies with some of the issues the main character(Pecola) was going through and it is really hard to believe that roughly 63 years later our world is still like that. To really get the message across Morrison uses \\"Love is never any better than the lover\\" as a way to end the book and to me that is what makes Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye \\"Simply Deep\\"."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book is about a girl named, Pecola. She lives with her father and mother, and her younger brother, Sammy. Her father is a drunk. He abuses her mother every night he comes home drunk. And her little brother, Sammy, runs away a lot. In the year of 1941, the year the marigolds in the Breedloves' garden do not bloom, Pecola's life does change, in a painful and devastating way. Pecola wishes that she had blue eyes like the white girls. She thinks that if she had blue eyes, that people would look at her differently, in a good way. And she thinks that she would look at things in a better way. But in the mean time, she still sees herself as being ugly. By the way the grocer looks at her, and how the young black boys make fun of her. And also how the light skinned girl befriends her, but yet still makes fun of her. In my opinion, this story is depressing. So i wouldnt recommend this book to a person that doesnt like being depressed. I personally liked the book because I like books that have racial conflicts in them. And this story mainly deals with racial conflicts."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"In The Bluest Eye, Toni Morrison wanted to relate the devastating effect racism had on African-Americans. Had Pecola been raised in a stable household she could have been better equipped emotionally to deal with those forces that dictated the social ideal of beauty, but Pecola's sensitive nature stemmed from an abusive household; therefore, her need to search for support outside her home was crucial. The problem was that outside her home, the world was full of \`Maureen Peal's', the blond-haired, blue-eyed children of America who inherently possessed the idyllic beauty this country so cherished; hence, Pecola's wish to change the color of her eyes. But was not her family's instability due to the social inacceptance of their race? Had not their instable characteristics been inflicted on them by society only to become a vicious, unending cycle of abuse which they reluctantly passed on to the next generation? You be the judge. This is a great story. I strongly recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I picked up this book in an airport and, even though I reached my destination, I hard a hard time not returning to its pages. I don't think I can put into words the profound affect that this book had on me, but it opened my eyes to the cruelty of society, and how we all contribute to it, even though we think we are innocent bystanders- our bystanding is actually contributing to this cruelty. It reminded me that the gossip and bad-mouthing of people serves the purpose of making us feel better about ourselves and can hurt people to the point of madness. Through this realization, I hope to combat contributing to this in my own life. Of course, the book had many other themes as well, but this one really hit home for me."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Toni Morrison is a wonderfully gifted writer. Her use of language in The Bluest Eye is exquisite. Through the use of different points of view, she captures the different motivations of each character and offers us a platform from which to understand their actions. My question is this...if this book is about the perception of beauty, did Pecola have to be raped to convey the theme? I believe the story supported Ms. Morrison's point without the brutalization of the child."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I can understand Morrison's dissatisfaction as an artist with this book, as it is less mature than her later works, but I myself feel no disappointment towards it. I was interested in this book because I *loved* Beloved. I was curious to see whether Morrison's earlier novels worked on so many levels. I was pleasantly surprised. I guess nothing can live up to Beloved, but I found this as poetic, lyrical, and emotionally wrought as Beloved. I guess it would have been better for me if I hadn't read it just to &quot;compare,&quot; but what's done is done. Morrison's prose, in fact, was just as evocative in the 1970s. The story, which could so easily have been transformed into a sordid tabloid-esque travesty a la VC Andrews, is done tastefully (as much so as any tale of incest &amp; poverty can be). In a society as &quot;look-ist&quot; as ours, the Breedloves -- for this is their story, not just Pecola's-- is as relevant as any: sadly, in America, beauty can make or break a soul, even if they have the bluest of blue eyes."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book made me sad, and yet left me feeling more insightful. Pecola's story is one of wanting blue eyes, and to fit into the world and be accepted. She envied little blue eyed, blond haired children, and felt she was not good enough unless she too had blue eyes. Her mother didn't help the situation by working for a white family, and to me, seemed to almost favor their children over Pecola. I found it disheartening that this poor child, Pecola went through life thinking that she was inadequate, and even her own mother didn't help to make her 'feel pretty.'This was a wonderfully written book, and very insightful to me to look into a world that I have never ventured in. This is a story that I will long remember."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"First, this book was a good book. No, it was not Toni's finest piece, but how many people do you know that write an instant hit? As far as the matters within, well this story isn't suppose to be about only Pecola. It is a novel about the grotesqueness of those persons around Pecola and how they make her grotesque. This novel is about the dehumanization within the minds of people that are not at ease with themselves and therefore project their ugliness(not so much as physical)onto a little girl that does not deserve it. That is why Toni allows many stories to be told; you can see how these people become grotesque."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"When I first read this book, I did not know the impact it would have on my life. By reading this book, not only have I gained understanding about myself, but others as well. I have a new understanding of the trials and tribulations of my life. I have suggested to all of my friends that they read this book! Truly an expression of the human experiance that spands decades."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"The Bluest Eye made me sad. The cruelty and injustice embedded in Pecola's world was difficult to witness. This child had no where, except her fantasy, to turn for the reaffirmation we all seek. I think it is one of Toni Morrison's best works, but it still makes me sad, probably because it echoes reality in all too many instances."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Although some may question the fairness of it all, I hold writers like Toni Morrison to a higher standard of critique than others. While many may become spellbound by the lyricism of her words, I read her work with the expectation of the warmth of a summer day. The power of her words has the strength of Atlas which are trained to penetrate the Achilles heel of humanity.This book tells all the secrets and opens all wounds. Morrison presents the stark naked psyche of all of the characters. There is a sense of multi-faceted simplicity. We see the rapist/child molesters, prostitutes and others beyond the scope of their actions. We see them as people who have been horribly scared and mutilated spiritually and mentally. Their transgressions places them outside the realm of good and evil because they have been denied their humanity. Excuses are not made or accepted but we are presented with the facts of their existence. This is not about material/physical vs. spiritual, yet the concept is present throughout the book.The overwhelming theme is LOVE. A lack of love, vicarious love, escapist love, etc. According to Morrison, \\"love is never better than the lover.\\" Pecola is a victim of love."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"An unbelievable touch of reality...one that few will ever come face-to-face with, let alone actual admit. Once I started reading, I could not stop until it was over. Painful, yet so true, honest, yet so shameful - many of the words have been said, heard and thought by others for years, yet no one wants to admit them. Ms. Morrison's details of each character, their background and appearance are all to hard to ignore and without it one would not be able to truly relate. A sad account of one child, one family and one community's affliction with their own race. All people of color could benefit from this tale of fictional-reality and perhaps find where it is we all went wrong. It is so easy to place the blame on each other, when in actuality it has been learned; taught, nurtured and accepted...black is beautiful. We say it, but how many of us truly believe it?"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I've just read MANY of the reader reviews for this novel. Why does no one mention the terrible beating poor Pecola got from her mother because her father raped her? I think that beating had as much to do with Pecola's \\"losing her mind\\" as everything else she suffered combined. In essence, she was raped by both her parents. I don't disagree that Ms. Morrison writes with a marvelous style about compelling life themes. But I find no redemption or healing in this novel (nor in her others I've read). Evil is not overcome. The conclusion is dark, lacking in hope. I'm an idealist, and thankfully, I see life filled with redemption and healing, even for horrendous circumstances. I only read Morrison when I have to (and I read this novel for a book club). I regret her view of life in so many of her novels is so overwhelmingly negative, especially since she's such a powerful and influential writer."},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"It has been a while since I read this book, but I recently was involved in a discussion about this Toni Morrison novel, so I've decided to write a review:The book has some brilliant moments, no doubt. But all and all this novel reads like a fifth-grader wrote it, and contains an extremely graphic rape scene between a man and a little girl. This novel, just like The Catcher In The Rye, is nothing but an attempt to write a story for people who love to see negativity and pessimism glorified. A play for that \\"woe-is-me\\" crowd of \\"LEFTIST\\" morons. An easy target to shoot for. If you want to become a famous novelist, just use the Lord's name in vain, over and over again, or describe how you hate the world because it has let you down.Like I said, there are a few parts of this novel I think are great. But there is so much more of it that is just disgusting, whining, and needless complaining. Toni Morrison is the most overrated writer in America today...www.therunnninggirl.com"},{"Title":"The Bluest Eye (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"This book was a waste of my time. Oprah had me believing this book was about a black girl named Pecola and how she thought that if she only had blue eyes, then everyone would love her.
