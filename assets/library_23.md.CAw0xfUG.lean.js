She has an incredible way of describing the feelings and thoughts of the main character, and his view on his relationship with others. She mixes in a great deal of humor through her writing, even though it's a very sad story. I have read almost all of Oprah's Picks and this is among my favorites. I read it in only a few days! You get to know the thoughts of the main character in terrifying detail, so that you even read of his thoughts to kill or punch a face, yet you grow to love him and admire him for surviving in a terribly cruel family and way of life. You will put the book down and wonder about Harley and how you could possibly have helped him overcome all the horror in his life. Well worth the cost of a hardcover!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This was one of my favorite books Oprah has chosen.

One of those books, which have memorable characters."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"As a native of Pennsylvania I must say that Tawni O'Dell has expressed the true &quot;back road&quot; atmosphere of this beautiful state. The character development in this novel is excellent. We are introduced to Harley, who is left to care for his younger sisters while his mother is in jail. One can easily feel for this boy who is just that; a boy that has not had the chance to actually LIVE. Every amount of his energy has been given away. Hopefully you will enjoy this story. Ms. O'Dell is a brilliant author, and I am anxiously awaiting her next piece of literary genius."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Life for Harley Altmeyer starts at the bottom of the social ladder, and doesn't go anywhere but down.Tawni O'Dell weaves a fabulous tale of lower-class white America, with such feeling and heart that it is hard not to at times sympathize with young Harley, who is on the verge of manhood in more ways than just physical age. You want things to get better for Harley; you want him to find closure; you want to see him freed from his emotional and societal prisons. O'Dell creates such a strong characterization of Harley that one can perceive his situation as though the reader WAS Harley.Struggling to be the head of his household, Harley holds down two minimum-wage jobs, and still barely keeps his family above water. On top of the financial pressures of life, he must also be father/brother to his three sisters; their mother is serving out a life sentence in prison for murdering their father...who by all accounts was a hard, cold man who harshly disciplined his children.O'Dell shows the cycle of pain that so often afflicts generations of families, and how difficult it is to break that cycle. Harley, no matter how hard he tries, cannot escape the fate that lies before him. He has the will, he has the opportunity, yet his path is blocked at every turn by circumstances beyond his control. His very future is driven by his past, and as has been observed by many wise sages, &quot;History repeats itself&quot;.Back Roads is a sublime tale, wonderfully written, although very depressing. There are no easy answers for Harley, though they seem very plain to the readers. Harley must balance the consequences for himself...and for this, he redeems himself and those around him by not choosing the easy way out or making excuses. This book is not a &quot;feel-good&quot; story about Americana, but it definitely expresses an America we know all too well.Peace Out."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"In her riveting debut novel, Tawni O'Dell tells the intense and unforgettable story of Harley Altmyer and his family's quest for survival and sanity. Harley's voice is so honest, authentic, and true making him a truly endearing character. He is bitter, violent, loving, wise, resigned, frustrated, intuitive, and innocent all at the same time. Harley is thrown into adulthood to care for his three sisters after his mother goes to prison for killing his abusive father. \\"One day you're an 18 year old guy and the next day your assigned a social worker and a therapist and given the choice of either being a LEGAL ADULT with 3 DEPENDANTS or an orphan with NOBODY.\\" Amber and her overwhelming sex-driven need to be loved; Misty who withstands all the family secrets and bears the most tragic one of her own; and the endearing little Jody with her \\"to-do\\" lists and collection of fortunes which reflect her world of make-believe and an attempt to bring order to the continual chaos erupting around her. Through each tense, gut-wrenching ordeal, the gruesome and exquisite sensory details of sex, violence, lust, and crime will stay with you long after the book is read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This first novel from Tawni O'Dell is so powerful that I am cannot imagine how she will ever follow it up. It's a lot to live up to. Harley is a modern-day anti-hero if there ever was one, but he doesn't really fit the mold of an anti-hero because he does SO MUCH for his sisters and to keep the family together even though he doesn't even realize himself why he's doing it. There's a passion in him that remains always under the surface, hidden under the guise of a PennDOT cap and his father's old hunting jacket. The passion is for something but even he doesn't know what it is -- it's not for a beautiful girlfriend or for sex or for money -- it's not even the TRUTH that he so craves. It's completeness in a way he has yet to realize he will never achieve, because the completeness he's searching for would necessitate a &quot;do-over&quot; of his whole life. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Always fearful that the next Oprah pick might be the best one, I try to read them as soon as they're announced. Back Roads is once again Oprah's typical survival against all odds type of book but I'm not sure I could call any of these characters survivors. They are all tragic in their own right -- even the poor dog Elvis. O'Dell is certainly a gifted writer challenging the reader to dare to stop reading her book and consequently taking the chance of never knowing how it ended. While it was dysfunctional at best it was also riveting. I would have given it 5 stars if I would have liked the subject matter a little more. I found so much of it disturbing but I kept on reading and have to admit, I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Some praise this book while others trash it, but with all such things the truth of the matter lies somewhere in the murky middle much like the characters, sad tragic and damaged souls, tormented by a history they had no control over and future that seems even more uncontrolable than their past, but these are no saints. Outside of the littlest girl there seems not a socially acceptable quality amoung them and yet the reader can't quite bring themselves to do what society has done with them - close the book and hope they go away.It took me a while, but at length I found the author was taking reader on a journey. This isn't entertainment as much as expereince and as such it become a fascinating view into the world of abuse and ideas so evil one can hardly comprehend. Perhaps the main character's fear voiced when confronting his 16 year old sister about the abusive guy she is considering living with are most telling, \\"Would you stay home if I hit you?\\" I shared his horror that she is going to say, yes.The language is foul at times, but revealing of the characters background. Some may be appalled at the young man's poor choices, awful problem solving techniques and his constant desire for sexual intimacy in the most animal terms, but is this all that shocking in a character whose entire existence has lacked the most important of all human elements - love?"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Tawni O'Dell certainly took the high road in her ingenious first novel about a nineteen year-old young man who becomes the legal guardian of his younger sisters after his mother is sent to prison for life for the murder of his father. He didn't have to take that responsibility, but he chose it. As he struggles with physical and emotional exhaustion and instability to make ends meet, he starts to think his life is worthless until he begins a touching relationship with a beautiful older woman. When he loses his virginity to her, he thinks there might actually be a God after all. But it doesn't last. He never seems to catch a break and his tranquility is short-lived. At times our hero doesn't seem like such a hero.Harley is witty, sarcastic and highly sensitive, and he takes care of his sisters. But he's also frightening. He's constantly walking the thin line between good and evil, as if he isn't sure what route to take, and he's so emotionally tortured by his abusive upbringing that O'Dell makes us think that any moment he will crack, as he uncovers some shocking truths about his family and some enlightening realizations about himself. O'Dell constantly keeps us guessing at who the real villain is, until we realize there are no villains but victims.While reading this book on the edge of my seat, I was constantly reminded of a phrase I heard often throughout my school days: \\"Pay attention because there will be a test later.\\" O'Dell pens each sentence with such flair that you'll want to pay attention. No matter how insignificant all the little things may seem, we are constantly hinted that they might become significant later. O'Dell grabs readers with the first sentence and doesn't let go until the last. But even then, she doesn't let go. Readers will remember Harley long after his tale is told, after the tragic climax and tear-jerking finale, and will be left with hope for his future. At least I was."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Amazon recommended this book to me, and I'm extrememly excited that they did. This is an Oprah's book club book, and sometimes I read the books of the month, and like them, but I usually stay away from them. The novel takes place in Pennsylvania, and I live somewhat near the area that the author describes in her novel. I have visited these rural areas out in PA. This book was not overly descriptive in the least, and I was amazed it kept my interest. I usually read novels that are rich in description. I found O'Dell's writing style to stray away from the norm, and it made the novel more interesting to read.The story is centered around a destroyed family that has had to endure abuse and even murder. They are 3 girls between the ages of 16 to maybe 7ish. Harley is the big brother, and has to take care of his sisters so they will not be sent to foster care. The children's mother shot their father and was sent to spend the rest of her life in jail. Through this novel the reader is able to look into their ownself, and see if we make the same mistakes the characerts do.Do we hide what we do not want to see? How we lie, and do no see the truth that stares us in the face. We remember what we chose to remember, and the rest we like to forget to save ourselves from heartache or pain.O'Dell takes you into the mind set of children who were abused by an overly aggressive father. Throughout the novel, Harley ponders why is father hated him, and what caused him to be abusive. Was it because his own father abused him, because he married so young, or because he never had the closure he needed in life? These are the type of questions O'Dell makes throughout her novel. She looks into the Harley's sisters as well. Without clearly stating how abuse affected them, she writes about their characteristics that were caused by the abuse.Harley struggles to make a life for his sisters, working two jobs and struggling to be appreciated by them. He begins a distasterous affair with a married woman, that will utimately bring a demise to everything Harley struggled for. This is a witty novel that combines humor with power emotions and extremely sensitive issues. Who we are? How we learn to cope with abuse, and the need to feel love? The need we all feel to know the truth. This is a must read novel for anyone that has a heart, and understands the bounds that bind people together."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I cracked open the spine of my newly purchased book and inhaled deeply (a passion of mine - the smell of a new book ) This book entitled 'Backroads' by Tawni O'Neill. I had heard recently of this book and the author, on the Oprah show. I was at the very least skeptical, due to it being a new Oprah pick and the complicated tendencies and prejudices whom every avid reader is aware when reading Oprah picks. Although, I have to say, I do usually read Oprah's picks and, in fact, probably own every one of these novels and feel it is money well spent; &quot;well worth it novels&quot;, a valuable addition to my ever increasing library. These books represent to me an intimate involvement of a day or less.This book held me captive for a full three days. Captive to the point where my family began to look at me sidelong and strangely, perhaps because I was spending long hours in the bathroom and the bedroom in order to have a valid reason to continue reading. It also could be the fact that after incessant reading, I get this disoriented look about me, a person who has been startled from a deep sleep; a person who has been a passenger in a vehicle for long hours.This is a sad book. But there is an incredible amount to learn along the way. The characters are original. They create a wonderful thought provoking, endearing, and heart wrenching reading experience. One merely wants to be able to protect these characters from harm and perhaps even be kin to them. It was a book that I found hard to put down. One of those 'special' reads where one reaches the end and is frustrated because the book doesn't continue; the characters are no longer a part of their life."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"&quot;Back Roads&quot; is an amazing story that kept me reading from the very first paragraph. The story was powerful and deeply sad, and it left me with the same feeling I had after seeing &quot;American Beauty&quot; Both stories explore the domestic side of America in ways that are rarely looked at with as much depth and power. The story is full of disturbing surprises and I came to love Harley's character in the same surprising way. This book definately made my Top 5 list and is quite possibly one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I finished this novel in two days.I simply could not put it down.I needed to know what was going to happen to Harley next.

With his father dead, his mother in prison, and three sisters to take care of,one may wonder where he finds the time and energy for everything else that happens. I didn't care, all I wanted was what would happen with the next page. He may be a low class Holden Caufield, but this novel reminds me more of the Bean family in Carolyn Chute's wonderful The Beans Of Egypt Maine. If you don't know that novel, read them both.

It is a very intense piece of Art. Although, I must warn you that Oprah was telling you the truth, it's a hard novel on the emotions . O'Dell, the author, does not let up! If you are a 'lists' person, here it is in order of intensity: Intrigue, Sex, Abuse, Sex, Secrecy and Genuine Unpredictability. The protagonist, 19-year-old Harley Altmyer is the sole guardian of his three younger sisters Amber (16), Misty (12) and the baby of the family Jody (6) (Jody's spelling is both sad and painfully funny). Rather than become a ward of the state or be put on welfare, a very responsible Harley decides to be &quot;the man&quot; of the house after their mother is sentenced to life in prison for the murder of their very abusive father. I am very tempted to tell you the incredible twists and turns O'Dell takes you with that fact. But you must read it all for yourself. You will NEVER in a million years or pages should I say, see what the end will be. To continue, in conjunction with his two years experience of parenting, Harley also has to deal with his bursting need for sexual comfort. Some of the sexual images in his mind are extremely disturbing and violent. Yet, this author is on her job, she makes you see why the images surface in that manner in the first place which allow us very sensitive readers to carry on with the story. He has to deal with three emotionally raw females, for which he has neither data nor point of reference. Also, there is the mortgage, the two full-time jobs, and a loneliness that is so vast it creates a fifth mouth to feed. If you are one of those, \\" I can't read another disturbing word of this book, I MUST put it down\\"...you simply can't.

(And I read a lot of books! ) Harley is thrown into manhood much too early in this debut novel by Tawni O'Dell. If losing his father too early by murder wasn't hard enough, he has to deal with raising his three younger sisters after his mother goes to jail. Each girl has her own distinctive personality, and it's a wonder they didn't kill each other living in that house together. Harley finds out the truth about his father's death and his whole world goes downhill fast. He falls for a young mother of two and things start to go really wrong after his sister finds out about them. Harley wonders about from day to day, drinking beer and not sleeping.

I thought it was awesome and I eagerly await a sequel or something else from Tawni."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Tawni O'Dell has written a tale of The Great American Nightmare. Undoubtedly, the story is a tragedy and, just as an occasional person might not appreciate Shakespeare's tragedies, this work may lose a sensitive reader. But the realism of the work with descriptions that are PERTINENT, makes the reader feel, smell, hear, and taste becoming one with the book. Harley is a victim of circumstance. His family has splintered from the whole of society with the death of his father and he becomes burdened as an individual to bear premature responsibilities. The story becomes a tale of children with misdirected passions brought into a harsh, cruel world too soon. And sadly enough, the work stings of believability. After reading this novel, one begins to ponder the workings of our society upon those who merely seek to just survive. Ms. O'Dell has done an outstanding job on her first book. And until Tawni O'Dell has her next novel in print, I will simply keep rereading this one."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Harley Altmyer has a load of responsibilities for a man of his young age.Harley's father is dead, and his mother is in prison for the murder, so he is left to raise his three younger sisters. Working two jobs, and looking for love in all the wrong places, his story of abuse, incest, and the strange relationships between siblings will unfold to answer the question...can he be the savior his family needs?&quot;Back Roads&quot; is a fast-paced novel dealing with some disturbing issues. At times hilarious and heartbreaking, while also being gritty and violent, first time author, Tawni O'Dell, handles herself like a seasoned pro; dishing out the heavy subject matter, and at the same time creating a hero in Harley.This book was an Oprah pick, but don't read it for that reason, read it because it is a well written, well executed story that grabs the reader and doesn't let go. This may not be a book for everyone, but any reader looking for intense fiction should pick it up.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Tawni O'Dell is tough and gritty and poignant and quick. She hits hard and creates characters that live with you. I couldn't put this book down, waiting to see what Harley would do next, hurting for him, wanting to be him, anxiously hoping he would survive. With a cup of fine vanilla coffee, a little rain, the New York Night and my favorite reading music (John McArthur's, &quot;HIDDEN&quot;) I started Back Roads and didn't finishe until the story was done. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book really caught my attention about half way through, although I liked it from the beginning. Dealing with incest, or multiple abuses would seem difficult at best to get into these characters heads, but not too difficult for O'Dell. She did a first rate job of developing these people; so that the reader left a kinship with them. Of course we deal with these kind of issues in our real lifes, this read left me deeply distrubed for all the members of this family. It stayed with me for several hours after finishing the book. To touch someone that much; I would think it takes one heck of a writer. I have read all of Oprah's picks, and this is by far the best one yet."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I had just finished &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; when I picked up this novel. These could not be more different books in tone and character but I was equally impressed with both. &quot;Back Roads&quot; takes you around every turn with this boy struggling to keep his family together. O'Dell makes you feel for him as well as his sisters and she makes the pain they endure horribly realistic. The landscaape of Western Pennsylvania is the perfect backdrop for a novel that I found chilling yet irresistable. I could not put it down and when I was finished, I was still haunted by what the lives of these characters could have been had they not been doomed from the start. Wonderful book and I highly recommend it to anyone who can deal with a little shock to the system. The topics she covers are not always easy but they are well worth braving."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This author is a very good writer. The book contained wonderful, thoughtful, and provoking phrases that I wanted to write down. At the same time, it contained witty conversation and dry sarcasm that would make one laugh. I feel the writing was excellent, especially for such a difficult story line and subject matter. The author showed the reader how the effects of abuse whether physical, emotional, or just plain denied have far reaching ramifications on this family. The book leaves you feeling badly for the characters and hoping their lives will heal in the future. The book is graphic, but it has to be in order for the reader to understand the emotional workings of this family."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"You can't help falling for Harley. He's modern literature's great anti-hero; a post modern young man whose wry observations and astute cynicism provide for a remarkably entertaining and moving romp. For an Oprah selection this novel certainly packs a punch and I admire Oprah for choosing such and edgy, gritty and urbanly realistic novel for her Book Club. This is a riveting portrait of a dysfunctional family gone even more awry when the mother is put in prison after killing their father. Harley tries desperately to keep it together and we applaud his efforts to stop the remaining threads of his family life unravelling. Teenage angst, dead end lives', domestic violence, incestuous couplings and murder are all played out around a veneer of humour and compassion. Harley is such a lovable character, beautifully realised and startlingly portrayed. You just want to keep reading long after the novel ends - I couldn't put it down! You know though that with an astute and intelligent boy like Harley things WILL get better. Life is a struggle for the Altmyer family and there is so much anger but as readers' will discover they manage to transcend this and find that their true loyalties are to each other. A truly remarkable story from a remarkable writer. Tawni O'Dell is going to be a real voice on the current literary landscape."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book definitely left me speechless at the end. I found myself reading and re-reading different parts just because it had that much of my attention. Although some parts left me in disgust, overall it was good. I would not recommend it though, for all readers. There is certainly a degree of maturity needed when reading this book. Not only does it tackle human emotions, feelings, and actions, but it also involves raw and unspeakable human thoughts. I do not give it five stars, though, because there were some parts that were slow and sometimes I wasn't quite sure with what was going on. The main character, Harley, is the narrator. Harley goes through these things with his family and has a stream of consciousness-type thinking. He will be doing something and thinking of doing something at the same time, and sometimes this is not O'Dell's strongest writing point. She sometimes leaves the reader confused, but wanting more, and that's how the book was readable. O'Dell in general surprised me. Not very often do you find a woman author who writes a storyline with a male protagonist. But she did a fine job of it. She easily convinces the reader into getting into Harley's head. It's very surprising that a woman would write like this. Overall, a good book. It's sure got some heart-stoppers though."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"The main Character in Mrs O'Dell's story is Harley Altmyer, an 18 year-old boy living in the small town of Laurel Falls. He has to look after his younger sisters, Jody, Misty and Amber, because their mother is serving a life sentence in prison since she killed their father. He works at a Shop Rite with two incompetent work mates, Bud and Church, under the command of the useless boss Rick. And he has a second part-time job at Barklay's Appliances. Their house is a permanent chaos and it is very difficult for Harley to make both ends meet. He is assigned a social worker and a psychoanalyst whom he both loathes. But he has no choice since he doesn't want his sisters to be officially declared orphans and be sent to foster families.The strength of this novel is the fact that the events are seen through Harley's young mind. He is often confused because he is not mature enough to have two jobs and educate his younger sisters at the same time. They in turn consider him more as a brother than a father and as a result there are frequent rows between them, especially between Harley and the elder girl Amber who strives for independence. But Harley is very much concerned by the well being of the girls and his worries even once make him have a hallucinatory vision of finding them dead at home, piled up in a pool of blood.At the same time he is looking for a girlfriend and wonders if it is possible to love someone without getting personally involved, without any mutual feeling or judgement. His first relationship is a confused one with a neighbour, Callie Mercer, wife of a bank manager and mother of two children. And Harley often recalls his father and how he used to ill treat his children.His struggle in life is all the more impressive since he gets no support at all from any adult, not even his uncle Mike."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book was well written and the characters fully developed, however, I found the story to be a bit over the top for my taste. I did not see one thing funny or sexy (as portrayed in some reviews) about incest, adultury, or murder.The story is dark and disturbing, without redemption. The character's extreme dysfunction was not quite believable (even in our present day society where this behavior seems to be rampant, their behavior was bizarre).Although incest, murder and adultury occur everyday, the sequence of events in this book impacted me as though I had witnessed a bad accident.

The subject matter is not easy, but the writing glides through it so easily that you feel sucker-punched when yet another of your nice tidy explanations for human behavior hits the trash.I can't imagine anyone who would not be changed by reading this book.

He included WAY to many details about &quot;girl stuff&quot; , granted, he grew up with 3 sisters, but there were many times I thought that there was no way a guy would take note of these things. I think it can be forgiven because the rest of the book is so good,not to mention the fact that most of the readers of this book are probably female due to the Oprah endorsement. maybe I was just spoiled by the believablity of Wally Lamb's &quot;she's come undone&quot;."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Wow! Call me naive but I was shocked by the goings on in this book. Harley, Amber, Misty, Jody and Callie. These - for the most part - are well drawn characters, each with their own idiosyncracies, beliefs and secrets and while this is an obvious strength of the book perhaps it leads to a glaring weakness. Harley is an obvious charmer. He has the great ability to communicate what seems logical to him to us even when there is very little logic there. And that is where I had the problem. The situations he describes - the many sexual ones with Callie for example - mostly seem rushed and for the first time in a long time I came away thinking that this 300+ page book should have been about 200 pages longer. There seems to be something missing the first time the encounters start with Callie. What possessed her to become involved with him? Nothing in the book tells us. The situations aside, Back Roads is a likeable book. I struggled with the frankness as I failed to see where the story was going - Amber's involvement at the end however was far too obvious - but as I reached the end I became acutely aware of the film Boys Don't Cry. What seems glorified suddenly becomes horrifyingly real as everything is put in context and we see this family once again torn apart by acts of violence. O'Dell's Back Roads is a solid read. It is easily read, introduces you to characters you'll probably remember, and tells a story that many of us will find foreign. That is what books are all about. Not a must read but one that many will get a lot out of."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book dealt with a very serious subject that added humor and had many surprises.

One of Oprah's best picks yet."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I can't imagine taking on so much responsibilty at such a young age and in the middle of a horrific tragedy.

This book grabs your attention in the first chapter and never lets go. Harley and his sisters are victims of child abuse and neglect. Harley is thrust with the responsibility with raising his younger sisters after his mother goes to prison for killing his father. Harley eventually learns the truth about his father's death from his mother and that is the biggest surprise of all. Harley's sister's Misty and Amber both crave love and attention from him. They seem innocent but they are nothing but that. The pressure of keeping his family together is overwhelming for Harley and he finds solace in his lover Calliie and his shrink Betty. Back Roads is a very suspenseful novel with many twists and turns"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I rushed out to get this book for my holiday. I managed to finish it, but it did not relax or enlighten me. I was surprised that Oprah selected this book.

She can use language well, has somewhat interesting characters (although not believable ones) and paces her story dramtically. Those few positives can't help the fact that this is a terrible book. The storyline, which could have been a fascinting look at the coping mechanisms of children who survived the murder of a parent by the other parent, is instead a VC Andrews tale of incest and murder. Nothing that happens even remotely resembles reality. Furthermore, the over the top use of WORDS in CAPITAL letters is annoying, as are the characterizations of both Misty and Amber. These two characters are so unsympathetic that you can't imagine caring for them. I am shocked that Oprah picked this for her club because the story is just so over-the-top; it is steeped in bathos. What starts off promising descends to a level of Gothic melodrama so perverse (becuase the author chooses to throw many Jerry Springer type cliches into the mix) you'd almost laugh if you didn't realize you just spent a day reading the novel."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This story was boring and useless.

It was a good story line at first and it held your interest as to what Harley would think of next. It started out very innocent and touching. About the last quarter of the book, it took a turn for the worst. I think Tawni O'Dell wanted it to be more of a mystery, but nothing led up to a mystery until the last quarter when the dog dug up a bloody shirt. It then became so predictable. Then it started becoming incestuous as if it came out of no where. The main character is dreaming of his older neighbor and has an affair with her, then all of the sudden, he's having sex with his sister. The incest could have been left out of the book. If they were trying to express the love that the sister had for the brother, it could have been done in a better way without the incest. It wasn't necessary. The story started out great....then the incest started and the children are all murderers and it became very far-fetched. I noticed that this was the only book the author has written, hopefully if she decides to write another one, she will take her time and think it out before she tries to throw a bad plot together. Sorry."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book seems to have a lot of fans, but personally I was horrified by it. Is this what the youth of today have become? ...Are all children abused today? Harley does not win my sympathy. Rather, he appalls me. Responsibility is supposed to bring maturity. Instead all he can think about is his penis. I gather he ends up in a mental hospital. I just hope he doesn't con his keepers into letting him loose on society again.

The comments on the dust cover indicated it was a humorous story of a teen age boy rearing his younger sisters. If a mom in prison for killing the dad, incestuous goings on, adultery and the boy being nabbed the for murder of his lover is humorous, I guess I have become something of a prude. For the same amount of money, I could have had the latest book from John LesCroart, John Grisham, Steve Martini or David Balducci.

It examines the hopelessness that WE all feel at some time and place in our mundane, everyday and pitiful lives. Harley shows that even when you attempt to do the right things in life.

He is overwhelmed with all the responsibilities but keeps on trying and doing the best he can to survive.Harley finds relief from all the pressures of life in sexyal encounters with an older woman, which causes problems when his sisters find out about it. His drinking and lack of sleep has ill effects on his his clear perception of his situation and his thinking, but he always tries to protect his sisters and make it through the next day alive.I felt like reaching out to Harley, who needs help in the worst way. Although far from being a perfect person, Harley quickly finds a way into your heart and one has to feel sorry for his predicament, wanting to ease his troubles. He is a strong person in his way and portrays an excellent lead character in this story. The strong personalities of the sisters also fill the story with excitement, intrigue, and at times utter helplessness.The engaging story makes this book hard to put down. I found myself disgusted and deeply disturbed at times, but was unable to stop reading. I had to know what happened next and would Harley make it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I don't get all the raves.

I think anyone would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Gripping, heartwrenching, and absolutely addictive- so much that one feels withdrawal symptoms after finishing this novel. Ms. O\`Dell\`s central character, Harley, is at once simple in his basic understanding of human interaction and complicated because of the corruption in his life caused by those interactions. Not for the lighthearted, Back Roads is more of an undertaking than a read, and doesn\`t so much speak as it cries of the perseverance of the human soul toward redemption and peace."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I loved this book- reminded me of White Oleander by Janet Fitch- would highly reccomend."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long time.

It's been about a year since I first read this and decided to crack it open for another read last week. Just like the first time I read it, I was up until the wee hours because I couldn't put it down. Although sometimes a bit uncomfortable and shocking, I think those elements made it a \\"can't stop reading\\" selection and overall it was just as entertaining the second time as the first...even if I knew the ending.

This entire family had issues including the aunt and uncle.The mother's problems started when she was a child and had lost her own parents.harley and his sisters never had a chance with an abusive father and a mother who would allow the abuse.I dont know why the neighbor had the hots for harley especially when he was all nasty and dirty.there was nothing funny in this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I can't believe how difficult it is to order now, there is no place to put something in a cart, it is all about this kindle stuff.

The main character is a hateful young man with fantasies of sex and violence towards his younger siblings. The setting is a dismal village in rural Pennsylvania where each resident almost competes to be more hopeless than his neighbor.I am no prude and I have no problem peppering my library with a little dysfunction every now and then, but I actually finished this book feeling like a worse person. As far as I'm concerned, the only thing this author got right was picking out the cover image; a back road that leads to hell.Rating: One \\"trillionth\\" of a point.Suggested With: A pair of running shoes, a jet pack, a concord plane, anything that will get you the hell away from this book as fast as possible."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I read this book and hated it; I was sorry I wasted my money.... Normally, I would have donated the book ater reading it. But, in this case I was so disappointed, I threw the book away after reading it. I was disappointed with the author for scrubbing the language so clean that the area she set the book in could have been anywhere in the US. I was also disapponted in the Oprah book club selection committee. It seemed to me they found a \\"story\\" they liked, and that is where their critical thinking ended. It was the only and last Oprah book selection I ever bought. After reading it, it was obvious to me that whoever had chosen the book for the Oprah club had never been to western Pa. I am from western PA as is O'Dell and this book lacks local color. She either forgot or choose to ignore that language is also a part of the landscape of a locale. Landscape is just not about dysfunctional families, EatnParks and religious statues in the yards.... People in that area of PA say \\"ain't,\\" \\"slippy,\\" and \\"youns.\\" This would be esp. true for someone like the main character, Harley. (There are people with college degrees from this area who still have \\"color\\" in their language.) O'dell is no Faulkner or Caufield. I find this lack of \\"local flavor\\" with a lot of modern authors. Unfortunately, our books are even becoming Mcdonaldized. There is nothing special about this book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Trust me. This is an overeducated writing-school drone's attempt to &quot;slum it&quot; by portraying characters she cannot articulate or understand. Worse, the twists and turns are at once sensationalistic and pedestrian. It's true, the dust jacket appears to have been written by someone who was unfamiliar with the book. I wish now I fell into that category too. I listened to the audiobook, so perhaps the novel's better on paper. But I doubt it. When will first novelists learn that hardscrabble does not automatically mean poetic or literary? When will first novelists abandon the notion that metaphors seem from the pores of the downtrodden? Again, don't waste your time. And think twice about Oprah's abused-protagonist-of-the-month club; that doesn't make the writing good. If I could give ZERO stars, I would. But they won't let me."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I don't have any comments quite yet. Just started reading this book yesterday. It is kind of hard to get into. Depressing with Harley taking care of his 3 sisters while their Mother is in prison for killing their father.

But BACK ROADS could be set anywhere that people are poor and more rural than urban. The setting was almost incidental, and I was disappointed. The characters too, tended to disappoint. The writing, while technically fine, tended to disappoint. There was nothing new explored here, not in terms of the family, the region or the male or female psyche. I could predict everything, which is for me, the ultimate disappointment."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book takes an intense journey into the mind of a psycho.

Don't count on that with this novel. The characters and their continual struggles with lives that are far from normal, leave you breathless and heart-broken. There is a neck-breaking turn with each new chapter that forces you to reevaluate the opinions and conclusions that you had previously held. Yes, there are some disturbing inuendos and suggestions in this book, however, that is exactly what makes it so intense and volatile. This book will make you believe that are good authors still around and at the same time you will make a new best friend in one of the most vivid and endearing characters I have ever encountered in a novel, Harley Altmyer. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This was a great book, I couldn't put it down!

A very well-written novel! Right when you think you know where the plot is heading, it takes another twist which totally catches you by surprise! I simply could not put it down! O'DELL keeps the pages turning by allowing you to so easily become involved in Harley's life and all the mystery, suspense, romance, laughter, intrigue, and heartbreak that evolves around him and his dysfunctinal family, friends, and acquaintances. You will not figure out this ending until you read the very last page! Looking forward to reading O'DELL's next novel."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"\\"Glass Castle\\" also has kids raising themselves in poverty in crummy houses, scratching for enough money to buy food, but I liked it better because the characters are better-developed, there's hope, and they rise above their environment. Here all the family's past conflict is in retrospect, the main character is a head-case, fantasizes about sex and violence. The ending is like a trainwreck which may explain why people read it in one sitting, and the twists seem a bit contrived and too weird.You know nobody is going to get anywhere, you get little of the flavor of the town since the characters and settings are very limited; the places Harley works and their home are most of where the story unfolds. His sister Amber pushes him constantly and he just takes it yet has fantasies of smashing people's faces into glass. You never know much about his parents except how they treated their kids and a tiny bit about where they were from & how they came to be married; a big grey area considering the family later dissolves (to put it mildly) and you have little to base it on. Tons of sex, sexual circumstances, situations and language as though that's all a teenage boy thinks about, but it is written by a woman......."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"You don't need three hundred reviews to see that this is an excellent first novel. Although the first ten pages can produce some confusion, when O'Dell shifts to the 'real' start of the story, the introduction makes sense and draws in the reader. This is one of the best novels I've read in two or three years. O'Dell's first work reminded me of Nelson DeMille's best work, although on a much more local, low-end scale.Admittedly, the first ten pages almost led me to close the book, unfinished. Instead, I finished the entire book in one long night's read. It is true: This book is hard to put down. And, to the other 'crictics', yes, there are many elements of this story that would be the grist for about two weeks of Jerry Springer shows, e.g., \\"Horny housewife seduces murderer's son.\\" And, having spent a bit of time in western Pennsylvania myself as a youth (my grandparents lived in western Pennsylvania; one grandfather was a coal miner), the title still left me scratching my head a bit, even at the end. There weren't that many back roads involved and the tenor of the setting seemed a bit generic, white trash, even red neck, and not peculiar to coal mining country in Pennsylvania.Those aren't knocks on \\"Back Roads\\". O'Dell has a great ear for dialog and, as a female author inabiting the male protagonist's mind and body, she does an excellent job. Her attnetion to the small details of life in this depressed, stressed, and repressed world brings life to a very dark story of incest, murder, betrayal, and poverty. Harley gives 'single parenthood' a whole new meaning as he struggles as the brother cum father of three girls, each with profound psychological wounds. And, as a teen, he acquits himself well, even as he fumes, fumbles, and makes his own mistakes. It made me wonder: \\"Could I have done any better?\\"A final note: Don't let a young son or daughter read this. The subject, not the language or sex, is not pleasant. For a more mature reader, there are lessons and there is light in this dark tale."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads examines the effects of physical and sexual abuseon children. It is an excellent book for that reason...I hopeit makes readers think twice before ever hitting a child.Back Roads starts out describing the life of the abandonedAltmyer kids, and how they cope on their own without theirparents. Harley tries hard to do the right thing by his 3sisters by working hard, paying property taxes on the old houseand keeping the girls from foster care.While sympathetic, Harley's obsessive thoughts of sex, violence,and degradation make him sometimes hard to like. At first glancehis sisters are mostly sympathetic characters--tough, swearingAmber (whom Harley thinks dislikes him), mysterious Misty, andlittle Jody, the only character who remains innocent throughoutthe whole book.You want the characters to survive and maybe escape their lousyexsistence, but towards the end of the novel you realize that'snot going to happen--too much earlier tragedy leads to inescapable doom, which surprised me.The harsh, continuous use of the F-word is almost symbolic andkind of prophetic for what happens at the end. The bittersweetscene where Amber agrees to not run away from home if Harleywill agree to start hitting her made me want to cry. This isthe legacy that abuse has passed down to the Altmyer children.The book reminded me of White Oleander by Janet Fitch, exceptwith a male character. O'Dell writes convincingly as a youngmale in the same way Wally Lamb handles the female point-of-viewin She's Come Undone.There is indeed a little humor sprinkled throughout, with thewry descriptions of people and their lives as seen throughHarley's eyes. Harley is often hard to like, and more oftenthan not he is either lusting, crying, vomiting, or just freakingout. But again, the legacy of abuse is at fault here--peoplewho call the book depressing should understand that terriblethings like that happen to innocent children every day. Mistyand probably Amber are scarred for life, but you hope at theend that poor Jody might have a shot at a normal life withUncle Mike and Jan.The book is very well-written and sympathetic, but also sadand appalling.Bravo to the author for her honesty, I would definitely recommendBack Roads."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I really expected to like this book as it started off with vivid descriptions of locales and characters. But it slowly and inexorably descended into a mixture of foul dialogue, foul situations, and some not-to-be-believed character interactions.

This book is headed for the trash."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I have never critiqued on here before, never have I been inspired to, until now. I was disturbed not by the events in the book, but by the fact that a FEMALE author wrote a book 1st person about an abused MALE. I did not feel it was accurate and although much of the insight comaparing genders was clever, it was evident to be a woman's point of view. The story did read well-I finished it in a weekend. It may have been because of the taboo topics though, as those are always somewhat attractive. I really respect new authors and do not normally form a negative opinion whether I loved the book or not, however in this case I was a little angry that this book was recommended. I know not, on what basis it would be considered done well. Oprah's book club picks always seem to have the same basic theme, and though it is a good one-it can get tiresome. Sometimes I think shock value sells too strong and since I am not a Jerry Springer fan, I get frustrated sorting through all that is meant to be disturbing to find what is actually good."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"The characters in this book, from Harley to the baby sister Jody, are so deeply described that I felt like I knew each of them. Harley, the main character, is responsible for his sisters since his mother was sentenced to life in prison for killing his father.Harley has the most intriguing wit and intelligence and doesn't even realize just how smart he is. He deals with his responsibility like a grown man. It takes the reader awile to actually dawn on the fact that he takes his responsibilities of his sisters without question and does a remarkable job.Even though one sister is promiscuous, one is obsessed with her dead father, and one is constantly making her lists and praying for her elders &quot;sowls&quot;. He does the best he can.The love affair that Harley has with his neighbor is adulterous, but when you focus on just the two people coming together, it's hard to look down on them because they do so because of their overwhelming need to feel loved.I was surprised by the ending of this book. I wont say what it is cause Id be stupid to let the cat outta the bag! But I sincerely hope that Ms. O'dell will do a continuation on this book and follow through with all the characters to see how their lives progress say ten to fifteen years down the road. In my mind I find myself writing maybe what could be with them and how they have progressed and developed.On a scale of one to ten I give this book a twenty!

He's one very troubled young man, barely out of highschool and is trying to take care of his young sisters since none of the relatives wanted to take them in. Uncle Mike lives not too far away, but for some reason does not really want to have a lot to do with Harley and his sisters.Harley holds down two jobs to make ends meet. They barely survive on his income, eating meals such as hot dogs or pizza for dinner, if anything. All of them are obviously emtionally on edge and things get worse as Harley slowly finds out what really happened to dad.In the mean time, he gets involved with Jody's best friend's mother, who happens to be married,and this leads to more troubles at home.Although this story seems to be pretty convoluted and over done, I found it yet another great pick by Oprah. I really liked the character of Harley and felt very sympathetic to his situation. He has a good heart underneath it all, and this is what I think kept him going.

Once you realize that the subject matter, although shocking, is actually handled in a way that is in favor of the very best of morals, you can gain an understanding of those in very difficult circumstances. I really hope that there will be a sequel. I also hope that there will be a movie! (If there is, I have just the theme song for it. I had written it before I heard of the book, but it fits well.)

The book was a little disturbing and I felt that Callie's motivations could have been explored more, but otherwise, this book was a great read."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I read this book in a matter of days. (For me, that's pretty good! :0) I was horrified at some of the events that happened in the book to this poor family, and it greatly sadened me. Harley, the main character, given what he had to deal with, did a good job. You couldn't help but love him.At times it felt that I was right there in the middle of it all. This was a book that was certainly hard to put down. The author, Tawni O'Dell did a fantastic job in writing this book! Everytime I had this story figured out, it turned on me again and I was thrown more into the story.The ending shocked me and was completely unexpected to me. At the end, this book left me wanting the story to continue going on. This is a great summer read for anyone wanting something that will keep them thinking. This is a book you'll remember!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"&quot;Back Roads&quot; was both humorous and sad, but very well-written. The story takes place in the backwoods of western Pennsylvania. It centers around the life of a college-aged guy named Harley Altmyer, whose left caring for his three unruly younger sisters, after their mom is convicted of killing their dad. While Harley is working two jobs to support his poor family, he yearns for the typical life of a college-aged guy. This includes having a good sex life. Harley has been having trouble finding a girl that he would like to sleep with. Then Callie Mercer, who lives up the road, enters the picture. She is considerably older than Harley, and is married with two young children, who play with Harley's little sister, Jody. However, both Harley and Callie become interested in one another, and start having a secret affair. In the meantime, secrets regarding the Altmyer family and the events surrounding Mr. Altmyer's death start surfacing, which Harley must come to terms with. &quot;Back Roads&quot; is fairly quick to get through, and the reader will not be left bored."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"What's good: the travails of a morally, emotionally, and financially destitute family; a protagonist who is not always likable; a moral and uplifting end. The novel is quite graphic in terms of both violence and sexuality, so be aware.What's bad: an illogical affair is about the only thing that comes to mind."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I believe this book was the most depressing one I've ever read. I saw no light at the end of the tunnel and couldn't figure out why someone would write a story with absolutely no redeemable characters. Everyone in this mess is completely screwed up from either domestic abuse, incest, lies, irresponsibility, poverty, desperation, mental illness, you name it. I only finished it to see where it ended and hoped like hell SOMEONE was going to get a happy ending but alas, no. Read this book only if you like reading about non-stop misery and unhappiness."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I am still trying to figure out why this book would beconsidered enjoyable. I found it very disturbing and uncomfortable.At times I wanted to stop reading because I felt like it was a trashytalkshow in words. I read email about how people loved Harley (found him endearing) I found him repulsive. The character did not even bathe. I feel that the author is a very good writer and very descriptive but the story was over the top when it came to dysfunction. I know people are saying it is true to life, but how much murder, incest and sickness can be in one family. I feel the story could have been more uplifting in some way..."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I needed this book for a potential internship with a literary agency, so it was important that it came ASAP.

Powerful images, characters and situations. Bravo Ms. O'Dell! Thanks for the great read!Karen Albright Lin"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Reading this book book was such an enjoyable experience! The way the story of this truly messed-up family unfolded completely engrossed me! I couldn't put it down! The narrator's character was so very endearing and the horror of his life was quite shocking. The ending seemed a bit unclear as to where exactly he was... but aside from that, I am very excited to read her next book... I wonder if any characters will overlap (it seems like the setting is the same!)... I hope so!I especially enjoyed Harley's relationship with Elvis (such a surprisingly common dog name!) and Jody. His mom's character was a bit of a mystery and I would have liked a bit more about what exactly happened the day their whole family changed forever... O'Dell wrote with a lot of skill, and really created characters and relationships that sprang off the page and seemed to be walking and breathing in the same room at times. Wonderfully done!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Tawni O'Dell writes a fantastic story, and this is my favorite. No sense rehashing the plot. What makes this book brilliant is her insight into the plight of a young man saddled with all the baggage of his lower class background in rural western Pennsylvania. As the plot twists and turns, Harley does his best, but he's up against the tide. O'Dell portrays his descent into madness with compelling prose. She also captures the atmosphere better than most anyone."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I bought this book to take with me to the beach.

The whole story and the characters seemed very unrealistic."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"What a GREAT book!

If you are in the mood for that read it! GREAT character developement, but tends to drag in some places. It was not my favorite piece of literature, but pretty good."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads was one of the best books I read this summer. I was really pulling for Harley and his sisters. I wish it ended better for them though."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"The author IS the protaganist in this sick story of incest, violence and murder. The reader is artfully allowed inside Ms O'Dell's mind as she lays bare the desperation of a drunk, sexually-starved, masturbating teen-ager. Like a cue ball on a losing snooker table, Harley smashes head-on into the balls, but without sinking any."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book is very easy to get into, and once you start reading, you cannot put it down.

Nonetheless, this is still one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"There's nothing that I enjoy more in a book, than to be in the process of reading it...and somewhere in the middle...just when I think that I know where it's going, and how it's going to end, it takes a turn on me, sending me on a mission to quickly find out what's about to happen next. And so...I am left unable to put the book down. Back Roads is that kind of book. Pick it up...and don't dare put it down, 'cause you might miss something. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"With BACK ROADS, Tawni O'Dell has crafted a gritty and tremendously engrossing first novel which is reminiscent of Lisa Reardon's BILLY DEAD.Harley Altmyer is nineteen years old, left to take care of his three younger sisters after his mother is imprisoned for shooting her husband.As the novels opens, Harley is being held by authorities for reasons that are at first unclear. The story follows Harley, a both complex and passionate teen as he struggles to be brother, father and mother to his sisters, all while he works two jobs and battles his own personal demons. By the novel's stunning conclusion, the secrets and lies of the Altmyer become clear not only to Harley, but to the reader as well.This is a tough and emotionally draining novel, but O'Dell's gift as a natural storyteller makes every page worth it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I didn't know the reason why I had to go looking for this particular book after seeing it on Oprah a few years back;That show made such and impact on me that I was in tears. I looked everywhere for the book not really sure why? When I finally found it. I got too busy and put it away, but about a week ago I decided to do something good for myself and read. I'm not really a big fan of reading. I get bored with most of the books I pick up, but after the first five minutes I was hooked. Maybe, I can relate somewhat to the character he is so human and truthful it's scary. Or maybe because I am also 19 and thinking about being put in that position is scary.Harley does the best that he could, I don't blame him. We can't judge because most of us don't know how it is not to be loved by the one person we want most to care. It is so sad what happened to that family but none of them could have helped it. I was in love with all the characters especially Callie and Harley. What they had was messy and unclear but in a way absolutely beautiful. When I finished that book I couldn't stop crying and thinking about how horrible life can get. Then it also reminded me how wonderful and bright it could be. This novel shows both sides, at first I was really upset with the ending but the more time I had to think about it, it was perfect especially the last sentence. Amazing, O'Dell put the passion for reading in me again, Thank you and I cannot wait till your next novel you have a new fan. One more thing Jody is a sweetheart and a real joy ,she represented hope. Everyone do something good for yourself..READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I loved this book. I've never felt so many different emotions while reading a book before. I felt such compassion for thischaracter, who had to go through so much at such at young age and to be thrown into &quot;life&quot;.It's amazingly written by Ms. O'Dell. I was at the edge of my seat almost from page one, I couldn't put it down.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves to read! Truly amazing!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book is constantly making you second guess your own opinions. It is always changing and something vital is always surfacing and changing your views about everything! I think it is a wonderful book and I would definately recommend it!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is my review over the story Backroads. Backroads is very different from other books I have read. It is very exciting and a little to descriptive. Harley, the main character, comes from a very messed up family. The family has a lot of problems and the problems only get worse. The father is very abusive towards his children, not the mother, the mother really didn't stick up for her children. The children only wanted love. Misty felt like she had to get revenge on her mother, and she ended up by accident taking the life of her father. Misty felt horrible, but her mother took the blame for the crime and was sent to prison. The children then have to grow up on their own, but Harley is the one that takes care of them and all the responsibilites. Harley feels hatred towards his mother and does a lot of crazy things, until he finds out the truth. Then he turns to the mother of one of his younger sister's friends, Callie. Harley falls in love with Callie. Harley keeps having flashbacks and has terrible visions that he is trying to get rid of. The day he gets rid of them is the day he loses Callie the one he loves. Harley takes the blame for the shooting of Callie, but it was really Amber, his sister, which was jealous. Harley then ends up just like his mom, innocent, but takes the blame. The three girls end up being sent off to foster homes while Harley gets the death sentence."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This was a big disappointment. It was too disturbing, too dark, too depressing. I am sure that there are a lot of poeple out there who could relate to the characters, but I sure couldn't. Read &quot;Here on Earth&quot; instead. That was 100 times better!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This could have been a great book if the characters were better developed. I felt almost cheated the further I read on ... realizing that the mystery and vagueness of Harley and his sisters' personalities were leading nowhere. The book left me feeling empty and disappointed.I find it interesting that that there is even a Reading Group Guide with 'Topics for Discussion'. Does she really believe this to be great writing? Don't flatter yourself Tawni, you're only an amateur."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I could not put down this book! I was mesmerized by it! Full of secrets and surprises, it was a real page-turner. Some of first thoughts of reading this were, &quot;my God, these poor kids raising themselves&quot; but then it went deeper. Mental illness, incest, infidelity, its all in this book. I couldn't help but feel sorry for Harley, becoming a man, a father, and dealing with a horrible tradegy all at once. It's no wonder he was crazy! I think of the time that had passed until all of these secrets came to light. Its scary to think how long a person can keep secrets, tradegies, buried until they really start effecting your life. It makes me realize how important CLOSURE is in my own life."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Deep and sad with a thought provoking and powerful ending. Definitely not a light read, and a page turner to the end. Makes you reconsider the chances we think we might want to take or the things we might want to do. The characters are extremely well created, and the descriptions take you right there."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book could tell alot about some boys out there that some of us have dated, married, witnessed, or even gave birth to. It tells a story that probably happens in America each year. But it really puts you on a roller coaster, hating one character then realizing you should love them. It was very revelating!! I LOVED THIS BOOK!! (And I have sent my copy to friends and loved ones across the country!)"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book takes you to a place you have never been and you can't escape! You have to know what happens next - I read the whole book straight through barely taking time to eat and acknowledge my family! I thought Tawni O'Dell did an incredible job of letting us get to know and care about these characters - you are screaming out loud at them by the end of the book!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads is a wonderful, yet shocking depiction of a teenage boy having to grow up fast. While the circumstances surrounding Harley's life are extreme and intense, O'Dell succeeds in revealing the challenges, struggles and courage of a typical adolescent. The character of Harley portrays a typical adolescent who is concerned, yet confused; proud, yet insecure; courageous, yet afraid; immortal, yet self-destructive; restless, yet lethargic. O'Dell successfully portrays the \\"back roads\\" as being synonymous to the search for one's self-identify in order to find a place in the world - a search that is done by all people in different ways and in various situations."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Reading this book is like slowly driving by a horrific traffic accident. With all of your might you want to look away...but the raw animal part of you wins over with it's desire to see all the gruesome details. That is Back Roads...it is the ugly aspects of life. Reading about Harley, Amber, Misty, Jody, and Esme's Mom will make you blush and gasp more than once. Your stomach will turn and you'll wonder what kind of person thinks of things such as these. And you will not want to put it down..and you will not want it to end. I am so glad I read Back Roads, and I am eager for Tawni O'Dell's next offering to the literary world. But in all honesty, I'm glad that most books aren't like this one because it exhausted me...and left me wanting more!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I kept thinking of Jane Smiley's &quot;A Thousand Acres.&quot; Afraid to keep reading because of what the truth may reveal, but yet unable to stop."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I cracked open the spine of my newly purchased book and inhaled deeply (a passion of mine - the smell of a new book ). The book is entitled 'Backroads' by Tawni O'Neill. I had heard recently of this book and the author, on the Oprah show. I was at the very least skeptical, due to it being a new Oprah pick and the complicated tendencies and prejudices whom every avid reader is aware when reading Oprah picks. Although, I have to say, I do usually read Oprah's picks and, in fact, probably own every one of these novels and feel it is money well spent; &quot;well worth it novels&quot;, a valuable addition to my ever increasing library. These books represent to me an intimate involvement of a day or less.This book held me captive for a full three days. Captive to the point where my family began to look at me sidelong and strangely, perhaps because I was spending long hours in the bathroom and the bedroom in order to have a valid reason to continue reading. It also could be the fact that after incessant reading, I get this disoriented look about me, a person who has been startled from a deep sleep; a person who has been a passenger in a vehicle for long hours.This is a sad book. But there is an incredible amount to learn along the way. The characters are original. They create a wonderful thought provoking, endearing, and heart wrenching reading experience. One merely wants to be able to protect these characters from harm and perhaps even be kin to them. It was a book that I found hard to put down. One of those 'special' reads where one reaches the end and is frustrated because the book doesn't continue; the characters are no longer a part of their life."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This novel is asolid debut. It was well written and the main character really affected me. The story, I thought, was a bit too dramatic, though; there were too many dramas unfolding, too much angst, and not enough levity for my taste. If it were not a first novel, I would hvae given it 3 stars, which is still pretty good."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I had been warned that this book was &quot;raw&quot;, but that didn't bother me. The characters were so well written that you felt as if you really got to know them, and in fact I've known people much like them, although not in the same set of circumstance. Even the characters names were perfect for them. Harley was sweet and loveable, and sexy. All of his inner turmoil was aptly described. The sisters, Amber, Misty and Jody, all reminded me of real children I've encountered in my many years of public school teaching. And we wonder why these children have trouble learning! Callie, who seemed to have it all, was an innocent victim.She was just trying to help, bless her heart; and yes, she too was a victim of this dysfunctional family. The mother's seeming detactment from her ffamilly and their plight came across clearly. And the dead father; how the reader hates him and his kind! I would highly recommend this book, and look forward eagerly to more from Tawni O'Dell, a rare talent."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book was full of unexpected twists and turns.

Although its much more interesting and keeps your attention longer than Catcher in the Rye. It's hard not to feel for the boy in this book.

I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Back Roads is like a much darker and more disturbing &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. I couldn't put it down. Great characters. Great story. Great writing. Very enjoyable. I'll read this one again."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I honestly still can't decide if I actually like this book. Yes, it is a very well-crafted piece of literature which, to be honest, I couldn't put down. However, the level of dysfunction which permeates the story is profoundly disturbing.Despite the horrors of their situation, I felt deeply for Harley and his sisters; I wanted them to break the cycle of abuse and misplaced love which had obviously had a stranglehold on their family for generations. Despite the fact that the further I got into the book the more depressed I became, I had to see it through to the end and literally could not put it down.I would comment that the professional reviewers (e.g. the Chicago Sun-Times) who describe the book as &quot;funny&quot;, are not only off the mark but they are offensive to me. There is absolutely nothing funny about the themes portrayed in this complex and disturbing story."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is filled with secrets and leaves you guessing about what really happened all the way to the end. Surprises hit you in almost every chapter, some you expected and some you didnt.

You guys have got to read it!!!"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I won't go into the summary of the book, as other reviews have already accomplished, but I will go into how I felt while reading this book. I felt compelled by the book's honesty, grit, humor, and integrity. The dysfunction of the character and his perception of those around him are shocking at times, but reasonable in thought at other times. The book certainly is entertaining, well written, and makes the reader aware that love can exist where dysfuntion lies, and that love can be perceived in more ways than one. The perception of the main character is compelling, interesting, dramatic, violent at times, perverse, and compassionate, but he stays true to his feelings which are totally and completely real. I believe you will not only enjoy this book, but will remember it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This book was fantastic. Once I started it, I could not put it down. The story is dark and at times heartbreaking but at other times, quite funny. Just like real life.

It's the tale of a young man whose mom is in jail for his father's murder leaving him to raise three younger sisters. The twists and turns as you discover what really happened to Harley's family- and the things that happen to Harley in the the course of the book- will leave you reeling."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I did like the writer's style and found the character of 19 year old Harley to be likeable. However, this book really goes to the pit of society and paints a graphic picture of incest. If incestuous loves scenes do not bother you, or perhaps thrill you, then this is a very good book for you. If on the other hand, you find this kind of thing disturbing, then I would not suggest this book. Also, this is a dark book with a depressing tone throughout and a depressing ending. I wasn't quite sure what type a point the writer was trying to make, if any."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I started reading this book on a plane home from a wedding, and couldn't put it down!

If I could have rated it 5000, I would have."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"What amazes me about this book, is how the female author nails the &quot;mindtalk&quot;, that voice inside us, of a 20 year old virgin male and his nascent sexuality. Ms. O'Dell, the author, is an attractive woman ( her photograph is on the back cover of the book). Her description of a young man struggling with big issues is astounding. Harley, the 20 year old male narrator in this story, is losing his virginity, while trying to support his three sisters after their mother is imprisoned for murdering their father.Wow. That's a pretty full plate for Harley. What amazes me is the author's descriptions of Harley's sexuality with accurate descriptions of male sexual excitement and what goes on inside the mind as Harley grows into his sexuality while his younger sister is more experienced.Also, Harley finds certain words troublesome. Words such as CRISIS and EXCEPTION. He repeatedly asks others to DEFINE what they mean by a certain word. Also, Harley sees certain words and phrases in neon above the people who speak these words. This device, used by the author, had a powerful effect on me. Harley was beaten by his father and abuse victims can often times be hypersensitive to abusive language, even though their physical abuse has stopped. This device developed by the author for this character was quite interesting."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I found this book extremely interesting.

I couldn't put this book down."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I am really confused after reading this book twice. I think I think it's a good book, because i did want to keep reading it, but i just didn't get it! Who killed Dad? What was going on with Misty and the Dad? And Amber and Harley? Did Harley get arrested? Is the mom innocent? WHAT IS GOING ON! There were a lot of unanswered questions, the writer makes this a sketchy-imagine-it-yourself kinda book. There were a lot of hallucinations and dreams, so i couldn't tell what was real or not! It didn't have any meaning or satisfaction in it. But it was just...interesting. Read it, but you won't cherish it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Harley is a victim. The &quot;morality&quot; of the work is questionable(and I don't mean the fundamentalist variety, no specific scene or image bothered me at all!). I would love to ask Tawni what meaning she intended to make with this piece. And I would also love to hear what feminist literary critics have to say about the work; but then again they usually direct their energies towards male authors. On the one hand the Oprah selection surprises me, but I think I understand why they seem to have pedestalized it. Still, I it's a solid effort and her command of craft is clearly evident."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is a sad and depressing tale that you can't put down!

As their mother is away in jail after being convicted of his murder, Harley begins an affair with a married woman who is the mother of his little sister's best friend. It becomes twisted and dark and you just sense this is not going to end well. Harley and the kids' life is doomed for poverty and despair. Lots of family secrets that have been tucked away come to light in a spiral of events. Kept me guessing how it was going to all play out. Very impressed with this being Tawni O'Dell's first novel."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is a great book if you're not looking for beach reading, althoughI also found it very quick and interesting reading. the characters aresimply unforgettable, and the writing is fresh and clear, with anervewracking edge I thoroughly enjoyed..."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"At the beginning of the story, I thought &quot;I'm not going to get into this book.&quot; I pushed myself to read the first chapter but after that I could not put the book down. I felt sorry for Harley, he was under so much pressure and I did not understand the feelings his sisters had towards him. As he continued his affair with Callie, I was sure that one of the girls was to blame for Callie's demise.

Granted, the reason I picked it up was because it was a selection for Oprah's Book Club, but I am so glad that I did. This book captures the reader's emotions and draws them into the lives of the characters whether they like it or not. I felt like I could go to Pennsylvania and actually find Harley and his sisters. Ms. O'Dell has a gift that she shares with the rest of us. It is that rare book that you will keep thinking about long after you have finished reading.

Now I'm grown up and live in New York, but I loved the book and encourage other to read it as well. The character descriptions were excellent. Just a fine piece of writing.

I really wanted to like this book. How disappointed I was! Although compelling for about the first half, it seemed like the author just didn't know where else to take it. The incest theme seemed to be thrown in as almost an afterthought,and yet was supposed to be central to the actions of those involved. Very disappointing! Not at all like many of Oprah's other selections."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"When I started reading this book, I was intrigued by Harley's courage, his ability to survive tragedy and adapt to hardship, and the intriguing mix of responsibility, fantasy, and devotion -to his particularly UNinteresting, dysfunctional family. This young man was damaged, twisted, and then defeated into the kind of fellow who had all the makings of a typical serial killer in a sequel -but a REAL \\"big brother\\" he is NOT. I felt that he was perverted, and abusive of EVERY female in his life, in some way, as he held no respect or genuine concern for any of them; they were merely \\"objects\\" he used, ignored, or detested. The entire drama was so tragic and disgusting, that I truly cannot recall experiencing any \\"reading pleasure\\" from this literary drivel. I finished the book hoping for SOMETHING better in the end -but when it was over, it only left a sour taste in my mouth. This was the first book I didn't pass on to a friend to read -and the first one I ever threw away."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Oprah pick or not, this book was a waste of money. The author seems to have some talent, but there was only one sympathetic character in the whole book (the woman with whom Harley is sleeping), and even her behavior was odd at times. This is a family with some serious problems, and it seems as if they just whine and mope and feel sorry for themselves. Harley comes across as some kind of half-wit without sense enough to realize that his sisters need the care and guidance of someone much more mature and stable than he is.

I'm glad I read the book! This book is about a family whose life is terrorized by an abusive father and a mother who sits back and doesn't do much beyond clean up her children's wounds and scream at her husband as this happens. When their mother is sentenced to life in prison for \\"killing\\" her husband (sorry you have to read it to find out who really killed him) the eldest son has to become the parent to all his three sisters. Even though he is only nineteen, he tries to keep them together the best way he knows how. Yes, there are a series of unfortunate events but that is to be expected in a dysfunctional broken family. Anyone who thinks this story is too raw or sordid lives in a bubble!The author does a really good job of telling the story, bringing you to the edge of your seat as the story unfolds. As I read this I felt like I was transported to that town in the smokey mountains. That for me is what good writing is all about; when an author can suck in the reader to the point that he/she feels present at the scene where the unfold. At the end I felt compassion for all the characters except Misty whom I wished was made to pay for her crime and the other things she did to help set the tragic events in motion.I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I highly recomment this novel for a quick, disturbing yet oddly entertaining read.

Yet her story shows how we all have basic similarities.I &quot;felt&quot; for each character. Whether what I &quot;felt&quot; was sympathy, contempt, impatience, or passion changed from scene to scene.

He was stuck in a situation he didn't know how to get out of."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"This is a brilliant and frequently difficult book. It is the story of Harley, a nineteen year old singlehandedly raising his three sisters after his mother is imprisoned for killing their father. Not only is he struggling to support his family, but he is also grappling with a family legacy of abuse, the magnitude of which is initially unclear. Harley is one of the most complex characters in modern fiction. He is simultaneously heroic, pathetic, frightening, sympathetic and abhorent. The increasingly awful events in his life and the overwhelming responsibilities he has assumed magnify the usual child/adult dichotomy common to his age.Sensitive readers should be forwarned that there are many unpleasant issues in this book - child abuse, adultery, incest. Nevertheless, O'Dell is a compelling storyteller and does an excellent job of making you care about the fate of her characters. It's interesting to compare this book to Wally Lamb's &quot;I Know This Much Is True&quot;. Both books are about a man trying to maintain his sanity despite a tramatic past and in the face of horrendous circumstances. O'Dell's book is by far the darker of the two and in many ways the more realistic. Lamb's book is about the anguish of living with a schizophrenic identical twin, not an everyday occurence. O'Dell's premise - children left to fend for themselves after their sole surviving parent is imprisoned - is unfortunately more common than we care to believe. I did think the ending of &quot;Back Roads&quot; was overdone, but not so much as to overshadow the finesse of the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"It has now been two weeks since I finished &quot;Back Roads&quot; and although some of the images have stayed with me and haunt me, I must say that I find the language and the content of the book to be disappointing, almost to the point of disgusting. I feel that the disfunctional family theme both in movies and in novels has just about run its course. It is a sad commentary on American society that such families do exist, to be sure, and we should be aware of their existence, but I fail to see the ultimate point of the book. I shall remember it to be sure, but I dare say that I do not have any desire to read Ms. O'Dell again."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"is foreign to O'Dell in Back Roads. If one could get through the verbal rubbish, the basic story line would be unbelieveable and unrealistic, but &quot;alright print for the tabloids..&quot; The book was an insult to the female spirit. The main character, Harley, ping/pongs between masterbation, work and sex without ever showering. One gets the image of this stinky cheese boy with greasy hair, dirt (and stuff) caked under his fingernails, hotdog &amp; mac cheese breath... but still manages, through O'Dell, to be feaverishly desirable to a classy/showered married woman. The spirit of this woman's character is whithering in discust. Beside being overpowered with the fact that Harley never showered or brushed his teeth, where was Social Services/Welfare and the Sanitation Department? and how did six year old Jody manage to catch her school bus on time every morning? ...not to mention groceries purchased for four on a bag boys income. I realize I'm going against the grain of previous reviews ~ and to each his own ~ but, I don't know where Oprah was going with this one. Not recommended for someone in search of a believeable escape. ...and forget it if you are in search of broading your intellectial horizon. Sorry, the only thing you can expect from reading this book, is the desire to compulsively shower."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"Picked up this book at Goodwill for 50 cents after reading the description on the jacket that is was \\"funny\\" and that Harley's \\"bumbling heroics would redeem them all\\". What book were they talking about? Heroics? Redeem them all? This Harley character in the book is not heroic and from the very beginning of the book the author has him casually wanting to \\"bash\\" his first dates head into the windshield of his truck. He then proceeds to attack the poor teenager in his truck, slapping her violently for no reason. Non-stop violent thoughts against woman. How can a \\"hero\\" commit such evil acts such as \\"date\\" violence? Even the object of his desires, Callie, a 33 year old Mom of 2...he wants to \\"turn her over and smash her face into the ground\\" when he has sexual encounter with her. This is the most disturbing character in a book that I have read about ever. He is a psycho. How he is able to be in charge of 3 young girls is disgusting. It's the way the writer casually puts his evil, brutal thoughts about every woman in the book as if it's \\"okay\\". Because, darn it, he's working 2 jobs and putting food on the table. I absolutely hated this book and had a real hard time finishing it. I hated the end of this book as well. The most depressing book I have ever read. I had no empathy for Harley. The entire book was chapter after chapter of \\"American Pie\\" young boy thoughts of sex, with references to bananas and cucumbers at his local job at a grocery store. But not normal teenage boy sex. Violent, aggressive, brutal thoughts of bashing woman's faces into glass. On more then one occasion she uses this violent reference toward woman. To me, this book was not about incest, but how a rapist and woman beater is thinking about his next prey. I cannot for the life of me, understand how Oprah could recommend this book. If this book was made into a movie, it would be a horror movie on the lines of Psycho or some other really creepy, terrifying male character. The writing style was awful too. And in the end there is absolutely no redemption. You are left hanging as to what happens to the 2 younger girls and the Mother who is in prison, falsely accused. If you want to read a really depressing book, this is it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I read this book in one sitting and like my title says it just creeps into your brain. I'm not one for reading Oprah books, or anything like that, but the storyline drew me in to getting it and reading it. The story, and esp Harley, made me love it. He's such a REAL character. I think that's the best you can say about a book, that it has at least one real character. I think this one may have a couple. Harley's on the edge through the whole book, it makes the story so urgent. I loved that aspect of the story. I only gave it four stars because it kind of falls apart at the end...esp this one action that I did not find believable, or particulary necessary. But it didn't really matter to me, because Harley still remains a really great character.

Harvey, the book's main character suffers from the pent up sexual frustrations of a teen and the responsibilities of a grown up. Setting this book in the back roads of a small Pennsylvania town amongst deacying coal mines and the shadowy Appalachian woods , Miss O'Dell makes her readers feel the gritty decay and injustice of Harvey's world. The images of violence in the book are so vivid that a lump rose in my throat and I had to blink away tears. The descriptions of Black Lick and the woods felt so close to memories of my own from Pennsylvania that I felt as if I knew these roads and the people who traveled them. From tiny details like the Stretch Armstrong Harvey fails to recieve for his birthday to the Eat N' Park parking lot, this novel captures the spirit of small town America and coming of age in the eighties and nineties remarkably. What made the book such an exciting read was the honesty of these charaters and the TRUTH behind every word of this novel."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL STORY!

I CANNOT WAIT FOR HER NEXT NOVEL."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"After reading the reviews, it would appear that this book evoked strong feelings, both positive and negative, from its readers. From that standpoint alone it is a success. Even those who hated it were profoundly affected. There was little indifference. I am in the category of those who loved it. It didn't start out that way. Oh, there was no doubt that O'Dell's writing was magnificent, almost poetic. Nor was I bothered by the disturbing subjects of incest, murder, statutory rape. One reviewer asked why we need to read about these things. Because they exist, and burying our heads in the sand is not an option. I just couldn't make a connection with the book, even though I acnkowledged the gorgeous writing, and found the characters well developed and interesting. But something happened halfway through the book. I can't really figure out what it was, but suddenly I became deeply and emotionally drawn to the story and its characters. I couldn't put the book down. Harley, the protagonist of the story, evoked such strong maternal feelings (I am the mother of a 17 year old and a 20 year old, both girls) because he was a young man in pain, with no one to turn to, and with such overwhelming responsibilities to his sisters. He seeks love with the mother of his younger sister's best friend. His father is dead and his mother is in prison for his murder. And he is only 19. For the rest of the book, I found myself alternately laughing and weeping. Some reviewers have complained that there is no humor in the book. It is subtle, and of course muted by the disturbing subject matter of the book, but it is there. I literally went from feeling the book was OK but not extraordinary, to realizing that it was one of, if not the, best book to come down the pike in a long time. Harley and his sisters, Jody, Misty, and Amber, will stay with me for a long time. Don't read this if you are uncomfortable with controversial subject matters. But if you are not, you will be depriving yourself of a most remarkable experience if you don't read it. I am far from an Oprah fan, and her endorsement had nothing to do with my decision to read this. So whether or not you like or don't like Oprah, leave her out of the equasion. This book stands on its own merits as a significant literary event. I, like some other readers, await with great anticipation, more books from this incredibly talented author."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I picked up this book because 1) it was an Oprah pick and 2) the reviews were so interesting I was intrigued and curious. Tawni O'Dell has written a wonderful book. I can't believe it's a debut novel. She has captured so well the torment and intensity of this young man. There are so many parts of Harley that are pushed and pulled and strained. It's a wonder he didn't go over the edge with all he had to cope with. Harley is a truly interesting character whom I have thought about long after I finished the book. This book has some of the same intensity that Wally Lamb showed us in THIS MUCH I KNOW IS TRUE. Families can make you crazy in many ways. Everyone copes differently. I highly recommend this book. If you like good character development, Harley is a great one. Read it."},{"Title":"Computational study of the aerodynamics and control of the asymmetric vortical flows over Delta wings (JIAA TR)","review":"I want to tell you not to read this book - but I won't. I want to hate this book - but I can't. I want to forget this book - but it has scarred me.Four children are orphaned when their mother is jailed for killing their abusive father. The oldest, the son named Harley, is thrust into the role of being father and mother to three sisters, Amber, Misty and Jodie. He is struggling with becoming an adult - hormones, etc. - and is now shouldered with responsibilities normally earned by one many years older than he. He works two jobs, wonders if he should be bothered that the girls seem to eat only hot dogs and frozen pizza and worries about finding money to pay the property taxes on the house. He maintains regular appointments with a psychiatrist to work through issues relating to his mother's absence and incarceration. The older sister, Amber, is a rural Lolita: a vulnerable vixen, who looks for security in meaningless sex with local hoods. She wants her drivers' license but not a part-time job needed to pay for her own insurance. The middle girl, Misty, is rage in a prepubescent body. In moodiness and isolation, she harbors the family secrets and her own resentments over her father's death. The baby, Jody, is the joy and innocence remaining of this damaged family; she witnesses the family's decent but is shielded from recognition by childhood and its undaunted optimism. She hides in \\"to do\\" lists, which reflect a world of make-believe and an attempt to bring order to chaos erupting around her.Jody is the only child to have escaped her father's hand. Each of the older children bears the physical and emotional scars of abuse. In the absence of the mother, who is damned for both killing the abuser but failing to stop the abuse, Harley, Amber and Misty cannot make a \\"family\\" from what is left of a group of individuals trying to survive. They both love and hate one another; they cannot embrace each other because the wounds inflicted by years of abuse are still raw and sensitive. The amusement with which Harley shares his experiences and struggles only exaggerates the ruination of their lives.This story is \\"Party of Five\\" in a nightmare. Other reviewers have doted on the Appalachian setting as creating a \\"local color\\" work, but this family crisis could have been staged at any time or place. I think I recall seeing a similar story on \\"Law and Order - Special Victims Unit\\" once; if I didn't, it would work, all the same . . . This is not a story for the faint of heart. I cried for these children and their lost innocence; I wanted to kill their dead father; I wanted to punish their jailed mother personally. My strong reaction is making this review difficult to write.This book is the first \\"Oprah's Pick\\" I can recommend but not because I \\"like\\" it. I like this book in the way I know it is often best to vomit when I have a bad stomachache. It's one of those painful things we must endure - facing the crimes and atrocities in our own modern society - in order to impart meaning and purpose to our own lives. However, in today's environment of mass media assault, where camcorders can take us directly to the scene of a massacre, the perverse exhilaration from such a book as this comes from the knowledge that I am still outraged by it."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"In \\"The Evolution - Creation Struggle\\" well known philosopher and evolutionary commentator Michael Ruse discusses the development of evolutionary science. I offer the following thoughts to potential readers.First, it should be noted that this is not a book for readers seeking a rigorous examination of current evolutionary theory. This work is largely a survey of the historic developments in evolutionary thought and the corresponding responses to these developments. Ruse's overview of pre-Darwinian evolutionary thought is well done and commendable. Darwin like many other great thinkers did not work in a vacuum, but instead benefited from the work and effort of his predecessors and contemporaries. It is useful to recognise the contiguous nature of intellectual progress in an era where the contributions of an individual (no matter how insightful) can often be overstated.Though he is clearly within the pro-evolutionary camp, Ruse does not hesitate to highlight similarities between Darwinists and creationists. Similar to Religion, a \\"Darwinian\\" worldview involves faith and offers an ontological framework for adherents. In examining the current uproar about Darwinism Ruse rightfully acknowledges that many theists are not hostile to evolution (e.g. it could just be the means that God choose to create). Rather, it appears that it is the grandiose ontological and ethical extrapolations that some commentators draw from Darwinism that raises the ire of sceptics. Ruse's nuanced voice continues to be a positive force in a discussion that is sometimes characterised by excessive emotion and inflated epistemological claims. I appreciate the author's intellectual humility - his lack of doctrinal orthodoxy, however, may make his views anathema to some hard-core Darwinists.Ruse's use of a pre milleniumist/post milleniumist construct to analyze the reactions to evolutionary theory is an interesting but awkward approach. Granted one could argue that many atheists fall within his post -milleniumist category - focused on progress and improving the here and now. I find it difficult, however, to shoehorn more than a small minority of theists into the other category. Although when asked they may indicate that conversion is of paramount importance - their philanthropic actions speak volumes with regard to their concern for, and commitment to, improving the present world.Ruse only touches on Intelligent Design briefly, however, his comments are useful. I share some of his musings regarding ID. Is it a science? Can it be falsified? What predictive power does it have? Whether or ID proves to be \\"scientific\\" in the narrow sense of the word, it does serve to highlight many of the challenges facing Darwinism (whether we like it or not). For instance, regardless of the reducibility of Behe's sub-cellular organisms they do highlight a nagging challenge to contemporary evolutionary theory - time. Darwin recognized this hurdle in his day when the earth was believed to be only several hundred million years old (we now think that number is closer to 4 billion). This increased time would sound good if our view of complexity had remained constant. Unfortunately, complexity has increased by orders of magnitude. In Darwin's time Aristotle's spontaneous generation theory of life was still popular and cells were seen as relatively simple structures - clearly not the case. The development of all these complex entities in the allotted time through an undirected mechanism- despite the rhetoric remains significant.I found Ruse's writing style a bit awkward at times. For instance, I found his use of poems and quotations overdone - they often added little. A cynic could argue that the author was padding material that would otherwise have made for a couple of short papers/articles.Overall, worthwhile, but not Ruse's best work. His tone is appreciated, as always, however, the book does not bring anything new to the discussion for readers familiar with the issue."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"With this book Michael Ruse brings some of the fruits of his less accessible scholarship to a popular audience, and it is a welcome contribution to the growing literature on the creation-evolution divide. Unlike the first reviewer on this page, Ruse is an internationally-reputed philosopher of science who knows most of the important living evolutionists personally, and is thus admirably well qualified to speak critically on these matters. His writing style is also one of the most readable and engaging you are likely to find."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"I hope I won't be penalized here for just writing a couple of sentences. I found Ruse's book to be very interesting. His analysis of the philosophical history of evolutionary thought is worth the price of the book. I also like that he senses that the debate between proponents of evolution and creationism is really about a much bigger question. I see it as the same question raging in the Middle East right now: will we have a secular or religious based society.I don't think Ruse's book will change any minds - just look at the length and depth of the other reviews and it's easy to see how passionate people feel about these questions. The real value of the book is its dispassionate look at everyone's assumptions and arguments. Should give both sides some firepower."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"\\"My area of expertise is the clash between evolutionists and creationists, and my analysis is that we have no simple clash between science and religion but rather between two religions... Those of us who love science must do more than simply restate our positions or criticize our opposition. We must understand our own assumptions and, equally, find out why others have (often) legitimate concerns. This is not a plea for weak-kneed compromise but a more informed and self-aware approach to the issues. First understanding, and then some strategic moves. You now know why I wrote this book.\\"There it was; out of the blue. \\"You know now why I wrote this book.\\" It is a good thing Ruse made that clear on the final page of his new book, for if he did not, I might have never known.Michael Ruse has of late made a habit out of writing the same book over and over again. This is another \\"how we got there from here,\\" book filled with much of the same history that he has given in past books (most notably, \\"Darwin and Design\\") with many of the same conclusions. I often caught myself wondering why he went through the trouble of writing this book when all he had to do was release an anthologized collection of excerpts from past ones.This book, disjointed as it is, aims at showing us how the evolution/creation struggle developed from the pre-Darwin days to today. Ruse asserts that these two 'movements' stemmed from a 'crisis of faith' starting from the reformation. He tracks both how creationism became more and more fervent as a response to the growing evolutionary philosophy/science and how evolution became more fervent in response to that response.Ruse has caught particular flack from the view, as seen in the above quote, that evolution has been and can be often taken as a religion. He trecks through the tired history of Spencer, Sumner, and the Social Darwinists, the believers in a directional evolution of the 1950s, up to todays 'true believers' in Dawkins, Dennett, and Wilson.Ruse seems to be making the point that evolution is too easily seen as directional - teleological and when thus seen, it too easily becomes religion-like. This is a good point but I've seen it made better elsewhere by the likes of Mary Midgley, Steven Jay Gould, and even Ruse himself (in \\"Darwin and Design,' focusing exclusively on teleology and evolution).Ruse is on significantly weaker ground in suggesting that religion and evolution can easily and peacefully co-exist. I used to be convinced of this but like Ruse, I now see Steven Gould's attempts at diplomacy as condescending to both sides. Point blankly: evolution simlpy contradicts one of the most sacred roles delegated to God in the Bible. Yes, Ruse points to Christians who have successfully balanced Christianity and evoluition, but only because they chose evolution over genesis (i.e., adapted the view that genesis and the bible are metaphorical and, hence, not to be taken at their word.) Ruse tries and tries but doesn't make any convincing case that one does not have to choose between genesis and evolution.My big complaint, though, with this book is in its layout. If Ruse's above quote is right, and his point in the book was to suggest strategies for how the 'evolution problem' can be best fought, then most of the book was simply irrelevant. In his 'Conclusion' for instnace, he suggests that evolutionists need to band together in fighting ID instead of getting hung up on disagreements over detail. Agreed. But where, I ask myself, did he make that point in the book. The only answer I came to was, \\"Just now.\\"I fear that in trying to appeal to both sides of the evolution/Creation struggle, he will end up appealing to neither side. His arguments are often hasty, and most of the book (as another reviewer notes) just does not support, or even speak much to, his conclusions.If you want a book that does make a persuasive case that evolution often passes into the 'zeaolot' category (I think this is true) read Mary Midgley's \\"Evolution as Religion.\\" Or read Ruse's own \\"Darwin and Design.\\""},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"Ruse's basic point is that there is evolution - a genuine science of the origin of species that begins, for intents and purposes, with Darwin. There is also a kind of a secular religion -his term - based upon evolution that he terms \\"evolutionism.\\" Evolutionism is used to advance a particular progressive worldview.Ruse says that that while it would be nice if scientists were not evolutionists, that isn't the case. Contrary to the protestations of some -eg, Stephen Jay Gould - evolution like all science itself does imply certain cultural values. Furthermore, many important evolution scientists, including Edward O. Wilson, used evolution to advance evolutionist positions, eg to comment on biodiversity and the like.While the cruder forms of evolutionism -such as eugenics- can be intellectually discredited easily, Ruse believes that it is probably neither possible nor desirable to pretend that evolution doesn't have implications that challenge the verities of a religious tradition, or that in some sense, the troubling notion of biological \\"progress\\" can be avoided. He urges his readers to learn more about the theological and cultural issues that surround the topic of evolution.Good points. And Ruse writes as clear and as beautifully as a summer day on an Icelandic glacier. The problem is that, given the examples he chooses, he's less than compelling in establishing evolutionism as a full-blown \\"secular\\" religion. That scientists would \\"metaphorize\\" a subject like evolution and believe it has implications that go beyond their science comes as no surprise. But nowhere, in the Wilson that he quotes, for example, do I see evidence of the reliance on faith or the desire for supernatural, ecstatic transcendence that characterizes many religious traditions.Furthermore, the concept of evolutionism is so broad that it encompasses everyone from the eugenicists to Dawkins. That ideologues of all stripes would glom onto the latest trendy science for metaphors has been true since Descartes. This tells us very little about the current controversy.Finally, Ruse all but sidesteps the fact that the present controversy over evolution is tied to the resurgence of the extreme right wing and that many of those advancing anti-science agendas in the US today are political activists exploiting religious traditions rather than true believers. Their interest is not science, but political power.The book is at its most compelling when Ruse argues that all those who oppose the teaching of lies in science classes are going to have to learn to form a coalition despite their differences. Otherwise, creationists (and the so-called \\"intelligent design\\" gang) will continue to succeed in injecting religious doctrine into science. After all, there are huge doctrinal differences between Catholics, Protestant evangelicals, and IDiocy advocates like Behe and Dembski; if they can get unite for a common cause, so can those who care about teaching real science to American students.On this last point, he is 100% right."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"Michael Ruse must hold some kind of record for his effort in reconciling disputes and bring calm to contentious arenas. The evolution-creation conflict has raged around him for thirty years. He's attempted to impart the issues, describe the contenders and resolve the philosophical differences. His many books have covered the viewpoints from several directions. He presents various perspectives as dispassionately as these may be conveyed. He obviously abhors strife. This book may be the penultimate effort on his part to parley the current dispute in the USA over \\"intelligent design\\" and evolutionary biology.His method is almost military. Assemble the warring troops and conscript them into a single force. He introduces nearly every figure in Enlightenment Protestantism on the Continent, Britain and the Western Hemisphere. Puritan Jonathon Edwards stands, if uneasily, with Matthew Arnold and pre-conversion John Henry Newman. Ranks of evolutionists, from the Darwins, grandfather Erasmus and the renowned Charles, through Thomas Huxley and Ronald Fisher. As the phalanx swells in number, Ruse struggles to show where similarities imply some level of uniformity. Darwin started out to be a cleric and various churchmen sought to find a divine plan in the evidence Nature depicted to those willing to observe and record.On the Continent and Britain, \\"creation\\" as a firm stance receded quietly in the background. As Ruse has stated elsewhere, it was possible for a Darwinian to be a Christian, and vice versa. In the USA, the picture was different, beginning even before independence. Distance from European influences and the sense of mission many settlers brought in their knapsacks led to the rise of \\"exceptionalism\\" there. Not only was the new nation blessed with material benefits, but the arrangement was deemed part of a divine plan. Implicit in the plan was the notion of \\"progress\\". Darwin's natural selection decreed no purpose to evolution, an idea which even ardent followers couldn't accept. Instead, the human species was placed at the top of the evolutionary tree in solitary splendour. All that was needed to fulfill the \\"plan\\" was to determine the way humans should work out their mandate.Exceptionalism under divine mandate had no hesitation in declaring that the god's intention was to favour those who kept the faith. The Second Coming, long debated in Europe, found new, and strident, spokesmen in the USA. \\"Millenarianism\\", either pre- or post- , depending on what scenario was favoured, became a major motif in Christianity there. Versions of these themes would generate \\"fundamentalism\\" and literal - or nearly so - readings of one of the many Bibles. Ruse skims over why this movement came to such intense power in the USA, but he doesn't doubt its impact. He cites the depressing statistics of US citizens in their acceptance of a deity and firm date for the world's origins. He notes the vague understanding of the role of humans in Nature, with some accepting evolution, yet detaching humanity from the process. These muddled outlooks are reflected in the rise of first, \\"creationism\\", then \\"creation science\\" and finally today's desperate attempt to keep the divine in Nature, \\"intelligent design\\".With the disclosure of DNA's power to guide life's path, the conflict between religion and biological science in the USA assumed a fresh intensity. In his chapter \\"Evolution Today\\", Ruse lines up new ranks of contenders. Still struggling to don them in uniforms to reduce disparities, he offers Ian McEwan as a novelist introducing altruism as a natural aspect of human life. In his description of Edward O. Wilson, Ruse shows how a lapsed Baptist could still retain a strong sense of ethics, but derived from our ancestors in the deep past, not from religious education. Nature, says Ruse, holds a promise for humanity. We need only stop contending over who can best show us what that is and how to recognise it.The problem, says Ruse, is overcommittment. Both the religious and scientific spokesmen have become entrenched in their views. Always the peacemaker, this quietly passionate scholar seeks to have two \\"camps\\" take serious and reasonably unprejuiced looks at what the other is saying. Why do the faithful believe so strongly? Why do evolutionists tend to slide into \\"evolutionism\\" - taking \\"evolution beyond science\\"? Ruse sees both camps seeking human betterment as the goal for all. Ruse takes a sideways swipe at Richard Dawkins for his \\"boyish atheism\\" as one of the more disturbing elements. This is an unfortunate lapse for Ruse [although he's done it before]. Whatever Ruse's attempts at quieting dispute, he blithely ignores the levels of violence monotheists are capable of perpetrating. He also ignores the wealth of recent scholarship challenging the long-held tenets of Christianity. He forgets that religion is founded on dogma, science on assessment of data.We should pay some heed to what Ruse attempts to achieve in this book. Natural selection has offered some insights into why individuals find strong stances appealing. Regrettably, there's been little suggested on means to soften them. Ruse may provide some reasonable solutions, but bending inflexible minds will take more than his calm approach.

As such the battle between YEC(young earth creationists) and people like Dawkins, Dennett, Gould, Wilson etc is a religion vs religion battle not as it is mislabelled and misunderstood as a religion vs science battle.This book ought to be required reading for anyone who desires to enter into the innumerable online CED discussions, perhaps then something would actually get to the point of reasonable and fruitful conversations there, for without the distinction the argument is endless and worthless. I sure hope this book gets the eyeball time it deserves, especially from those i see everyday posting the same arguments that are category errors because they lack this distinction.The theme of the book appears on pg3:\\"The dispute (between evolutionists and creationists), as we shall see, is more than merely a matter of right and wrong. At some deeper level, it involves commitments about the nature of reality and the status and obligations of humans in this reality. In particular, I argue that in both evolution and creation we have rival religious responses to a crisis of faith--rival stories of origins, rival judgments about the meaning of human life, rival sets of moral dictates, and above all what theologian call rival eschatologies--picture of the future and of what lies ahead for humankind.\\"as he says in a few more pages--this is a clash of rival metaphysical world pictures, evolutionism and creationism.Chapter 1-Christianity and its DiscontentsBegins with a history lesson, \\"the Reformation did have repercussions and implications that slowly began to undermine the very foundations of Christianity.\\" pg 13It is this crisis of faith that Ruse locates both the beginning of creationism and evolutionism, brothers birthed from the same Western culture, responding to the same growth of secular science and the critical and people upsetting social and cultural changes that undermined the religious certainty that had previously glued together medieval European Christendom. \\"The first reaction to the eighteenth century's crisis of faith was simply to opt out of the conflict. In this view, reason and evidence, made supreme, are tools of the devil, and on the really crucial issues they are deceptive. The way to God is through an open and loving heart, through emotional commitment, not rational choice--that is, through faith and conversion. Thus the Protestantism of the Reformation gave way to evangelicalism, \\"pg 17 The first separation, the first big battle, is epistemological, something i have come to believe over the years and really appreciate how well Ruse ties together pieces i know but didn't fully see related to the big picture, a valuable thing.He then makes a crucial alignment, millennial thinking and apocalytic thinking, in particular, premillennialism with creationism. This forms one of the major threads of his entire argument. But he looks at progress next, seeing it as postmillennialism, secularized and brought down from heaven to earth, applied to all of humanity not just a portion. This is the counterpoint thread to premill, and he associates it with evolutionism. How he does this is the topic of Chapter 2-From Progress to Evolution, \\"the cultural idea of progress led to the biological idea of evolution.\\" pg 28 It is a good and informative chapter, perhaps if you only can skim a few pages this is the chapter to look at first. He introduces the great chain of being and the political connections to both the French Revolution and to Darwin's upper middle class British culture, thus laying the groundwork for Chapter 3-The Growth of a Pseudoscience and 4-Charles Darwin, the real meat of the book and when he introduces his really big idea.Ruse is proposing that evolution started as a pseudoscience which incorporated cultural and social values into a system which only in the 1920-30 became a professional, a real science, as it incorporated genetics and becomes what we now call the neo-darwinian modern synthesis. Chapter 5-the Failure of a Professional Science is the years following Darwin and how the evolutionism domains the field by presenting a science-based ideology that has as it's purpose the explanation of the meaning of life and the human position within it.Chapter 6-Social Darwinism is a short study of H.Spenser and T.Huxley and how they built \\"Popular evolution--evolutionism--offered a world picture, a story of origins, and a special place for humans in the scheme of things. At the same time, it delivered moral exhortations, prescribing what we ought to do if we want things to continue well.\\"pg 122 rengthening the case for the religious nature of post-Darwinian evolutionism was its link to millennial thinking, which began to flourish in a major way in popular culture in the nineteenth century\\". pg 123Progressivism or as Ruse terms it secular post-millennialism is the modern myth that most drives our modern capitalist societies, that evolutionism hooked into this thinking is crucial and most certainly one of Ruse's great contributions to the debate with this book.Chapter 7-Christian Responses, but 8-Fundamentalism is the more interesting of the two chapters. He aligns fundamentalism with the American providential historical idea of the city on the hill, where the common ideology was that God has very special plans for America in His great scheme of things. It was nice to see a line about pew space, a crucial measure i used recently in a class i taught on American Presbyterian history, perhaps that is why i like the book, big pieces of it resonant with me...... He brings up Scottish Common Sense realism, the Civil War as a theological crisis that separated North and South, allowed the North to move more liberally religiously and socially and had the South, home to fundamentalism, react to all these as it separated and isolated after the War.Chapter 9-Population Genetics outlines how evolution began to be a real professional science and slowly ridded itself of some of the more ideological and social values that it had. A big part of this is the definition of the two distinct levels-metaphysics with progressivism and the science with random mutation and the natural selection filter that increases population fitness to the environment without purpose or teleology.This forms the climax of the book, Ruse having presented his ideas and made his case.Chapter 10-Evolution Today is a quick look at sociobiology and a look at evolutionism vs evolution today. Chapter 11-Nature as Promise and 12-Earth's Last Days? are basically Ruse's attempt to put himself in his opponents shoes, first liberal religious and second conservative fundamentalist to see how they can react to the distinction of evolutionism and the science of evolution. He recapitulates his major points (making this a good chapter to scan second) and asks how to solve the problem of these two battling religions."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"It's becoming increasingly clear nowadays that there is something else going on with the discussions about creationism, Intelligent Design and evolution than merely a discussion concerning the 'facts' of evolution. Michael Ruse in this book really makes it clear that the discussions on evolution and religious belief are not about facts, but constitute a clash between worldviews, or - in James Hunter's terms - a culture war.Ruse describes the history of the debates concerning evolution from the publication of Darwin's ideas until the contemporary debates concerning Intelligent Design. He shows (1) how scientists have interpreted Darwin's evolutionary theory in worldview terms, which, consequently, provoked responses from religious believers. Ruse argues that scientists making worldview claims based on evolutionary theory are NOT doing science, but are constructing worldviews! (2) Ruse also shows how the negative responses to evolutionary theoryby Christian theologians was often triggered by theological and moral presuppositions about e.g. human nature and the end of time (eschatology).Ruse's main points are (1) that the clash between evolution and creationism and Intelligent Design can best be described as a clash between \\"religions\\", and (2) that there are plenty of bright theologians who have shown in a very nuanced way how evolutionary theory and Christian faith can live in peaceful coexistence.This book simply is magnificent. Not only does this book show why scientific facts have so little impact on creation-evolution debates (they simply are irrelevant, since the underlying problems are not about the facts but go much deeper). Moreover, Ruse writes humorous and in an extremely human way.As a theologian, I daresay that, though Ruse confessed to be an agnostic, he knows more about what religion is really about than the many American theologians and believers who embrace creationism or Intelligent Design...FINAL NOTE:If you liked this book and want more knowledge on the social-historical and political backgrounds of the culture war, I can warmly recommend the book \\"Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America\\" by James Davison Hunter (New York: Basic Books 1991), also available through Amazon.com."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"A Methodist minister I know often preaches that the three men in recent history who have caused the greatest harm to humanity are Marx, Freud and Darwin. I am inclined to agree with him on the first two; and although I vehemently disagree with him on the third, I do understand his position. It is often argued, by theists and non-theists alike, that Darwin gave atheists a compelling argument for their lack of faith. However, in the book The Evolution-Creation Struggle, Michael Ruse disagrees, maintaining that both evolutionism and evangelism are responses to a general crisis of faith that has its roots in the eighteenth century Age of Enlightenment.The emphasis on reason over faith during the Enlightenment was due in part to advances in science that were beginning to have a positive impact on everyday living. Many influential thinkers of this period were deists, viewing God more as a prime mover than as an active participant in his creation, a belief that was more compatible with the naturalistic worldview required of science. Thus, the crisis in faith precedes Darwin. Indeed, Ruse claims that \\"[f]ew people became evolutionists and then lost their religious faith as a result\\"; rather, these people became \\"dissatisfied with their religion and then went looking for something else\\" (p. 29). On the other hand, this clash between reason and faith led others to reject reason and science, making emotion instead the focus of their faith. Hence, Ruse concludes that \\"both evolution and creation\\" are \\"rival religious responses to [this] crisis of faith\\" (p. 17).Charles Darwin was far from the first to propose a theory of evolution. Indeed, his grandfather Erasmus Darwin had proposed a theory of common ancestry based on the isomorphic features of living organisms. Around the same time in France, Lamarck proposed a theory of speciation based on acquired characteristics that were passed on to future generations. Furthermore, Lyell's argument that the natural world could be explained in terms of physical laws acting over eons (p. 46) gave evolution the time it needed to produce new species. Thus, Ruse comments that \\"[e]volution had been in the air for a long time, and many people had been looking for a reason to believe it\\" (p. 85). Darwin's theory of natural selection gave them that reason.The idea of evolution, which Ruse calls evolutionism, arose during the Enlightenment and was intimately related to the idea of social progress. Both Lamarck and Erasmus Darwin interpreted the fossil record as a biological progression from simpler to more complex structures, a great Chain of Being, with humans, of course, at the top. Evolutionism also provided a vehicle for promoting social progress during the nineteenth century, and twentieth-century evolutionary biologists have tended to be progressivists as well. E. O. Wilson, Theodosius Dobzhansky and Ernst Mayr, at least in their popular writings, all linked social progress with biological evolution, and even Richard Dawkins' views are progressivist when he describes evolution as a \\"one-way ratchet of progressive innovation\\" (p. 222).Ruse links the evolutionist-creationist debate to premillennial and postmillennial thinking in Christian eschatology. The premillennialist believes that the Second Coming of Jesus is approaching and that the focus of human endeavor meanwhile should be on spiritual development. The postmillennialist believes that the Second Coming is still a distant prospect and that the focus of human endeavor for the present should be on social progress. \\"Evolutionists are postmillennialists,\\" Ruse maintains, because of their desire to \\"improve our lot and bring about heaven on Earth\\" (p. 267). Creationists, on the other hand, are more likely to be premillennialists.It may seem odd to conflate evolutionism and postmillennialism, but Ruse maintains that evolutionists have made a religion of their science, offering the promise of progress as a substitute for traditional Christian faith. Thus, the clash between evolutionism and creationism is not simply a conflict between science and religion, but rather a conflict between two religions, \\"always the bitterest kind\\" (p. 267). Not only do fundamentalists object to the way that evolutionary theory challenges their faith in the Biblical story of creation, but scientists also object to the way creationists challenge their faith in methodological naturalism by insisting on bringing supernatural forces into the equation. Ruse disagrees with those, like Stephen Jay Gould, who insist that science and religion are different magisteria; rather, each impinges on the other.During the twentieth century, Christian theologians have struggled with the question of how to integrate the science of evolution with their faith. Some, like Karl Barth, simply reject reason as a means of understanding God. Others, like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, feel that they can successfully integrate science with their faith. In general, though, Christian thinkers recognize that the process of natural selection does not necessarily lead to the development of man created in the image of God, and so they prefer a more Lamarckian worldview that paints \\"nature as a harmonious web rather than a parched battlefield of struggle and strife\\" (p. 230). However, the natural world is not obliged to cater to our preferences, and a pick-and-choose approach to integrating evolution with theology is disingenuous. In contrast, Barth's position, at least, is intellectually honest.Ruse closes his book by observing the political alliance that has formed between young-earth creationists, who reject nearly all of science, and the proponents of intelligent design, who generally do not necessarily reject geological time or evolutionary processes. What these two disparate groups have in common is a loathing for naturalism in science. In like manner, Ruse suggests that atheistic evolutionists cultivate Christian evolutionists as allies in the current ID war, calling for \\"a little more tolerance of those who might wish to make something more of the mystery of life\\" (p. 284). Yet, given the reluctance of Christian thinkers to accept all implications of evolutionary theory, one wonders just how fruitful this alliance would be.Ruse is clearly on the side of the scientists. However, his painting of the evolution-creation debate as a religious war inadvertently lends support to the old creation science counter-argument that evolution is also \\"just\\" a religion. Nevertheless, Ruse provides a broad history of this debate from the Enlightenment to the present day, and he presents the various concerns that people of faith have about evolution with empathy and honesty. The Evolution-Creation Struggle is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the roots of this dispute."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"As others have already noted, this is a book which focuses on the history of evolution and creationism rather than a text on current debates or legal battles. Michael Ruse has served \\"in the trenches\\" of this battle, having provided testimony in important court cases on whether creationism qualifies as a science or not.As a quick note, I'd suggest starting with his conclusion and then reading the rest of the book to see how he fleshes out his analysis.My main concern, having read creationist literature for quite some time, is that his key ideas in his book will be overlooked and the book will be mined for supposedly self-incriminating quotations. One of the hings that I loathe about creationist literature is its intellectual dishonesty in seeking out isolated (can you say \\"out of context\\"?) quotes that make it look like Gould or Dawkins actually deny the validity of evolutionary theory.For the lazy creationists out there, you want to start at p. 266, \\"Rival Religions.\\" Michael Ruse is making solid and honest points about the development of creationism and evolution (-ism), but this section will no doubt be cited by people who want to maintain that creationism and evolution are both religions...which doesn't prevent them from saying in the next breath that they're both science.Potential abuse aside, this is a great book for those who are interested in the historical development of this debate."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"Dr. Michael Ruse's book is really good. He explains how the controversy between evolution and creation goes back to before Darwin. He then proceeds to show how the struggle has developed over the last two centuries. One of the most interesting aspects is how Dr. Ruse shows that people take extreme positions on both sides of the issue but that there are a number of people in the middle (both religious and non-religious) who try to find a balance. One of the most fascinating chapters, \\"Nature as Promise,\\" shows how theologians (such as John Haught and Keith Ward) and theistic scientist (such as Pierre Tielhard de Chardin and Simon Conway Morris) have found a way of accepting both evolution and a belief in God. Definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"Michael Ruse has done us a great favor in setting the record staight on the early history of evolution. Even if you are a fairly literate layman on the subject, Ruse will probably put several big cracks in the evolution/creation spectacles you didn't even know you were looking through. For instance:- The usual story about how the entire western world slavishly believed in six days' creation until the genius of Darwin set us free with science is completely wrong headed.- Evolution, or \\"progress\\", was in the intellectual air for a full century before Darwin came along. Darwin's contribution was to give already enthusiastically embraced evolution a potential to develop in a truly scientific manner.- Darwin never saw his evolutionary ideas turn into a true, hard science. Most of his disciples wandered off into what Ruse calls the pseudoscience of ideological \\"evolutionism\\". Those that remained true to the scientific enterprise wandered into the morass of comparative morphology, a field that was recognized as a scientific dead end by the beginning of the twentieth century.- The theological response to evolution, early on, was not uniformly hostile. More than a few theologians were already caught up in \\"evolutionism\\" themselves.- It was not until the 1930's that evolution, coupled with the new sciense of genetics, finally became the hard science Darwin had wanted to produce.Unfortunately, \\"The Evolution-Creation Struggle\\" runs out of steam just when things start to get interesting. The Scope's trial gets amazingly short shrift, though Ruse does spend enough pages on it to explode a few more stereotypes we have all inherited from \\"Inheret the Wind.\\" And then, the story of how we went from a nation where evolutionists had to fight in the courts to get into the public schools to today, when it is the creationists who have to do the fighting, is completely absent. Surely, regardless of which side you're on here, this story would be fascinating and surely belongs in a book of Ruse's chosen subject.That being said, Ruse does provide a fair-minded review of the thoughts of all the major camps in the contemporary struggle that I think anyone on any side of the fight will find exceptionally informative. He makes a few mistakes, such as tending to lump the intelligent design folks in with the siz day's creationists. He spends several paragraphs on the cooperation between the two groups, but he shows no awareness of the attempts several big name creationsts have made to throw the ID believers under the theological bus. But, by and large, he does present very accurately and fairly what the IDers believe.And he gets a few tangential issues wrong as well. The old canard about the American founders being deists and agnostics is only about fifteen per cent true. And, reading Ruse, it's easy to get the impression that the Pope \\"ex cathedra\\" declared evolution anathema in the 1800's. It never happened.In the end, \\"The Evolution-Creation Struggle\\" is very helpful, perhaps indispensible, in our understanding the aspects of the evolution-creation struggle that it touches on. I just wish his history of the struggle hadn't left out most of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"What does 'evolutionism' have to do with the science of evolution? Not much -- no more than alchemy has to do with the science of chemistry, or astrology has to do with the science of astronomy. In each case, one is a valid science, while the other is a set of value-laden extrapolations and interpolations.This book sketches the history of both -- evolutionary science and evolutionism -- and how they do and do not interrelate. Ruse is careful not to elide the distinction as he draws it out with his usual clarity, but as at least one reviewer has noted, the anti-science crowd will find ways to construe Ruse as saying evolutionary science is just another creed."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"Michael Ruse fails to sustain his argument, I'm afraid, in THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE. The title is misleading because it's not specific enough. The story of the anti-Enlightenment/anti-Darwin fundamentalist backlash is not new, and Ruse doesn't attempt to add anything to it. What IS new is the story Ruse tells of how \\"evolutionism\\" was also a reaction to the Enlightenment, a more optimistic reaction. The best part of the book is Ruse's marshalling of evidence to this effect in the period prior to the Darwinian revolution. And before I forget to say it, Ruse is not arguing that modern biology and the neo-Darwinian synthesis it's based on is not scientific. What he is discussing is the wider metaphysical backdrop of the scientific theory of natural selection-plus-genetics.But it's a classic case of a Procrustean bed -- Ruse tries to fit his intellectual history into the constraining concept that creationists are premillennialists and \\"evolutionists\\" are postmillennialists. In other words, the liberal/progressive intellectuals and scientists can also be situated on the Christian metaphysical terrain -- they believe that it is up to humanity to perfect the world BEFORE Christ returns. I just don't buy it. The claim is too big and his evidence too scanty, indirect, and circumstantial.There does seem to be some truth to a more general idea, which is far from original. Max Weber, the great German sociologist, claimed that the Protestant work ethic continued to propel the accumulation of wealth even after the religious belief fell away (THE PROTESTANT ETHIC AND THE SPIRIT OF CAPITALISM). And the process philosopher Alfred North Whitehead famously said that \\"[The Middle Ages] was the age of faith based upon reason. [The 18th Century in Europe] was the age of reason, based upon faith.\\" (SCIENCE AND THE MODERN WORLD, p. 57). In other words, the structure of belief continues to inform thought even after belief fades. But here is where Ruse goes wrong, in my view. He elides the distinction, and claims that the BELIEF continues, and so calls \\"evolutionism\\" a form of religious belief, a postmillennial religious belief.Some further thoughts on the flaws in Ruse's argument: 1) Darwin's theory of natural selection has always struck me as depressing. Compelling, but depressing. I am certainly not alone in this. So there is a big problem with Ruse's insistence that \\"evolutionism\\" is necessarily an optimistic view. This is one way that the observable facts do not fit his conceptual scheme. 2) An increasingly influential faction among the evangelical/fundamentalists is known as the Dominionists -- James Dobson of Focus on the Family is the leading figure in this group. The Dominionists are -- postmillennialists! They are aspiring theocrats, who believe it the job of the Christians to take over the government and rule according to Old Testament principles in preparation for Christ's return. This is another case where the observable facts do not support Ruse's theory of \\"fundamentalist premillennialists\\" versus \\"progressive postmillennialists.\\" 3) Ruse has left many support structures out, and expects the premillennial/postmillennial concept alone to support the weight of his vast construct. There is no discussion of liberal and conservative ideology, for instance, and how they have changed over time in the U.S. and the U.K., a glaring oversight. Also missing is any examination of the idea of sociocultural evolution, a central concept in anthropology (it should be a central concept in sociology as well), which is not at all the same as biological evolution. Ruse could make a much more cogent argument if he disentangled the two, but it would be a more complex argument.I agree with Ruse's practical conclusions, that defenders of science should avoid bashing religion, as Richard Dawkins is prone to do, and that defenders of science should rise above their differences to work together more effectively in keeping ID and other religious notions out of biology classes. And fortunately the unconvincing historic argument of THE EVOLUTION-CREATION STRUGGLE is not necessary to either of those worthy aims."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"The histories of evolutionary theory by Darwinists are forever biased, because noone really wants to do without the agendas that require confusing the issue. And the scientific/academic community is simply incapable of critiquing the limits of Darwinism, so the job has to be done by someone else. It's overdue. Ruse's effort here produces a strikingly one-sided perspective. The illusion that Darwin alone got it right with his theory of natural selection is the source of one form of the blindness. It reminds one of the tale of the blind men and the elephant. Many in the early nineteenth century had a part of it, but noone, certainly not the Darwinists, can see the whole. Ruse, author of some several histories of evolution (cf. The Darwinian Revolution) here produces an unexpectedly propagandistic account of the history of evolution, with all the spotlight on the great scientific labors of Darwin, everyone else is somehow an 'evolutionist', even T. H. Huxley.The current 'fundamentalism' on natural selection distorts the whole history of the subject. Looking at the history plainly shows a scattershot effect, in which different perspectives each have an insight the others lack. Hegel would be ridiculed now, but he saw that without an account of the evolution of consciousness you have nothing, and should even bother to claim a theory at all.Ruse's attempted distinction of the science of evolution and 'evolutionism' is misleading, since it assumes that Darwin's theory solves the paradox of evolutionary progress. To dismiss everything before Darwin as pseudo-science, and set up Huxley as the St. Paul to Darwin is to narrow the field of vision. Withoug Huxley's reserve of skepticism about natural selection Darwin's work might have fared badly. Darwin's clever but finally inadequate exposition of his own theory subtracts greatly from the misleading claims for his scientific heroism. The Transcendentalists hardly deserve to be been so totally dismissed. The rubric includes the teleomechanists, springing from Kant, who saw the metaphysical dilemma in evolutionary theories, something beyond the capacities of a dunce like Darwin with his 'science'. They sensed the limits of scientific methodology with its reductionist prejudice, and inability, clearly analyzed in Kant, to deal correctly with teleology. The result is clear from the record where all parties swing back and forth between different erroneous attempts at the idea of evolutionary progress. The embryologists before Darwin clearly foresaw something now resurfacing in genetic research, and the current evo-devo makes one hope everyone might press the reset button and start over. Many of the early critics had a problem with Darwin because his theory was all too obviously wrong, and seemed almost silly. We have been so reconditioned by bad histories of Darwinism we have lost common sense. As the dialectic now tries to swing to other extreme with the Intelligent Design faction, one can only throw up one's hands.Still, Ruse is quite right that the 'religion' of secular evolution distorts public understanding of scientific research. That springs from Darwin's own 'evolutionism', and can't be fobbed off on the others, like Spencer. Two kinds of 'fundamentalists', religious and Darwinian, confront each other. The style of discourse all too obvious among many Darwin fanatics resembles a form of intolerance. The educational system takes on the look of a Jesuitical school of indoctrination. Sociobiology plies its obvious ideology, and in the main disguised Social Darwinism reigns as before. Ruse somewhat outrageously tries to let Darwin off the hook on Social Darwinism. Blaming it all on Spencer doesn't cut the ice anymore. Any theory of natural selection will automatically provoke a kind of Social Darwinist confusion. Time to face facts.The dismissal of the earlier generation before Darwin is unacceptable anymore. The confusions over the idea of progress, as in figures such as Erasmus Darwin, are notably open to critique, but surely Darwin is as confused as the rest. A figure such as Lamarck, if we can bypass his confused theory of adaptation, and the silliness over giraffes' necks, clearly saw the way in which two levels are at work, and must enter any theory. Darwin collapsed these two levels into a monistic selectionism, to the unending confusion of the whole subject. The point is clear in figures such as Gould who try to reinvent the second level, but can't let go of selectionism.The current morass of evolutionary theories is a phenomenon clearly, although indirectly, indicated by a figure such as Kant who practically prophesies the intractable Darwin debate. The dilemma of scientific, ethical, aesthetic, and teleological issues has to be recast altogether into something more than just scientific reductionism. Until that day the Darwin debate will tick over without end, and leave one with the impression that a technological society that can put a man on the moon can't produce a true theory of evolution. Thus the term 'evolution-creation' struggle is misleading. The problem is Darwin's theory. The question of creationism is nonsense at the fringe, but threatening to hijack the debate from the domain of scientists and philosophers where it belongs."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"In a very readable historical account of \\"The Evolution-Creation Struggle\\" the author takes the side of evolution in its major aspects, relying on an undirected process, which depends on \\"natural\\" causes. My main concern, as I related in other reviews here, is just the question of such undirectedness, absence of aim, the principal issue of the \\"struggle\\" in the title. For that reason I will concentrate on the author's \\"Conclusion\\", where this idea appears to be most discussed.He speaks of the use of methaphor (e.g. p.277), mentioning \\"final cause\\" (designating goal-directed, purposeful, action) as a metaphor in \\"thinking of the heart pump, for example, ...as if...designed\\", the point being made that though the heart pump is functional, it evolved as a result of aimless natural forces.My intent is to repeat here my concerned observations in the other reviews, observations that belong to more comprehensive ones in my book, dealing with knowledge in various fields. As I indicated, the approach to the question of design, of direction toward a goal, has on both sides of the dispute been \\"barking up the wrong tree\\". Because of centuries-old comparisons of organs like the heart to man-made devices, overlooked was a decisive distinction between the living and the lifeless. The former is not only functionally built, but also functionally active. That is to say, while it can be questioned whether a structure's unseen formation was aimed at, the same cannot be questioned regarding the organism's live activities. They are fully known to be aimed at self-preservation.What is more, each individual organism is formed as part of that aim, which is to say that organisms do not come about by accident, in contradiction of the randomness claimed respecting, beside the formation of live beings, all of biology, alongside the rest of nature."},{"Title":"The Evolution-Creation Struggle","review":"Michael Ruse is one of those naive darwinists who attempt to promote a worldview in which Christianity can be reconciled with science, if and only if science has the last word. Actually he has a naturalistic stake in this evolution-creation struggle.He wants to keep science pure from any \\"religious miracles\\" but doesn't bother to maintain the ultimate \\"naturalistic miracle\\": the universe, with its astonishing macro and micro complexity, has no ultimate cause!!! Galaxies, stars, \\"quasars\\", \\"blasars\\", planets, the solar system, aminoacids, proteins, molecular machines, DNA-RNA, cells, thousands of different perfectly functional organisms, all evolved out of nothing, by purely random processes, against all mathematical and probabilitistic odds!! That's remarkable, for someone who says he doesn't believe in miracles. For Michael Ruse - who has been around and seen enough - this naturalistic miracle can stay, even against all evidence, because it doesn't bring God in to the picture. Apparently, he doesn't dare to question evidence of design in nature, but it is clear he doesn't want to face off with the Designer.According to this view, Christian faith can only hold on as long as it stands the test of modern science. For Michael Ruse, evolutionism is an unquestioned paradigm, that should be used to evaluate all religious doctrines. For Michael Ruse, science and religion remain separated, and evolutionists, such as Richard Dawkins, should not cross the border line that keeps them separated. Religion and biblical creationism are, a priori, considered as epistemologically inferior, according to the rules of the game establioshed by naturalists, because they are not based on the observations and rational theorizations of men.As plausible as this may seem to those who have been mercilessly indoctrinated by modern rationalism, this view is in reality totally flawed.The point is that Biblical Creationism is perfectly scientific, because is based in the observations and rational activities of a perfectly moral and rational God, the Creator. The fact that we consider ourselves rational and expect rationality from this world comes from this foundational understanding. We cannot base our expectations of order, intelligibility, mathematical beauty of relativity equations, and golden proportions on random and purely accidental processes and assumptions.It is true that, from the point of view of modern human science, it seems totally absurd to start a scientific inquiry by relying on a Sacred Book. I know what naturalism is all about and do understand these feelings. After all, the argument goes, science should rely only on observation, hipothesis building, experimental testing, conclusion formulating, theory building and paradigm constructing. So why rely a priori on a Sacred text?My answer to this would be:A) Every observation is based on a priori assumptions. These may be either a belief in a Creator or a belief that nature is all there is. Evolutionists cannot do without a priori assumptions.B) The origin of the Universe is not observable. No one was there to watch. If there is a God, then He is the only reliable witness to the process of Creation. You can only start with some form of Revelation or with your own speculations and extrapolations. In this light, the Bible is a good starting point, because of its inherent plausibility from a scientific, historical, anthropological moral and spiritual perspectives, all of which have been tested in many different contexts and times.C) Observations are incomplete. Many astronomers are now saying that we may never understand the origins, since the speed of light and microwave background radiation may have been influenced by many astronomical events that we may never be able to observe and understand. Others, think they can put forward a theory of everything by saying that out Universe is one in millions of previous or parallel universes, as if it wasn't hard enough just to explain our Universe.D) The same observations are able to generate hundreds of different theories. So we may ask: how will we ever now if we have come up with the right explanation? If we don't know the truth in advance, if our observations are conditioned by a priori assumptions, limited and able to generate multiple theories and models, how will we be able to recognize the true explanation when we see it?For these reasons, it seems to me that it makes complete sense to start with the Bible, with its model of special creation a few thousand years ago, fall and curse, global flood, Babel, dispersion and rapid speciation. I know this may be a humbling experience to modern proud rationalism and naturalism. But then, so what? True wisdom and knowledge about the origins of a created world starts inevitably with the revelation of the Creator. It is absolutely reserved for the Creator to establish the epistemological rules of the origins game. If we don't accept these rules, we lose.Although this epistemological humbling experience may prima facie sound utterly unscientific and repugnant to the modern mind, it makes perfect sense because it tells what we should look for and expect to find, as any other scientific model would. In this sense, the Bible is scientific because it helps us to make many predictions. Remember that even Stephen Jay Gould had to admit that biblical creationism does indeed make predictions.For instance, the Bible predicts states of affairs such as:1) all species of the flora and fauna belong to separate genera, so we should not expect to find intermediate links in the fossil record, in molecular biology and in the living world.2) since all species were created by the same Creator, they are expected to show relevant genetic, structural and functional similarities and be dependent on each other.3) since Man was created in the image of God, we should expect the fine-tuning of the Universe for life, with many \\"antropic coincidences\\".4) since all creatures were created by an Omnipotent and Omniscient God, we should expect overwhelming signs of complex specified information and intelligent design in the macro and in the micro universe.5) since all species were created by a Omniscient and Omnipotent God, we should expect systems and mechanisms of adaptation to the environment and minor variations within species.6) since God is the creator of life, the probability of a single cell emerging by chance should be virtually zero, and we should not expect life to be generated by non-life by random processes.7)since God made the species (a term that does not correspond to the biological concept of species) with special designs, we should dismiss the existence of vestigial organs and junk-DNA.8) since God has cursed His creation because of Man's sin, we should expect that along with evidence of design the universe reveals evidence of that curse (v.g. death; carnivory; harmful mutations; accumulation of genetic diseases; death of the unfit; attack and defence systems; poisons; pathogenics).9) since there was a global flood several thousand years ago, we should expect to find lots of liquid water in the Planet along with many signs of fossilization and cathastrophism in geology. We should also expect to find many more living fossils than intermediate fossils.10) since there was a global flood, we should expect some of its most probable results, including the petrified forests, canions, sediments, fossils, the Ice Age and the continental drift. We also should expect earthquakes, storms, and tsunamis.11) since the Earth is young, we should expect that its magnetic field is also still young.12) since the Sun is young we should expect its nucleus to be young.13) since the Universe is young we should expect to find mature galaxies even where scientists say they should not exist.14) since Man didn't evolve, men will always be men (v.g. Neandertals) and apes will always be apes (v.g. Australopithecus).15)since Dinosaurs were living until several millenia ago, we should expect to find many accounts of the interaction between men and \\"dragons\\", and should expect to find soft tissue, ligaments, cells and hemoglobin inside some of their petrified bones.16) If a God of Love and Justice has created Man in His image, and if Man has sinned and ruined His creation, than we should be able to look into History and find a special revelation or a dramatic event in which God provides some kind solution to man's problem. Maybe Christmas and Easter can provide some indication.The scandal for evolutionists, is that all these and other biblical predictions, although not scientific according to modern scientific standards, have been shown to be true.The result is that the scientific community finds itself many times in a state of shock and awe, or of surprise and wonder, when its own predictions are denied time and time again and when creationists predictions are found to be in full accord with observable evidence. The problem, then, lies in the modern scientific paradigm, as well as in the modern dichotomy of science and religion.I know that this may be hard to admit for many evolutionists, such as Michael Ruse, that have been indoctrinated by modern rationalists and simply cannot do better than that. Their naturalistic, uniformitarian and evolutionary \\"memes\\", with all their appearance of intellectual sophistication, simply don't allow them to move beyond that.The current scientific paradigm may be very appropriate when dealing with observable facts (and there is no conflict between creationists and evolutionists when it comes to observed facts), but it fails miserably when it comes to engaging in origins science. Here we simply cannot do without the Creator and His revelation. Since He is the Alpha and Omega, only He can give meaning to our present existence and provide a reliable account of what happened in the past and of what will happen in the future.That's why I find Michael Ruse's position incredibly puerile and naive. If he wants to keep the modern scientific method at the expense of truth, then let him have it. It is his problem. I would prefer to be called a child of God, than a child of modernity. By the way, God is not pre-modern or post-modern either.If evolutionists stick to their failed paradigm, against all empirical reasons, they will find themselves, time and again, in a state of shock and awe, surprise and wonder, because evolution simply didn't happen and will never fit the observable data. Evolutionists try to assure us that everything is random and purposeless, and than ask us to take seriously their own thoughts.Michael Ruse should study American Constitutional Law and realize that the original meaning of separation of Church and State, in First Amendment to the federal Constitution of 1787, has nothing to do with preventing a scientific recognition of the Creator, based on sound facts and arguments.In the American Declaration of Independence of 1776, even fundamental rights are the product of intelligent design, since their fundamental character rests on their being endowed by the Creator. Michael Ruse's \\"constitutional Law\\" arguments could have worked in Jacobin France or communist Soviet Union or Albania, but they should not be allowed to work in America, nor in any decent country.Separation of Church and State wants to prevent authoritarian enforcement of religion, \\"science\\" or ideology, but not to prevent the free and open discussion thereof. Michael Ruse naturalistic stakes in this debate distort his vision of religion, science, philosophy and even constitutional law."},{"Title":"Virtual Memories (The Serena Wilcox Mysteries)","review":"The concept on which the story is based is far fetched.

Tohru meets another Sohma, a young boy named Hiro (he turns into a ram when he's hugged by a member of the opposite sex). Hiro is jealous of all the time Kisa is spending with Tohru, because Hiro has a crush on Kisa. Can Tohru put up with all the grief Hiro gives her? Also in this volume, we learn how Tohru and Uo became friends through flashbacks.This volume is definitely focusing on character development. The introduction of Hiro brings about some character development for Kisa, and the flashbacks of how Uo and Tohru became friends gives the reader more insight into Uo's character and why she is the way she is. While there really isn't much in this volume to truly progress the story, you sometimes just need a breather from the action and get to know a little more about the characters in the story.If you have read and enjoyed the previous six volumes of the Fruits Basket manga, I would recommend reading this volume.I wrote this review after checking out this manga volume through the King County Library System."},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 7","review":"fruits basket is a cool manga. aspects of it are sad.....the family issues and limitations they create. but it's got awesome sarcasm and charcaters that you will fall in love with. love it!"},{"Title":"Fruits Basket, Vol. 7","review":"Hi!

Through an original approach Gran succeeds in proposing the use of four distinctive paradigms of modern state formation, each with unique characteristics, but more importantly sharing features that show up in various states. By breaking with the Eurocentric model, and the elite state centered view of history, Gran proposes that development in Russia, the &quot;Russian Road&quot; of development, shares characteristics of a weak middle class and a tendency to alternating between liberal phases and autocratic rule in its hegemony of rule. The Russian Road of state formation and hegemony shares characteristics with similar modern state formations in Iraq, Turkey and other states.Italy, on the other hand, provides an example of &quot;Italian Road&quot; formations with its inherent contradictions of regional conflict, a weakly integrated and 'underdeveloped' rural Southern population, which the North can only reach out to by appealing to the traditional Southern intellectuals, clergy and landowning interests. Italy shares characteristics with modern state formation in India and Mexico which experience a similar problem of regional struggle and contradictions. Gran proposes two other major paradigms of modern state formation: the tribal ethnic state, of which he analyzes Zaire and Albania as notable examples, and the bourgeois democratic state, of which his analysis of the United States and Britain are especially insightful for his treatment of the notion of race as caste in these states. Gran expands on the sociology and interpretive framework provided by Antonio Gramsci and draws on comparative analyses of Stuart Hall for Britain, or Partha Chaterjee for India, Eugene Genovese for the problem of the South in U.S. History. Gran's originality is as thought provoking as his methodology which offers challenging essays for each region and paradigm, by analyzing its historiography and the organization of culture as a component of hegemony. This book offers some examples of struggles of subaltern groups and non elites in the making of their own histoyr.Yet, more work could be done on aspects of counterhegemonic struggle by subaltern groups, and as Gran alludes, the analysis of those states which combine features of several types of his paradigms. As Gran suggests, for example, Egypt offers features of the Italian Road in its internal regional conflicts and the pitted struggles of traditional intellectuals with the modern state, but also displays features of the Russian Road in some state policies.Spain for example offers contradictions seen in the Italian Road, the clash of traditional intellectuals, and the conservative Catholics, and Catholic Reform, Opus Dei, in contrast with the the needs of the modern organic intellectuals and the problems of regional absorption and struggles. In Spain, the features of regional autonomy offers parallels with the Russian Road problematic of breakaway ethnic struggles, and language and education policy, the Basques and the Catalans, for example. Other combined models may be further analyzed in Japan or Latin American states for example. This is a work that provokes thought. It offers a watershed of ideas that is topical and disturbingly shakes our consciousness of regions that have evaded analysis, as in Albania and Zaire. His essays on the limits of Russian and other states centered historiography is especially insightful. Beyond Eurocentrism may be used as a manual of how to begin the analysis of our times and the struggles of ordinary people in different regions and states."},{"Title":"Beyond Eurocentrism: A New View of Modern World History","review":"Few works have successfully attempted to compare and explain world history by showing how states form and use intellectuals and notions of caste to maintain rule and hegemony. Through an original approach Gran succeeds in proposing the use of four distinctive paradigms of modern state formation, each with unique characteristics, but more importantly sharing features that show up in various states. By breaking with the Eurocentric model, and the elite state centered view of history, Gran proposes that development in Russia, the &quot;Russian Road&quot; of development, shares characteristics of a weak middle class and a tendency to alternating between liberal phases and autocratic rule in its hegemony of rule. The Russian Road of state formation and hegemony shares characteristics with similar modern state formations in Iraq, Turkey and other states.Italy, on the other hand, provides an example of &quot;Italian Road&quot; formations with its inherent contradictions of regional conflict, a weakly integrated and 'underdeveloped' rural Southern population, which the North can only reach out to by appealing to the traditional Southern intellectuals, clergy and landowning interests. Italy shares characteristics with modern state formation in India and Mexico which experience a similar problem of regional struggle and contradictions. Gran proposes two other major paradigms of modern state formation: the tribal ethnic state, of which he analyzes Zaire and Albania as notable examples, and the bourgeois democratic state, of which his analysis of the United States and Britain are especially insightful for his treatment of the notion of race as caste in these states. Gran expands on the sociology and interpretive framework provided by Antonio Gramsci and draws on comparative analyses of Stuart Hall for Britain, or Partha Chaterjee for India, Eugene Genovese for the problem of the South in U.S. History. Gran's originality is as thought provoking as his methodology which offers challenging essays for each region and paradigm, by analyzing its historiography and the organization of culture as a component of hegemony. This book offers some examples of struggles of subaltern groups and non elites in the making of their own history.Yet, more work could be done on aspects of counterhegemonic struggle by subaltern groups, and as Gran alludes, the analysis of those states which combine features of several types of his paradigms.

But these technical flaws do not detract from the merits of this work as an interpretive framework for contemporary history.

Highly reccommended"},{"Title":"Blood in the Argonne: The \\"Lost Battalion\\" of World War I (Campaigns and Commanders)","review":"On 2 OCT 1918, Major Charles Whittlesey led his unit, part of the 77th Division in a successful attack on German defenses in the Argonne Forest of northeastern France. His attack was successful, but the attacks of the rest of the division could not keep pace. Wittlesey's unit got so far ahead that the German forces closed in behind it, surrounding them.Whittlesey's unit was not a battalion, nor was it ever lost, but the 700 men in his command suffered more than half their number in casualties. When the newspapers used called term the 'Lost Battalion,' it became forever associated with them. This is their story.While the true story of the Lost Battalion has been hard to determine, these authors have been able to find official records, written diaries and memoirs, and interviewed the descendents of both the 77th and the Lost Battalion. This book corrects a number of mistakes and inconsistencies in Johnson and Pratt's 1938 book 'The Lost Battalion.'This is likely to remain the definitive book on the history of this minor but infamous incident in the Great War. It is lively reading and helps you to get a feeling of what these soldiers went through."},{"Title":"Blood in the Argonne: The \\"Lost Battalion\\" of World War I (Campaigns and Commanders)","review":"I first became interested in the \\"Lost Battalion\\" when I learned there was a local connection. As part of my volunteer work for my local county historical society, I have been privileged to listen to taped interviews with two of the men who surivied being pinned down for 5 days in the Argonne Forest. Their names were Peter P. Koshiol (pg. 152) and Albert A. Euteneuer (pg. 306). Although they were both long dead, their words remained just as fresh as the day they were spoken. But one thing was clear. Although their experiences have gone down in history as a great example of American courage under fire, the blood and fire of those five days in the Argonne Forest scarred them both for the rest of their lives. This is a point that Alan Gaff hammers home again and again in the book he has written about what they went through. His book follows the \\"Liberty Boys\\" from the moment they were all drafted, their training and their shipment \\"overseas,\\" and their final experiences in coming up against the Kaiser's military machine. Mr. Gaff pulls no punches in describing the brutal reality of hand to hand combat during the First World War. AS the Generals and Colonels whiled away their time in fortified bunkers behind the lines, thousands of \\"grunts\\" were killed fighting for their country. On October 2, 1918 a ragtag crew of American soldiers were pinned down and surrounded behind enemy lines without food or water, and what comes out of this book is not only the story of the Officers, who most accounts have focused on, but also the strory of the common soldiers who watched their best friends eviscerated before their eyes. This is combat reporting at it's best. It is also the most accurate report we are likely to get. This book, which I recommend highly, is certain to remain the definative account of World War I's heroic Lost Battalion. For this Mr. Gaff deserves a round of applause."},{"Title":"Blood in the Argonne: The \\"Lost Battalion\\" of World War I (Campaigns and Commanders)","review":"Readers who enjoy stories of military units and army encounters will appreciate Alan D.

Central to its theme are Mitch Garnet, the Carnival's security chief, Pearl Mason, a singer with a mutant body, and Hector Tomas, a Theta Researcher who has found out the truth behind the multiple dimensions.I am a fan of strange worlds, mutated bodies, oddly imaginative aliens, and a good carnival. 'Everybody Scream' delivers on each of these twisted needs of mine, along with a lot of action on the last day of the carnival's season, plus a sizzling finale that keeps you reading right up to the last page.Worlds collide across dimensions, drugs are bought and sold, corruption seethes underfoot, and people's daily lives float by as you immerse yourself in Thomas's Punktown world. Thomas does use his strange platform to put out some messages on political issues such as Animal Testing and Animal Rights, but the lessons are not long or tyrannical, more thought-provoking, so if you hold a different view just skip the paragraph and enjoy the book.Thomas is a talented writer that is definitely worth the attention, so don't forget to pick up the anthologies Punktown and Punktown Third Eye, along with the upcoming Punktown Shades Of Gray. Strange worlds and strange beings, it doesn't get any better than this.Take an extra minute to note the fantastic artwork on the cover by David A. Magitis, a very talented artist in my opinion. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Everybody Scream!","review":"Everybody Scream is about Punktown's otherworldly carnival, a word rooted in the Latin cognate \\"carn-\\" or \\"flesh.\\" And if there is an overarching theme throughout Everybody Scream, it's that the carnival itself is one giant organism with its various constituents all appendages of its body.Sophi Kahn is the head. The owner of the carnival and the thinker of the group, she always tries to maintain a cool detachment from the inevitable murders that happen at the carnival. Yet when one of her indiscretions come back to haunt her, her emotions take over...Del Kahn, former famous singer and de facto leader of the carnival, is its heart. He thrives on emotion in the moment, preying on young girls who idolize his memory as a star. But if his unfaithfulness is driven by the gaping void in his soul, his redemption is galvanized by Sophi's jeopardy. And when roused to anger, the fist is raised...That fist is Mitch Garnet. A forcer with a checkered past, he itches to retaliate with violence against those he deems worthy of scorn. When the gloves are off, little can hold Mitch back, not even Del. The only person who can tame Garnet is Pearl Mason...If Garnet is the masculine portion of this carnival's corpus, Pearl Mason is its feminine voice. A former prostitute-turned-singer, she has a conjoined twin that she conceals beneath maternity clothes. She is both mother and maiden, torn between two roles. Pearl is also a canary in the coalmine, the first to react to a wrongness about the carnival that's the surest sign something is rotten in Punktown......as evidenced by the parasites. There are two kinds, equally loathsome: the ghoul-like snipes (yes, snipes) and the roach-like coleopteroids known as bedbugs. Both feed off the carnival's denizens in different ways, but only one group has an agenda. And the only person who perceives that agenda is......is Hector Tomas, the eyes of the carnival. Hector is a Theta researcher who has seen awful things in other dimensions that are enough to drive him to use drugs - so he can sleep, so he can forget, so he can function. A broken man, Hector turns to the only people who can satisfy his needs.And that is the odious Johnny Leng, enforcer for Roland LaKarnafeaux's drug-dealing gang of bikers. Leng is the carnival's embodiment of lust, and he rapes and murders his way through the carnival with abandon. It will take a strong heart and a clenched fist to bring him down.Everyone else in the novel is a victim or an accessory to this twisty tale of a carnival's last night. As always, Thomas' superb writing is in full effect here, detailing a myriad of alien races and cultures effortlessly. Everybody Scream is a fascinating series of character studies and a chaotic whirl of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Just like a carnival."},{"Title":"Everybody Scream!","review":"Suffers from not being Deadstock, Monstrocity, or Letters from Hades.Kind of like reading anything by China Mieville after Perdido Street Station, nothing ever quite measures up.Anyway, this is a Punktown novel. And Punktown novels are excellent for a anyone bored with conventional, sci-fi, horror, fantasy, and a few other things. It's a day at the carnival. There is no plot line that is terribly important to all of the characters; they meet and bounce off each other, everyone trying to make the most out of what they have. Or, in some cases, just trying to get laid.Some thought-provoking stuff in here, along with interesting, likeable characters. And a few douche bags.

I bought this book hoping to read a new concept in improvisation, one that did not rely on scales. But that is not what this book is. In short, what this book is is less than 30 pages containing 60 of his licks. 20 Major, 20 Minor, and 20 Dominant.The main premise of this book is to keep a diary of your own riffs/licks and use those when practicing and improvising. Eventually you'll build up enough licks that sound like you and you'll develop your own vocabulary over time.I guess that this is a sound enough premise since it is a well kept secret that very little of what we call \\"improvisation\\" is really that. Even the great jazz players of all-time play stuff they already know MOST of the time and only now and then venture out into new waters. (Just listen to multiple takes of a jazz recording by the same artist and you'll hear how similar the solos in the multiple takes are). They work out much of their solo material in their practice time.But where do these riffs/licks come from? They are based on scales. Verheyen himself concedes that when describing his licks - they are based on Pentatonic scales, or Major scales, Or Dorian, Or Lydian, etc... There is no way around it folks. If you want to be a well rounded musician and soloist, you need to know your scales. Check out what Verheyen himself says early on in the book. \\"Obviously I know my major, minor, and dominant scales as well as the modes, diminished, and altered scales... the book's title by no means endorses bypassing the harmonic knowledge gained from them.\\" There you have it folks. If you want to play like Verheyen then you better spend years studying the scales and modes just like he did.Really what he is trying to get at in the book is to learn how to play scales in your solos without it sounding like you are running a scale or a scale exercise. He is trying to create melodic ideas out of the scales. This is commendable and I do endorse this concept. Unfortunately, he doesn't give you any idea how to do this. He just gives you some of his licks. And worse than that is that he suggests that you can succesfully improv without scales.So, I guess that my biggest beefs with this book are the misleading title and his lack of explanation as to how to create melodic content out of scale sequences and intervals. But perhaps this can't be taught so easily in a book? Maybe the ear is the final judge and imitation of masters is the best way to learn?"},{"Title":"Mel Bay's Improvising without Scales: (includes CD) The Intervallic Guitar System of Carl Verheyen","review":"This book is excellent for breaking out of scales and vertical boxes. Carl will get you playing all over the neck with wide intervals, string skipping and fast horizontally moving lines. After 27 years of playing, I still get inspired by new approaches!The book is pretty much a huge list of examples with tab for lines over minor 7th, major and dominant chords. Some absolutely mind blowing lines in this book!My current interest is in playing over chord changes so the only thing I would have added is some lines over various chord changes in order to show how to connect the chords/lines."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's Improvising without Scales: (includes CD) The Intervallic Guitar System of Carl Verheyen","review":"Book is well written, clear and relatively concise.

It would have been helpful to have been given some insight into how he used intervals melodically to create different moods or colors, but that's why we need to go through them, since that is subjective anyway.

Little-known shipwreck with almost unbelievable events."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"cwldm \\"cwldm\\" who wrote the review \`Less than the original' (and who only gave this book 2 stars) would have you believe that the use of the word 'God' in this book is an oversight on the part of the author, due to the fact that the religion of the Colonials is polytheistic in nature and the word used should be 'gods'.However, if the reviewer were a true fan of the show, he/she would realise that the opposing religious views of the Cylons and Colonials was not actually officially introduced until Season One. If you watch the Miniseries, you will see that the word 'God' is used several times (by Cylons and Colonials alike) and the word 'gods' does not appear at all.In fact, the only slight reference to polytheism in the Miniseries is to the 'Lords of Kobol', and Ron D. Moore himself has admitted that at that point, the Lords of Kobol were only going to be historical figures in Colonial history (like the saints in Catholicism) and not any sort of deities.There are other aspects of the Miniseries which were changed in actual series in order to make more sense (i.e. changing the Astral Queen from a freighter to a prison transport and changing the number of prisoners from 500 to 5,000), and is to be expected.In short, it is the job of the author to write a book that is true to the specific subject material, in this case, the Miniseries. In this, I believe that Jeffrey Carver has done his job, and done it well (hence the five stars).It is not however, the job of the author to attempt to fill in every plot-hole, contradiction and continuity error made by the show's creator's. And considering the fact that most books based on television series are never truly considered to be \`canon' by either the fans or the powers that be, any changes made by the author would be futile, as the 'official version' (the Miniseries) despite being contradicted later, will always be considered to be the \`correct version\`.The Miniseries is the starting point for every other story about the Galactica, and it makes sense therefore, that the first book Tor would release would be a novel of the Miniseries. Anyone who has not seen the Miniseries in a while should get this book before reading any other Galactica novels (released in the latter half of 2006), if only to serve as a reminder of the events that led to the situation in which the Galactica now finds itself."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"I know I'm not quite in the right generation, but I have read the old Battlestar Galactica book adaptations of the TV series (thank you, public library!) and have grown rather fond of them. I was a little perturbed about the new Battlestar (particularly how Starbuck is now a woman), but I am open to new ideas, so I bought this one with my birthday gift card.PLEASE NOTE: I have never seen the actual miniseries, so this is just a review on the book, not on how the novelization compares to the miniseries.Many years ago, the Twelve Colonies created the Cylons to make life easier. They even made Cylons to fight their wars for them. Eventually, the Cylons got wise enough to wonder why they were taking orders from humans and revolted. For many years, the two fought until the humans drove the Cylons away, not to be seen again.Or so the Twelve Colonies thought. Forty years have passed, and the Cylons are back, badder, slicker, and ready for human blood--and lots of it. They nearly wipe out civilization with the exception of the select few. Commander Adama of the last battlestar, Galactica, Captain Apollo Adama, Lieutenant Kara Thrace, Laura Roslin, the new President of the Twelve Colonies, and others must now battle their way across the galaxy searching for respite from the Cylons' attack.Good:Well, I must admit I was scared that they would wreck Battlestar Galactica. What with the onslaught of bad remakes, such as The Dukes of Hazzard, Bewitched, and Starsky & Hutch, I feared the worst.Fortunately, these fears were unfounded. Although several events have changed (namely, that several characters have gender changes, names such as \\"Starbuck\\" and \\"Boomer\\" are now pilot call-signs, and Zee is killed in an accident some time ago instead of during the battle), the changes for the most part are good. Obviously, the TV series of the 70's was dated. It is nice to see women in positions of power instead of the ubiquitous \\"companions\\" (Cassiopeia in old Battlestar or Inara of Firefly fame) or relations of the big boys.The events in the new Battlestar are most definitely edge-of-your-seat material. I mean, it was easy to whip through thirty or more pages of the fast paced action in one sitting. Seeing how people react to Armageddon, the tough choices they have to make, and how people band together is awesome but what is even more awesome is how the book handles these subjects. Well done, realistic, and, most importantly, interesting.Over the course of the novel, three characters have found a place in my heart: Commander Adama, President Roslin, and Colonel Tigh. Commander William Adama is a perfect leader but really not that awesome as a dad. His tough demeanor makes him appear to be unemotional, but we, as the audience, can see the inner turmoil he hides inside. President Laura Roslin in some ways is similar to Commander Adama but in other ways not much. She also is a good leader (given that she started out being the Secretary of Education) and hides her emotions deep inside. Unlike Adama, Laura is comforting, willing to divulger her condition to her aide, and more likely to kill herself saving another's life. Colonel Saul Tigh is completely different than the other two. Tigh drowns his sorrows in alcohol, starts fights so he can retaliate against another officer, and isn't afraid to make the tough choices about who lives and who dies.Bad:Besides the sexual situations (the beginning one with Gaius and Natasi was too much for me), there really isn't a whole lot to pick on with this book. There are so many characters that I wish the author had included a Dramatis Personae in the beginning. At one point, Adama refuses to leave until Starbuck and Lee return to the Galactica. Ordinarily, this would be no problem, but several times in the book, characters (including Adama) leave doomed survivors behind to favor the ones that could be saved. This seemed to me to be contradictory. Furthermore, the beginning was a little kiddy, a little slow, and a little boring.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:While the f-word is replaced with \\"frak\\" (may be too much for some people), other words such as da**, he**, and sh** do not have their \\"Twelve Colonies\\" equivalent.I was rather shocked at the copious sexual references in the book and at such an early stage. Within the first 50 pages, three separate situations are detailed. Some are merely \\"grope\\" fests, while others are definitely R-rated.Violence is typical fare. Lots of space battles, nuclear bombings, etc. Several people (most unknown or vaguely sketched) are killed.Overall:I am pleased to say that my worst fears were quickly dissipated with a reading of this book. Battlestar Galactica is not the way it was in the 70's and that's great. What \\"they\\" have done with Galactica is great: new, exciting, updated, yet still a tribute to its namesake. While I wish the sexual situations could have been toned down and a few characters nixed, I would greatly recommend this book to anyone.Brought to you by*C.S.

It opens like the TV series with the diplomat at the diplomatic out post waiting fruitlessly for his Cylon counterpart. Little does he know that his life is about to end when he meets a beautiful women who turns out to be a Cylon. This book is the start of the series on how human life might be in about 200-300 years ahead of us but follows what we would call pagan worship. It is as if the ancient Greeks survived into our century. They believe in a planet that was the home of their species and from which sprung their interstellar civilization. The names of their planets appear to be from the Zodiac. They reached a level of civilization where robots took the place, jobs and tasks of people. As the book goes on to say, the robots called Cylons, rebelled and went to war with their human masters. They also believed in one god as opposed to the humans pantheon of gods. This was one reason for the war. Sound familiar? The books explore the relationships between humans and also between the Cylons as well as humans and Cylons, some of who look just like humans with human frailties. This could easily be book one in a series that could span many books as long as they are based on the TV series. In this first book of the hundreds of millions who are killed only about 50,000 humans escape and are lead by the Battlestar Galactica, a very old military starship that acts as a shepherd to take the survivors on a quest to find a mythical planet called Earth that is mentioned in their religious text. The writers use real not whimsical science. The guns shoot bullets. The fighter ships called, Vipers, shoot missiles and machine guns. They explore the stress of using nuclear weapons. They have faster than light drive but are in danger of running out of fuel. They run out of munitions and have to find supplies. There are traitors in their midst also and they have to deal with that. The action takes place someplace far away and the time is not know.All of the human foibles are explored.

Making its first appearance in 1978 as a television series, it became the drama to which other sci-fi episodes were compared. Today, it has reappeared on the SCI FI channel after a hiatus of over 20 years. Written by Ronald Moore, (think Star Trek), it has won a new generation of followers.Now, audiobook aficionados can enjoy Battlestar as narrated by the clear, powerfully appealing voice of Jonathan Davis. He's a mimic among the best, and has developed character voices which bring stunning impact to his reading.This story is based on Jeffrey Carver's novelization of the miniseries which, as he notes, was both a pleasure and a challenge for him. \\"Turning a story on screen into a novel is not a simple matter of transcription.....,\\" he said. \\"When you're writing the novel, you have to flesh out things that go by quickly onscreen.\\"Thus it fell to him to sometimes write original material to bridge gaps or explain quick scene changes that are easily handled on film but need to be described with the written word. This must be done while staying true to the original intention.All of this is by way of saying that with this audio book we now have one more way to enjoy Battlestar Galactica. It's a must for seasoned sci-fi fans, while others will be thrilled when they are introduced to it for the first time.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"This \\"book\\" is bascially a rewrite of the screenplay for the miniseries with little to nothing contributed by the \\"author\\".

As a rule, I find that most abridged readings are stale and uninteresting. However, I really dig BSG so I thought I'd give this one a shot. I didn't care for it very much. It told the story... it got the details right. However, it seemed to me that Jonathan Davis was just going through the motions and wasn't putting any emotion behind the words. This performance was significantly bit less than stellar. I didn't hate it... but it's priced low for a reason."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"When I read this book, I thought I would gain insight into the minds and hearts of the characters that could not be expressed on film... this book did not give that. It's more a printed version of the Battlestar Galactica mini-series/pilot and nothing more.Another thing that disappointed me was that I personally enjoy the differing viewpoints of religion in the show and in this book it is so inconsistent that it's almost jarring when I find it. When most of the Colonials say \\"Gods\\" it's spelled as \\"God's\\". I have to wonder if Jeffrey Carver actually saw the show to know that the Colonials' religion was polytheistic while the Cylons' were monotheistic.The 2 stars I gave were pretty much for its association with Battlestar Galactica."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"Man made the cylons and now they are coming for their revenge.

The main question that is asked and often is just what is \\"human\\" and being human. While the questions aren't answered in this book it goes a long way to explaining the beginnings of the TV series. It asks, could a machine be human?

With themes that ranged from apocalypse, survival, war and 'the enemy within' it was challenging and cerebral science fiction rather than the lightweight campy fare one is used to.I was intrigued by this novelisation and wondered if respected sci-fi author Jeffrey A.Carver would manage to capture the atmospheric, claustrophobic and most importantly thrilling nature of the series. It must have been a daunting challenge.This novel concerns the early part of the series which of course found the Twelve Colonies of Man at peace for forty years, united following a desperate war with the man-made Cylons. The Cylons were (to those unfamiliar with the series) mechanical beings whose function was to perform the manual labour that the humans were loath to do themselves.The Cylons eventually rebelled and a terrible war ensued followed by the peace found at the start of the novel. During this time the humans assumed that the Cylons were gone forever following a truce, yet the old enemies have in the ensuing years developed new models that chillingly look and act like humans. The vengeful Cylons return to the Twelve Colonies with one sole purpose: the complete destruction and extinction of the entire human race.After a massive attack only one warship survives: Battlestar Galactica, the oldest in the fleet, which was ironically being decommissioned and turned into a museum. Commander William Adama who was due to retire himself is now tasked with leading the remnants of the human race leading a ragtag group of military personnel and civilians to safety.The novel, like the series is about survival and that old favourite: paranoia, because when Cylons look human, who can you trust?I have to say that apart from a few minor errors Carver has managed to produce the goods here. He has captured the desperation of the fleeing human survivors as well as the coldness of the Cylons. The characters of Adama, Tigh, Starbuck, Apollo, Roslin et al are all captured with aplomb.Carver has captured the essence of the show and infused proceedings with the requisite tension and horror as well as throwing in plenty of breakneck action. The only other gripe is that this is essentially a rehash of the opening episodes of the series. I have no problem with that at all, but if you are already familiar with all things 'Battlestar' you know where things are heading.That said there is snappy and convincing dialogue and tension throughout. This is also more importantly thought-provoking fiction and Carver can take a bow for this brave stab at what could have been just another pale television tie-in rather than the sophisticated and entertaining work it actually is. Well done."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"Other reviewers noted small inconsistencies between this novelization and the miniseries it was based on: like using \\"Husher\\" for Adama's callsign instead of \\"Husker.\\" My thoughts: no big deal. The novel stayed true to form, and was a quick, enjoyable read. I don't care to put in spoilers, so I'll leave it at that.I'm also pretty impressed with Carver's willingness to post some of his novels for free. It shows a pretty modern attitude, willing to try out different methods of marketing and outreach. For the record, what goes around comes around - in recognition of Mr. Carver's willingness to provide free material, I ended up making a paypal donation."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"I got this book for my husband, who read it in record time (for him, that means about a week).He's not as wordy as I am, but had this to say about the book: \\"If you like the show, you'll like the book.

Usually I like original works better as you get to see some of the authors personality come through in the story. In this case though I think it works very well. Mr. Carver does a real good job of moving the story along while having to fill in the backgrounds necessary that you can take for granted on tv or a movie. After all when watching the show you can get an impression of what a character is thinking by looking at their expression or for that matter the \\"stage\\" for where a scene takes place is often times very important to the characters interaction. All these things have to be conveyed in print and Mr. Carver does this without bogging down the story. Definitely the the sign of a deft and well-practiced author. Makes, sense the guy does have over 30 years of writing experience. I think if your a fan of BSG, Jeffrey Carver or just like to sit down with a good book i'd put this on your list to read!"},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"This novelization, which is touted as a brand new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" novel is indeed a good companion to the miniseries from a few years back. Now that we are getting close to entering the third season of the series it is safe to say that this new version of the classic series is here to stay. The series being carried on by Richard Hatch is a different series and is already on it's tenth book, while this one is the first (of many so it seems) for the new series. As such I am hopeful that it will create and expanded universe in which some of the side characters or backgrounds of characters will be explored.While this novelization is good, it doesn't have any extras that may give readers extra insight into some of the characters. What we are able to garner from the miniseries is about what we can garner from the book as well. Although some minor details that are revealed over the course of the first two seasons. For example, I think Tyrol's past problems are only alluded to in the series, whereas here there is a brief throwaway mention. But for those who may be looking for more details on the characters, you're out of luck. There are no big revelations or 'cutscenes' although part of the conversation between Six and her mysterious contact on Caprica is given a bit of expansion. Still again, there are no details provided on who that mysterious contact is. We are once again left to wonder.Given that Mr. Carver likely had notes and the script to work off of, he's done an excellent job of describing the scenes and situations that were so well done in the miniseries.

After a re-watch of the DVD sets, concluding with season 4.5, I picked this book up and found it to be a pleasant journey back to the beginning of the epic story. I wasn't expecting anything new, and nor is there for fans of the series. The book is written well enough to not distract from the storyline. I have one note for the author -- thesaurus! Yes, Cmdr William Adama has a \\"craggy\\" appearance; however, we don't need to read the same adjective so many times that it gets annoying."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"There is nothing in this novelization that is not in the miniseries on dvd.

For the next decade, humanity warred against their creation with the loser eradicated from the Twelve Colonies. No one won and a truce occurs; the Cylons leave the sector. After one scheduled meeting in year one of the \\"peace\\", the Cylons vanished never to be heard from again until now thirty-nine years later.In that interim, the Cylons have devoted their energy to their prime objective: destroy humanity! Their plan is clever as a new generation of Cylons has been created who look and act like humans not metal monstrosities whose design was totally based on form not aesthetics. Their new assault from within proves successful with only one human warship left after a massive attack. The Battlestar Galactica was about to be turned into a museum while Commander William Adama was retiring, but instead he must rally humanity against a stronger amoral adversary whose genocide objective seems certain to occur.Action-packed, this novelization of the latest Battlestar Galactica tale is a fun story for fans of the series. Cylons are portrayed too often as loquacious boasters explaining their genocide plans instead of just cold bloodedly killing machines; thus the tale loses some of its potency as it feels like a TV adaptation with four degrees of Star Wars. Still within that limiting context, Jeffrey A. Carver displays his writing talent as he makes the Twelve Colonies and the key humans and Cylons seem real. The Battlestar audience will want to enlist in the war of survival as Mr. Carver provides an entertaining rendition."},{"Title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"This is a novelization of the mini series that kicked off the successful Sci-Fi Channel series of the same name. If you are only familiar with the original series, you might be surprised at some of the changes.Humans created Cylons to help make life easier. Eventually they became sophisticated enough to try and destroy humanity. The war ended forty years ago with a truce. The Cylons left to find a world of their own. A special station was set up as a diplomatic post. Every year humans have sent a representative while the Cylons have sent none. Until now.The Cylons are back and they have new models that look just like humans. The Battlestar Galactica is being decommissioned and turned into a museum. Commander Adama is facing retirement. But the Commander's insistence on no computer networks allows the warship to survive the initial onslaught and take up the cause of human survival. On the flipside we have the Secretary of Education being elevated to President. Commander and President do not see eye to eye.This is only the beginning of the story so, like the mini series, there is no real ending but there is a cliffhanger. Jeffrey Carver does an excellent job of fleshing out the story while being completely true to the series. An excellent book and a joy to read.

He often takes just a single line - a fragment - of pre-Socratic Greek text, and tries to find in something that disloses the Ancient Greeks relationship to Being. What happens is the complete transposition of the fragmant to something like a short poem co-written at dawn by Paul Celan and Ted Hughes after a night reading Rilke. I doubt any one will read this, so I can be as pretentious as I like. As with all great poetry, this book, as with many others by the dark prince of philosophy, re-reveals much about our relationship to world. A world suffuse with Being, rather than objectified by it."},{"Title":"Early Greek thinking.","review":"Like Nietzsche's writings, this book reflects the contemporary disatisfaction with - and distrust of - metaphysics. There is a beauty about the philosophy of the Pre-Socratics, at once poetry - and philosophy. Heidegger's way of looking at them - infinitely better than the rather silly view found in early 20th c. readings - that they were 'failed physicists.' Heidegger was right to point out that ancient Greek terms like'phusis' carried quite different nuances - along with 'logos' etc. Heidegger's exploration of the lethe-aletheia theme - central to all these essays, is well worth consideration. After all, something crucial was lost - in the linguistic transformation of aletheia into (latin) 'vertitas' - and then 'truth' (in English) - the idea of philosophy as the 'correctness' of representations. With justice, Heidegger argues that 'aletheia' is unconcealment - in which being comes to presence, not simply an occasion for making judgements about the validity or otherwise - of representations. If only for that, Heidegger's work is worth reading.That said, whether these observations justify the fateful conclusions Heidegger arrived at about the course of Western philosophy as a whole, is another matter. He was influenced by Nietzsche, and Nietzsche's repudiation of Platonism as 'the palest and thinnest ideas of all.' Heidegger's work currently enjoys a wide following. Many would be loathe to see the Master criticized.Still, there are those who would argue that Heidegger over-stated his case.There is a problematic side to Western philosophy - analytical methods which never give us what Heidegger meant by 'lebensphilosophie' - a 'philosophy of life' or lived experience (erlebniss). But surely, that sort of thing was a legacy of the 18th. c. 'Age of Reason' - which didn't have the 'wings' of Greek thinking. Arguably, Plato was the first 'Heideggerian' - who, after all, was concerned with the task of understanding the intrinsic relationship between that which 'appears' - and Being. Heideg- ger's theory of a 'secession of logos' and the split (chorismos) in Plato's philosophy between the 'forms' - and sensible things, is rather cavalier as interpretations go,based on Aristrotle's view of the Platonic Academy - in the hands of Xenocrates. Heidegger has paid scant regard to the changes or development in Plato's philosophy between the 'Theatetus' and the 'Sophist' - in that respect, bad hermeneutics and philology. If Platonism (or Neo Platonism) has been such a bad thing, a lifeless abstraction - why was it such a great inspiration for Renaissance thinkers - like Ficino and Mirandela? Plato, Aristotle and Plotinus were required reading for the Florentine Academy.Nobody could argue that the great Renaissance thinkers were forgetful of the relationship betwen 'beings' and 'Being' - and the last, most dramatic outpourings of the 'classical' spirit came - not from the Pre-Socratics, but from the legacy of Plato. Nietzsche saw the Renaissance as Plato inside out, a simplistic and essentially mistaken view. Arguably, Heidegger adopted an equally simplistic and misguided outlook, by elevating Nietzsche's judgement to a kind of final, apocalyptic revelation and pronouncement on 2,500 years of Western civilisation.Not everyone agrees. By all means, enjoy this book, enjoy the Pre-Socratics. Heidegger was not wrong about the danger of philosophy divorced from life and experience.Whether Plato made that mistake - is a good question. That would be easier to decide - reading 'Early Greek Thinking' - alongside the 'Parmenides' of Plato, the 'Theatetus' - and 'Sophist.'"},{"Title":"Early Greek thinking.","review":"heideggers book about early greek writing is great and in depth.i will tell my freinds about it.those who like philosophy,will enjoy heideger."},{"Title":"So, You Want to be a Wrestling Promoter?","review":"Honestly, I approached this book with few expectations, and was pleasantly surprised to find a lot of useful information. If you have had some degree of experience in the wrestling industry, you are probably already aware of much of the information in this book. If, however, you have aspirations to become involved in pro wrestling as a business venture, this is a good book to pick up before taking the plunge.What makes the book especially valuable is the candid portrayal of the wrestling business. Both Drasin and Collins make no bones that a lot of dishonest people ---be they promoters, wrestlers, or bookers--- do become involved in the biz. Nor do they try to convince you that promoting pro wrestling is a good avenue toward wealth. They illustrate the positives of the pro wrestling business without giving you delusions of grandeur.The biggest surprise for me was the portion of the book written by Bruce Dwight Collins. Ric Drasin has been involved in the pro wrestling scene, and has long been wise and savvy to the business end. Collins, on the other hand, is a more recent inductee into the ranks of the independent wrestling promotion. His limited experience, and the fact that his rookie successes and mistakes are still fresh in his head, really gives the book a greater depth.I'll be honest... when I came to the section written by Collins, I rolled my eyes when reading about his naive beginnings as an Internet wrestling enthusiast, and thought I was in for a long, cringe-inducing read. I've met more than a handful of Internet smarcks who fancy themselves rasslin' promoters, and many of these folks are delusional! Collins, however, appears to be one of the exceptions. In fact, by reeling in his ego and showing his innocent enthusiasm for pro wrestling in the beginning, Collins better illustrates the gradual transition from a starry-eyed fan to a realistic man of business. In between you read about the many unexpected obstacles that stand in a promoter's way, from no-show wrestlers to the petty battles brought about by jealous competing promoters.Ric Drasin's experience in the business gives you a good idea about the industry's beginnings, how it has evolved into the present day, and his vision of pro wrestling's future direction. Drink in his information well, because Ric is a good independent promoter who preaches promoting with a rational mind versus getting carried away and spending mountains of cash on unnecessary accessories.My criticisms of this book are few, and are not significant enough to steer anybody away from the book. The aesthetics and the occasional typos give the book an amateurish look, especially the placing of an advertisement for a self defense device.The combination of Ric Drasin's experience and Bruce Dwight Collin's recent indoctrination are what makes this book a hit. If you want to become a wrestling promoter, this book is a good start. If you want to become a wrestler, this book is a good heads-up when dealing with promoters.

What I mean by great is that few books give you the tools to operate in wrestling.Most books tend to be biographical in nature or they try to expose the 'seedy' side of wrestling. This book is not in that category. It is a very rare book, one that shows you HOW to BE a promoter.This book takes you step by step on how to run your own wrestling shows and there is so much in this book ! Ric also has some extra sections such as wrestling moves and the book has some nice photos too.I recommend many wrestling books but this is one you really SHOULD get. If you become a promoter, you will use this book as a REFERENCE manual. It's also a good look at what happens behind the curtain."},{"Title":"So, You Want to be a Wrestling Promoter?","review":"Very informative. Ric Drasin tells it like it is.

For starters, this \\"comprehensive guide containing two books in one\\" clocks in at a measly 139 pages total, with about a third of the pages being either blank or at least half blank.

I've never paid so much for such a small book.This would be okay however, if the book itself had contained very much actual useful information in starting a wrestling promotion. If you are looking for a step by step guide, then don't waste your money. There is no actual information on how to obtain start up money, how to track down the contact info for talent, how to sell your ideas to people, what the day to day operation of a promotion is like, or how to land a television show on a local channel. There's not even any useful information on how to talk to wrestlers without offending them or hurting their fragile pride, how to decide if someone is reliable enough to put a belt on, and things of that nature.Instead what we are treated to is a very basic explanation of what the job of being a promoter is. Odds are, if you're considering this book, you are probably serious about choosing this as a career path, and as such are already familiar with anything that could be considered useful in this book. It is written for average Joe Blow that saw Rasslin' on tv a couple times and thinks he can make money off of it, not for people who are serious about promoting and have a realistic view of the modern wrestling landscape.In actuality, only about a quarter of the pages even have anything to do with promoting to begin with. What fills these pages are the authors talking about watching wrestling with their Grandpas in the 70's, how wrestling sucks now compared to the \\"good ol' days\\", how awesome it is to have Jake The Snake Roberts and The Blue Meanie working your shows (to quote Tony Schiavone- that'll put some butts in the seats), and you get to hear the main author be a total mark for himself. Marvel at his tales of how he designed the Gold's Gym logo, how he worked out with The Governator once 25 years ago, how he is a former world champion in the small time promotion he owns that no one has ever heard of, how he's such a successful actor (I watch tons of tv and movies and have never seen him in anything ever), and how he was the first guy to have a bald head and a goatee (he honestly believes he started this trend, and I wish I was exaggerating when I said that there was an entire chapter devoted to it). He even included a lecture about safety, and an ad smack dab in the middle of the book for a keychain that is also a self defense weapon.How is any of this supposed to help me become the Vince McMahon, Dixie Carter, or Carey Silken? I'm not quite sure exactly. But what I do know is that you should take the 13 dollars you were going to spend on this, and use it to print up flyers for your show. Then spend the hour or two it would have taken to read this to plaster said flyers around your town. And that my friends, is more genuine advice than this entire book will give you.Bottom line avoid this. If I could give this 0 stars I would. There are no redeeming qualities to this whatsoever. On the plus side, you can tell it was actually written by a couple of small time wrestling promoters, because I feel like I've been swindled by a couple of crooks."},{"Title":"So, You Want to be a Wrestling Promoter?","review":"Ever wanted to make $100, $500 or even $1,000 or more per month doing something you love to do ? \\"So, you want to be a wrestling promoter?\\" is the book for you !Written by Ric \\"The Equalizer\\" Drasin (an actor, wrestler and promoter-www.RicDrasin.com), this book is very detailed and walks the reader thru all of the nuances of promotions.

I wish the author had concluded each winner's write-up with a sentence or two as to what the recipient ended up doing, what business he went into after football, as we tend to think all Heisman winners made tons of money a la OJ...might be an eye-opener and definitely good fodder for trivia games.Overall, this book's a good quick read or browse for just about anyone."},{"Title":"Legends of the Heisman","review":"This book tells all in a glorious manner that a fan wants to know about the heroes of the college game.

Many of these authors have never even met an American Indian. The shape-shifting model of the hegemonic stock-story presents an ongoing battle. Devon A. Mihesuah illustrates how many images found in literature today are not authentic and do great damage to American Indian people. Stereotypical books freeze Native people in a pejorative past and strip the self-esteem of American Indian children.As an American Indian woman, I am often saddened and angered when I read most of what is written by non-Indians today. I am also saddened when I meet authors who feel they are imbued with the authority to write \\"about\\" American Indians because they have a great, great, great, great grandmother who was supposedly an Indian. My own great, great, great grandfather was Black. One can only imagine what would happen if I just sat down and wrote an authoritative book on Black people and culture in America today.Short of spending a few years on a reservation, this book is a good start to understanding more about Indian people.Devon A. Mihesuah helps non-Indian authors realize the responsibility they have when writing about American Indian people. Native writers can also benefit from this book, for occasionally even we can be blind to images and words that can misrepresent. There is also tremendous diversity between tribal nations. We all have different religions, languages, and cultures. Therefore, it is quite easy to make an intertribal faux pas. Mihesuah encourages more American Indians to write. Writing from within our own Native culture creates an authentic voice which needs to be heard.Stereotypes of American Indian people are deeply woven into the fabric of America. Authors have tremendous power to perpetuate or dispel these images. If you write about Indians, you have a responsibility to help make these changes. Choose to help build the self-esteem of American Indian children and create a more authentic world for Indian people through your writing. Yakoke, Devon Mihesuah, for your book."},{"Title":"So You Want to Write About American Indians?: A Guide for Writers, Students, and Scholars","review":"This author brings up a number of points for authors to keep in mind when writing about Native Americans, and clearly defines sensitive issues revolving this.

He will never leave us nor forsake us, no matter how badly we miss it. His love is unconditional. His mercies are new every morning. Great is His faithfulness!These are radical statements! They go contrary to the typical Christian teaching concerning God. Usually God is represented as stern, angry, and ready to get us for the slightest misstep. This leads to conclusions and attitudes about God that hinder an intimate relationship with Him.There are reasons for the Lord being represented harshly. In the Old Testament, the Lord vented His anger and judgment often and in devastating ways. There was Noah's flood; the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; a death angel killed all the first born of Egypt in one night; an angel killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in one night; and on and on the list goes. There is no doubt our God is a holy God who hates sin and demands justice.But there is also the portrait of God that Jesus painted through His teachings and actions. He showed mercy on the worst of sinners. He associated with publicans and harlots. The only people to receive His harsh rebukes were religious hypocrites. And His ultimate action of dying for our sins proved beyond any doubt that He came to save, not condemn the world.How does this fit with the Old Testament view of the harshness and severity of God? Is God schizophrenic? Does He sometimes love us and other times hate us? How can we have a healthy relationship with someone who changes His moods frequently?These are questions that present a dilemma keeping many people at arm's length from the Lord. The vast majority of people KNOW there is a God. They just don't know how to relate to Him. They are confused because there have been confusing signals sent to them, often by the church.A minister will say that it was the Lord who sovereignly killed a baby and in the next breath ask if anyone wants to serve this GOOD GOD. We are told that God won't answer the prayer of anyone in sin, yet we are told that we all sin. Where does that leave us?Without a prayer!There is a simple answer to these questions and a harmony between the wrath and mercy of God. God is not schizophrenic. There is one true nature of God clearly represented in the Word and that is LOVE! First John 4:8 says,\\"...God is love.\\"He doesn't just love at times. Love is the nature of God! Jesus gave us the greatest representation of the true nature of God ever presented. But what about the harshness of God's judgments in the Old Testament? Many expect God's mercies when we do well, but what about when we sin?God placed our sin on Jesus and punished Him in our place. God satisfied His own demands for justice, not by punishing us but by punishing His Son in our place. This wasn't a partial payment for our sins, conditional on our holiness being added to it. It was a total payment that leaves us with nothing to do except believe and receive or doubt and do without.Jesus' payment for our sins forever changed our relationship with the Father. If Jesus had made His sacrifice for sins in the Old Testament, then we wouldn't have seen the wrath of God vented as recorded in the Old Testament scriptures.Here's an example. In 2 Kings 1, Elijah called fire down from heaven and killed 102 soldiers who had come to arrest him. Jesus' disciples asked to do the same thing and cited Elijah as their example. Jesus rebuked them for even thinking about such an act, saying,\\"Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save them...\\" (Lk. 9:55-56)Jesus rebuked His disciples for trying to follow Elijah's example. This shows that if Jesus had been present on the earth in His role as Messiah, Elijah's act of judgment wouldn't have happened.There is a difference between the way God dealt with mankind under the Old Covenant and the way He deals with mankind under the New Covenant. One of the biggest problems in the church today is a failure to understand these differences. Before the sacrifice of Jesus there was harsh judgment. It wasn't because the Lord desired to punish us. His nature has always been love. But there was a price that had to be paid for sin, and until that price was paid by Jesus, He had to do something to restrain sin.It's similar to the way we train our children. If you wait until your child is twenty years old and can comprehend exactly what you say before you begin disciplining him, you and the child will be in big trouble. A child has to be restrained from doing wrong from a very young age. At one or two years old, a child may not understand that it is the devil tempting him to take his sibling's toys. But he can understand, \\"If you do that again, you are going to get a spanking.\\" He may not comprehend the issues of heaven and hell, but when the devil tempts him with covetousness, he will say \\"NO!\\" because of the fear of a spanking.Likewise, before the new birth, the Lord restrained the amount of sin in the earth through enforcing the strict Old Testament law by harsh judgments. This put the fear of God in men, but. . .\\"...fear has torment.\\" (1 Jn. 4:18)Although the amount of sin may have decreased by those under the law, the sin they did commit became more exceedingly sinful and damaging to their lives through the law (Rom. 7:8-13). Therefore, the law wasn't God's best, or first, way of dealing with sin. Prior to the time God gave the law through Moses, God didn't impute men's sins unto them. That means He wasn't holding men's sins against them or, as the word impute literally means, God wasn't putting men's sins on their account. Romans 5:13 says,\\"Until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.\\"Men were sinning, and that sin was destroying their lives. God didn't want to punish them. He was willing to show them mercy, in a sense on credit, looking forward to the sacrifice of His own Son for their sins. But men began to take the lack of God's judgment as approval.This can be clearly seen with Cain and his descendants. Cain killed his brother Abel (Gen. 4). Instead of punishment, God extended mercy toward Cain, even putting a mark on his forehead to warn others that God was protecting him. But Cain's great-great-grandson, Lamech, interpreted this as approval of Cain's murder. Lamech killed a man in self-defense and therefore felt more justified in his killing than Cain was. He said,\\"If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.\\" (Gen. 4:24)God didn't say that. Lamech said that. Lamech was being presumptuous because of God's lack of punishment upon Cain. Therefore, mankind began to move so far away from a proper standard of holiness that if God had not intervened there wouldn't have been a virgin left from whom Jesus could've been born.As Paul stated in 2 Corinthians 10:12,\\"...but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not wise.\\"This has always been the case. If one gets by with sin, others will be emboldened to commit more sin. So, before the Lord could produce the new birth where He came to live within us and guide us through the indwelling of His Holy Spirit, He placed external restraints on sin that even lost people could understand. \\"You sin and you die.\\" That's the way it was. Not because that's the way God really wanted it to be, but sin had to be restrained until Jesus' atoning sacrifice could be made.God's lack of punishment on sin had also led to a total loss of a true standard of right and wrong. Men compared themselves with others so often and for so long that no one knew what God originally intended. Something had to be done.Therefore, God gave the law, but not because it was His best. He could have given the law to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden when they first transgressed, but He waited 2000 years until the time of Moses. That's because the law had serious side effects of condemnation and guilt. God didn't want us to run from Him but to Him. However, sin was destroying the human race and had to have some restraint before Jesus came. That's why He gave the law.The law wasn't God attempting to save mankind. It was God showing us that we could never measure up to His holy standard. It was to drive us away from self-righteousness and toward receiving the sacrifice of Jesus by faith. Yet, amazingly, the church has interpreted it in a completely opposite manner. Most Christians think the law is wonderful and something that we are obliged to comply with as much as possible. Not!The law was given for two main purposes. It caused us to fear God's punishment on our sins, and therefore, to those who listened, it lessened the amount of sin in our lives, thereby diminishing Satan's in-roads. Second, it totally took away all hope of being saved by any virtue of our own. The law made everyone guilty before God with no hope of justice. We needed mercy.Those were the main purposes of the law. It was not God's list of steps one through ten thousand of what you must do to be right with God. It was God's list of all you have done wrong, proving that you can never be right with God unless He provides another form of payment. It was not to set you free. The law was to bind and destroy you. It was a severe spanking for the whole human race to turn us from sin and self-salvation.Luke 2:14 says,\\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will TOWARD MEN.\\"1 John 2:2,\\"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the WHOLE WORLD.\\"Romans 2:4,\\"knowing that it is the GOODNESS of God that leads man to repentence.\\"Before I learned these truths, I used to say that God would have to apologize to Sodom and Gomorrah if He didn't judge America, because we are just as deserving of judgment as they were. But now that I know the truth, I say, \\"If God does judge America, He will have to apologize to Jesus, because Jesus satisfied God's demands of justice.\\""},{"Title":"The Judgement of God: Terroism, Flood, Droughts and Disasters","review":"This book will definitely offend those \\"christians\\" who have a wrong conception of who God is, because they are products of the modern gospel. So many people think God is only a God of love, mercy and grace. But if they would read other verses of the Bible they would see that God is good and severe, as Romans 11:22 puts it. So many people think that their sin is OK because they have continually heard \\"Jesus loves you\\" and \\"God has a wonderful plan for your life.\\" Satan has deceived the the bride of Christ in thinking that they do not have to know or follow the Law of God, the Ten Commandments. That is why our society is being more and more decieved, because as Hosea 4:6 says, \\"My people are DESTROYED for LACK OF KNOWLEDGE...\\" In other words they are ignorant of the law of God and therefore reap the consequences of breaking the Law of God.

Frankly, I had to read this book twice in order to get past her offensive terminology. \\"Whiteness\\" is the foundational problem for Hooks, and it leads to racism, colonization, and \\"oppressive structures of domination.\\"It is possible that Hooks uses inflammatory language with intention. Her overarching purpose seems to be to rekindle black solidarity in order to complete movement toward racial freedom and equality. This goal is laudable, but I find it easier to support Hooks when she rephrases this goal outside of racial class conflict. She advocates for control of one's destiny, self-actualization, community, and integrity of being, but she does not seem to realize that these are the yearnings of all humanity, not simply American blacks.American culture, perhaps every human culture, is hierarchical. Even whites must deal with the \\"oppression\\" of those higher in the structure. Continued fracturing of middle and lower levels of the social structure along racial lines merely diffuses the power innate to each social class. Coalitions across racial, religious, and ethnic barriers are needed to compete with the hegemonic power of the social elites. Hooks passionate voice may actually work to maintain the secondary status of black Americans by making such coalitions more difficult.I find two additional inconsistencies in Hooks message. First, she advocates solidarity and self-actualization, but I cannot help but wonder if these two goals can be harmonized. Secondly, I believe she is guilty of baseline distortion in her assumption of hopelessness as the black cultural norm. This implied victimization is self-defeating, and seems to deny the tremendous advances black Americans have made educationally and economically in the last twenty years.It is possible that America needs to be continually confronted lest we become complacent in the progress we have made toward an egalitarian ideal. If so, Hooks' voice should be heard. But make no mistake about it, Hooks is not a voice of calm reason and balanced reflection. She writes from the fringes where ideals shine so brightly that the merest hint of a blemish is magnified."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"A friend recommended this book to me and I was a little skeptical at first, because I don't read much fiction, except for Grisham, Clancy, etc. I work too much to be bogged down by &quot;serious fiction&quot;, but I found this book to completely accessible, a fast read and utterly fascinating. From the first page, I was riveted by this book. The author's descriptions are poetic - the sounds of the words alone descibe the scene. The characters are phenomenal - I continually found myself loving a character and being disgusted by the same character at the same time or despising an evil character but feeling sympathy simultaneously. I continually was amazed that this kept happening. As I read further, I realized there is so much more than appears at the surface. And if you're a suspense lover like I am, you'll find that the surface alone will be enough. Beneath the surface there is a psychological drama being played out that peels back the layers of the novel's town - and I began to get the feeling that this story could be about anyone's town. This book is a must read - it's tension-filled, gritty, poetic, visceral and ultimately overpowering. I could not put it down and I found it to be a steady, tension-filled, march to a poignant creschendo. I have recommended this book to friends and I am receiving the same reports.

She has some baggage, sure. She realizes she has baggage, wonders what she can do to heal, but never does anything! Her problems are never solved within herself-- A man comes along and &quot;rescues&quot; her, magically transforming her into someone her family can be proud of.I would have preferred a story about a woman living in excess, who learns to be strong and pull herself out of the mire by looking within.

She finds it difficult to live up to the expectations of her &quot;perfect&quot; aunt and uncle and their &quot;normal&quot; children. Fiona is now 30, and her recklessness, unfounded trust in people, and poor judgment has earned her a reputation as an impulsive flake. She apparently sleeps with every man who crosses her path, and the book opens with her waking up and not knowing who is in her bed.But in spite of her poor judgment and many mistakes, Fiona is basically a good person and wants to help people. There is a real dichotomy between her basically good inner self and her outward appearance and actions. She is working as a waitress in the town diner, but wants to complete her education, so is taking a night class at the local college. She is surrounded by men who use her in so many ways. Patrick Grady is cruel and unstable as a result of injuries in Vietnam, and she believes him to be her father. Todd Prescott is her longest relationship (since high school), but he is wealthy and spoiled, and is constantly getting bailed out by his parents. George Grimshaw is the loyal and steady friend since high school, and former boyfriend of her cousin Elizabeth. She also becomes involved with Rudy, her cousin's fianc&eacute;. Her uncle Charles is a respected and prominent judge and is always helping out others, but can't seem to give Fiona the love and support she really needs.The intricacies of the relationships between all of these people make for interesting reading. You keep wondering what dilemma Fiona will find herself in next, and how she can extricate herself. The situation with her alleged father, Patrick Grady, deteriorates and becomes frightening, and the mystery of who he really is and his motivations will keep you engrossed until the end."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"what a book. i could not put it down. mary mcgarry morris has done it again. fiona is lovable, hateful, smart, stupid, sexy, all rolled into one and then some. fiona,s family friends, and enemies are all characters that make it impossible to forget.ms morris is an exceptional , gifted writer. she continues to create characters that have a lasting impression on the reader. i am once again amazed by her ability make her books seem so alive. great work."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Fiona was too available to any man who asked for she didn't value herself.I believe the ending was too pat yet you had to be glad that Fiona finallyfound her way with the help of someone who cared about her."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I almost didn't read this book because it started out slow and uninteresting, so I read the last page, before returning it to the library. For some reason I decided to continue reading and became completely hooked. I'm not going to give a synopsis of the book because many people have already done that and I don't think it is necessary. Even though I did read the last page before continuing on it didn't tell me everything. OK, the clues are abundant in this book and I have figured out a good bit of where it is going. I have figured out who Fiona's father really is but I haven't completely figured out what happened to her mother. For some reason I am finding it impossible to ignore this book and am enjoying it, except for the incredible number of typos and the repetitious use of \\"she bit her lip\\", \\"he bit his lip.\\" Far too much lip-biting and I find it very annoying that the author doesn't seem to be able to come up with a more realistic way to describe the character when he/she is upset, angry, etc. How many people in real life do you see always biting their lip? See, just a small but annoying detail. This is not the best book I've ever read but it's a better than average read. I read \\"A Dangerous Woman\\" but have not read any of the author's other books. Maybe I should try another one to see if it is better than \\"Fiona Range.\\""},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"In general I liked this book. There was something about it that reminded me of Richard Russo's work. It told an interesting (albeit predictable) story. Fiona is definitely a flawed character, but I found myself rooting for her.That's not to say that the book does not have problems. As mentioned by other reviewers, there are numerous typos - far too many. Also, there are too many repetitive scenes with too much repetitive dialogue. How many times did we have to read about Patrick calling Fiona and leaving messages about needing to talk to her, or conversations between Elizabeth and Fiona that started out pleasantly enough but ended with Fiona's outrage, only to have the next conversation between them be the exact same way. There was also a problem with the chapters. Each chapter contained several breaks, which was fine, but where there should have been a break, none existed. It definitely hurt the flow of the story.I also think that Morris was a little unfair to her main character. I think she tried at times to make her more screwed up and unlikable then she needed to be. For example, Fiona tells Rudy she loves him, they have sex, she feels guilty, tells him she doesn't love him, then tries to seduce him, only to be hurt by his rejection (which again was repetitive, since the same thing happened with George.)I'll give this one three stars. It needed to be shortened by about 100 pages to be a five star book."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I picked this up on the bargain bin, and it was a good little read. I got a little annoyed with Fiona for always being the victim. Seems like it would be easier to just pick up and go somewhere where no one thinks that you are the worst thing around. But it was entertaining nonetheless."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I found that I was able to predict the ending very early on as well. I did find it hard to put down though. I did not, however, like the clean, happy ending. Givin the amount of psychological problems that the main character has or probably has, it doesn't seem to fit."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"After reading this book, it is hard to understand how it received so many off color reviews. This book was amazing and nearly impossible to put down. Fiona was such a compelling and real character -- she said the things we all sometimes want to say, but cannot. True, she made many mistakes, with 20-20 hindsight, but this was a character who had been rejected, lied to, used and abused for most of her life. This book would make a great movie. It is about someone who never gives up, even if everyone else seems to have never believed in her. I wish there were more books like this out there -- with the happy ending."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Where do I start? At the beginning of course. Fiona's character jumps off the page from the start, in fact her life was thrilling to the end of the novel. Morris once again paints a complete portrait of a woman. By the time I finished I felt I knew Fiona inside and out. If she waited on me at the local diner here in town, I'd spot her before I read her nametage. But it wasn't just Fiona. This book is packed with 3-dimensional characters. The judge-what a crafty, yet somehow still respectable man. (By the way, has anyone stopped to follow how Morris portrays judges in her four novels? That would be an interesting essay itself) His wife, Aunt Arlene-keeping up appearances no matter the cost. Dear Elizabeth-Almost as complex a character as Fiona. Get this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Repetitive, silly, ridiculous, tedious, monotonous....if you've started reading this book, do yourself a favor and just skip to the 2 last chapters and save yourself some valuable time. Thank goodness I got mine at the library and didn't waste my money."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Once again, Mary McGarry Morris has given us a masterpiece of gut-wrenching, hilarious/tragic writing that is not to be put down until it comes roaring to a cymbal-crashing halt. Her photograph on the inside back cover tells me that she has suffered like her quirky heroines - her eyes look sad.I could identify with this particular protagonist more than any of the people in her other books (though my favorite Morris work is 'Vanished'). What I loved about this is Morris's total skewering of &quot;peppy,&quot; &quot;upbeat,&quot; &quot;traditional&quot; families - the whole &quot;family values&quot; hoo-ha. She just layered dysfunction upon dysfunction in this book and had me cracking up or crying all the way. Poor Fiona. Though both my parents were alive and known to me growing up, I often felt like the &quot;poor relation&quot; or &quot;odd pet&quot; of my family. The &quot;secret&quot; was that my popular, lovey-dovey parents were deeply insecure and financially unstable and took out their problems on their children by abusing them and belittling them privately, while putting on a &quot;happy face&quot; publicly.I also loved the jaundiced eye Fiona turned on her family's &quot;good deeds&quot; that brought them such public acclaim but which were actually smokescreens to cover the brutal dysfunction underlying their apparent saintliness. I had that in my family, too - the &quot;you can never give too much&quot; attitude that I consider a hallmark of co-dependency. I wonder if it is also a New England thing, since I was brought up not far from where Morris (or Fiona Range) lives.I have only one criticism, and I also voiced it after I read &quot;Songs.&quot; It is this: I felt the ending was too pat - I won't give it away here. But I am a writer myself and I felt that the endings of &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; and &quot;Vanished&quot; were much more satisfying - as a writer I felt they were perfectly &quot;true&quot; - &quot;real&quot; - whatever. But I do see where Morris was coming from. I guess I just wanted something a little, say, &quot;richer.&quot; My husband, upon hearing my complaint, said (channeling Steve Martin) &quot;Well, EXCU-U-U-SE ME!&quot;, taking Morris's side. He heard me chuckling and sighing all week as I ploughed happily through this book, and feels I'm quibbling with a great piece of literature.In any case, my heartfelt thanks to MMM, who is truly one of America's greatest living storytellers."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I liked Fiona Range, the character, from the very beginning. She's having a melt-down; she's on the brink of discovering who she really is, who she wants to be, and where she came from; she's unapologetic, funny, brash; she's a genuinely good person who doesn't always do the &quot;good&quot; thing. Fiona--the promise of the character--is very human, very accessible. But the execution of her self-discovery is not only disappointing, but lame. Instead of working on her from the inside, sorting her out piece by piece, the author makes Fiona's self-discovery seem like a tv-movie-of-the-week plot: Bad girl (who is really a good girl deep down) wants to change, can't seem to make it happen, blames all her bad luck on everyone else until Good boy (who can be bad because, after all, he cheats on his fiance) tells her he loves her (I actually missed the part where she felt anything for him but pity) and eventually &quot;saves&quot; her from herself (at least that's what we assume). Frankly, Fiona only ends up with him because he ends up with her. Not very interesting.There are some interesting characters in the book that also had potential--Elizabeth, Fiona's cousin, whose physical and emotional deterioration because she can't make decisions was purposely frustrating to read; Patrick, a Vietnam vet Fiona befriends and steadfastly defends; and the diner characters--but in the end, they're just as hollow as Fiona.Overall, not her best work."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"For some reason, I was completely taken with this book. I hate sappy, romantic stories or ones that have overly depressing endings. As a 30 year old like Fiona (though married), I really connected to this character. Fiona is more like a beloved old friend who keeps doing things that really tick me off. Her actions often seem completely rash from the reader's perspective. However, having made irrational, highly emotional choices myself (what woman hasn't?), I find Fiona Range to be the only book I've ever read with a main character that could easily be someone I know or, to some extent, me. And, the best part, the author presents her story without judging Fiona. The reader is allowed to do that herself. I am still recommending this to my friends. I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"This is the story of a 30 year old waitress who hasn't done anything with her life and seems to do nothing but cause problems. I enjoyed reading this book but wish that it wasn't so transparent. Mary is a gifted writer but this book needed a little more meat and some speed to it.This short review comes from a reader who's favorite books include, She's come undone, White Oleander, Amy and Isabel and loved the Bridget Jones'"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Poor Fiona Range. If only people would LISTEN to her, she'd probably not be in half the trouble she got into. At times I wanted to scream at Fiona to tell those around her to just sit down and shut up, already, so they could hear her side of the story before they judged her. But if she did that, we wouldn't have a story, now would we? At any rate, I found this book enjoyable, but somewhat frustrating, as I figured out before I had gotten past the dust jacket one of the big secrets of the novel, and the other secrets became just about as obvious as the novel went on. Still, this novel teaches its readers a very important lesson, one that hit home with me, anyway -- peace at any price is not worth it."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I admit I did not get into this story right away. However, when it begins to take off, BOY does it ever! Fiona Range is a novel full of twists and turns, and even though I thought most of it was predictable, the ending threw me for a loop.Fiona Range is probably the oldest teenager alive -- 30-years-old and still causing trouble. Raised by her aunt and uncle after the hasty disappearance of her mother shortly after her birth, Fiona has always felt like an outsider. Growing up in a house full of cousins who could do no wrong, Fiona looks at herself as the Black Sheep, the Trouble Maker, the Embarrassment Who Can't Get Her Life Straight. Slipping in and out of different beds quicker than changing socks, and if there is a moment of goodness that lasts longer than usual, leave it to Fiona to break the monotony.Fiona's story is one of sadness and trying to fit in. It speaks of the different relationships that surround her: with her family, who tend to cover their own transgressions with surface smiles and false happiness; with her ex-boyfriend, Todd, who is a troublemaker in his own right; her co-workers at the diner, Maxine, Chester, Donna and Sandy, who have their own stories to share; and her father, Patrick, who Fiona seeks out for answers about her mother. The fun begins at an engagement party for Fiona's cousin, Elizabeth, and doesn't end until novel's close. Excellent writing, very engrossing storytelling. Will be reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Where do I start? At the beginning of course.

I feel like a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; just watching all these people's relationships and interactions and decisions. With a house/husband/kids/p/t job, Ms. Morris is the only author that completely absorbs my thoughts and takes me away into another realistic world. I'm a die-hard Oprah book club fan, and Morris' books exemplifies all the relationship intricacies. Her characters are always 3-dimensional, never just &quot;cliche&quot; people. She's not a &quot;happily ever after&quot; author, which is also realistic. If anyone else out there also loves Mary McGarry Morris' books as much as I do (I read them all), please e-mail me to give me other books similar to hers, that are just as absorbing and realistic. I'm a avid reader and would love to share book info. Thanks. Enjoy Fiona!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Once I picked FIONA up I couldn't put her down. I suspect that's how a lot of the other men whom she encountered in her life felt too. FIONA is voracious and demanding and very pleasing as well. Bet you can't tell if I mean the heroine or the book itself. You've got to get this one and find out. I can't get FIONA out of my head. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I found this book SO exasperating. Fiona is totally unsympathetic. Within a single paragraph, she thinks she's being dismissed by her family, then she likes them, then her feelings are hurt by some perceived slight, and on and on it goes. I thought it was carelessly written; it felt very lazy to me - it could have done with serious editing. Plus, I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was set in the 40s or 50s, which is fine, if the book REALLY were set in those decades; I had to keep reminding myself this was supposedly set in the current day. I finished the book because I just had to see if it was going to be ludicrous to the very end, and it was. Even the &quot;happy ending&quot; was apathetic and tacked-on.I've liked the author's other books, so I was most disappointed when I finally got my hands on this one. I did finish it, but I sure won't be passing it on to my friends!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I'm one of those people who dislikes re-reading books, or seeing a movie more than once. I'm a novelist myself (unpublished, but hopeful), and I like to gulp as much fiction and media as I can, but rarely go back over old ground.The only movie I watch over and over is the Coen Brothers' \\"Miller's Crossing\\" and the only books I seem able to re-read are those by Mary McGarry Morris.For one thing, each time I re-visit one of her novels, I find there are new layers of meaning I missed the first, and even the second time. For example, the first time I read Fiona Range, I, like some of the others who have reviewed it here, found it to be less tragic and moving than her other books, \\"A Dangerous Woman,\\" \\"Vanished\\" (my favorite; it should have won the Pulitzer) and \\"Songs In Ordinary Time.\\"However, I am currently re-reading it now and, contrary to what I thought was going to happen (I knew the ending, so how could it be surprising and interesting?) it has turned out to be even better BECAUSE I know the ending. Now it truly does seem tragic, a magnificent character study of a Woman Interrupted...a woman whose whole life revolves around the black hole of lost identity, a giant lie perpetuated by those who pretend to have cared for her.It's a about monstrous hypocrisy and what happens to people when they are kept from essential knowledge about themselves. It's about cruelty that drives people to self-destruct. Damn, it's good.After Faulkner and Joyce, Mary McGarry Morris has had the most significant effect on my writing. Joyce Carol Oates, Richard Ford, Russell Barnes (\\"Affliction\\"), Alice McDermott, Annie Prioux, Stephen King, Toni Morrison...they are all to be studied, and I owe them so much. But Mary is the greatest writer in America today. As another reviewer here noted, her characters are fresh, real, surprising, devoid of stereotype, human to the bone. No one writes them living and breathing as she does.With their many flaws and their heartaches, their jerkiness, their addictions, their violence and their cuteness, they are truly unforgettable. The old expression, \\"To know her, is to love her,\\" is what makes these books keepers. Thanks, Mary, for the gifts."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Mary McGarry Morris has a winner on her hands. This book is just wonderful. I think it could possibly be one of the best books I have read this summer (and, I've read a lot) but, this one has everything you need. The characters, story, plot, setting, etc...I found it thrilling, charming and wonderfully told. Others have said it's no better than a cheap &quot;dime-store&quot; romance novel, but I disagree. I thought it was well written and very nicely told. It's a smart book by a gifted author. Certainly one I would recommend to others."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Fiona Range is a revealing book about a young woman who learns to take her place in the world, in spite of her step-family's well-meaning attempts to keep her an outsider. Fiona is raised by her maternal aunt and uncle and grows up with three cousins, one of whom is also her best friend. While Fiona is attractive and witty, she's also a hellion facing a turning point in her life. She is searching for the reasons why she is such a difficult person, and why she is so unappreciative of her step-family's 'good deeds'. Fiona's life changes when she digs up the family secrets and asks to have the record set straight.Fiona Range is a great study of the kinds of people who take in 'abandoned' children and undermine those children's fragile sense of security by 'unintentionally' reminding them of their second-class status. It is also a great study of the development of the classic 'guarded personality'.Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Whisked through 418 pages in two-days. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I really hoped to enjoy this book. The initial introduction to Fiona, is risque, yet pathetic. She wakes up one morning to find herself in bed, hungover from a party the evening before, with an aquaintence, whose wife was in the hospital, recovering from childbirth.And it only gets worse from there..All the male charecters are seen as Fionas' victims. From her employer to her family, they all complain of being victims to her selfishness. I couldnt sympathize at all with her.Her worst charecter in this book is the cruel and crazy Patrick Grady, who is believed to be Fiona's illigitamate father. She relentlessly persues a relationship with this terrible man because she wants to be his daughter. The author paints a one sided picture of him...never really showing any warmth or humane personality traits. It made Fiona seem even more unreal, to chase after him so relentlessly.The other charecter who was so irritating was her cousin Elizabeth. She is whiny, spineless and weak. I had wondered how she attracted so much love and attention from the other people in this book.I have to say the only reason I finished this book was that I was on a 4 hour bus trip, and it was more interesting then the scenery.On a more positive note, this book was mildly entertaining, and an easy read. It seemed like more of a soap opera plot then a book with a lot of substance, which can sometimes be fun."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Although Fiona Range, the title character of her fourth book is the main focus of this story, author Mary McGarry Morris ultimately paints the portrait of a flawed family trying to maintain its place in a very confusing and complex world. Fiona Range is a satisfying, if not always easy look into the world of a prominent New England family and its one wild child. When she is quite young, Fiona is abandoned by her mother; she is denied paternity by her father, Patrick Grady; she is raised by relatives who do not understand her petulant behavior and who are constantly puzzled by her absolute lack of judgment. Fiona is 30. For the past few years, she has worked as a waitress in Chester's Coffee Shop in Dearborn, Massachusetts. Her life is stuck in a constant cycle of rebellion, failed relationships, and an endless, empty horizon. As much as she yearns to be part of the family who raised her, she is repulsed by their shallow lives and their almost insatiable need to present a perfect face to the community. Her Uncle Charles Grady is a prominent judge. Her Aunt Arlene is the perfect wife and mother, volunteering in the community and taking care of those who cannot take care of themselves. To the world, the Grady family is a model of success. Their three children are educated, employed and functioning members of society. Jack is a computer whiz. Ginny runs a day care. Elizabeth, the schoolteacher, is engaged to a wonderful doctor from New York. Their lives are picture perfect, if you don't look too close. And then there's Fiona. The trouble with you, Fiona, is you don't think before you act. The trouble with you, Fiona, is you don't think. The trouble with you, Fiona, is you. The trouble with Fiona is you. The trouble. Fiona is the trouble. There are a lot of issues raised in this book. Not all of them are resolved, but they're out there for the reader's inspection. This is not a book you read in one night. You must pace yourself in order to endure Fiona's wild abandon, Elizabeth's neuroses, Patrick Grady's madness, and ultimately, the Grady family's undoing. I liked all the characters in this book. No one was perfect and there were no Hollywood endings, all neatly tied up with red ribbons. The people who make this story work are flawed and they all struggle with life's hardest questions. In other words, these people could be REAL. And, to me, that's what quality fiction should create: real people, flaws and all, dealing with life's triumphs and tragedies, while trying to make their way in the world without inflicting too much damage on themselves and those around them. Very Highly Recommended.Terry H. Mathews Reviewer"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I found myself desperately trying to get to like the character of Fiona, and just when I thought I could, she would do something to upset me. In this respect, I found the character very well written, because despite the fact she isn't always likeable, this is who she is. What was so disappointing was the extremely predictable ending, as well as the lack of well developed characters other than Fiona. I still find the book a decent read, just not one of the best."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I have never written a review - good or bad, but felt compelled to do so. I have never rolled my eyes or made exclamations of disgust (at the writing, not Fiona) quite so many times. I am not a snob, but I do have high standards, and I believe the author wrote &quot;down&quot; to us . . . nowadays, the reading population is fairly sophisticated. I found many editing mistakes and was surprised that Viking had published it. There were too many contractions - speaks to the entire book being poorly written. Ms. Morris - I challenge you to rise above mediocrity.And . . . .why does this all suddenly happen in Fiona's 30th year . . . what on earth has she been doing for the past 12 years since HS graduation? She is shallow, petty and childish, and not a character I care to read about. The foreshadowing was incredible, I figured out the &quot;plot twists&quot; about a third of the way through. I am honestly surprised so many readers enjoyed it, but I doubt if my views in the minority.

Fiona, who could have been an interesting character, comes off more annoying than sympathetic. As I read it, I wondered if this might be one of the author's earlier efforts, which is being published now that she has achieved some success.

I read Morris's Oprah-chosen novel and liked it well enough to pick up her new one. This is a let-down! All of the characters are predictable and one-dimensional. There is not a sympathetic one in the bunch. Elizabeth, George, and Rudy all come across as spineless. Fiona herself, if she was really that headstrong, would have left these people behind a long time ago.

The story line was transparent - there were no surprises whatsoever. I had it all figured out about 1/3 of the way through and just slogged through the repetition and confusion so I could see if it got any better.

There are so many typos that it is distracting to someone who knows how to use grammar. Tbe plot is too simplisitic for a book this long--maybe better suited to a novella or a short-story.

Thirty years ago her irresponsible unwed mother abandoned Fiona as an infant. In Dearborn, Massachusetts, her conservative aunt and uncle raised Fiona to behave properly.Fiona's love life is one disaster after another as she always ends up with a loser. When her \\"perfect\\" cousin Elizabeth, accompanied by her fianc&eacute; arrives in town, Fiona, acting par for the course, ends up sleeping with the fianc&eacute; and her cousin's former local boy friend. Her efforts to get closer to Patrick Grady, rumored to be her father, flops even worse although Fiona defies her uncle's warning about this person he gives hush money to keep quiet. Fiona knows she needs to reclaim her life, but each step she takes is closer to the abyss.FIONA RANGE is an exciting psychological character study that will remind readers of LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR. The cast is clearly defined, which enables the audience to fully understand the conflicting emotions that eat away at Fiona's self respect. The story line is filled with tension that builds up to a fine climax as readers wonder what will Fiona do next to cause herself even deeper hurt. However, at the same time, the constant repetitiveness of Fiona's self destruction costs her any empathy. Though superbly drawn, part of the story line feels like filler. Still, Mary McGarry Morris packs quite an emotional wallop in a story that goes deep into the inner gut of a person knowingly traveling down a path that can only end in tragedy. Fans of relationship dramas will relish this distressing, well-written tale.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I really only checked in at this site to comment on Mary's Absolut short story on the inside cover of the 5/22 New Yorker.

Quite a feat with a job and 2 young kids, but I MADE time for it. I really felt for all the characters and the ending was great. One part of the ending I was sure of from early on but there were other elements that were a complete surprise. I think every family has a Fiona somewhere in it and this was a great insight into what they (the Fionas) are going through.

She had been very drunk the night before and can't remember what happened. As she sees this man leave her apartment, she realizes it is the husband of one of her friends - a friend who just had a baby yesterday. Fiona just can't seem to get her life straight. She is desperately lonely and doesn't know how to fit in.She was raised by an aunt and uncle. Her mother deserted her when she was an infant and Fiona has always felt like an outsider in her adopted family. They avoid discord at all costs and Fiona is direct, often to the point of her own embarrassment. She is impulsive and doesn't always think before she speaks. She is especially close to her cousin Lizzie who is now engaged to marry a doctor after returning to her family home in Dearborn, Massachusetts. Fiona works as a waitress while all her cousins have careers after attending college. College just wasn't in the books for Fiona. She tried community college but it just didn't work out. Fiona goes through men fast and is considered 'easy'. She tries to make something of her life but as she says, \\"I'm at the wrong place at the right time' or \\"I'm in the right place at the wrong time\\".Fiona is obsessed with knowing more about her mother and finding out who her biological father is. She thinks her biological father is a man names Patrick, a Vietnam War vet who is very unstable and dangerous. She is warned to stay away from him by her employer and her family but she can't. This results in disaster and tragedy for Fiona. Patrick is labile, mercurial and dangerous. Fiona thinks he deserves a chance because she believes he is her father - Patrick and her mother dated throughout high school and were together after he returned from the war.Fiona begins to date Lizzie's ex-boyfriend from high school, George, but this doesn't work out. She finds herself becoming more and more attracted to Lizzie's fiance, Rudy. Lizzie herself can't decide what or who she wants - George or Rudy. Lizzie goes into a deep depression and is very fragile.Fiona's family bails her out of one mistake after another. They say to her, \\"Be like us. Don't keep wasting your life on messes\\". Fiona doesn't want to be like them. They don't talk about things and pretend everything is alright even when things are horrific. There are secrets and lies going on and Fiona is usually the only one of them to address these. Because she addresses what they want to be left unsaid, she is singled out as being the 'wrong' one, the one who just won'd fit into their idea of how a person should act.The story is beautifully written and the prose is superb. My one disappointment with the book is LIzzie's continued relationship with Patrick despite her knowing his true nature. It just doesn't ring true. Even as self-defeating as Fiona is, no one should be able to put up with all that she does with this frightening man. His relationship to her is sick and portends of worse things to come.I am a huge fan of Mary McGarry Morris and I loved this book. I have only one of her books left to read,A Hole in the Universe. I am saving this novel to savor. She is the author ofSongs in Ordinary Time (Oprah's Book Club)andA Dangerous Woman. Most of her books, Fiona Range included, have protagonists that are hard to like. Many are repulsive and outcasts. Yet she brings them into your heart and makes them real and broken so that you can empathize even with their frightening and often despicable natures. She is a remarkable author."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"You can almost see MMM trying to bring out the characters, to shed some sort of three-dimensional light on them, as well as giving some meaning to their interactions. There are too many characters, however, and past the 200th page you kind of stop caring whether Jack wants to live up to his fathers expectations, or that Elizabeth is torn up inside about her feelings. Fiona keeps making stupid decisions and having sex with every TOm Dick and Harry that knocks on her door. Not to mention the fact she keeps associating herself with Patrick, after what he's done to her. She acts like a battered woman, but meanwhile she's supposed to be some sort of strong, outspoken diva. Perhaps it shows up her different faucets, but afer the fifth time she hangs up on Patrick and the thrid time she gets caught trying to get in some guy's pants, it gets kind of annoying. This could have been a very insightful book, instead, it reads like a soap opera. I hate soap operas."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Oh Dear. This book is absolutely dreadful. There's not a single likable character in it including Fiona who has singlehandedly created a whole new personality disorder for psychiatrists to examine. Elizabeth is so pathetic you want to stuff her in a gunny sack and drown her just to put her (and you) out of your shared misery. All the men are weak, silly characters who fall in and out of love at the author's convenience. There are a host of characters who, at no peril to the 'plot line', would be left out of the Lifetime movie versionto keep the budget down--a tactic that could have been used by the publisher instead of refusing to hire a proof-reader to go over the galleys (the paperback is laden with typos).At the conclusion of 'Fiona Range' the reader is left with the hope that, if biological warfare ever reaches our shores, it will begin and end in Dearborn, Massachusetts. (With apologies to real live residents of Dearborn--if there is such a place. I am quite sure no real town could be inhabited by characters as thoroughly awful as Fiona Range and her gang of idiots and snivelers)."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"After reading this book, it is hard to understand how it received so many off color reviews. This book was amazing and nearly impossible to put down. Fiona was such a compelling and real character -- she said the things we all sometimes want to say, but cannot. True, she made many mistakes, with 20-20 hindsight, but this was a character who had been rejected, lied to, used and abused for most of her life. This book would make a great movie. It is about someone who never gives up, even if everyone else seems to have never believed in her. I wish there were more books like this out there -- With the happy ending."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Got it at the airport and the next thing I knew I was in San Francisco. My biggest dream would be to meet Fiona. My biggest nightmare would be to meet Fiona. Morris nails this characterization with her usual stunning perception. Even for Morris, this book is off the charts. Now if I can just get this maddening, seductive, selfish, brilliant, naive,needy woman off my mind..."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Compared to &quot;Songs in Ordinary Time&quot; this book was boring and predictable. The characters never displayed any depth. I thought it was absurd the way 30 year old Fiona kept dismissing Patrick's inappropriate behaviour. I figured out the plot early on. Maybe the author will do better next time. I'll wait for the paperback on that one!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I am always on the lookout for stong female characters, Fiona has proved to be the weakest yet. With her life revolving around one man to the next, she never takes the time to evaluate her own NEGATIVE choices and take stock in her own worth as a human being. I kept reading simply for this hope, but it never arrived. In the end, Fiona still takes pleasure out of seeing other lives destroyed. Only skillful writing could have saved this character, and unfortunately Morris has failed. Fiona's story is thinly constructed. Morris's novel is devoid of any quality literary technique. And I certainly hope that the copy editors of Viking have been retrained, as misspelled words and punctation errors further scar this already poorly written novel. May I never fall in the type of love that The Philidephia Inquirer calls Morris &quot;a master at depicting.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Ms. McGarry Morris: My clock is ticking. I'm not getting any younger. You're not exactly a prolific writer so please drop everything else and get to it. I'll pay double for your books and I promise not to lend my copy to the double line of friends waiting at my door.I can't say that I have a favorite of your four books to date. Fiona Range might be the most tangible character thus far but that takes nothing away from the other books. They are all equally excellent.By the way, will we be seeing Fiona Range on the big screen?Remember, double; no lending to friends. Promise!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I just finished FIONA RANGE, and can't think of a book since Michael Cunningham's THE HOURS that was so engaging and well-developed.There are no clear cut heroes in FIONA RANGE. There is no obvious line of demarcation between good and bad in this book. It's just not that simple.Morris has created a family with such complex and compelling characters that -- gosh -- they could be real.I'll be recommending this story to my reading buddies. It's that good.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I used to be one of those readers who had to finish a book I had started, whether or not it was holding my interest. I am not capable of this these days. I'm sorry to say that I quit reading Fiona Range with less than 100 pages to go, choosing instead to skim the remainder just to find out what happened.Mary McGarry Morris paints the picture of a 30-year-old waitress struggling to make something of her life, while repeatedly getting in her own way. Fiona's mother ran off when Fiona was still a little girl, leaving her to the care of her aunt and uncle, who raised her alongside their own children. Her father is assumed to be Patrick Grady, the violently angry loner who had loved Fiona's mother before he was shipped off to the Vietnam War, but who had returned a scarred and changed man who still denies any relationship to Fiona. When we first meet our heroine, she is dealing with a rat's nest of problems, including strained relationships with her aunt and uncle and her bizarre, persistent attempts to build a relationship with Patrick. Her biggest problems, however, seem to revolve around her cousin Elizabeth and Elizabeth's fiance, Rudy. Elizabeth doesn't seem to want to marry Rudy, but also can't let him go... which eventually pushes him toward Fiona, causing repercussions in every aspect of Fiona's messy life.Sound interesting? It was, until about halfway, when all of the characters began to grate on my nerves. Fiona herself is hard to pin down- she does or says something horrible, then goes for long stretches of time acting pretty much like a normal human being, before doing something bad again. I couldn't decide if I liked her or found her irritating. The other characters, on the other hand, are so one-dimensional and repetitive that it's painful. In particular, I grew so weary of Elizabeth's hand-wringing and spinelessness that I felt no sympathy for her when her difficulty in breaking things off with Rudy pushed her closer and closer to emotional collapse. Throw in a few too many hushed conversations, family secrets that are constantly danced around (even long after the reader has guessed the truth), and angry phone conversations, and you have a book that eventually becomes unreadable.I give &quot;Fiona Range&quot; three stars, because it could have been much worse. However, if you are new to this author, I would recommend &quot;Songs in Ordinary Time&quot; or &quot;A Dangerous Woman&quot; before I would suggest this novel."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"You want to care about Fiona, you really do. She has it rough, trouble just seems to float in her tepid cup of yesterday's bitter coffee. But unfortunately this book reads like a mediocre second hand account of someone's sister. Interesting, especially at first, but things start to drag, times rolls on, you finally reach the big, final conflict and you swear to yourself you're watching an episode of General Hospital. (Not that there's anything wrong with General Hospital, but you expect something different from Morris.) Such promise, such a beautiful cover, but I found myself shrugging afterwards, and moving on."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I was so drawn into Mary McGarry Morris' book Songs In Ordinary Time. I hovered in that world created by such an expert of nuance and detail. I loathed the story of Fiona Range. I can't believe this came from Mary's hand. I can't believe this was written after Songs In Ordinary Time. I would guess this to be more of a first try than a novel by such a successful author. This story was unbalanced, inconsistent, dull. I told the library that they should lose it instead of returning it to the shelf. I was so disappointed!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Good opening chapter that soon fell prey to redundant explanations of Fiona's emotions through tired cliches. The attempts at suspense were just annoying because Fiona neglected to ask the right questions, and then the suspense gave way to a predictable ending. I think the story was valid, and worthy of being told, in half as much space."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I am not a snob, but I do have high standards, and I believe the author wrote &quot;down&quot; to us . . . nowadays, the population is fairly sophisticated. I found many editing mistakes and was surprised that Viking/Penguin had published it. There were too many contractions - speaks to the entire book being poorly written. Ms. Morris - I challenge you to rise above mediocrity.Why does this all of a sudden happen in Fiona's 30th year . . . what on earth has she been doing for the past 12 years since HS graduation? She is shallow, petty and childish, and not a character I care to read about.Less than halfway into the book, I figured out the ending . . . so much for plot twists. There's an incredible amount of foreshadowing.I am honestly surprised so many readers enjoyed it, but I doubt if my views are in the minority. However, since it was an Oprah book, my hopes may have been too high."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I have to say this is the best book I've read this year. The main character, Fiona, is constructed so well that you feel as if you know her and her family because the detail given is so in depth.Upon reading the first chapter, I had to find out what was going to happen to Fiona. I hungered to know whether her life would ever be settled. Fiona you see, is a 30yr old waitress who is known as the town trouble maker. But reading this novel from her perspective you see what a kind-hearted person she really is and you will root for her. Although she sometimes does questionable things and the reader knows what Fiona is doing is wrong, you can't help but pray that things turn out for her.I really, really enjoyed this novel and plan to recommend it to all of my friends. The brilliant writing will keep you hooked!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"After I read Songs in Ordinary Time, I was hooked and searched for all of M.M.M's books. I LOVED her earlier books. I was a tiny bit disappointed in Fiona. I found myself becoming tired of her continual &quot;bad luck.&quot; Her earlier books were more meaty and real. Good but no cigars."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Finally done with this book! Fiona Range is by far the worst book I've read by Morris. It was near torturous trying to finish this novel with its multitude of typos and grammatical errors. Whoever attempted to proof/edit this novel should be fired. I found the story boring and the characters lifeless. I couldn't wait for Fiona to slice her wrist or do something equally stupid given that her sole talent in this novel seems to be her ability to make one stupid decision after the other. The book's ending did not surprise me; I'd predicted it before halfway finishing the book. If you're interested in truly experiencing this author's talent read Vanished or Songs in Ordinary Time."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I just loved the character, Fiona. She was tough yet soft. She was a true survivor. I must admit, I was able to predict what ended up happening in the end, but I still found it to be a very good book, and enjoyed it completely."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"After reading this book, it is hard to understand how it received so many off color reviews.

If you like this book you should also read Morris's &quot;Songs in Ordinary Time&quot;. It is also excellent."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"MMM is a good writer (especially A Dangerous Woman), but this book is flat.Fiona is unsympathetic. She is a 30 year old brat. Her feeling of being an outsider is self-induced, and the constant episodes where she is \\"acting out\\" are repetitive and exasperating. The other main characters are equally repellant.The book suffers from sloppy editing, as well.No one hits a home run with every book, but this one doesn't even make it to first base."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Thirty-year-old Fiona Range, the hapless heroine of this book, is a self described &quot;magnet for trouble&quot;. Fiona's life reads like a 90s version of a Greek tragedy. Abandoned by her mother at infancy, she is raised by her genteel and conventional uncle and aunt - the Hollises - in a small town near Boston. Desperate for attention and a sense of belonging, the volatile Fiona careens from one feckless man to another, barely holding down a waitressing job. In her saner moments, she wallows in guilt, wishing she &quot;could get on with her life instead of feeling so hopelessly stalled all the time&quot;.The novel begins with Fiona waking up in bed with the husband of a close friend, after a drunken party. Things only get messier. After being virtually shunned by her foster family for her reckless behaviour, Fiona decides to seek out Patrick Grady, the troubled and violent town loner rumoured to be her father. Despite the warnings of the Hollises, she relentlessly badgers Grady to let her into his life and tell her more about her mother. Grady initially rejects her, then becomes possessive and threatening. Meanwhile, the Hollis family prepares for the much anticipated wedding of Fiona's dutiful but indecisive cousin Elizabeth. As Elizabeth vacillates between her old flame George Grimshaw and her new fiance Rudy Larkin, Fiona ends up drifting inexplicably into liaisons with both men. Eventually the story hurtles to a violent and sensational denouement, as the Hollis family secrets are exposed.Morris's three previous novels have won rave reviews. Her first novel, Vanished, was nominated for the National Book Award and the PEN/Faulkner award. Her third, Songs In Ordinary Time, became a bestseller after being chosen by Oprah Winfrey for her book club. Morris certainly has a knack for realistic, crisp dialogue. Fiona's &quot;wicked mouth&quot; and endearing habit of talking first and thinking later will have many a reader rooting for her. &quot;You are too true to be good,&quot; says Rudy to Fiona at one stage, and it is Fiona's blunt charm that propels the narrative forward. The book's best passages are those where Fiona ticks off the repressed Hollises. But as the novel meanders on, and Fiona flounders ever deeper in messes of her own making, readers may find themselves more exasperated than empathetic.Her perpetual regrets over wasted opportunities come close to whining, and the novel becomes bogged down by Fiona's dreary wrangles with a stream of deceitful, unsuitable or brutal men. Morris's farfetched soap-opera plot, with its untimely deaths and dark secrets, strains credibility, before a climax so predicable that only Fiona fails to see it coming. Fiona Range is as wayward and confused as Fiona."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"Mary McGarry Morris evinces striking skill at creating the vivid character of Fiona Range. Fiona is hard to admire, but engages interest by her rebel attitude and behavior. She is someone the apparently respectable people of small town Dearborn near Boston, shun and label as trouble.Some of her bad behavior is not exactly of her making. By book's end, readers gain some sympathy for her.She steps into the book in the worst light. From a drunken state where she is beyond knowing what she is doing, she wakens hungover in her own bed -- but with a hairy arm wrapped around her that could belong to any male from this small depressing town. Although she never misses a day, she is late for work, as a waitress in Chester and Maxine's coffee shop. Thirty-year-old Fiona arrives with a throbbing temple, her hair looking possibly as though cut, dried and fried, her good looks on vacation.Maxine is Chester's wife, her attempts at waitressing are hilarious. She would make Guinness Book of Records for average number of plates dropped per shift.Life for Fiona sinks further until she determines to restore it. It would help if she could identify her father.Many point to Patrick Grady, a local dysfunctional war veteran. She harasses him but he refuses to talk to her. Her mother disappeared years ago. Brought up by a family presided over by Judge Hollis, Fiona became persona non grata because of bad behavior, and they evicted her.Fiona likes to speak truth. It is not always what people want to hear, gossip is more their style. Small communities have a reputation of everyone knowing everyone else's business. Like Peyton Place, Dearborn also houses dangerous secrets.These explode in final chapters that solve a long standing mysterious disappearance and create an exciting and surprising denouement for all that has occurred."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I just finished reading Fiona Range & had to write this review. I read 150 pages in one sitting--which says a lot about a book. I have to say that when I got this book, I was enticed by the title because I like the name Fiona. When I first started reading it, I saw Fiona, the main character, as pretty much a slut & someone I wouldn't like if I ever met her.Fiona Range became really good & you saw that Fiona was more than just a slut. I could relate to her struggles of trying to fit into her conformed life with her aunt & uncle. She struggled to grow close to who she thought was her father & deal with the fact that she was 30 & had become nothing & constantly made mistakes. This novel had a very surprise ending & I really thought it was creative & well written. It's only (small) problem was that it did have some sub-plots that threw you off, but the significant events ending weaving into an understandable story. i would definitlely recommend this book, for even someone who doesn't enjoy reading. It's worthwhile!!!!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I must say I was a little disapointed with this book. I got more excitment when Billy Ray Tuggle and Opal were introduced years ago on &quot;All my Children&quot;. At least they could act. Fiona was a whiney woman who just made me sick instead of sorry for her. Her cousin was a poor excuse for a human being constantly crying and acting like a two-year old. I felt like I was reading a book about two woman who where psychiatric cases. That premise would have been interesting if I actually had any feeling for these characters. The only person I had any interest in was Fiona's father. He was an interesting character study. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something to take up time on an airplane or bus ride. I think I would have been more satisfied reading a Harliquin Romance or watching Spongebob Squarepants."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I've read all of Mary McGarry Morris' novels and have loved each and every one! Fiona Range was so very human and vulnerable I ached for her sadness and disappointment in what her life had to offer. . . again, as in previous novels, Ms. Morris' story features a woman with plenty of troubles, struggling to find her way. This was a great book which should please all of her fans!"},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"This book was by far the best ever by Mary McGarry Morris. The characters were so real and the ending...what can I say, I never suspected it! I loved this book and was done with it within a week. Fiona Range is a character who you really feel sympathy for. i'm sure everyone knows a &quot;Fiona Range.&quot; Eventhough, she frustrates the reader, and I felt like taking the book and shaking it, Fiona is a great character with a witty unique personality."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book until about the last 20 pages or so. I would definitely rate the previous part 4 stars, but the ending deserves only 2 stars. Morris did an excellent job of describing Fiona and her place in her family. Most people probably even know a Fiona....nothing is her fault and everyone is plotting against her. Morris's descriptions are vivid and satisfying. It's too bad that she seems to have failed to wrap the story up in any meaningful way and simply went for the &quot;movie of the week&quot; ending. What a shame because I really enjoyed the book before the ending."},{"Title":"Fiona Range","review":"As I already said, it was predcitable. Somewhere around the fourth or fifth chapter you can put the pieces together and figure out what is going to happen. There are some good twists and turns, but you end up right where you thought you would. However, even though you know what is going to happen, you want to continue reading anyway. I really enjoyed the characters and all the little (and big) messes Fiona gets herself and her family into. This is the first book I have read in a long while that I can honestly say would make a good movie. Of course, if it were a movie they would have to not give so much away at the very beginning of the story!"},{"Title":"Psychotherapy Isn't What You Think: Bringing the Psychotherapeutic Engagement Into the Living Moment","review":"Psychotherapy Isn't What You Think: Bringing the Psychotherapeutic Engagement Into the Living Moment. James F.T. Bugental, Ph.D. Zeig/Tucker, 1999. The latest work of this pioneering existential-humanistic master psychotherapist. The subtitle concisely states the central deceptively simple theme that he has been hammering at (or hammering out) for the past four decades--that therapy is not detective work to uncover the past, or to explain how a client got to be a certain way, but rather it is a joint undertaking between therapist and client in which both parties must strive to be present in the moment. Bugental argues powerfully and persuasively for the primacy of the client's subjective experience as the proper realm for true depth psychotherapy. He demonstrates clearly in this text (as well as in previous writings, such as his classic, The Art of the Psychotherapist), the therapist must avoid the pitfalls of the &quot;content trap,&quot; but rather focus attention on the client's process. Although most therapists think they know the difference between content versus process, in actuality, the term &quot;process&quot; is often used so loosely that it becomes meaningless, as in references to a client &quot;processing her feelings,&quot; or &quot;leading a process group.&quot; Bugental skillfully elucidates the various nuances of a client's process, and shows how the therapist can begin to notate or &quot;tag&quot; the client's process, helping clients to see, experience, and gradually modify the the most restrictive elements of their process which form their core patterns of life (and therapy) resistance. The chapter titles and subheadings alone should be enough to make you run out (or double click) and buy this book (published by the new press, Zeig, Tucker, &amp; Co--This is the Jeffrey Zeig, director of the Milton Erickson Foundation, producer of the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conferences, and a masterful therapist and teacher in his own right). A few samples: Living is Only in the Now--Orienting psychotherapy to what is actually present; Two Eyes are Better than One--We need both the objective and the subjective; and The Necessity for Space Suits--Our self-and-world construct systems. Written by Jim Bugental in his eighties, this work should give us a cause to celebrate, reminding us of why we were drawn to this field in the first place."},{"Title":"Psychotherapy Isn't What You Think: Bringing the Psychotherapeutic Engagement Into the Living Moment","review":"Bugental's book serves as a great reminder that the healing essence of therapy is found in the living moment between therapist and client. Striving to explore the client's experiencing in the here-and-now (instead of collecting facts in a \\"who-done-it\\" type investigation), this humanistic-existential approach to therapy invites the client to find their own truth, while in the safe and ever-present company of the therapist. By helping the client to engage in the living moment in the therapy room, the therapist can ultimately help the client to engage fully in their relationships with self and others outside of the therapy."},{"Title":"Psychotherapy Isn't What You Think: Bringing the Psychotherapeutic Engagement Into the Living Moment","review":"Bugental's book is captivating and inspiring for any therapist wanting to work on truly bringing the therapy into the room. You will learn from Bugental in many ways professionally and personally by reading his refreshing perspective."},{"Title":"Guidelines for Health Supervision III (Book + Cue Card Booklet, Revised Edition)","review":"The book was in great condition. I appreciate the honesty and good service."},{"Title":"Build Your Dream Home for Less","review":"As a licensed builder, developer, broker, and appraiser with 30+ years of experience, I will tell you that homebuilding is one of the most complicated tasks the average person might ever attempt. There are a multitude of products and processes that need to come together in the correct manner, or else the results can be disasterous (mold, water damage, foundation problems, etc ---why do you think builders have more lawsuits today than even OB/GYN's?)If you want to build your own home for the personal satisfaction and for the control of your project then I would encourage you to do so.However,if you believe you will save 20+% in doing so, you are in for a suprise. Most custom builders work on a margin of 7-18%. Consequently, at best, therein lies your savings---unless you plan on doing a lot of the labor yourself (and have the expertise to do it). However, thinking logically, the custom builder has both experience and established relationships with the trades for many years. He knows which subcontractor has EARNED a good reputation. When you attempt discover who is best, you are starting out at a distinct disadvantage. Even if you do discover a trade with a good reputation, that person is analyzing YOU---\\"am I going to get repeat business, is this person's inexperience and lack of knowledge with other trades going to disrupt my schedule, etc.\\" You can well imagine that your price will be substantially higher and your control over the subcontractor will be substantially lower. The end result is that often, you assume the risk of the builder, do the work of the builder, have little recourse if something goes wrong, and can actually spend MORE for the priviledge of it!The author does a good job of explaining the building process. However, in an attempt to cover everything, he simplifies to excess. In addition, some statements are downright misleading. As an example, the front cover states that you can \\"get your plans drawn for free\\". I found nowhere in the book to explain how that is done. Your own \\"kitchen table\\" drawn plans will not suffice. Unless you are in a rare part of the country with no governing juristiction, Code officials usually require certifications from an architect, engineer, truss manufacturer, etc., that demonstrate that the structure will perform to code.If you are going to build a home soon, read the book. It will give you a good overview of the building process. Also read books that focus on the concept of \\"building science\\". Most are geared to a particular climate, so you need to choose one that matches your area (suggest books by Joseph Lstiburek).Then, armed with a good working knowledge of the building process, interview some custom homebuilders and get estimates from them. If you then are still convinced that you want to experience the trials and tribulations of being your own general contractor, you WILL be prepared for the experience!"},{"Title":"Build Your Dream Home for Less","review":"I lost the first copy after reading the entire book and I have bought it again. This is an excellent book for those who want a book that lists by chapter, everything you need to build your own home. This book is for you if you have a basic knowledge of construction techniques and need a book that doesnt try to go so in depth that it just wastes space. I have read 2 other books and they were filled with useless info. The author gives personal accounts of errors he has made while building, and how to avoid them. The book is straight forward and concise. I highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Build Your Dream Home for Less","review":"Very good advice throughout from an experienced builder, written in a relaxed and straightforward way.

I'm a woman and have generally left \\"trade\\" stuff to my husband, but as he is working FT and I'm not, I'll be largely managing the project and I wanted to do a lot of homework. Woodson seems very knowledgeable and shares the information in an easy to follow format. He also explains many trade terms (certain types of joints, wiring etc.) that other books assume you already know - nice for us non-handy folks. One thing that this book could use is an update to include newer construction items such as insulated concrete forms, geo-thermal energy systems, and radiant floor heating. Also beware that Woodson, like all the other authors I've read on this subject, has his opinions on certain things (like you don't need air conditioning in Maine - it doesn't get hot often, but boy does it get humid and AC is really helpful). Take the opinions with a big grain of salt and read other books/articles to cross check things that you aren't sure about...however this book was a good foundation. Would recommend."},{"Title":"Build Your Dream Home for Less","review":"This book has lots of practical suggestions about ways to save money, gives a concise run-down of different types of materials and methods, and information on sub-contracting the project yourself. I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 only because if you already know a decent amount about building, you probably know a lot of the recommendations. I wish he could have provided some sources for buying materials where professional builders go as well as lesser known tips and secrets.

He never gives the kind of detail you need to really begin thinking about all that must be considered when launching into a huge project like building your own house. At points, he says in essence \\"I could spend pages talking about this subject, but I won't.\\" Okay, then where is the reader supposed to get all the stuff the author couldn't be bothered to include?Again, I'm not saying this book has no value.

There are other books available that will be of better value."},{"Title":"Build Your Dream Home for Less","review":"I recommend this book; but I encourage you to read more. Learn more before you buy your first vacant lot. I believe the most problem you will encounter will be dealing with the RED TAPE. Getting your plans approved, getting your permits, inspections, zoning, community board, etc. These should all be researched before buying the lot and the plans should be purchased after the lot is purchased. You don't want to buy the blueprints and then buy a lot that will not support or allow for the house.I have to say that the comments left by \\"JC\\" entilted \\"flawed but helpful\\" above seems to be made by a person who has a G.E.D education level. Any intelligent and educated person will find that building a modest house is not that difficult at all. And it can be done within a few days to a few weeks. This is even proved by shows like the extreme home makeover or \\"Habitat for Humanity\\" (a non-profit organization that creates homes for the homeless). The World record in building a home was 3 hours. Testing the soil is done by an engineer. Leveling the soil and creating the footings and forms is not difficult at all. Your plumber would then come in and insert the water and sewer lines. Pouring the concrete and utilizing the floats, helicopter and implementing a technic to avoid cracks in the concrete can be done by the concrete contractor as part of the bid. Your electrician and insert the wiring after. Those contractors can be held legally liable for any negligence. Framing is simple. A moron can do it. Just pay attention to the local codes and utilize Pythagoras' theorem to get your right angles to ensure creating the correcting frame lines. You can also get rid of the stick framing method and utilize Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs). This will allow you to finish framing, sheathing and insulating your house in 2 to 3 days depending on the size. All the doors and windows are already created in the panels that follow your blueprints. There are companies that will set up your entire SIPs house shell for about $14.50 sq ft, which includes the doors and windows and you just insert the rest (e.g. sinks, toilets, floors, drywall, electricity, plumbing, etc). For $14,500, you can get a 1,000 ft SIPs shell house. It will be one of the greatest and rewarding experience of your life.So as for JC's 30 years of contracting experience and his feedback above, he seems to be behind the times and out of touch. Old ways and old thinking. And if he thinks building a house is similar to quantum physics, well, that just tells you how deficient his own brain is. In fact, JC is so out of touch that he doesn't even realize that you can get FREE house plans on the Internet. Especially from those non-profit organizations that are promoting GREEN HOUSES. I think it is time for JC to retire and allow the younger and smarter builders to take over. People like JC just annoy me because it is so obvious that they are not very intelligent people and they interject their negativity on everyone just so they can earn a buck from them. I mean if everyone built their own house, no one would need JC.Keep learning about house building and you'll see for yourself that you can do it yourself. This is guaranteed. Research how many couples have built their own house and how rewarding it was. And if you are smart enough, you can do it better."},{"Title":"Build Your Dream Home for Less","review":"I love this book, I'm on my second time around reading it.

My favorites are probably the written quotes, such as \\"Washington is the William Tell of the United States\\" and \\"Well, how do you like the year 1941?\\"The carvings date from 1898 to the 1940s to the late-1960s. Even when the book was published in 1970, the author said that many of the trees photographed therein had been torn down for no great reason, so this book really captured something fleeting, something special.I'd say this is already one of my favorite New Mexicana titles, for sure, and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the state, in unique folk art, shepherd culture, or historic inscriptions. The accompanying text is clean and readable, though not too heavily researched, and the whole book is a treat. It's just beautiful, and worth every bit of whatever you might have to pay for it to get a copy of your own.NOTE: I'm currently researching an article on this book (to pitch to a regional magazine), and I'd like to track down any surviving carvings from the ones shown in the book. If anyone knows anything about their specific locations, the book's author, or this subject in general, I would love to hear from you.

Those who are aware of today's best practices in eBusiness will find the book a little too simple to be helpful.For an existing business, electronically connecting together its various activities and stakeholders is a big, tough, and frustrating task. On the other hand, it's work that has to be done in order to survive. eBusiness is not a choice, it's a key foundation of tomorrow. This book helps clarify many misconceptions about eBusiness and provides many helpful case histories that will extend and expand your perceptions. The book's main weakness is that it does too little in how to adjust business models to reflect opportunities beyond what eBusiness offers. For that reason, many readers may too narrowly focus their attention on eBusiness.Review: Thomas Siebel is the chairman and CEO of Siebel Systems, a business applications software company that helps enable eBusiness. The firm is the fastest growing software company of its age in history. The company's experiences with aiding customers form the baseline for this helpful book.First, Mr. Siebel points out that an eBusiness is more than eCommerce. An eBusiness allows a company to &quot;record, measure, update, and analyze (in real time) large amounts of finely detailed, customer-specific information.&quot; You can also &quot;coordinate and personalize all interactions with customers, prospects, and partners . . . .&quot; You &quot;program 'intelligence' into any customer-facing process and optimize those processes.&quot; You &quot;practice intimate, one-to-one, relationship-based marketing, sales, and service.&quot; You also &quot;execute an optimized, integrated relationship and intelligence-based . . . system of multichannel marketing, sales and service.&quot; Think of this as taking the superb service and flexibility of a handcraftsman and using systems to allow a large enterprise to have the same capabilities. As you can see, the writing in the book is a little overladen with business and software terminology.Mr. Siebel proposes 8 key principles for an eBusiness, and details these with examples in the book:(1) &quot;Know your customer&quot; (a segmented approach to the market) and IBM is the example;(2) &quot;Use multiple channels to interactive customers&quot;(3) &quot;Personalize the customer experience&quot;(4) &quot;Optimize the value of every customer&quot;(5) &quot;Focus on 100 percent customer satisfaction&quot; and Marriott International is the example.(6) &quot;Develop and maintain a global, customer-centric eBusiness relationship&quot; and Honeywell International is the example.(7) &quot;Leverage and extend the ecosystem&quot; and Chase Manhattan is the example.(8) &quot;Cultivate an organizational culture based on eBusiness excellence and innovation&quot; and Dow Chemical is the example.Quick &amp; Reilly is used as an example of how to make the converstion to an eBusiness combining all of these principles.The book's key point is that in &quot;the not-too-distant future there will be no distinction between business and eBusiness.&quot; I agree.Readers will find the case histories to be the most interesting and valuable part of the book. Much of the material in these case histories was new to me, and I read lots of books and articles on this subject.After you have finished absorbing these visions of the emerging new best practices for making life better for customers, be sure to also think about your other stakeholders such as partners, employees, suppliers, shareholders, lenders, and the communities you serve. How can they be helped by eBusiness, as well?Make more helpful connections among all stakeholders!"},{"Title":"Taking Care of eBusiness","review":"A truly authoritative book that explains real ebusiness:1. eBusiness is not adding a \\".dot com\\" and a \\"shopping cart\\" to your business.2. eBusiness is not about improving or streamlining business processes3. eBusiness is all about customer and how to keep them happy.4. eBusiness is about the infinite possibilities that the businesses have in front of them to serve the customers in a true way ( beyond the lip service ) and reap rich rewards in terms of customer loyalty.I do not want to dwell into some of the fine examples in the book ( like the $2 billion saved by IBM) but his message is concise and clear.Readers should find the examples interesting.However I have a valid comment about the book .Tom Siebel is a very respected figure in the CRM ( Customer Relationship Management) and eBusiness world. He is a legend and Icon representing the later day IT leaders.Tom Siebel's reputation in the 90s is similar to those of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in the 80s.Atleast in the book Tom should have kept above his company and competitors as he expresses his views.However unfortunately he uses Siebel's product lines to explain his point at the slightest opportunity he gets. All the examples in the book are using well known Siebel customers.A 'subtle' sales pitch for his product line all along the book.Siebel corporations major weakness of getting into the small customers is bcoz of the fear of the small firms that \\"Siebel is a nice product - but is too expensive and we can not afford it\\" ( Siebel's midget competition has several times knocked of the Goliath using this sales pitch)Tom could have used the examples of successful small firms that has reaped the benefits of eBusiness and Siebel product line.He has reinforced his views that Siebel is primely for the large corporations.Still Tom Siebel succeeds to get his message across to the readers with the same pitch as Siebel\\" Getting the right message to the right customers at the right time\\".

Author Thomas Siebel, CEO and founder of Siebel Systems, extols the values of \\"eBusiness\\" (his coinage, apparently), which just happens to be his company's specialty. But at least Siebel Systems - unlike a lot of dot-com companies - has thrived and remained profitable. Siebel contends (arguably based on enlightened self-interest) that companies must either employ new eBusiness tactics or perish. Using profit reports and return-on-investment studies as back-up material, he makes a pretty compelling customer-first argument that we [...] recommend to anyone who's interested in the future of business."},{"Title":"Taking Care of eBusiness","review":"It seemed like he kept saying the same thing over and over again, badly written and outdated.

First, Tom Siebel is the # 1 player in the CRM revolution, which is overturning how business gets done.

Third, the case studies in this book are amazing and will help you to understand the range of possibilities available to your organization."},{"Title":"Folding Paper Masks","review":"A friendly style, simple designs and accessible materials required make this an excellent book for rainy day fun with a 4 to 12 year old. This would provide several hours of fun for a room full of either boys or girls at a sleep-over - with minimum mess and minimum cleanup.Even if you or your child has no idea who Shari Lewis or Lambchop are (Lambchop makes no appearance in this book) the large clear photos of a very young Shari modeling each mask are cute and friendly. There are also large clear illustrations detailing how to make each mask.Although the book does not seperate the masks into recommended age-groups they flow from the easiest ones at the front to ones in the back that might hold a preteen's attention for an hour or so. There is also a chapter on adding finishing touches so that your child can really personalize their artwork."},{"Title":"Folding Paper Masks","review":"This is a very dated book."},{"Title":"Purgatory: Illustrated by the lives and legends of the saints","review":"This book was originally published in 1893. Father Schouppe presents an interesting collection of short legendary accounts of purgatory. Schouppe points out that his purpose is not an academic presentation or an argument. Instead he has written an understandable and entertaining volume that assumes the existence of purgatory, and can be read easily by anyone. The stories contained in it deal with the questions of the location, purpose, pains, and duration of purgatory. And it deals with how living people can relieve the souls suffering in purgatory, and how to avoid purgatory.For non-catholics, it would be helpful to keep a dictionary with Roman Catholic terms nearby when reading this. But while reading this book, I kept remembering John 19:30 when Jesus said \\"it is finished\\", and Hebrews 1:3 \\"Who ... when he [i.e.,Jesus] had by himself purged [i.e., made purgation for] our sins, sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high;\\" KJV"},{"Title":"Putting Meat on the American Table: Taste, Technology, Transformation","review":"American wasn't born a meat-eating nation: it evolved from colonial to modern times and was as much influenced by technological developments and processing and production advancements as by consumer tastes or meat availability. PUTTING MEAT ON THE AMERICAN TABLE: TASTE, TECHNOLOGY, TRANSFORMATION is a lively study which will also earn a place on the college bookshelf for its scholarly side in examining how new technologies have advanced American meat. Using consumption surveys, chapters provide lively insights into evolving American eating habits.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Putting Meat on the American Table: Taste, Technology, Transformation","review":"Great chapter on chicken. Horowitz tells the story of chicken's transformation from one of several types of poultry into a \\"meat\\" worthy of competing for American dinner table and lunch time space with beef and pork. By the early 1960's, the chicken war was making modest gains. Thanks to hybridization, the chicken was meatier, tastier, and cheaper. And through new processing protocols, (such as removing heads, feet, and entrails), it had become more attractive and convenient in grocery stores. Yet market researchers kept encountering a certain malaise as they surveyed consumers about why chicken remained in third place. They called this new disorder \\"chicken fatigue.\\" You see, in the 1960s, chicken -- even the new, better, bigger chicken -- was always ... chicken. In 1962, more than 90% of chickens were sold whole: too much for a couple, marketers learned, but not enough for a large family. Pork and beef, on the other hand, came in many cuts as well as pre-cooked forms (bologna, dogs, pork rinds).Chicken got into first place thanks to the processing strategies of Tyson (who brought us nuggets) and the branding strategies of Perdue (who revolutionized cut up and boned chickens, processed, dated, and priced right in the plant). \\"Product differentiation\\" broke the monotony, and chicken became king on American menus.The book is both lively and learned. A great read for anyone interested in the social history and technology of food."},{"Title":"Walt Whitman (Lives & Legacies (Oxford))","review":"This year, 2005, marks the 150th anniversary of the first publication of Walt Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass\\", the most influential work of poetry yet written in the United States. The event has been appropriately marked by new editions of Whitman, new studies, and by many conferences and celebrations to explore Whitman's legacy.But the most fitting way to celebrate Whitman is to read or to reread him. David Reynolds's short biography, \\"Walt Whitman\\" (2005) breaks no new ground about its subject. Instead, in 154 pages it introduces the reader to the main facts of Whitman's life and to the many themes that appear in his poetry and prose works. It is a good introduction for those readers wishing some background before beginning a study of Whitman. David Reynolds is Distinguished Professor of English and American Studies at Baruch College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. This book is largely a distillation of Professor Reynolds's longer study \\"Walt Whitman's America: A Cultural Biography\\" (1995).Walt Whitman (1819-1892) had little formal education. He held a variety of jobs as a newspaper editor and writer before publishing his masterpiece, the first edition of \\"Leaves of Grass\\" in 1855. This work set forth a vision of a United States based upon pluralism, egalitarianism, a kind of secularized and ecumenical mysticism, and acceptance of one's sexuality that many readers, myself included, still find deeply inspiring. Whitman largely fulfilled the goal he set himself of setting forth the ideals of the United States in poetic form. The free verse he developed in \\"Leaves of Grass\\" changed dramatically the structure and technique of subsequent poetry.Professor Reynolds's study opens with a brief chapter on Whitman's life. The remaining six chapters of the book discuss themes and influences important to Whitman and to the understanding of his work. Professor Reynolds offers vivid but brief pictures of the New York City of Whitman's day, of Whitman's interest in oratory, the theater, and music, both popular and classical. Professor Reynolds describes Whitman's interest in the new medium of photography and in art. There is a discussion of Whitman's religious and philosophical views and of his dream of a secular, ecumenical, yet personal faith. We see Whitman's interests in phrenology, spiritualism, and, later in life, in the religions of the East. There is a chapter on Whitman's attitudes towards sexuality -- a subject much explored which receives only a limited treatment here -- and a chapter on Whitman's reverence for Lincoln and on his services during the Civil War as a nurse. The themes of each chapter are illustrated with appropriate short quotations from Whitman's prose and poetry.I think Whitman's importance lies in his poetic expression of the democratic ideal, his commitment to nonsectarian religion, and to his recognition of the force of sexuality in human life which, interestingly, Whitman thought formed one of the bases of democracy. The Nobel-Prize winning author J.M. Coetzee has recently written that \\"the most attractive feature of Whitman's dreamed-of United States is that it does not demand of its citizens the sublimation of eros in the interest of the state.\\" (New York Review, September 22, 2005, p. 22) Reynolds's book will introduce the reader to these aspects of Whitman's work.Reynolds's book will have served its purpose if in encourages readers to visit or revisit Whitman. For those readers wanting to do so, I recommend the outstanding edition of Whitman's poetry and major prose works in the Library of America series.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Walt Whitman (Lives & Legacies (Oxford))","review":"Picking up David S. Reynolds' WALT WHITMAN armed with almost total ignorance of the poet, I was satisfied in finishing that I had gained a good grounding in Whitman's life, times, and work. The first chapter, a brief biography, lays the foundation for those that follow on Whitman's art and his response to, among other things, war, sex, and science. Annoyingly there are four typographical errors within its 138 pages of text, but WALT WHITMAN nevertheless succeeds marvelously in providing scholarly content to the generalist in a crisp, well-organized style."},{"Title":"On Call","review":"This is the second book that I have read by Anita Burgh, the first being \\"Breeders\\" - and although about different topics they are both very similar in style.\\"On Call\\" focuses around the nurse Chrissy Galloway, coming to terms with life as a widow and just moving back to her hometown Fellcar to take up a new nursing position.

Having never read any of the extensive Rumpole series, I figured this collection of six stories would be a good place to test the waters. What I found was a series of predictable tales, populated by thin characters that offer little variety in their foibles from story to story. And while you could make the same case for P.G. Wodehouse's creations, the difference is that he had the Midas touch when it came to language and wit, whereas Mortimer's prose is generally uninspired. After a while, the curmudgeonly grumblings of Rumpole get rather old, as does the sharp tongue of his wife (She Who Must Be Obeyed), the pathetic philandering Erskine Brown, and the doddering foolishness of Uncle Tom. While the cut and thrust of the courtroom scenes do impart a sense of vigor and wit to the proceedings, they are the only bright lights in what are otherwise remarkably dull and predictable stories.

Read the reviews for that book."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Informative book, would recommend it to anyone who is serious about wanting to invest.

Wish I had bought this a year earlier. Turns out I was trading in the dark. When I shouldn't be trading at all. With this book, I started investing. Now I'm much more confident about my portfolio. Even during the recent downturn, I stand behind my picks because I chose them for the right reasons."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"This was a great purchase for the last 13 chapters, which explain current trends in each sector of the market. The beginning contains a good overview of value investing, but I found that the valuation techniques were not explained thoroughly enough to actually use (the growth and discount rates are sort of pulled from thin air, and these are important). So - it's good for beginners, and it carries the Morningstar name, but you'll later need to move on to more quantitative discussions of valuation."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I have just recently entered into the world of investing, and this book has really helped me to have a much better understanding of what I'm doing. At first, I was more or less just picking companies (hey, I like this one, etc). Dorsey's book was very helpful and informative. It gives you a ton of suggestions on how to evaluate a company, and it guides you through the some of the hard-to-read financial reports.Before reading this book, I read Phil Town's Rule #1 book, and a lot of the basic principles are the same, but Dorsey's book actually explains the concepts to you. I cannot recommend Town's book.I would heartily recommend that everyone read this book before they begin investing. You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"This was a solid introduction to value investing. I especially appreciate that it takes the time to break out the nuances of different industries and how this impacts your investments. The approach outlined makes a lot of sense -- very logical. It makes me wonder why anyone would do it any other way.After losing money too frequently on poor investments in otherwise good companies, I decided that there had to be a better method to investing than what I had been following (which was my own ad-hoc approach). I purchased a handful of books on value investing and I would say that this was the best and most thorough of the group. Using the principles layed out in this book, I can tell exactly what I was doing wrong and have already seen an improvement in the investments I choose. Despite a market that is significantly down, I'm holding steady and now have a much more confidence that when the market picks up, I will be in the right place."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"This book gives everything you need about fundamental analysis, including how to see in detail company business.

If you practice the value calculation twice you will get it how to do it for life. Putting it in excel just makes things far easier."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I had a bit of a tough time going through certain parts of this book, partly because I'm just not the kind of person that can pick apart financial statements. But it does help you go through them [financial statements] and learn what they mean, and how cash flows through a company. If you can understand what they are trying to tell you; you are WAY ahead of your average investor, even the smart ones.Most importantly, they teach you about \\"economic moats\\". These are the strengths of the company that keep competition at bay for a long period of time, allowing the company to continue to grow for years (and thus, the stock price and dividends as well). It also goes through the businesses represented in the stock market, sector by sector, to tell you how to analyze a particular stock from each sector and its good and bad characteristics.A little tough, and certain parts require some math, but even if you don't \\"get it\\" all 100%, you're still way ahead of your average investor, as I said. You definitely come out of this book with more knowledge about companies and mistakes made by average investors than you knew before you turned the first page.My only wish is that some of its more acute parts didn't go over my head quite so high...and that is why I give it 4 instead of 5 stars. Otherwise, a FANTASTIC book. Definitely pick it up and don't be afraid of not understanding all of it: you'll at least absorb something out of it that will get you ahead."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Excellent book!

It's too easy to lose yourself without a plan. This book provides a few rules that everybody should be paying attention to when they decide to invest money into a business.I personally enjoyed seeing how they put a valuation toward a business to detect a fair value. Knowing when to sell is one of the more difficult tasks of investing. It's simply too easy to fool yourself into thinking that you should hold on a little longer.

Another good buy :)"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Now, you can't breeze through this book like you would \\"One Up on Wall Street,\\" but that's because this book covers a lot of accounting and financial concepts involved with companies. It's sort of a textbook on how to find good companies using various different financial metrics. Dorsey definitely knows his stuff, but in order to learn what he's teaching you, you've gotta pay rapt attention throughout the entire book and have pen in hand to highlight everything. I'm an engineer by profession, so I'm accustomed to working with math, etc., but getting into the accounting and financial terminology for most of 350 pages can be exhausting. The back half of the book is downright revolutionary in that it explores the different investment sectors (e.g. health care, retail, consumer products) and tells you how to analyze companies within those sectors.It might seem obvious that one should generally be wary of restaurant stocks because, hey, you eat at the Outback all the time and you see it's crowded all the time, so you should by the stock, right? Maybe. Dorsey explains it to you and you say, \\"Yeah, that makes sense.\\" Any schlub can whistle on down, rent some space and start cooking meals for people. That's why the restaurant business is highly competitive, 'cause it's easy for competition to sprout up.You should definitely have a copy of this book if you're a serious investor, but don't think you're just gonna kick back on the beach and read it (unless, of course, you're not really serious about an education in investing)."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"The book, \\"Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing,\\" is an outstanding read.It covers ALL aspects of choosing equity investments (though stocks are the focus). Best of all, it takes a fairly complex subject and breaks it into digestible chunks. For example, the author goes through the process of reading financial statements (annual report and 10k), showing where the money appears and disappears without requiring a bachelor degree in accounting.Digestible chapters simple means that there is one idea which is developed for each section and not so much detail that it becomes a textbook exercise. (One does not lose the point of the discussion.)It is illustrated with examples of well known companies, with an explanation of why the best answer is not always the obvious answer.Finally, it is written in a style that is thoroughly readable."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I really really like this book and keep going back to it. Mr. Dorsey has a knack for presenting what could be very confusing obtuse financial information and definitions into concise and simple manner without dumbing down the reader. The book has some simple rules that could be incorporated into a stock picking stategy. Combined with other books from william O'Neill and Peter Lynch, it just adds to what goes into picking a great stock. Isn't it wonderful that most of the information is available free on the net? I don't invest in stock recommendation services for the simple fact that I want to learn how to pick good stocks for myself without having to fall back on the crutch of someone else's opinion, cuz that's basically all it is, an opinion."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I have been looking for someone to help me better understand how to fundamentally analyze a stock.

THANKS"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"This is a rather readable book abounds with good tips for amateur (or even professional) investors. It tells you which industries to put your money and which not, e.g. Energy is a luscious industry but not Power Generation and why; it tells you why a bank is preferred to an insurance company, and why larger banks are preferred to smaller ones...etc. It also pinpoints the bottleneck of various popular industries and draws our attention to where usually the pitfalls are as far as the management and their financial reports are concerned. It is most insightful in its rather up-to-date discriptions of the nitty gritties of some popular industries.However, this book doesn't touch upon asset allocation things like how bonds, commodities and cash could help your investment in stocks. There is little, if at all, on any derivatives. It is not meant to be a replacement of Warren Buffet or Soros or Peter Lynch's wisdom, still less the fundamentals of Grantham. In particular, note that with the change of a single element in investment environment (& there are huge differences between Asia or Bric and US!!!), and then the choice of stocks should or could be the other way round, and if one chooses to follow the advice of this book to its letters, it might prove to be very costly."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"\\"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing\\" is a guide to value investing by Morningstar's Director of Stock Analysis Pat Dorsey and the folks at Morningstar, Inc. The book's goal is to educate investors in how to \\"find wonderful businesses and purchase them at reasonable prices.\\" Its title is a little misleading in that the \\"Five Rules\\" are a small part of this book. The five principles to which the title refers are: 1. Do your homework, 2. Find companies with strong competitive advantages (or economic moats), 3. Have a margin of safety, 4. Hold for the long term, 5. Know when to sell. Those are vague principles, but most of this book is dedicated to telling you just what homework you need to do and exactly how to do it. Pat Dorsey and Morningstar are advocates of long-term investing who are skeptical of trading and portfolio churning, so this book's intended audience is value investors. No technical analysis here. This is all fundamental analysis, but traders may find the advice on analyzing company finances useful as well.\\"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing\\" has 2 parts: Chapters 1-12 are a \\"how-to\\" for analyzing companies, their finances, and determining what their stock should be worth. Key points include how to evaluate a company's competitive advantages, what to look for in financial statements, analyzing a company's management, spotting financial chicanery, and how to determine a company's intrinsic value. This is all fairly complex, and there is math involved, but the book takes you through the process, with examples, explaining why and how every step of the way. Chapters 13-26 provide overviews of 13 industries, from banks to software to industrial materials, including information on what the industries do, how they make money, hallmarks of successful companies, and risks to look out for. Each of these chapters concludes with an \\"Investor's Checklist\\" for that sector to help you identify key factors when choosing a stock. \\"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing\\" is among the best books I've seen for learning how to pick apart financial statements, and it packs a great deal of advice on evaluating companies within their sectors into one concise and readable volume. Highly recommended to value investors."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I retired at 51 on my investments and have spent much of my time trying to counterbalance the instant-gratification claims of so many of those selling seminars and &quot;help&quot; to the investor.While few people would be so foolish as to pay $40,000 for a Honda Civic despite that car's solid engineering, many will buy a stock with no concept of what its fair-market value may be. Of this number, some are subscribers to the Greater Fool School of investing. They'll happily overpay for a popular stock in the arrogant belief that they'll be able to unload it for a profit to some Greater Fool. Sometimes, they will indeed make a profit. (At other times, they'll make an excuse.) This book is not for them.The rest overpay not because they subscribe to the Greater Fool school but because they simply have no idea of how to value a stock. THAT is where this book shines. It will make the investor more conscious of what a stock is worth -- thereby avoiding the payment of $40,000 for a Honda or (in some cases) the payment of $100,000 for a Yugo!Will the identification of value stocks and the discipline of not overpaying for a stock guarantee a profit? On any given purchase, of course not. However, it is a fool's task to argue that conscious investing based upon some sense of a company's true value will not reward more of its practitioners than Greater Fool speculations will over time.If you're a serious investor with at least the discipline and patience than you demand of your own children, following this book's counsel should help you to make more money with greater safety. It's more accessible than The Intelligent Investor and a must read both for the novice and for the experienced investor who would like to pick up some distinctions that will improve his or her performance."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Have been meaning to put in a good word for this book for a long time. It's a gem. I've read an embarrassingly large number of introductions to investing in equities and this is probably the best. Other books purport to tell you how to identify hot stocks; Dorsey shows how to value companies. This isn't just a matter of understanding PE ratios and other traditional metrics, which most books explain more or less adequately. Instead, it means analyzing balance sheets and cash flow and income statements. _Five Rules_ provides as reader-friendly an introduction to assessing a company's financial statements as I've come across, with plenty of real-world examples. The object in the end is to determine the present value of a company's future cash flows, and Dorsey's explanation of a simplified version of Fisher's and William's discounted cash flow model is lucid and lively. Clorox is the company evaluated in this chapter, and en route there are instructive comparisons of HP and Dell, Best Buy and Circuit City, and, finally, AMD and Biomet. Chapter 8, Avoiding Financial Fakery, is particularly helpful. Obviously, having read this book and nothing else, you're not going to be able to spot something fishy in the footnotes to Microsoft's income statement that has escaped the attention of all the analysts. But for someone without a background in accounting, _Five Rules_ is a godsend.Dorsey then conducts a very informative tour d'horizon of 13 industries. It should go without saying that before you invest in a company, you'd want to find out something about the economics of its industry, so you can compare apples with apples. The chapter on health care is especially good, but I found them all excellent.In an Ameritrade ad that aired this week, a teenager asks her dad for $80 for a pair of jeans. The dad is nonplused, but the girl assures him that everyone is buying these jeans. He asks her who the manufacturer is, promptly logs onto Ameritrade, checks a chart, and buys the company's stock. The guy then gives his daughter the $80, a reward for the hot tip, presumably. He might do OK this time, but you have to figure he'd be a lot better off in the long run investing a fraction of that $80 in _Five Rules_.Bottom line: there are a ton of books on trading strategies, but if you're looking for a practical book on value investing, this is the best."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"There are many books on financial statement analysis, and I've bought most of them...being a liberal arts major who is working toward an MBA in Finance, I've found mastering ratios and concepts related to reading company annual reports frustrating and challeging: my brain seemed not to be wired to be competent in this subject matter. However, I find Pat Dorsey's treatment effective in that he uses the concepts in a less intimidating context than other books might, without watering down the content. Can someone read this book and decipher GE's annual statement to the last footnote? Not hardly. It is often said that it's knowing the essential 20% of a subject that is responsible for 80% of one's success, and this book fills this role in understanding that 20%. Further, the chapters breaking out how to modify analyis of different sectors and industries in the market is also helpful to avoid comparing apples to oranges when evaluating stocks and companies. Beyond this book, the next step up from this would be &quot;Analysis for Financial Management&quot; by Higgins."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"The best investing principles, as clearly reiterated here, are stable and evergreen.

This conveniently organized book offers several chapters of general relevance to investors in all markets and industries, including an industry-by-industry examination of the determinants of value.

One section takes a step-by-step analysis of each sector of the market: typical breakdown of the businesses, trends & comparables, and what to look for in the sector. This book is dense with relevant information!My only critism is that the book is out of date I.e. written in 2004. The reason it is an issue is because the analysis of financials, technology, and housing have a pre-resession vibe that is disconnected with current views on the sectors.

Overall, i am a believer of fundamental analysis (FA) and the author should be in the same camp too. There are quite a few books on value investing. yet, this book offers the most transparent explanation on value investing, especially the chapter on valuation of stocks. In my belief, the DCF, though quite old-fashioned, is still the starting point for any valuation analysis. the author was able to demonstrate the concept in a concise and convincing way. He offered not only the rationale, methodology but also two examples to demonstrate how to calculate the intrinsic value.

The chapters in the back of the book are great in terms of breaking down each industry and giving a quick overview of what to look for in each of these sectors.

Dorsey gives the \\"morningstar\\" method of evaluating stocks, which emphasizes safety through choosing stocks with a wide \\"economic moat,\\" cash flow and income to survive worst case scenario. In fact, one of his rules for investing is to envision the worst case scenario for each stock. The method he outlines here is extremely rigorous and time-consuming. I don't see how anyone could take the time to evaluate each stock in a 10-20 stock portfolio using his method unless you didn't do anything else, i.e, unless you're a professional investor. That said, he does give lots of good points and cautions. The section on evaluating a company's financial statement is very thorough and detailed. Also valuable is an in-depth chapter on the ins and outs of all the major and minor market sectors, banks, technology, energy, health, and etc."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"It is absurd how good this book is.Sadly, it's also overlooked by many and doesn't seem to get the \\"shelf space\\" it deserves. I guess in a way that's good --the more knowledgeable the masses become, the harder it is for us folk to capture and exploit pricing inefficiencies in the market (greater fool theory).Anyways, back to the book: It is pure genius -- insightful and easy to read.Dorsey is a CFA who knows stocks like the back of his hand.The best part about this book is when Dorsey goes off and breaks each sector down to its most important metrics for study.For those just beginning to dabble in the market, I can't think of a better introduction -- in fact, if this is your first book on stocks, consider yourself way ahead of the the crowd, who is probably off somewhere reading Suze Orman, buying expensive mutual funds that lag the S&P;, and drinking 5$ latte when they should be buying SBUX and betting on rapid expansion abroad."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"It is one of the best book that I read, refered to stock investemnt. The fundamental analysis are very clear, and he explain how to read well all the statement of the corporate.The sector analysis that Pat Dorsey made, is very interesting and is a great contribution for the book."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"When I think of Morningstar I picture something similar to Moody's or Standard & Poor's, a correct, slow and slightly bureaucratic organization. This book gives a totally different insight. It takes a clear stance for the Warren Buffett \\"buy wonderful businesses at reasonable prices\\"-type of value investing (as opposed to the \\"Graham low multiple, cigar butt\\"-type). It's clear that the author Pat Dorsey, Director of Stock Analysis for Morningstar, but also Joe Mansueto the founder of the same firm, are great admirers of Mr Buffett.If you choose this type of franchise investment you also per necessity have to focus your research effort on finding that wonderful business and securing that it stays that way. This is what Dorsey tries to do through this book's five rules. In short they are:1. Do your homework - engage in the fundamental bottom-up analysis that has been the hallmark of most successful investors, but that has been less profitable the last few risk-on-risk-off-years.2. Find economic moats - unravel the sustainable competitive advantages that hinder competitors to catch up and force a reversal to the mean of the wonderful business.3. Have a margin of safety - to have the discipline to only buy the great company if its stock sells for less than its estimated worth.4. Hold for the long haul - minimize trading costs and taxes and instead have the money to compound over time. And yet...5. Know when to sell - if you have made a mistake in the estimation of value (and there is no margin of safety), if fundamentals deteriorates so that value is less than you estimated (no margins of safety), the stock rises above its intrinsic value (no margin of safety) or you have found a stock with a larger margin of safety.After stating the rules Dorsey goes on to present a number of chapters to complement them. Topics like commonly made mistakes, descriptions of various types of economic moats, financial expressions, accounting, analysing companies and their management, how to avoid financial tricksters and valuation. I like the chapter on moats and there are a number of nuggets like \\"the bottom line about financial health is that when a company increases its debt, it increases its fixed cost as a percentage of total costs.\\" That's why high financial and operational gearing combined with volatile sales is such a potential corporate killer.Yet this is only half of the book. The second half is a one after another review of the economic characteristics of various corporate sectors. As this book is written about 10 years ago it's interesting to see which sectors that have changed the most during these years. Care to guess? Financials - naturally - but also media. Ten years ago we hadn't started to understand the effect that digitalization and Internet would come to have.It's really hard to grade this book. It gives a sound, comprehensive and logically consistent investment strategy. But, this is a book for the retail investor. It will take the novel investor a long way, but as the book is so comprehensive the coverage of each topic is quite shallow. If you have some investment experience you will learn very little.A practice where you buy undervalued stocks that you can own long term will serve the right person well if you got the stomach to stand the short term movement of markets. Above all this book reinforces the importance of being able to articulate ones investment strategy. If not, it's very easy to get frustrated when the markets move against you, this will make you move outside your core competence and will unavoidably lead to trouble. This book gets you started.This is a review by eqtbooks.com"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Dorsey is one of the people behind the Morningstar system for evaluating mutual funds, stocks and electronically traded funds - the system that has made Morningstar one of the most respected names in investing.Dorsey presents the nitty-gritty of investing in this book. Most of the book is very understandable, and is the perfect book for anyone wanting to learn how to invest effectively in the stock market. There is probably no better general introduction to investing on the market.The only difficulty is the material from chapters 3 - 6, where Dorsey explains the math and concepts behind all of the letters you see when you look at market information (like P/E Ratio, P/S Ratio, ROI, ROE, etc.). It can be a bit intimidating, but (a) you can read the book and skip these chapters with no problem, and (b) it is worth the effort to at least look at the math, since Dorsey tells you what figures are helpful, what figures are not, what figures are very important in evaluating an investment, and what figures are misleading.Before you invest $10 in the market, spend the money on this book. Your portfolio will love you for it."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Well written in clear layman's terms. For a more complete help in putting together a strategy for investing would recommend a book on value investing and techinical analysis."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"If you know very little about investing and financial statements, you might get more out of this book. However, a large portion of it is dedicated to summarizing and explaining the financial statements. If you know this information already you will skip a large portion of this book. On top of this the style and flow of the book make for a rather boring read.Also, this book is promoting the specific investing philosophy of the author, which essentially is a buy and hold strategy. Attempts are made throughout the book to discourage most other types of strategies, so if you believe in a different strategy and do not want to be preached to this is not the book for you.The most helpful information comes at the end of the book with a little more detail about specific industries and what to look for when investing in those industries, although some of the information is obsolete. Other than this section of the book you will find yourself skipping over much of the content if you have any kind of knowledge about investing. To summarize, if you are new to investing, this book might be able to help you to a certain extent, but if you are an experienced investor there are much better and less boring books out there."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I just purchased the Kindle edition.

I was even more appalled that Amazon allows &quot;non-review&quot; book reviews to be submitted!! Evidently, \`amodeus1791 from New York City' is a terribly un-read, unsophiticated, myopic, arrogant person who is abundantly ignorant of history also. Clearly, \`amodeus1791 from New York City' is the epitome of an example for that insightful maxim &quot;Living is easy with eyes closed - it's understanding all you see.&quot;So-called amateurs have made incredible contributions to knowledge in a variety of technologies and sciences in the ecourse of human history. And so-called amateurs have also made incredible millions in the stock market too. It is precisely the discerning amateur eye that has broken ill-fated innummerable mindsets throughout history time and time again. Why? Simply because so-called 'amateurs' aren't afflicted with myopic blinders - or blindfolds as in the case of 'amodeus1791 from New York City'. (You also have to question whether or not a respected research company such as Morningstar would really publish a true &amp; pure 'amateur' on such a subject?)My first recommendation is that all Amazon readers trash ignorant garbage that is spewed off so indiscriminately like that from \`amodeus1791 from New York City'. I also recommend that Amazon refuse to allow &quot;non-review&quot; book reviews to be published on Amazon!!Actually, if you are looking for a variety of perspectives on a very complicated subject that is part science, part gambling, part intuition, and part art - then this book is as good as any other &quot;random walk&quot; before graduating on to the Benjamin Grahams and John Murphys of the world. It is well written, well researched, well organized, and well thought out -- unlike \`amodeus1791 from New York City'.And for that matter - don't place any faith in my review either -just read the book if you are a semi-serious student of the subject. Because if you are a semi-serious student of the subject you'll want a variety of input - and you'll know how to make up your own mind as to what market perspectives suit your style of investing.And by reading the book - you'll know infinitely more about it than \`amodeus1791 from New York City' does!"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"This book shows you how to calculate the value of a stock like Morningstar it also tells you the percents that Morningstar uses when they calculate the fair value on a stock and what price to buy a stock at. If you like figuring this stuff out yourself BUY THIS BOOK, I haven't found any other book that gives this information yet."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I was quite eager to read Dorsey's book on analyzing stocks. Since this was the guy who founded the well known website Morningstar.com I thought he would know a great deal on analyzing companies. I wasn't disappointed while reading his book.The first chapters of the book were not really useful for readers already familiar with fundamental analysis. Further in the book he tells how to valuate companies on well known ratio's such as P/E, P/B, P/S, and were you have to be careful about for each company. Later on he starts on explaining the ROA, with a very helpful distinction between Sales turnover en Net Margin (for the real fans: he uses the Dupont formula to make this split). Then we get some examples on how to interpret this ROA over a certain number of years, before he makes the link to ROE and how to interpret that.There is also a full chapter on how to calculate the price we should pay for a stock, based on a the present value of the expected free cash flows in the future. This might be helpful for some investors, and academics also like to put a lot of value to these FCF models, but I'm not that big a fan of them. These calculations assume you can make estimations for the next 10 years, and more dangerously you have to make an estimation of each growth and discount rate. The final present value you get by this calculation is very sensitive to mistakes you make in the parameters. I prefer to use the approach presented in Graham his classic book: The Intelligent Investor. He offers a simpler more robust approach (imo).Also helpful was the chapter on analyzing a companies management. Although most value investors agree the management of a company is of huge importance for the future of the company, you don't find a lot of information in most of the financial literature. Dorsey gives us here a full chapter and how to do this in a practical way.The real meat of the book still comes after this information, though. He gives a full overview of the most known stock industries (especially the one on banks was useful for me with the low prices bank stocks are selling at these days). These chapters are concluded with Checklists for each investor to make sure the stock were analyzing has good fundamentals. Really nice, these checklists.In short: recommended!"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Pat Dorsey brings you up to speed with sensible, concrete guidance to picking stocks. The investment style he presents is, of course, the sensible and research-driven version of value investing that Morningstar uses. While the book is easy to read, it is also packed with information. Even after the first read, you will find yourself going back to it as a handy reference. Strongly recommended for all but the most experienced investors."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"I hope the second printing corrected some of the many errors that found their way into the original. I'm referring to incorrect numbers, for the most part. For example, p. 150 Step 3 for Clorox shows \\"perpetuity value = (412.8 X 1.03) / (.09 - .03) = $16,777.61.\\" Way off. The 412.8 should be 977.3. There are many such errors. I'm afraid the beginning researcher/investor will become frustrated at not being able to replicate the analyses. Take all calculations with a grain of salt.However, for $12 or $17 it's hard to beat. Dorsey goes through the discounted cash flow approach to analyzing a company and valuing a stock step by step. Very clear. Once the errors are fixed it could be a great book. I know how it is rushing a book to the printer before it's ready and I don't want to be too harsh. Even eliminating all practical examples it's still a good read."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Don't just read this book and let it languish on your library shelf. STUDY this book carefully, and keep it with you for reference.Chapter 5, \\"Financial Statements Explained\\" is in my opinion, the most important part of the book. As an investor, understanding what the Cash Flow Statement and Balance Sheet is telling you is the only way to understand what's really going on in the company.Did you know that the Accounts Receivable entry can tip you off that the company may be in trouble? The Balance Sheet can tell you if anything is tying up the companies cash flow and reducing earnings.You can't discover this essential information any other way than by reading the financial statements and understanding them. Pat Dorsey, the author, is a master at explaining these important concepts without talking down to the reader. You probably won't take everything in on the first pass through the book. It will require some time and work on your part to really understand what Dorsey is saying, but then when has anything worthwhile in life come without effort?If you can buy only one book on investing this year, buy this one. If only it had been available when I first started investing."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"This is well written in conversational style language which makes it is easy to get through, yet, at the same time it is extremely detailed. The author has a fun sense of humor too. Many great ideas about what to look for in determining the financial health and value of a company - and how some of these rules change depending on the industry it is in. I took a lot of notes and I consult them often. I love the system they use to determine what a stock should be selling at, before you even look at the stock price. This is what Buffet does too. The book is bloody fantastic! What's also great is many of the things you would normally have to find by searching in the 10k back when this book was written, you can now just do with screeners!"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"As a beginner in the investment world, I recommend this book to accounting majors and of course to beginning investors.

This book can lay the foundation before graduating on to The Intelligent Investor."},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"The book is very well written and researched - great for the someone just starting to learn about investing: Dorsey begins with a Hotdog Stand business. You will learn everything you need to understand each financial statement. As an example, plant & equipment would be your Cart, and the $100.00 borrowed to start the business is your long term debt. Too basic? Well, then turn to chapter 6. If you think ROE is net income/shareholders equity, then you will learn it actually has three components. Same with ROA. Wide Moats, it's all here. And the Author has the credentials to boot!"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"Before reading this book, I had spent most of my time reading about day trading, swing trading, technical analysis, etc. I dreaded having to do actual research on a company. Why spend hours poring over financial statements and researching management when you can look at a chart and get all the information you need? Who cares how the company makes its money? It just got out of a triple bottom formation! Alas, the continuous chart monitoring finally got the best of me, not to mention I lost most of the money I started with. During this dark time, I found Pat Dorsey's book and everything magically fell into place. I discovered that it wasn't such a chore to learn about the company you were investing in. It was actually quite practical.\\"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing\\" provides a great foundation of knowledge for analyzing companies. It's also perfect for beginners as each topic is broken down and easy to understand. Pat Dorsey does an especially great job of explaining financial statements.

And now I am actually making money!"},{"Title":"The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing: Morningstar's Guide to Building Wealth and Winning in the Market","review":"This book covers everything you really need to know about investing.

Ms. Fowler has translated these poems with philogical assistance from Fox. The result is a very readable translation - enjoyable on it's own. However, I found myself going back to Fox for the background to truly understand some of the poems - the cultural chasm and the passage of time eroded the meaning of the poems to me.However, the translations are lightly footnoted with required information e.g. that Menqet is the goddess of beer or that a word is added for meter. While I prefer translations that stand on their own, this is a good choice for an introduction to a little known poetry that had significant impact on our culture indirectly via the Song of Songs"},{"Title":"Love Lyrics of Ancient Egypt","review":"Literature on the subject of love is minute compared to the vast amount of writings we have from this lost civilization. It's interesting to note that these poems were by young lovers. In Egypt this translates to the VERY youthful (early teens). The poems, though, are obviously written by a mature and artistic hand; a literate hand, since writing was a high-status occupation known only to an elite class. This makes their content even more intriguing from a human perspective.The allusions to anatomy, \\"When you bring IT to your sister's house & storm her cave, her gate will be raised...(to) slaughter it,\\" may seem a little naughty but shows some of the limitations of the hieroglyphic script and how scribes made the best of it. Today's reader will find it amusing and, perhaps, enlightening. After millenia we still want to keep our youthful thoughts alive, just as the ancients did.The Harris 500, Turin and Chester Beatty I, New Kingdom hieratic papyri texts are an eye-opener. This little book is a fast read for the young at heart. A few black & white images spot the pages nicely. A great little glimpse into the minds of ancient Egyptians and their ideas about living life."},{"Title":"The Nile Tributaries Of Abyssinia And The Sword Hunters Of The Hamran Arabs","review":"You've got to like the sometimes tedious, journal-style approach of early explorers, or at least be willing to put up with it, to appreciate this book. However, it holds some remarkable writing, insight and yes adventure. Baker was a contemporary of Richard Burton, John Henning Speke, Henry Morton Stanley and David Livingstone, all famous for their searches for the source of the Nile River in Africa. If you know anything about this time in history and about Africa itself, then you know that Africa was almost always fatal. Few who went into the interior returned, and those who did usually paid with their health. Not a pretty picture. Into this scene walks Samuel Baker, a wealthy, larger than life British aristocrat with a passion for exploration and excitement.Baker was a man who tackled rather than simply lived life. A fine linguist, writer, artist and sportsman who hunted with a knife because it was too easy to kill with a gun, he was also extremely practical with a &quot;let's get on with it&quot; attitude towards his travels. Nothing but determined, he presses forward when others would have said, &quot;enough.&quot; Are you surprised that he succeeds where others have failed? I wasn't.What I like about Baker's writing is that he knows how to tell a story. He is as interested in the people as he is in the facts of what happened. It also helps that Baker himself edited this book, picking and choosing the entries from his longer journal. If Baker is pompous and full of his own superiority at times, he can be forgiven. All in all this is a good read. It helps, however to have read his first book &quot;The Albert N'yanza Great Basic of the Nile&quot; first."},{"Title":"The Nile Tributaries Of Abyssinia And The Sword Hunters Of The Hamran Arabs","review":"I like to read about exploring and hunting in Africa, authors like Ruark, Capstick, & Hemingway. The reason I hunted down this book is because Hemingway said it was the best book he ever read about Africa. I figured he would know.I enjoyed this book immensely. Baker describes his explorations, hunting expeditions, and encounters with the natives in experiences that now can only be dreamed about. He talks about his extensive hunting trips with the Hamram Arabs, who hunted elephants with swords from horseback. He tells about traveling hundreds of miles on the backs of camels, and about rescuing one pack camel that had fallen off the side of a cliff by wrapping ropes around it and lowering it to the bottom of the canyon. Even much of the day to day camp life is very interesting, as the party had to provide for all of their needs for themselves.It is worth noting, that apparently modern readers must be somewhat put off by a supposed tone of superiority. One reviewer indicates this way, and in the version I have, the publisher actually attempts a vague apology on the back of the book. I didn't notice anything in Sir Samuel Baker's tone, but if someone can read this book and not conclude from the narrative that Baker actually is superior to the vast majority of mortals, they must have a better imagination than I do.One of the most interesting aspects of Baker's explorations is that he had his wife, Lady Florence, with him the entire time. One of my favorite stories is about a night when he was awakened by a gentle tug on his sleeve, which was always his wife's signal that something was wrong. Without rolling over he reached under his cot and got his rifle first, and then his wife indicated that a hyena had just stuck it's head in the door of the tent. He waited a few minutes, and when the hyena took another look, he dispatched it there in the tent in the middle of the night.If you like to read about Africa, or about exploration, hunting, or high adventure, I think you will enjoy this book very much."},{"Title":"The Nile Tributaries Of Abyssinia And The Sword Hunters Of The Hamran Arabs","review":"This book makes fascinating reading for anyone interested in 19th century Africa. Above all, it gives a clear insight into how Africa and, in particular, the Nile was viewed by European adventurers and hunters at the time. Samuel Baker was a very able writer and his fluid style and keen eye for scientific detail make this book a pleasure to read. Perhaps the only negative aspect of the book is that it goes into too much detail on Baker's hunting expeditions and the modern reader may find some of these episodes quite savage and cruel. Apart from that, it is a book which is well worth reading and which gives the reader a much better understanding of how life really was in these remote areas in the late 19th century."},{"Title":"The Nile Tributaries Of Abyssinia And The Sword Hunters Of The Hamran Arabs","review":"There was a time when men of honor travelled the world in search of new and exciting adventures. Strength of character, intestinal fortitude and raw courage abound in this wonderful recount of actual events. It is hard to imagine in our \\"modern world\\" how difficult and dangerous the adventures retold in this amazing book must have been to actually achieve. This is not Hollywood or a video game. These events actually transpired as written by a man of unquestionable strength.Although his writing style can be a bit dry at times the reader is transported to a world which no longer exists. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Africa, hunting, exploration, etc. There are few men of any generation whose accomplishments can be compared with those of Samuel White Baker.For those who enjoy this book I highly recommend, Man-Eaters of India, by Jim Corbett. Another fine example of courage and honor under the most difficult of circumstances."},{"Title":"Halloween Other Festivals: Death And Life","review":"This book remains one of my all-time favorite books on folk holidays. A series of essays on various fall and harvest celebrations, it centers around Halloween, but branches out to discuss celebrations from Christmas mummers parades of the Ulster Scots and cutting the last sheaf of wheat, to Bonfire night in Newfoundland, to modern day trick-or-treat scare myths.Beyond merely recounting the history of Halloween, this book does a wonderful job of placing our holiday in a global context and discussing what societal need these holidays or myths fulfilled. A fascinating study of our human history, I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in folk history and the &quot;meaning&quot; of holidays.In a similar vein, I also recommend, Halloween : An American Holiday, an American History by Lesley Pratt Bannatyne for a more detailed look of the holiday as it unfolded in the US."},{"Title":"Halloween Other Festivals: Death And Life","review":"Halloween and Other Festivals of Death and Life is a scholarly anthology of articles related to Halloween in various ways. The book is divided into three sections: Customs, Communities, and Material Culture. Each article assumes some knowledge, taking an in depth look at topics ranging from the history of Trick-or-Treating to the non-seasonal use of Halloween imagery in Southern settings. Some articles focus not on Halloween, but on related festivals such as Bonfire Night and the Texan acculturation of the Mexican holiday Day of the Dead.Each article reflects the author's own style making some more readable than others. However, the diversity of approaches and the variety of perspectives makes this a fascinating read. While the introduction attempts to bring these articles together in a coherent fashion, there is very little tying them together besides the direct or indirect relationship to Halloween. The book can be read cover-to-cover or piece-by-piece.I would not recommend this book for those looking for a history of or introduction to Halloween, but rather to those who have some knowledge of the festival and are looking for scholarly commentary. Nonetheless, the casually interested may find some parts quite enjoyable and Halloween lovers will really appreciate the various views offered."},{"Title":"Halloween Other Festivals: Death And Life","review":"This book is full of fascinating cultural references on Halloween and other celebrations associated with death. It is illustrated with some amazing artwork (like the front cover) and the details given on the celebration is beyond compare.My one complaint is that with all the references and citing it is a tough read. You need to work at it to get through it, but it is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"Halloween Other Festivals: Death And Life","review":"I've always had something of a fascination with Halloween, it's an unusual holiday to say the least. There is nothing intrinsically pleasant about death, evil and the supernatural, which this holiday surrounds us with images of. It's the only American holiday where masked strangers can show up uninvited to your home and demand some form of appeasement, usually in the form of candy. What are the origins of this phenomenon and the significance of Halloween's contemporary manifestation? These are the questions this work seeks to answer. I was glad that I took the trouble to read this, I felt that it gave me a much better understanding of this holiday.This book assembles thirteen essays by various scholars and experts in culture, folklore and history, including an introductory essay by Santino. These essays cover such topics as Halloween's origins in ancient pagan harvest rituals such as the Celtic Samhain; its current manifestation in the British Isles and the related festivals that accompany it, such as Guy Fawkes day in England; its popular manifestation in American culture, with its related rituals and myths; other related customs such as the Mexican Day of the Dead and Bonfire Night in Newfoundland; the Greenwich Village Halloween parade; the history of Halloween noisemakers; and Halloween imagery in non-standard settings, such as in graveyard displays and year-round house decorations.The essays cover quite a bit of ground and teaches you much about Halloween's history, and about how it and other related festivals are celebrated. This book casts a wide net; although there is little interconnection between the articles besides the common topic, they provide the reader with a good view of \\"what's there.\\" The essays don't provide much of a philosophical analysis of this holiday, but it provides a good source of data to base one upon.It appears that Halloween is like a vestigial organ that has taken on new functions. It has some of its roots in ancient pagan harvest rituals, which sought to appease the supernatural forces over which it was believed the fate of men depended. Bad harvests meant death, starvation and misery for countless of our ancestors, so the connotations of Halloween's imagery and its relation to this season aren't difficult to fathom. Most people no longer believe that supernatural forces control nature, but the images of the harvest season and of death and the supernatural survive. Although most of us enjoy a greater separation from the forces of nature than our predecessors, it is nonetheless important to be reminded of the significance of this season. Halloween and other related festivals act as a form of catharsis: we sometimes need to confront our fears in order to deal with them. They turn some our worst fears - death, misery and fear of the \\"unknown and unknowable\\" - into playthings that we seek to control by taking on their forms."},{"Title":"Halloween Other Festivals: Death And Life","review":"I enjoyed all of the collected essays. Small-town, U.S. America's holiday traditions and the celebrations and conflicts attendant are probed."},{"Title":"True Face of Jack the Ripper","review":"This is yet another of the many books claiming to identify J the R. This one focuses on a wierd person named Stephenson or D'Onston, his first name changes from Robert to Rosslyn. The case seems to be based on hearsay, and the subject's own ego. He repeatedly wrote giving his theories to the media and police, and really anyone who would listen. The theory is largely unsubstantiated and the author does little to make us believe in his theories. He just says that all the others are wrong and he's right. Great ego, less great book."},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"Okay, I got it! Michelle was a bad lady, full of deceitful and murderous thoughts. She's the kind of lady we all love to hate. Good true crime story. But, reading this book is a lot like spending all day with my aunt Helen in Queens. I kept waiting for the author to write something creative to help move the story along, but it never happened. Bore, bore, bore! I just finished reading a similar story about another lady who conspired to murder her husband with her boyfriend (Dale Hudson's Dance of Death) and it was like riding a roller coaster. I couldn't put Hudson's book down. But with Fleeman's book, I couldn't wait to put it down. I assure you I won't be telling my friends about this book. Hey, I'm a generous guy, but two stars is all you'll get from me on this one."},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"While well written and very detailed, this book is one more story of how a lonely wife gets her boyfriend to kill her husband. What is really interesting about this book is to watch Michelle, the wife of Marty Theer and mistress of John Diamond, who sports a psychologist license, behave in a frenzied, stupid manor following the death of husband by trying to control everyone and everything from the investigation to the boyfriend's ex-wife.Overall a good read for true crime lovers. Unfortunately, the author seems to have jumped the gun a bit by publishing the book before the John Diamond's appeals are complete so readers will have to follow up online for that information."},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"This story could have been an interesting read but it wasn't. It was like a story boringly told by a narrator. Terrible read. It was not like a true story book at all. The intrigue,suspense and mystery were missing. I felt like I was reading a bunch of articles clumped together. It was very boring,I had to skip many pages at a time to get through the book it was terribly boring. Very Disappointed."},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I would never want to make light of someone's murder and the pain their family suffered. But, having said that, I have to wonder if this story really warranted a book.Unfortunately, it's a too common tale of a spouse (in this case a moderately attractive wife and psychologist in desperate need of a facial waxing) gets her military boyfriend to murder her military husband for his life insurance.The story is certainly more interesting than the writing would indicate. The writer really drags out each bit of (sometimes) minor and seemingly unimportant information.If you like a good true crime read there are much better ones out there. If you are looking to pass the time without wasting too much brain power this one works."},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"The story itself is intriguing - I bought it mainly because I wanted something not too challenging to read at the time and was somewhat interested in the topic. Whatever interest got me through the first few chapters quickly waned, largely due to the author's complete lack of writing skills. Randomly jumping around from one part of the story to the next within chapters, without adequately leading the reader with a \\"red thread\\", it takes time, effort and patience to read this book from cover to cover. My advice: get the cliff notes (in other words, read a review or talk to someone who's read it - you'll get a better overview than the hodge-podge mess the author makes of this story!!)."},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"I honestly don't think there are as many matrimonal murders where a spouse kills the other that needs a book. In fact, I'm getting bored with them in general. Captain Frank Martin \\"Marty\\" Theer was a victim of his wife's boredom and desperation for an escape with her new boyfriend and fellow military man, John Diamond. The book is decent enough and I can read it quickly. It's not that difficult in reading the material. After her husband's murder, his wife and psychologist with a doctorate, Michelle Forcier Theer, unravels as a woman bent out of control because she has lost control of her own destiny and life. There are many women like her out there but they don't murder their husbands or persuade their boyfriends or even girlfriends to take action. I am surprised to learn that adultery is illegal in the military. Michelle Theer is a sad case because she was educated and could have left the marriage on her own accord and be alright. Her actions speak volumes especially after she becomes a suspect in her own murder. Didn't she do the research that the spouse is always suspected immediately? I guess the book speaks for itself."},{"Title":"The Officer's Wife (St. Martin's True Crime Library)","review":"This book could have been written better- too much like a newspaper article.

Liungman's explanations of their origin and uses. Browsing the pages is rewarding for the artist looking for inspiration. There is plenty of it -- the book contains some 1,600 articles, and an additional 100 pages with essays on ubiquitous/especially interesting signs or sign systems (such as the Mystical Pentagram, or the signs of the Alchemists).The explanations are usually to the point, although I find that Liungman occasionally strays too far away from the subject at hand. The sections about the astrological systems of signs are particularly abundant in information, and would have gained from being more carefully edited. The selection of signs, however, is excellent; it even includes modern ideograms from the Internet age, such as the At sign.Symbols -- Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms really excels when it comes to searching for signs that the reader does not yet know the name of. Using a taxonomy scheme of his own, Liungman has classified the signs into 54 distinctive groups. The reader can navigate to any of the groups simply by describing the sign in terms of \\"Crossing lines/Not crossing lines\\", \\"Single-axis symmetric/Asymmetric\\" and so on. A quick glance at the right group overview page is all it takes to find the right match.This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Symbols -- Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms","review":"I was inbetween 3 and 4 on this.

The Russian authorities delay the news and, when they say anything at all, first want to blame an unspecified American sub for causing the demise of the Kursk. Cooler minds and a more open Russian press prevail, and the truth leaks out. A thorough, impressive work, \\"Cry\\" represents an excellent piece of investigative journalism, pushing aside the misguided \\"collision\\" theories and illustrating the demise of the Russian military.Although long-time enemies of the Russians, American, Norwegian or British rescue craft and experts volunteered to try and could have perhaps saved lives after a low-quality, high-risk torpedo exploded inside the Kursk's hull during a training mission. But it was not to be. Old habits die slowly and the stubborn, proud, resentful Russians would rather be dead than helped. The result was even greater embarrassment, in addition to the sad deaths of the crew that survived the initial blast.No one in the Russian naval, or political hierarchy comes off well in this story. The harsh truth is that Russia tried to maintain a world-class military appearence using dated and rusty methods, including unserviced supply cranes for loading torpedoes and a torpedo that -- although an $11,000 \\"bargain\\" when compared with America's million-dollar torpedoes -- was more likely to destroy its launch ship. And that is just what happened.The real pity must go out to the patriotic, well-intentioned yet poorly trained and equipped sailors of a decaying naval power. And not only the determined sailors, their parents, wives, brothers and sisters, and children all deserve our prayers and our sympathy.Ramsey Flynn jumped on the story early and had to deal with tremendous obstacles of technology, geography, politics, culture and language to piece together a true multi-cultural experience and a story that speaks for the tenuous nature of Russian-American relations today. He did a fine job. Maps, details, notes, photos and extensive notes document all the sordid details.Let's hope we learned something from out mistakes, for the sake of our children and the memories of these heroic victims of a corrupt, disingenuous system."},{"Title":"Cry from the Deep: The Submarine Disaster That Riveted the World and Put the New Russia to the Ultimate Test","review":"Submarine disasters usually happen like the rest of the things about subs, alone, silent and deadly. Of the 52 boats lost during WWII, some are still unaccounted for, just not yet returned from patrol. With the Kursk, we know what happened. Experimental hydrogen peroxide powered torpedoes exploded inside the boat. (Strangely enough it appears that the American submarine Scorpion sank in 1968 because of a fire in their torpedos.)The main part of this book, however, is not on what happened to the Kursk. It is on what happened afterward. The coverups by the Russian military and Government. The less than stellar performance of the American and British navies in delaying the offer of help.This part of the book is extensively researched. It's tragic, but unfortunately the way of the world. People don't want to tell their managers bad news.I've got to add that at least one wit has come up with another answer, it was Microsoft Windows XP. See: peter-marina.com/kursk.html"},{"Title":"Cry from the Deep: The Submarine Disaster That Riveted the World and Put the New Russia to the Ultimate Test","review":"As I suspect many people can, I recall learning of the downed Russian submarine, the Kursk, in August 2000, and following the efforts of the Russians to recover any survivors from the wreck, as well as the tragic discovery after a week that none of the crew remained alive. Ramsey Flynn's account of the disaster, coupled with an analysis of the responses to the disaster by both the Russian and American governments, makes for a gripping tale that at once informs and saddens the reader.The sadness is natural regardless of what the book might say, for the story of the Kursk is the story of the deaths of 118 sailors in the icy waters of the Barents Sea. The story is made far sadder, however, by the revelations provided by Flynn. At the same time, the depth and breadth of information the book provides the reader is a great value in understanding not only the particulars of this specific disaster, but just how risky military service remains even in peace time in the 21st century.Flynn's prose may not be soaring, but it is quite sufficient to the story, and I found myself almost unable to put the book down as I followed the twists and turns of the story. The failures of the Russian navy and the Russian government to react promptly and effectively to the disaster are chilling reminders of how Russian history taints its ability to make a true transition to a free society. And the actions taken by the American government as they learned of the disaster, while understandable, provide a harsh lesson in the calculus of international relations. It's quite likely that, no matter what the U.S. government had done in response to the disaster, the results would have been the same. But if there was a chance for the doomed sailors of the Kursk, the actions of both the Russian and American governments helped to ensure that chance faded quickly.My one complaint with the book is that, for all its information, the book never appears to answer one vital question: for how long were the sailors of the Kursk still alive in the crippled submarine? Flynn clearly wants to place some of the blame for the lost sailors on the slow reactions of foreign governments to the disaster (although that reaction was in large part predicated on the failure of the Russian government to tell the world what had happened), but without knowing how long the sailors remained alive, it is impossible to know if an immediate response on the part of the west might have made a difference. It's likely that nobody actually knows precisely how long the sailors survived after the explosions that crippled the sub, but spelling that out a bit more clearly would have helped immensely in interpreting the meaning of various delays.Flynn's decision to tie the Kursk disaster to the larger question of precisely where Russia appears to be heading in the 21st century is a good one, and it adds some good relevancy to the work. (Although I am of the opinion that simply telling the story of the disaster would provide an adequately gripping tale.) The future of Russia remains very much up in the air, as their transition to democracy appears to have stalled in large part thanks to cultural conditions in Russia very different than those western audiences may take for granted. Flynn rightly leaves those questions to be answered in the future, but the signs he has identified through his work are discouraging at best."},{"Title":"Cry from the Deep: The Submarine Disaster That Riveted the World and Put the New Russia to the Ultimate Test","review":"Ramsey Flynn has performed a heroic task in researching the disaster that befell the Russian submarine Kursk. The Russians, clearly, are still not entirely forthcoming about all the events that led to the explosion of a torpedo inside the sub and the horrifying efforts of the Russian navy to first ignore the disaster, then its inadequate rescue efforts and the final attempts to blame the disaster on other nations.Flynn explains every important element of the disaster in considerable detail --- and that is unfortunate because Flynn's writing is a bit pedestrian. While Flynn never leaves the reader wanting for information, he sometimes becomes boring.Ultimately \\"Cry From The Deep\\" is readable and highly informative. You may just find yourself having to approach this book a bit at a time, lest Flynn's writing style cause to you to lose focus.Jerry"},{"Title":"Tim Bavington","review":"This book proves to be a superb survey of one of the more interesting emerging talents on the West Coast. Tim Bavington uses both traditional and unconventional devices to compose sprayed stripe paintings. Sources have ranged from the Ancient Greeks, 13th C. and Renaissance Italian mathematicians, musical notation and theories of color harmony, to the binary bar codes used to identify virtually every product in society today.This book mostly focuses on his paintings of the musical variety. They are hypnotic paeans in paint to artists and music of the past several decades. Composed after sampled sequences of music - mostly guitar solos. Titling his paintings after famous and obscure songs alike, Bavington transposes sheet music into paint by assigning each note a particular color. Each paintings' palette is produced by combination of the 12 hue color wheel and the 12 tone scale. The bandwidth of the painting's stripes, in turn, is determined by the length of each note within the sequence.With the use a computer Bavington has lately been creating text and language based stripe paintings from bar codes. Text is translated into barcode which can be revealed by scanning with an appropriate device. However, when enlarged in scale and sprayed onto canvas the code becomes illegible to both computer and human eyes.A prot?g? of art critic Dave Hickey, who wrote the catalog essay, Bavington was included in his important Ultralounge exhibition of new, young painters in 2000 - where I became aware of the work. Hickey writes, \\"Tim Bavington arrived in Las Vegas from Shepherd's Bush in London (via Art Center in Pasadena) and he remains now what he was then, the thinking man's Mod - the progeny of Quadrophenia and Bridget Riley's great paintings from the Sixties.\\"Bavington proves that it is not a sin in these times to make smart, beautiful, and enaging abstract painting. Great book. Fantastic work."},{"Title":"Focus or Failure: America at the Crossroads, Where Are You?","review":"This book is not loaded with facts.

Each writing tool is presented in a brief chapter that explains the strategy, offers examples, and ends with practice exercises. Clark reminds us that these are tools, not rules. We should work with a few of them at a time to improve our written work and our writing process. The 50 tools are grouped into four sections.In \\"Nuts and Bolts,\\" Clark covers writing basics. There are no tedious specifications for comma placement or hyphenation. Instead there are effective techniques for using language \\"at the word, sentence and paragraph levels.\\" These ten tools include \\"Establish a pattern, then give it a twist,\\" which shows how repetition can set the reader's expectations. And how occasionally breaking the pattern highlights information and maintains interest. Another chapter, \\"Cut big, then small\\" discusses the painful task of revising by removing. Snip and cry, but snip.\\"Part Two: Special Effects\\" demonstrates techniques of \\"economy, clarity, originality, and persuasion.\\" The thirteen tips in this section include \\"Set the pace with sentence length\\" which shows how to influence the psychological \\"speed\\" at which a reader moves through text. \\"Get the name of the dog\\" emphasizes collecting concrete details as we do research. They allow us to move down the ladder of abstraction and bring life to descriptive writing.In Part Three: Blueprints,\\" Clark advocates organizing our writing process as well as our documents. Two of the best tools among these sixteen show how to encourage--and manage --readers' progress. \\"To generate suspense, use internal cliffhangers\\" and whet the reading appetite with not-yet-complete information. \\"Place gold coins along the path\\" reminds to provide points of enjoyment and closure to satisfy readers. And reduce the tension created by all of those cliffhangers.\\"Part Four: Useful Habits\\" closes the book with eleven long-term strategies for working writers. \\"Limit self-criticism in early drafts--then turn it loose during revision\\" balances creativity and critique. It is consistent with the two-part writing process described at length in Peter Elbow'sWriting With Power. \\"Recruit your own support group\\" goes beyond standard advice about seeking feedback. Clark encourages writers to understand their own writing blind spots and needs for others' expertise. Then target helpers with matching knowledge and skills.It does not surprise when a book from an experienced writer is well-written and entertaining--as this one is. It should not surprise that the advice is useful and can improve our writing if we follow it. This is a very good book and is highly recommended. It deserves a place on your bookshelf next to Strunk and White'sThe Elements of Style, William Zinsser'sOn Writing Well, Susan Bell'sThe Artful Edit, and Mark Kramer and Wendy Call'sTelling True Stories.Feed your shelf."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"This will go on my shelf right next to Strunk & White's Elements of Style and Zinsser's On Writing Well.

I love the idea of these tips as tools in a toolbox rather than rules to follow."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"Roy Peter Clark invites aspiring writers \\"to imagine the act of writing less as a special talent and more as a purposeful craft.\\" In his \\"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer,\\" Clark urges the reader to \\"think of writing as carpentry, and consider this book your toolbox.\\" The goal is to take away the fright and nausea that accompanies writer's block, and to make every writer more proficient at expressing himself.Clark divides his book into four sections: \\"Nuts and Bolts,\\" \\"Special Effects,\\" \\"Blueprints,\\" and \\"Useful Habits.\\" Within these divisions, the author clearly and concisely presents his tools; he also includes excerpts from the works of outstanding writers to illustrate each point. For instance, Tool 22 is \\"Climb up and down the ladder of abstraction.\\" The writer should know when to use concrete examples and when to reach for \\"higher meaning.\\" Avoid the treacherous middle rungs of the ladder where \\"bureaucracy and technocracy lurk,\\" and where euphemisms and meaningless phrases abound. Clark cites Updike and a baseball writer named Thomas Boswell to show the reader how it's done. Tool 38 exhorts us to \\"Prefer archetypes to stereotypes.\\" We should beware of heavy-handed symbols and strive for subtlety. Although it is tempting to fall back on familiar phrases and well-worn ideas, a writer should aspire to cultivate his own distinctive voice. To get his message across, Clark cites a passage from James Joyce's tale \\"The Dead.\\" Each tool is followed by a \\"workshop,\\" with several practice exercises.Some of the tools mentioned in this book are far from unique--most writing handbooks encourage us to make every word count and vary sentence length--but there are a few noteworthy tips that stand out. For example, Clark discusses how to \\"establish a pattern, then give it a twist,\\" and how to \\"mix narrative modes\\" using the broken line technique. A clever writer knows when to move his lens back to broaden his perspective and when to zoom in for a close-up on his subject.There is no shortage of excellent books on the art of writing. Along with \\"On Writing Well,\\" by William Zinsser, and Strunk and White's \\"The Elements of Style,\\" I recommend \\"Spunk and Bite,\\" by Arthur Plotnik, \\"How Not to Write,\\" by Wiliam Safire, and \\"A Dash of Style,\\" by Noah Lukeman. All of these guides, as well as Roy Peter Clark's \\"Writing Tools,\\" take some of the mystery out of writing and make it a craft accessible to all."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"Maybe the best way for me to describe Roy Clark's Writing Tools 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer is to use the following analogy: I can bake good brownies. Not the world's best brownies, but they get the job done - brownie-wise, that is. I'd like to make better brownies, but I'm not sure what I should do differently. Better cocoa? Smaller pan? More butter? I never know what to change, so I just keep making the same mediocre brownies. The same applies to my writing. I know it could be better - I just can't figure out how to change it.Enter Mr. Clark's wise and wonderful book, Writing Tools 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer, and suddenly I've got a myriad of new ideas! Clark gives struggling and aspiring writers a neatly organized \\"toolbox\\" full of models, practices, examples, and \\"what-not-to-dos.\\" Conveniently arranged into four sections, each portion of the book addresses different spheres of writing. The first, \\"Nuts and Bolts\\" concentrates on the building blocks of writing - the words, sentences and paragraphs. I found there to be an arithmetic quality to this first section, almost as if Clark was imparting the equations and theorems of good writing.Toolbox number two, \\"Special Effects,\\" delves into the less concrete world of how we use language. He identifies it as \\"tools of economy, clarity, originality and persuasion.\\" In this section he explores all of the tools, or devices a writer can use to help the writer shape his or her authentic voice.\\"Blueprints,\\" the title of the third toolbox discusses the structure of stories and reports. If a writer intends to take his readers on a path of discovery, enlightenment and wonder then the writer must be able to construct a trail that is enticing, engaging and well-lit. The tools of this third section discuss different kinds of narratives, foreshadowing and the dreaded \\"outline.\\"The final section, \\"Useful Habits\\" is generous and supportive therapy for the would-be writer. With sage and gentle advice, Clarke reassures us that we are not alone in our bad habits, urges us to learn from our critics and challenges us to \\"own the tools of our craft.\\"A special note: Don't miss either the afterword or the dedication.

Clark gives writers a fully stocked shed of clear, concise tips, strategies and guidelines to instantly help improve anyone's writing.The material contained in the 250-page book is timeless. It can be used in the moment to help refresh a current work. Or, it can be perused for concepts to try and exploit in future work, to give authors refreshing ideas on how to write more effectively.The book is organized into four parts: Nuts and Bolts, Special Effects, Blueprints, and Useful Habits. Nuts and Bolts are low-level tools to improve word choice, sentence structure, paragraph layout and editing strategies. The part on Special Effects contains tips on how to use language for imaging, pacing and emphasis, to list a few of the tools.Blueprints moves to higher ground detailing how to plan a work, how to write dialog, and how to generate suspense like Dan Brown. The final part, Useful Habits, gives some ideas for project motivation and execution, to help writers get their art from brain to paper.Clark did not develop all of these tools, and he admits that right up front. He uses dozens of references to give readers a sense that some tools are weathered advice, like lectures offered by a sage. But what he does well is put a good spin on the lectures. Anecdotes are provided alongside examples of the tools, and a humor is injected to help keep the book entertaining.The end of the book is reminiscent of a textbook, in a good way. It has a detailed index to help readers locate topics of interest, and it has a handy five-page summary of the different tools. It's too bad the summary didn't come as a pullout poster, because many writers would surely tack it on the wall above their monitors.Armchair Interviews: Another good book to help writers be better writers."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"This book delivers.

That was a very refreshing approach, where how-to books are concerned.I have an Ivy League Ph.D. and so often suffer under the delusion that I don't need anyone to tell me how to write effectively, thank you. But I decided to apply the steps here to one of my short stories from a couple of years ago. I began whittling away at it with this book at my side, and was astonished at how much tighter and clearer my prose became -- and therefore, more expressive.The section on passive voice, for example, demonstrates well the author's philosophy. He doesn't argue, as so many authors of these how-to books do, that the passive voice means poor writing. Rather, he says you should use the passive voice where it makes sense, e.g., where something is happening to a character that the character has no control over, if you want to emphasize that lack of control. \\"He was beaten and tortured.\\" Yes, you could write \\"They beat and tortured him,\\" to make it an active sentence, but it also has a different tone. If the character doesn't know who's beating and torturing him, for example, the passive voice adds to the sense of mystery.An excellent book of tools. Even if you decide not to apply them to your writing, this book will make you think about how your prose communicates.My two favorite tools (see below): \\"Fear not the long sentence\\" and \\"Climb up and down the ladder of abstraction\\" -- worth the price of the book alone."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"You may be writing a newspaper story or an essay for school.

Wrong!!! You are imaginative and know basic grammar so get writing. How to allow yourself to be imaginative is a whole different subject. Look at my Random short stories blog to show what you can do with a single word. The key is to brainstorm the word to see what pops up. But back to Writing Tools which looks at fifty tools divided into:Nuts and bolts-grammar, punctuation, sentence and paragraph construction etc;Special Effects-be concrete and simple and know how to make the writing guide the response of the reader etc;Blue prints-tricks of structuring; andUseful habits-reflections of how to start and keep writing.Each of the tools are 3-4 pages long with examples drawn from journalism and fiction to illustrate the points raised. There is summary page of the 50 tools on his blog site. Talking about how to write is as about useful as cooking advice, you need to see and taste it to see if its worth taking. So this is a piece of my writing with a makeover using the tools. So which version do you prefer? Strongly recommended book for you bloggers, budding reporters and secret scribblers.Original versionSo why ,if you are still with me, would you bother to read what appears to be such a distasteful book? The clue is in the structure and descriptions of the book repetitive phraseology of medical sexual teams and the descriptions of the car and body parts. It means that you the reader experience the alienation and emptiness that is the heart of the story. The story is not erotic in any sense as it point to the emptiness of lives that depend on more and more extreme highs and drugs to keep the sexual tension going. Death then becomes the ultimate sexual act. Nowhere does love and community figure in a world of motorways, airports, roundabouts and technological emptiness. What ever the feelings and motives of the writer, the story serves as a warning of a society that obsesses objects and appearances over personal relationships and social community-who cares for the children in this vision of our lives?The tools used1 Begin sentences with subjects and verbs3 Use active and not passive verbs9 Let punctuation control pace and space10 Prefer the simple over the technical16 Seek original imagery23 Read to tune your voice31 build around a key questionThe revised versionSo why, bother to read such a distasteful book? The recurring use of clinical sexual terms and the similar descriptions of car and body parts is a clue. The act of reading makes us emotionally distanced observers of a world running on empty. Sex means ever more extreme risks until Death becomes the ultimate high. In a world of motorways, airports, roundabouts and technology where is love and community?

The third section focuses on the structure of the text. The final section identifies useful writing, reading and social networking habits that writers should develop.Each chapter has a list of exercises to deepen the reader's understanding of the lesson that is covered."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"I started to write as soon as I started to read, which is to say very young. I write daily; prevent me from writing and you will have to deal with the consequences: distant stares, mumbling, note-scribbling, sudden odd ejaculations (of words).And I like to think that I have over the years gained some proficiency in writing. But there is always room for improvement and fresh insight into the process, and I regularly sample books on writing craft to pick up pointers.Writing Tools caught my eye the other day. I was struck by the presence of the words \\"tools\\" and \\"strategies\\" in the title, rather than the \\"rules\\" and \\"guidelines\\" featured so prominently in many another book devoted to writing skills. And as advertised, I found in this book tools immediately welcome and useful in my writer's toolbox.Clark's background is journalism, and many of the tools are devoted to increasing clarity and conciseness. But these are characteristics as important in fiction as in nonfiction, and the tools can be used on any form or genre.Each 'tool' is covered in a short chapter, the 50 chapters grouped as \\"Nuts and Bolts\\", \\"Blueprints\\", \\"Special Effects\\", and \\"Useful Habits\\". (It would be more accurate to say that the chapters, averaging four pages, are not short but rather just as long as needed -- Clark stresses allowing words the space they need while keeping them reined in.) 'Homework' is assigned in the \\"Workshop\\" exercises for each chapter.The book is replete with examples of fine writing in a variety of styles; Clark's critical analysis turns each of these examples into a lesson. He also asks us to ponder previous pages of the book and consider their alternative forms.I said above that I found the tools presented in this book immediately useful, and I would hazard to say that any writer, of any degree of experience, could open this book at random and find something useful. Roughly half the book is dedicated to strategies for creativity and structure (Chapter 28: \\"Put odd and interesting things next to each other\\") with the remainder presenting tools for tightening up what has already been written (Chapter 5: \\"Watch Those Adverbs\\"). Writers could do worse than to copy synopses of these chapters onto cards, then draw a card at random as the 'tool of the day' to apply to works in progress.After just one pass through this book, I already think of each chapter as a separate tool in the toolbox. Just as in my carpenter's toolbox there are tools for selecting, measuring, and cutting; tools and hardware for joining and building; tools for removal of material and for finishing and polishing. And just as in my carpenter's toolbox, I find satisfaction in knowing that I have the proper tools at hand to build new projects.The book itself is the best tool of all. I am going to buy a copy, plus several to give or loan out."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"As a writer and a teacher, I find this book excellent.

At an earlier moment in history, writers were imagined to be geniuses that pulled the great ideas and words out of nowhere. Here we have concepts and instructions on HOW TO DO IT: how to think about one's writing: how to be self-conscious even as one is in the process of being inspired. The author is EXTREMELY GENEROUS in sharing his own experience and experiences as a writer. In some way, it reminds me of the recent management hit, GETTING THINGS DONE by David Allen. That book, similarly, is about something one has done throughout one's life: organizing one's office, putting things in treys, creating files, putting labels on files, etc. However, Allen's book allows you to understand these \\"ordinary\\" processes in en entirely new way.So you're not only \\"doing it,\\" you also are knowing what you are doing: becoming conscious of certain ideas--even rules--that allow one to achieve a new level of mastery. I haven't finished WRITING TOOLS yet (I read about six pages a day). However, when I've finished the book, I'll study it again and again and allow the book to guide by experience as a writer. The book is not only about the act of writing, but how you prepare to write, what you think about before you write, where you write, how often to stand up, etc.It used to be that writing based on ideas popping into one's head (Kerouac's \\"spontaneous prose\\"), or based on the idea of one's self as an artist (a suffering artist?).

That said, let me pick a few nits:First, the book could be tighter, in many places clearer, and, as a welcome side effect, smaller.Second, it's a bit condescending: for example, Clark's categorization of verb forms into active mood, passive mood, and the verb 'to be' is reminiscent of this ancient Chinese classification of animal species into: tamed, sirens, and belonging to the Emperor -- charmingly quaint and amusing to those who know better and confusing to the rest. Why baby-talk at all? Isn't it safe to assume any student of writing comfortable with basic grammar?Third and last, the whole thing is suffused with the spirit of political correctness that I found irritating -- sanctimonious heorsheing, somehow always 'right' and 'proper' examples: the overall sense of scaredy-cat conformance to the 'liberal' (in the Limbaughesque acceptation of the term) norms of discourse gives this otherwise very serviceable book a taste of emasculated unease.On the good side though, I really liked the author's general teaching approach, which, w/o posting spoilers, could perhaps be summarized as follows: here's the rule, here's an example, here's a bit of discussion -- and btw, feel free to disagree. Iow, there are rules but there are no rules; I liked that very much.So, finally? Well, on one hand, don't retire your Simple and Direct just yet.

The author doesn't talk down to the reader, rather he displays humility by crediting his previous mentors whenever an opportunity arises. For example: \\"I learned the distinction between active and passive voice as early as fifth grade. Thank you, Sister Katherine Williams.\\" , \\"In graduate school, Don Fry helped me to see how my prose wilted under the weight of passive and \`to be' verbs.\\", \\"Carolyn Matalene, an influential writing teacher from South Carolina, taught me that when I write prose that the reader can neither see nor understand, I'm probably trapped halfway up the ladder of abstraction.\\", etc. After each chapter, Roy gives a list of suggested exercises that stimulate the writer's grey matter.

Trust me: This is one of the best.In 50 short bursts, Clark shows us how to think about a wide range of writing challenges. He tells us to start sentences with nouns and verbs and to use active verbs. He gives us permission to use passive voice but also warns us against adverbs. He tells us to keep our language simple and to be as specific as possible. He introduces us to Hayakawa's \\"ladder of abstraction\\" and explains how to pace our work. All great stuff.Most of Clark's examples come from journalism, which is fine. But I'd also like to see more evidence from literature. How do the masters -- Homer and Aristotle, Papa Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald, Will Shakespeare and Red Warren, O Henry and Henry Roth, Thomas Woolf and Joan Didion, Tom Wolfe and Liz Gilbert -- do it?

If you're like me, you can learn a lot of new things to help your writing. One great way is to read what other successful writers have learned over the years. I've gotten several books over the last few months and Roy Peter Clarks' Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer is a resource that might just help you.This is not a book that holds your hand and walks you through steps. Each chapter can be taken alone or you can jump around. It doesn't have to be read from beginning to end in order.What I really liked about this book was the fact that each tip/chapter was only two to four pages in length. As this is a small book in size (not thickness), this makes for quick reading. Though you might find yourself reading tips over again if it is really important to you.Another great feature is the \`Workshop' at the end of each chapter. Mr. Clark has you do three to five activities to help understand what his tip says and to find the problems in your own work. This is really handy especially for visual learners like myself.The many examples the author gives helps tremendously in learning and understanding the tips he gives. He pulls from classics and contemporary works as well as works from newspapers. This drives in exactly what he is talking about.The only problem I saw was that some of the lessons appeared more toward journalism than novel writing. I'm not saying you can't learn something from these sections and apply it to your writing, but it was not as easy to see how I could as the examples and descriptions were for those writing in the newspaper.This is one book that would be useful on your shelf and get some use out of. You might want to highlight areas that pertain more to you at the moment. I would recommend reading it again down the road as you develop in your writing career. Some things might become more useful later.Note: This book was purchased by me with my own funds."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"This is not the sort of book you read end to end and then put it away. Every chapter (or tool) is a gem. You read it, reflect on it, review existing writing to see how well you applied it, and then strive to apply it to subsequent writing. Or, as I've been doing it myself, skim the entire book paying particular attention to the tools most relevant to my own writing, and then use the book as a reference as I write. Every chapter includes examples to illustrate Clark's advice, as well as homework assignments - workshops, he calls them - to help readers gain experience with the tool presented in that chapter.The book is nicely divided into four sections: (1) Nuts and Bolts: the basics such as using word order for emphasis and avoiding the passive voice; (2) Special Effects: ways to spiff up the writing such as varying sentence and paragraph length and seeking original images; (3) Blueprints: tips especially useful to fiction writers, such as revealing traits of character and generating suspense; and (4) Useful Habits: things that will further improve one's writing, such as reading for both form and content and limiting self-criticism in early drafts.My favorite chapter is the one on editing. First, Clark presents his advice, focusing on the clipping and snipping we all know we should do, but often don't. Then he presents the exact same chapter as it looked when he first wrote it, along with the editing he did to improve it. Interestingly, the original included a lot of text that Clark deleted to create the tightly-written result. It's reassuring to know that everyone needs to edit, even those who write books on how to write."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"Roy Peter Clark's Creative Writing Tools, 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writes is organized and presented much like Francis Flaherty's The Elements of Story. It consists of 50 essays, each on a different craft element. The two books are overlapping yet complementary rather than competing.Where Flaherty seems to wish to do for story what Strunk and White famously did for prose in general, Clark presents his 50 craft points as starting points for discussions, accompanying each with a number of workshop questions for instructional use. But the invocation of Strunk and White is shared between the two 50-essay books, with Clark making explicit reference to that book's recommendations for writing and comparing them with his own. Clark's first ten-essay section on language \\"nuts and bolts\\" covers some of the same ground as Strunk and White. Where Flaherty eschews the invitation to create checklists that the organization of each book implies, Clark provides a top-level one as a summary (pp. 249-53).Of the two similar approaches, Clark provides, in general, more examples, even if some of those in Flaherty are longer. Clark also invokes a broader set of real-world concerns (such as the need to be aware of illustration requirements and integrate this into writing, on p. 225). His idea on creating a mission statement (Tool 40) is useful both for the writer and for the benefit of those, such as editors, that need to buy off on it. It certainly does not take the place of effective outlining - you can never have too much of that - but having thought things through to create a mission statement will make an outline much easier.I found Clark's way of defining his 50 essays to be easier to match to what I already knew than those of Flaherty, even if Flaherty's titles and openings were more descriptive and defining. Here, there are discrete essays for writing with different \\"camera angles\\" (Tool 34) and \\"Show, don't tell\\" (Tool 27). He provides essays on the importance of issues such as sentence length (Tool 18).Clark's most significant difference from Flaherty, however, is perhaps in the attitude that goes with the title. These are tools. All should be available to the writer when they are required. No single task will likely require all 50. Some tasks will require extensive use of a few and none of others. Just as Flaherty reminded the reader that there are many different venues for writing and each may well require a different approach and style. A lecture with PowerPoint slides, a speech and a ballad may be different ways of communicating, all of which have been known to exert an effect on people (and it is the effects that we are concerned with, in the final analysis). A photograph and a balance sheet may, in their wordless ways, also have powerful impacts. Clark's essays on each of his 50 points keeps in minds the many different effects of writing and how they may be achieved."},{"Title":"Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer","review":"This book is a godsend.

And not due to fictional bands of ravenous human hunters.This book should appeal to the knee-jerk reactionaries who sanctimoniously hand down judgments about the lifestyles of the rest of us. This book is worth less than fossilized mammoth dung."},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"Peter Ward writes his book, The Call of Distant Mammoths, like a murder mystery (a metaphor he uses several times). The victims are the large mammals that disappeared after the last ice age. The perpetrator? Who knows? Peter Ward's thesis fingers early hunters who came across the Asian land bridge as a major, perhaps the major, cause of extinction.Like any good mystery book, Ward starts before the beginning by taking the reader on an imaginary trip in a time machine through past eras, periods and epochs as he revisits the major extinction events in earth's history and reviews their causes. The most recent, and perhaps best-known, extinction event is that at the K/T boundary that saw the extinction of the dinosaurs. In all his examples, Ward makes the point that extinctions are rapid (at least on geologic time scales) events. I tend to agree, though I'd probably define rapid in terms of the speed with which organisms evolve.Ward gives some good background information regarding general points related to evolution. I especially enjoyed his clear but brief summary of human evolution, as well as the evolutionary history of elephants. With this introduction (which takes up about 1/3 of the book) Ward begins to make his case by examining the period of time around the last ice age. Ward finds more than coincidence in the emergence of human society and extinction of the large mammals at the end of the last ice age. As he puts it:&quot;The time of the Ice Age is of utmost importance to humanity, for it is the time of our origin. We began this interval as australopithecines, ape-like forms living and dying among the other wildlife of Africa. We ended the ice Age, only 10,000 years ago, as humans, living on every continent except Antarctica. For humanity, the Ice Age was the crucible of evolution.&quot;I remain fascinated by the idea that the ice age may have somehow precipitated a crucial event in human evolution, and in doing so led both to our emergence as a species, and to the extinction of many ice-age mammals.I found chapter 5 particularly interesting. This chapter, titled &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; illustrates the problems with viewing evolution as strictly survival of the fittest, partly because the terminology is somewhat circular and self-referencing. Many organisms that seem perfectly fit for survival end up extinct because of pure, dumb, blind luck. Things like errant meteorites and other rapid changes to the environment make the process of evolution something like a roulette wheel. From another point of view, what constitutes &quot;fit&quot; today may constitute &quot;unfit&quot; tomorrow, given significant changes in the environment.It's not until the latter sections of the Book that Ward gets down to business and describes how our species precipitated the ice-age extinctions. In one explanation, human-caused fires were a major contributor. I must admit, I found this explanation wanting. Even today (with billions of our species on the globe and millions of urbanites seeking outdoor recreation) lightning-caused fires far outnumber those caused by people. Perhaps these primitive societies started the fires deliberately? At any rate, it seems that climatic changes that led to drying out, with more dry lightning would precipitate more fires than our early primitive ancestors would. But that's just intuition - right? Perhaps our ancestors were more destructive than I think they were. What seems equally hard to accept is that a few million hunters managed to cause the entire extinction of the mammoths and other large North-American mammals that went extinct at the end of the last ice age.Perhaps the strongest point Ward makes is the correlation between the appearance of people in other areas (notably Australia) and local extinctions there. I found this particularly persuasive. I must admit to being skeptical about the proposed reasons, but the fact of a positive correlation cannot be casually dismissed. The presence of our species seems to correlate well with the extinction of lots of species - then and now. There remain, however, exceptions to be explained. After all, our species emerged from Africa, and Africa today has the world's largest assortment of large animals.I believe the weakest area of Ward's thesis remains the (nearly) simultaneous extinction of literally dozens of other large animals at the same time as the mammoths. While ancient cultures, armed with obsidian spears, might have had a penchant for mammoth flesh, and caused their extinction, would (could) they have been such voracious hunters as to do the same thing to horses camels, and rhinoceri? These other species remain relatively anonymous in Ward's book, and I think the argument Ward makes would have been far stronger had he proposed how those animals also went extinct at the hands of primitive hunters.I found Ward's results of computer simulations, showing that even relatively minor hunting can lead to extinction in a population that is already under stress, very interesting. It wouldn't be the first time our species has caused another to go extinct. Indeed many scientists would argue that people are currently precipitating the largest extinction event since the one that killed all the dinosaurs.Having read Ward's book was an enriching experience. For me, this book illustrates the thrill of science. Unanswered questions and the thrill of the chase are what make science such a rewarding enterprise. If natural science is your bailiwick, you'll find lots to like about The Call of Distant Mammoths. I highly recommend it.Duwayne Anderson June 15, 1999"},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"The extinction of ice age mammals and other megafauna is not just a periphereral topic. It is important because, as Mr Ward duly points out, in a sense WE are Ice age megafauna. The mammoths and mastodons and their extinctions are particularly interesting, not just from their romantic appeal, but because they are indeed representative of much that we can learn about what happened to other megafauna at the same time, and indeed about ourselves. A selection of both the probiscideans (elephant line) and hominids wandered out of Africa during the last few million years. Both hominids and the various probiscideans are large and adaptable to varying environmental conditions, including ice ages. Both seem wanderers by nature. Both are intelligent and social animals. Both have few natural predators. Both were very successful during climatic change, including the Ice Ages. Emphasis on WERE. What happened to the mammoths, and other megafauna? This book seeks to answer such a question- the causes, and moreover, the lessons we can learn from this about our own selves.Their extinction is not simple. Overhunting by humans is considered the most likely and significant cause, although there may well have been other contributing factors. Mr Ward contends that the end of the last ice age(s) created stress for mammoths and some other megafaunal species, which humans were then able to push over the edge through overhunting. It is true to say that without humans, they never would have gone extinct, as they survived many other climatic changes. However, the stress that was created by these climatic changes reduced their natural 'immunity' to such predators as humans in the first place, making it easier for humans to drive them to extinction. Basically, we kick other species when they are down.There are interesting discussions on wave front (killings), species threshhold and the like, stress, environmental change, elephant-and by correlation-suspected aspects of mammoth behaviour and nature, including gestation, rate of birth, mortality and its causes, and so on. Studies on modern elephants help us gain insight into what the mammoths might have been like, and so this book is also a good read for those who are interested in elephants in general. Some snippets include how elephants increase birth rates under stress, neglect their young in times of drought, the problems of poaching, their eating habits, and why they survived in Africa (they are already extinct in the wild in India).The basic thrust of the book concerns the debate between overhunting and the Clovis hunters which are suspected to account for their demise, and environmental causes. There are also some discussions on the extinction of other Ice age megafauna such as the diprotodon of Australia-a very large extinct elephant-like marsupial herbivore (there is a skeleton in the Coonabarabran Information Centre in NSW, Australia, recently found, which I have seen, with what looks like a spear point in its ribs), and others. There are overviews from various studies on Quaternary extinctions in general, throughout the world, although Mr Ward focuses primarily on mammoths.It is a very readable and entertaining book, neither long-winded nor self-congratulatory. However one criticism is that perhaps Mr Ward could have discussed other megafauna in more detail, especially in places like Madagascar, New Zealand and Australia. He does mention these places and their extinct megafauna, but only really in passing. (There isn't much on Australia Mr Ward!). But of course the book is about *mammoths*, I suppose.The book is quite readable, entertaining, and anything but dry. And I also think it gets better as it goes along, towards the end he introduces some interesting possible twists to the tale of mammoth extinction, and about ourselves, but you will have to read them yourself. Suffice to say those ice ages we have come through may have had more influence on human prehistory than we have formerly given credit.It really is an excellent book which thoroughly deserves more circulation, full of rare insights and romance. For science enthusiasts, animal and murder mystery lovers, put it on your shelf. I doubt you will regret it."},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"Mr. Ward's book was an interesting and quick read. It was written in terms that non-scientists can understand yet covers the breadth of the current extinction debates with a fair amount of detail. The history of life on earth between 40,000 years ago until the dawn of civilization tends to be overlooked by the flashier dinosaur eras. This book gives us a glimpse at this crucial not so distant time in our past. While I had hoped that the book would be more specific about the Pleistocene fauna I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"I grabbed this book in spite of the title &amp; am sorry that I did. The subject is fascinating, but the author simply doesn't do it justice. We get far too much personal anecdote (often without any real conclusion) and far too little real meat. Especially given the controversy (and topicality) of the Pleistocene extinctions &amp; the possible role that early humans played one would hope for something that would inform the educated layperson while energizing the serious student. Ward is definitely capable of this as shown by his earlier book on living fossils, but somehow he loses his way here. After reading the book I really had to wonder just who it was intended for, it seems to fall between two stools -too technical for the non-scientist &amp; not serious enough (nor with a sufficiently useful list of citations) for the professional. A real pity &amp; one hopes that someone else rises to the challenge."},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"I have to agree that Ward sometimes strays from topic, and gets in too much about himself -- but I read it all without getting bored, and apparently so did the more critical reviewers here. In other words, he can hold our interest even when he irritates a bit.The question in the title is: why did the ice age mammals disappear? Ward can point to a &quot;smoking gun&quot;. I wondered about the detail, thrown in as an aside, that other predators crossed the Bering land bridge at the same time as humans: why then are humans the only possible suspects? Nevertheless, the analogy with the K-T extinctions is a compelling pointer.The anecdotes about scientific conferences and personal experiences are integral to the story, because they show why we should regard Ward as a trustworthy guide. For similar reasons, I applaud the speculative scenes where Ward describes what a time traveller might see while witnessing important turning points. As with a museum display, we lay folk know the scenes are fanciful, but generations of museumgoers will attest that this is the sort of thing that makes a story live. It would be easy to cram pure facts in, and others have done that; however, this style matches what the general public asks for.I find myself wondering at the end about other ice-age mammals, especially the sabre-tooths. I look forward to reading other Ward books now that I know he's a man with some answers."},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"While I don't agree with all of Ward's theory's on extinction he's still one of my favorite science writers. In this book he not only reviews the Ice Age die off but covers some of the other extinction events as well. On the KT event Ward recounts going to a lecture in which Robert Bakker questions the whole impact scenario by saying &#34;If all this is true, why do we still have amphibians?&#34;. Ward thought this was a good point but then does not mention amphibians again for the remainder of the book. For me this was not the best book that Ward's ever written but he does cover a wide range of subjects in a entertaining manner. He brings up a good point on the extinction of mammoths and mastodons; because of the fragmentation of their environmental range, slow rate of reproduction and a long childhood they were extremely vulnerable to predation. The Human Overkill Theory is poplar but has many problems so Ward covers both sides of the argument. In spite of my disagreement on some points I did enjoy the book. Maybe that's what science is all about. I had no technical problems with this Kindle edition.LastRanger"},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"Everyone knows that the last ice age killed the mastodons and mammoths. Massive climate changes apparently altered their sources of food, the weather was difficult to adapt to and these mega mammals became extinct as a result of these powerful forces. But what if we are wrong in these assumptions?Peter D. Ward instructs us to search elsewhere for the true culprit. To learn the truth, Ward leads us through several mass extinctions in Earth's history, the demise of the mightiest of dinosaurs and the unceasing advance of the Clovis people and other groups of early man. On every continent, the great mammals disappeared shortly after the arrival of man. Coincidence? The author does not think so.On top of this, some species seem to go into \\"protective mode\\" if their survival seems unlikely. For example, when modern elephants are threatened, they produce less offspring, not more. They've even been known to shove juveniles away from shrinking waterholes so that the adult elephants may drink, thus helping to ensure the survival of viable males and females capable of continuing the species. Could ancient mega mammals have exhibited similar behavior? If waves of hunters were added to this sad equation, might not mammoths and other large creatures have reached the overkill threshold, the point from which their species could never recover?If so, how does this bode well for our future and the continuation of hundreds of species into the next century or millenium? Is it already too late?

That human beings are likely responsible for the mass extinctions of the Pleistocene megafauna is one of these truths. That we are still in the process of exterminating the remnants of the Pleistocene megafauna is another of these truths.Mr. Ward, in addition to being a fine scholar, is also a very talented writer who adds a generous touch of humanity to what could have been a very dry and intellectual read. I highly recommend this book. It's eye-opening, sometimes frightening, but largely on target.

I agree with Ward that Gary Haynes' Mammoths, Mastodons, and Elephants is a landmark book that covers this topic in a very matter of fact and informative manner. And even though Ward himself recommends the Gary Haynes' book, he chooses to ignore its logic and research to reach unsupported conclusions.Ward's apparent efforts to try to equate current environmental issues with an extinction that mostly occurred around 12,000 years ago just simply don't add up! Ward fails to answer some of the more intriguing questions (such as why did the long-horned bison, \\"bison bison antiguas\\" go extinct when the plains buffalo, \\"bison bison bison\\" thrived. He ignores compelling evidence that contradict his theories such as the fact that in recorded history there is no record of indigenous humans preying on elephants for food... that elephants have only been used as a food source since modern management of elephant herds necessitated thinning the herds. There is so much that contradicts Ward's conclusions, yet it is quite clear that his conclusions are very politically correct and will easily appeal to those that have forsaken facts in preference of emotions or those who really have no desire to learn about the real reasons for these extinctions, but would like to grasp at anything that allows them to advance an environmental issue. Don't mistake my motives in writing this. I'm not necessarily oppossed to Ward's environmental views, but I am oppossed to ignoring facts and attempting to mislead readers with information that is easily refuted from many, many reputable sources in a transparent attempt to advance such views.This book should be put into the category of FICTION where it belongs!"},{"Title":"The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why The Ice Age Mammals Disappeared","review":"What a disppointment. The author, a geologist, falls flat in this book. He strays into areas of expertise with grand claims and zero proof. He does not refer to his ideas as theories but as fact. Aside from the joy ride around good questions, the book is filled with extreme political correctness... Why are SUV's, Republicans, and present day humans always the ones that are to blame for extinctions that happened thousands of years ago (now you get an idea of what light that this book was written in).

They also stated that they liked the Papa Ngiza character -- I found him to be the only partial flaw in the book. His complex rants sometimes seemed contrived, and not always essential to the story. A bit too over the top, even taking into account the fact that the character is supposed to be over the top. Other than that unimportant personal opinion Harrison has an excellent voice, creates vivid, interesting characters, and has written what I consider a much better read than what most \\"best selling\\" authors can stitch together these days. A surprising gem. I have since ordered several other Harrison novels. Anyone who can put together something like this has a voice that I'd like to hear more of.

I was fortunate in that I had two older brothers so our book case was filled with age appropriate books. I'll never forget the faded blue cloth cover of our hardback edition. With the slightly flaking and cracked gold embossed letters, the old volume looked like it belonged in the Ancient Spells section of a real magic shop.I too, brought my search for this childhood remembrance to Amazon and I bought a second (or third or fourth) hand copy from a third party seller. At the time (2007) the book did not seem to be in print anywhere. I was grateful to get my well used copy.I dove right in the minute the wrapping paper came off and it was truly as though I stepped back in time. I finished quite a bit faster than I did back in the 60's, but the feeling of satisfaction from a book well read was like Deja vu. I could smell the musky scent of our hand built oak book case and all the old, dusty tomes that filled it.In my correspondence with Zilpha Keatley Snyder, the author, I expressed my desire to see our Harry fly on the big screen. Her response \\"It's good to hear that Black and Blue Magic has meant so much to you. I too have long thought that it could make a great film\\" gives me hope that one day our Harry will also fly into the imaginations of today's children.Today's reader might not be as impressed with the book, when you consider eight Harry Potter films being drilled into their young minds in theater, television and hi definition Blu-Ray DVD, but the adventure is there for all who seek it.

She informed me that this book was written especially for her son Douglas, who was in the third grade (at the time). He begged her for a story about boys, instead of all the girl protagonists that she had before. The flying part of the story was incorporated from her experience as a little girl: she used to dream at night about flying, and wanted to add a specialness to this story. She's a stickler for details. Her stories are begun not with plots, but with maps. She likes to have a complete foothold on her surroundings.

But I could see that the author had interesting ideas and wrote well. I decided to try another one of his books, that being King Rat. I ended up liking it. Although I would say I am not an experimental music buff, and I don't know anything about the culture, I found the book interesting. It was good to be immersed into a new world. I wish I had been immersed into it more. Usually, I find books to be too long. This one, I was wanting more details. Write a sequel or something in that same environment, and I'll buy it!As for storyline, I liked it. But, I always end up comparing to past books, and I just kept thinking how much I liked The Fox Woman by Kij Johnson. But, I prefer sensual books to gritty. It is just a matter of preference.I will definitely try another one of Mr. Mieville's books, most likely Perdido Street Station. I think he is interesting, and that I might find one of his books to be gold."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"\\"King Rat\\" is pretty good for a first novel. It's a fun, fast read and Mieville's writerly skills are apparent.

The same urban decay and chaos that made Perdido a masterpiece is already evident in King Rat. However, while Perdido was layered, complicated, intense, and grand in it's scope, King Rat is more of a one idea exploration. Still,its well worth the read and hasn't stopped my high expectations for the next Mieville novel. Here's an odd recommendation: Read Neal Gaiman's &quot;American Gods&quot; and King Rat sequentially - the books share an important yet incidental character..."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"What you can't deny Mr Mieville is him having exuberant fantasy and coming with the most original ideas possible. In this book he blends persuasively urban folklore, fairytale characters, modern rhythms and poetry of London dehumanized city hectic. The plot is rather simplistic, but has enough of little twists and grisly descriptions.However, the drawls of dialects his characters use are hardly intelligible sometimes, and detailed descriptions of Jungle music may bore you (if you're not the fan).A promising &quot;try of the pen&quot;, but to enjoy China Mieville's talent to the last drop, read the superb Perdido Train Station (completely different in plot and settings)!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I am a HUGE fan of China Mieville. I have read Perdido Street Station, The Scar and Iron Council. Those were GREAT books, but this is not in the same league.The book was interesting at the beginning, but there was not enough going on to keep me interested. I forced myself to finish it, hoping that it would get better. I would not recommend this book to anyone, since he has written far better novels."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Alright, but skip this one in favor of Perdido Street Station, which includes more characters in Mieveille's amazing vein of mythological/human/creature and much better plotting than King Rat, his first published novel."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Sorry, folks, but this book does not hold up. It's starts off with a fast pace and characters and a story that just sucks you in. But as more (annoying, pretentious) characters are added...well it goes down hill. This was a chore to finish. The writer is clearly trying to appeal to the hip, cool, gothic youth and is kills what should have been a great book."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"i will admit that i picked up this book because it incorporated Drum n Bass into the story. DnB is my one true love and i wanted to see how the Mieville would pull this off, since DnB and its (mostly underground)culture are not somehting many people understand or even know about. Drum n Bass was the perfect genre of music for this fascinating novel about London's underground...but if a reader had no prior knowledge about the music and it's culture, they would only get a quick (and almost outdated?) lesson from this book. Anyway, i don't think Mieville's sole purpose was to educated unfamiliar readers about a musical genre from London's urban youth (with a 10+ year history) so much as to simply use it to help create and support his unqiue and mysterious scenes in the novel (such as the Rat King's sewers). Okay, about the novel for people who don't even care about DnB...i loved how it incoporated the childhood tale of the Piped Piper and made a present day story out of it. You are defintely brought into another world...one that lurks right under the city's feet. The reader can sympathize with the main character, Saul, who is violently dragged into this surreal situation. Some of Saul's revelations are probably familiar to many of us...such as how he can feel so very alone in a huge city that isn't even aware of the struggle ensuing below its streets-his struggle. It was a quick read for me and it is exciting since something new is always developing. I really enjoyed the book and it was nice to finally read something different for a change. I am looking foward to reading Peridio Street."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read the book in a short amount of time...The concept was interesting. I wish there was more."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Brought and read this morning. Interesting concepts and good development of the supernatural characters, but I felt the mundanes got somewhat sidelined - they were all fairly one dimensional. The narration was pretty flat, too, and showed definite signs of thesaurusitis - though I liked the style adopted for the Animal Superiors' dialogue (nice use of Cockney rhyming slang, for one). Lacked a certain sense of the streets, too - the supernatural side was there, but not the reality.I strongly suspect the author of being an upper-class poser, I have to admit, seeing as everybody I know who went to Cambridge (as he did) and is into drum'n'bass came from a public school background - and his mother and sister are called Claudia and Jemima, which is a pretty fine class pointer over here. So I doubt he's ever been near real urban poverty - though I might be leaping to false conclusions here. Most of Jungle is posing, anyway, and at least he had the good humour to take the mickey out of it at points."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Saul Garamond doesn't bother waking his father when he returns from a trip out of town--which the police find suspicious considering his father is lying dead outside the apartment. While he's waiting in jail between interviews with cops intent on getting a confession, Saul is visited by a weird \\"man\\" who claims to be the king of rats... and Saul's uncle. Using rat skills, the King leads Saul out of jail and into the sewers, exposing Saul to the non-human side of his heritage. But the King has a problem... since the Pied Piper struck, the rats no longer trust him and the King himself lives in fear. Somehow, together, they've got to find a way to defeat the piper and reclaim the rat kingdom.Saul's adventures take place in a London that's just a twist away from the ordinary. Saul's friends struggle for success in the music business while the piper strikes again and again, leaving a trail that Saul knows can only be a trap. Worse, Saul doubts the motives of the King.KING RAT is China Mieville's first novel and it's an impressive introduction. Mieville really gets into the city of London, with its stinks, it's squallor and it's energy. Saul is an interesting protagonist, fallible, angry, yet with firm friendships and a growing appreciation for his dead father. There's a lot of potential here, and KING RAT is an enjoyable read. It's especially enjoyable for fans of Mieville (like me) because Mieville builds on his strengths in his later works. He returns to London, for example, in Un Lun Dun, and his strengths in creating complex plots and strange reflections of our world have developed masterfully. KING RAT is certainly not as mature as Mieville's later work, but it's certainly an enjoyable read in itself, as well as an introduction to an important author in today's speculative fiction scene."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the overall integration of this fantasy isn't quite there. There are unanswered questions, loose ends. But still - what a riot of imagination! Just getting into the Pied Piper story - from the viewpoint of the rats! (Reminds one a little of John Gardner's retelling of \\"Grendel\\" from the monster's point of view.) And the consistently eerie and ominous way that his battered, decayed London is brought to life: even the looming buildings are invested with personality and menace, like the tribes of bored teenagers.I've also read Perdido Street Station and Kraken. Unlike the majority here, I wasn't that grabbed by Perdido Street. But I loved Kraken.Plenty of other reviews have outlined the story of King Rat. Some mention difficulty with the language - not surprising if you're not British. To help out, I thought I'd include a little dictionary of the Cockney rhyming slang in the book (plus one or two other well-known ones) and a couple of other general slang terms. Some are simply rhymes (\\"pegs\\" for \\"legs\\") but the really characteristic ones are the ones that use a different word of the rhymed phrase to link to the meaning - (\\"china = mate\\" (china plate.) Not to mention the possibly sardonic overtones of \\"trouble\\" - see below!

It's fairly good overall, but a far ways short of the quality of the Bas-Loq books of The City and the City. Partly because he goes for a fairly claustrophobic atmosphere rather than his usual intense activity, partly because the interweaving of the politics never felt quite deft enough and the main narrative lacked the measure of complexity I was expecting.Nevertheless there is a lot of appeal to this story. It offers a fun adventure, first and foremost--energetic and refreshingly unique political intrigue, beautiful prose, continual movement of the story and protagonist, effective buildup and a powerful dramatic climax. Beyond that, the book is almost worth it for the atmosphere, the presentation of a dark urban undercity dripping with strange creatures and intelligent rats. In the presentation of horror and the sheer strangeness of the environment Melville's out-Gaimans Neil Gaiman, presenting an intense and memorable atmosphere. Never have I seen a book get more effective dramatic and fantasy mileage out of rats.Worse than: Iron Council by China MievilleBetter than: Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Not as dense as Perdido Street Station, The Scar, or Iron Council, but satisfying nonetheless. Imagine the Pied Piper as a psychotic control freak and you have the general idea. Not your average bedtime story, but one that will haunt your imagination for years. There are definitely some gory moments, but Mieville's narrative flows so smoothly that even the bloodiest scene works. Dark and violent with a few intriguing twists."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Most Mieville fans will probably start with his stupendous New Crobuzon novels, which are incredibly ambitious and revelatory, though that ambition occasionally gets a bit too heavy for its own good. If you've read those novels, King Rat proves that Mieville started out a little more down to Earth, but his writing in this debut novel was still dark and compelling, and there are surely signs of a genius in the making. This story is essentially a riff on the Pied Piper myth, though told from a sinister perspective and taking place in Mieville's purgatorial London underworld. At this point in his writing, Mieville wasn't letting his future huge ideas get in the way of a fast-moving story, and this novel is action-packed with plenty of Mieville's gifts for compelling and disturbing scenes and landscapes (though he does get bogged down in unnecessary details sometimes). Like a previous reviewer, I see several parallels between this novel and various works by Neil Gaiman, and although Gaiman is funnier, they both deal with mythology and the dark side of London, twisting and darkening quaint old fairy tales in quite compelling ways. Also, Mieville's backdrop of Jungle music here is a nice touch and adds a real interesting twist to the Pied Piper's use of music, which is much more sinister and murderous in Mieville's vision than in the fairy tales. And while the conclusion to this story is a little contrived, the young(er) Mieville had already established himself as an emerging master of speculative fiction and dark fantasy.

I especially liked the animal superiors, and loved the character of King Rat.

And through the two sittings it took me to devour it, I wasn't sorry.It's no polished masterwork. In this off-center update of the Pied Piper story, China Mieville launched his fantasy career with a barbaric yawp. It gets in your face on the first page, and it never backs off for a minute. It's skanky, percussive, violent, low-rent, alive. Especially it gets up your nose, pulsating with the smells of underground London, a dozen abbatoirs and rubbish tips. Its prose dives deep, then surfaces with dripping redolent rinds of gritty poetry in its mouth. If great graphic novels could speak, they'd talk in accents just like these.Okay, so that paragraph was a little purple. And \\"King Rat\\" is a *little* purple, forgivably so in a first effort, very forgivably in one with such a sharp, original, swiftly flowing story. All the more forgivable because of the pleasure of the dialogue when King Rat takes center stage, and starts delivering a pyrotechnic Cockney rant like some Soho Davy Crockett in a bragging contest. (If his talk gets too obscure, try Googling for \\"Cockney rhyming slang\\" to find a relevant dictionary.) He's a marvelous creation, darkly comic and genuinely menacing.For a marvel, Mieville makes his unlikely blend of proletarian realism, dance floor Jungle and Perraultian fairy tale work. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"King Rat\\", and now I'm spoiling for more, of what from an author this inventive will assuredly not be just more of the same."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This book reads like a cartoon spin-off movie: it's Batman/X-men/Spiderman (in this case our (tortured disenchanted teen) hero finds he's got super rat powers). It's all about the dark mood. It's very self-consciously visual: at one point Mi&eacute;ville actually describes a scene as looking 'like a page out of a graphic novel'. It almost crosses the line of trying just a bit hard to be cool - and as we all know a definitive thing about cool is that you're NOT trying. OK, it does cross the line with his raptures about 'jungle' as the supreme art form (as opposed to the faddish derivative that it is). But we've got the classic props - troubled rebellious youth telling their elders to stick it, dark, gritty city scenes, gratuitous use of the \`f' word, loud music - no sex though, which is a refreshing variation from formula. Although now I think of it, the movies I just mentioned are relatively low on sex too. It feels very cyberpunk even though it's not set in the future: anti-suburban, our hero isn't that heroic (I don't see him using his powers like Superman to set up shop to protect the weak).The ride is gripping enough, if reliant on moderately frequent almost \`horror' violence. The characters are not throwaways, but remember this is not a novel based on relationships nearly as much as special FX style action.The climax was really annoying (spoiler warning). I can see why he stuck with it even if the obvious OBVIOUS flaw was screaming at him too. It was perfect for Mi&eacute;ville's purposes to have the piper's discovery of multi-tracking in \`Jungle' DJ music as his ultimate weapon: a fantastic new art form grants the siren-manipulator the means of entrancing several species at once - even undoing our heroic hybrid (who is saved, hooray, because he gets down on the bass, baby). He built to this and spun it for all it was worth. Now lets, in no particular order - actually, no, I'll save the most numbingly obvious flaw until last - list the problems here:a) If the piper has always been limited to a single melody through his monophonic instrument, he has always been open to simultaneous attack. At least Mi&eacute;ville anticipates this objection by saying his animals can never take the chance that it will be them who will be targeted in a multiple attack, but there are several places in the book where his birdman, ratman or (his version of) spiderman do place themselves in just such risk. It's not as if Saul makes all the difference - the \`animals' are never assured that he's a match for the piper;b) Jungle music is, I'm sure, innovative in some ways, but hardly the first instance of multi-tracking, something that has been used extensively for decades. Recorded music is hardly a recent development, overdubbing likewise;c) Indeed, polyphonic music is not an innovation - try some of that hot-off-the-press Bach. What? Several melodies at once? Inconceivable! OK, sure, piano-accordion could hardly be the instrument of choice for a cool arch-villain ... but as I recall Jimi Hendrix looked pretty inspiring with his guitar (something you can even play polyphonic Bach tunes on if you're John Williams). Simultaneous melody is, like, so (centuries) old...d) Ear plugs (Odysseus picked this a while ago);e) But leaving all these aside, it just gets way too silly to have all these resourceful enemies of the piper pulling out their hair going, \\"Oh no, he's using amplified music! Whatever could we possibly do to overcome that??\\". Um, excuse me, but aren't there just a few ways you could pull out the plug? (Sshhh, don't say that, it'll ruin the whole suspense thing). Nobody even tries to. For goodness sake, you could just throw something heavy at the DAT player, cut through a lead, go outside and pull a fuse, noodle down the street and blow up the local grid. All would seem a wiser course than running towards the piper and away from the ridiculously simple weakness in his obvious weapon.It's just such a stupid hub for the climax to turn on. I mean, fantastic if you ignore the obvious. It reminds me of the equally stupid climax of Die Hard 2, where - to great visual and emotional effect - Bruce Willis lights up the fuel spill of the escaping hoons, blowing up their plane and providing the lighting to enable all the other planes to land. A great finish - as long as you can stop that little voice from saying, \\"Um, why didn't someone think of another way of lighting up the runway before this?\\" Headlights? Flares? Petrol generators? Fires? Dumb, dumb, dumb.Sorry, but this really hurt. Overall the mood is cool and the pages slide by. I realise I'm being a bit elitist with the music references, but the glorification of \`jungle' as the be all and end all did make me gag - as if it's the first time anyone's ever discovered the power of bass. There's some definitive immaturity in the way Mi&eacute;ville praises it by saying, \\"It's not Everything But the f-ing Girl\\". Great players in all sorts of styles are often generous in their praise and appreciation of other styles - they can love, say, funk, without having to add, \\"because Classical is boring, and country is stupid, and jazz is pretentious.\\" Part of growing up is realising there's a world outside your tiny sub-culture, and just because something isn't the same as \`yours' doesn't make it \`wrong'. If the art you love is really good, it's good enough to not be threatened by the existence of other good art. (Disclaimer: this is an overreaction of someone who teaches music to high-schoolers who think anything that hasn't been on video-hits in the last six months must automatically suck. Including \`Jungle')."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I loved Perdido Street Station and was expecting something similar from King Rat, but Mieville impressed me even more, for this is a small canvas story set in a very real and modern London. Full of atmosphere and images of the city. Wonderful characters. Maybe it's because I just finished it, but I think this is in many ways better than Perdido Street. This is definitely a writer who is destined to be amongst the very best of those writers who look to Mervyn Peake and M.John Harrison and others as their models. A deeper, darker and more substantial tradition than Tolkien. Read this before Perdido, if you can."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a very good and engaging reinscription of the Pied Piper children's story. Here the rats, more or less, are the heroes and the Piper is a beautiful but psychopathic musician. It is also a text where Mieville attempts to blend, more or less successfully, Industrial Fiction with an Adult Fairy Story. So it isn't particularly innovative (that's been going on for decades - transforming fairy stories into adult fiction and sometimes serious literature [Angela Carter's work for example]) but it is an interesting read: good writing, characters, incident, crisis, plotting, etc.I do not give it 5 stars because there is nothing truly unique and inspiring about the read.

Even when it's not something you'd really want to smell or sense, Mieville lets you have it full on. I enjoyed Ann Rice's early works for the same reason. I knew how the curtains in a room would feel under my fingertips, and how musty they'd smell. Mieville is much in the same vein in that regard, one of the best sensory descriptive writers I've encountered yet. A gripping story, too. Read his newer work!!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"A gritty, fascinating novel much of the way through, but towards the end breaks down due to its lack of logic.There are more complete plot summaries elsewhere on this page. But briefly--the half-human half-rat-god Saul, his humanlike/godlike/ratlike relative King Rat, and the similar entities Anansi King of the Spiders and Loplop King of the Birds fight the evil Piper. The Piper is a mass serial killer who can dominate any human, animal, and even the Kings of the animals by making them dance to the appropriate tune of his flute. Usually till they die of exhaustion but sometimes to achieve more long-term ends; that is, the deaths of still others. He also kills people in messy manual ways, using his flute as a physical weapon.And partway through the novel the Piper discovers sound recordings, which makes him _really_ dangerous. It seems to me he should have done this earlier in the 20th century. But maybe when you're hundreds of years old you get conservative.Obviously, the Piper has to be stopped--even though the three Kings and Saul all together may not even be a match for him. Their air of desperation is convincing, except--after a battle where Saul is forced to crush Loplop's eardrums to keep him from hearing the flute, I started thinking &quot;Ear plugs!&quot; Loplop and Anansi and King Rat seem more or less humanoid in form, so--why not? They seem out of touch with modern life, but surely Saul would think of ear plugs?And during one of the hand-to-hand combat scenes with the Piper, I started thinking, &quot;Guns!&quot; Why don't they even up the odds a bit with some good weapons? Maybe even a submachine gun? Saul's a modern, technologically hip guy who grew up in a seedy neighborhood. Surely he can get guns? Especially since he's learned how to be quasi-invisible (the Kings already know this) and can therefore easily evade people and steal.Also, the music descriptions are really dull . . . I think if those had not slowed down the novel so much toward the end its lack of logic would not have been as obvious.Still, it's a well-written horrific fantasy."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I read \\"The Scar\\" as my first taste of Mieville's work, and was blown away. I have to say that this work is not up to the level of his later work, but still evokes interest and images.While dark, it did not grab me by the throat the way his other work did. And I felt very little association or empathy for the characters.This is a good book, but worth reading more as a glimpse of where the author started from than as a work itself."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"For all the many words and apt phrases that Mieville uses, there may be only one word that describes Mieville works: dark. All of his novels to date have this sense of being written at the bottom of a dank, odiferous, and pitch-black well, to where the tiny bits of color that he allows shine through like the sun after a cloudburst.For this, his first work, he confines himself to the comparatively mundane setting of underground London, underground in both the physical and slang senses of the word, as we follow the story of Saul Garamond, heir apparent to the King Rat of Pied Piper fame. From the sewers to the rifling of garbage heaps for dinner, Mieville delights in offending your hygienic senses while enticing you with glimpses of a musical sub-culture that is just as strange to the average person as the rarified air of sub-atomic research. Bringing the characters of the ancient fairy tale to life is no small task, and Mieville succeeds admirably in the persons of King Rat and the Pied Piper himself. The Pied Piper comes across as a truly sadistic being, as shown by his actions, though at one point he specifically denies that characterization, while King Rat is easily identified with as the whining, downtrodden person who can never quite reach his goal of revenge. Their conflict is very real and very understandable, couched in a thousand years of remembrances of wrongs done, and is an effective mirror of all too many human interactions.What is not so well crafted is the character of Saul. His reactions to the impossibility of the reality of King Rat, or to the murder of his father, come across as much too accepting, reactions that no normal person would have. But it is even hard to judge just how close to normal Saul is, as his background, his emotional makeup, his normal life are only sketched in before being plunged into the midnight realm of rats and sewers. The emotional impact of this book would have been greatly enhanced had Saul been given much more development prior to the start of the fairy-tale action. The secondary characters are also given short shrift, and as these characters have important roles to play in the final outcome, this once again subtracts from the full power this story could have had.For a first novel, this is excellent, already showing signs of Mieville's imposing command of the English language to evoke mood and feelings, but the necessary cohesiveness between story and character that would make this a great novel is lacking. Still a very entertaining read, worth the time and effort, and very much recommended before tackling his later works of Perdido Street Station and The Scar, where he shows how much more he can accomplish.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is inspired by Neil Gaiman's NeverWhere. But it is not a copy. Mieville has his own voice and vision.This is not the glitzy West End of the tourists, or the City of Big Business. This is the London of the poor, the outcasts, the shabby projects. The London of the urban tribes outside of society.An ancient evil has returned to clear up unfinished business. The old King Rat failed to protect his people, and the rats dethroned him. But they are now confused and afraid, and lack leadership. The King Rat sees a chance to regain his throne, and Saul Garamond will be his tool.Mieville brings new twist to old story plots. There is where I find some of his brilliance. The story is interesting to the end. At no time did I know what was going to happen next.He writes in a poetic, yet fluent language. I even highlighted some passages because his descriptions rival Dante's."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I found \\"King Rat\\" to be another creative and entertaining world created by China Mieville. Unlike many of his other books, which take place in fantasy cities based on London, this one is set in the real London, but one that normal people never see. Like his others, it's an epic life-or-death struggle against a seemingly invincible enemy. I enjoyed the book but did not find it quite a good nor as engrossing as his best, like \\"Perdido Street Station\\". Worth a read."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Here we have a tolerably competent but not remarkable first effort from an author who later produced great things. The story and characterization are uneven. Things move too quickly at times; there's a lot left unjustified. Too many elements are too obviously derived from old fairy-tales. Heavy use of Cockney slang may be daunting for some readers, but I had no problem with it. The meaning is usually clear from context. The late 1990s Young Urban fascination with Jungle drum & bass music has dated badly - it makes the characters seem trite and phony, which would be brilliant if it was intentional, but I'm not sure it is. It may be unfair to compare this book with Mieville's later work, but such comparison is unavoidable. My advice is to skip this one and go to Perdido Street Station. \\"King Rat\\" is only of interest to fans of this author; as a novel in its own right it does not withstand the test of time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"China Mieville is an author I've been willing myself to pick up and try. I was forever approached by people and lectured about how gritty and graphic, weird and wonderful Mieville's stories are. Having now completed King Rat, I can tell you that these descriptions are indeed true... with exceptions.King Rat is probably the weirdest story I have read. It spins a tale about a man who discovers that he is half-human, half-rat. This entitles him to all the powers of a rat (whatever they are). In essence, the story follows the urbanised, shunned superhero: Ratman. The book is around 400 pages and could probably be knocked over in about a week of on-again-off-again reading. The language is descriptive, if not a tad strange, describing things in a way that I have never even considered, let alone read in a novel. However, there were moments in the story when I did question Mievillie's word usage. More often than not, it felt like Mieville was going to a Thesaurus and choosing words just because they looked sophisticated. Perhaps a read of Orwell's Politics and the English Language could have benefited Mieville here?My biggest disappointment about this novel is how easily I guessed the plot and the ending (to an extent). Once I had guessed the major plot points, the reading of the novel was a little less enjoyable. There were some very interesting characters in this book and Mieville took them in directions I found fascinating. It was a certainly a change of pace from the traditional, classical fantasy that usually finds its way into my hands. But in saying this, they were characters I couldn't really associate with.I still don't know what to think about this novel. I think I enjoyed it, but I feel like I didn't. I think it would definitely appeal to someone who is more into the gritty, punk-like way of life. For me, it's just not my thing. But would I read more China Mieville?Probably."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Interesting read and easy to get through. The story was well written and the descriptions of London gave it an added dimension. The ending...eeehhhh."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is truly great urban underground (and I mean that literally) fantasy in the tradition of novels such as Dark Cities Underground by Lisa Goldstein and Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman. Feeding off the drum and bass culture in London combined with urban myth, King Rat is a very hip but very dark book. Despite liking books very similar to it, I did find it somewhat hard to get into but once I did get fully immersed in the plot, it was hard to put down. Great action, incredible use of language, and an interesting explanation of an age-old myth. For fans of urban fantasy, this one's a must."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is a difficult book to find a place for. It is neither science fiction nor fantasy and will be overlooked by many of those readers. It likely belongs in the shelf with other horror novels where its redeeming qualities will likely be overlooked by legion fans adoring vampires, psychic abilities, and X-philes looking for a new home. Its future may lie closest on the screen for which it is exquisitely well suited. Once there it will give rise to a wealth of mainstream readers who will adore its ferocity, puerility, and pace.WHO SHOULD READ THIS:If there was ever a book that served as an oasis for the connoisseur of speculative fiction, it is King Rat. Very quick, quite short, and immensely engaging it carries just enough political weight and psychological angst to be well worth the invested time without causing sleepless nights pondering its mysteries. A 5-hour plane ride coming up? There is no better book.WHO SHOULD PASS:Certainly if you're squeamish of rotten food, rats, or spiders, then this is no the book for you. Similarly, it is a novel rife with coarse language, violence, filth, and enough remorseless sentiment over modern humanity to give pause to the pure still among us. Do not expect redemption from Saul.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"China Mieville's first novel is an amazing and horrifying tale of a young man who discovers that his father has been murdered and then that he is chief suspect. You'd think that that would be enough for a riveting novel, but that's only the beginning. He then discovers that he is not what and who he thinks he is, and his voyage of self-discovery combines with his rediscovery of London and its many levels. And, as the review title suggests, there are things about this book that, described baldly and out of context, would gross out most people but which work superbly in Mieville's capable hands. I don't want to sound cryptic, but I cannot in good conscience give away too much of this remarkable book's plot. It is beautifully realized, amazingly written, and haunting. I took other reviewers' advice and read this one before his latest, PERDIDO STREET STATION. It's excellent advice. (I'll review PERDIDO when I've finished it.) China Mieville is a remarkable writer, one with an amazing career ahead of him."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"If you haven't read the jacket cover, King Rat is a modern day Pied Piper tale. Saul, the main character, is a quiet, awkward young man who is caught in a bittersweet relationship with his father. When his father is suddenly murdered, Saul is left alone, scared, and framed. Now the prime suspect, Saul must flee the scene. Enter King Rat and his subterranean lifestyle. King Rat offers Saul protection, but it comes at a price. Saul follows the ratman underground and into the sewers and back alleys where he must learn to use his senses and instincts to survive. As Saul adapts to his new life, one of two of his only friends in the \\"real\\" world, finds a blond stranger outside of her apartment, keenly listening to the drum-in-bass tracks she's created. The stranger has a flute and is intent on collaboration...Mieville does a great job of the relationship between Saul and King Rat--curiosity, loathing, and admiration. I loved the mix of disgusting scents and tastes that Saul experiences as he learns to become a rat (nothing like moldy bread and pre-chewed meat to whet the appetite). Nice dark overtones. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into the Piper premise and it made the book an extremely clunky read (apologies to die-hard Mieville fans). The retold tale felt like what it was, a vehicle or skeleton for the more engrossing relationship between Saul and King Rat, and I couldn't help wondering why Mieville didn't give the story a new mythology--he's certainly creative enough. What made it worse for me, is that Mieville doesn't stop with the Pied Piper, he goes on to include ancillary folklore gods like Ananzi the mythical African spider king, LopLop bird leader (I think this might be a French myth, but not sure), and I believe there's another character that makes a cameo. It's just too much for me. The plotline just dragged. I would have been much happier if Mieville had just focused on King Rat and Saul and Saul's father. The interactions of those three characters and the mystery of Saul's mother's death (in the first fifth or so of the book) were far more interesting than the Piper premise. Mieville's definitely an interesting writer. I haven't give up, but King Rat was not a winner for me.I found myself wishing I were rereading Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere The similar subject matter's uncanny--Gaiman had the jump though, publishing his in 1998 vs. Mieville's 2000. [Neverwhere's plot ALSO takes place in London's Underground with and ALSO has a displaced main character. Coincidence? Consider: Gaiman's American Gods (2001) has a Mr. Nancy (an Anansi character), as well as a huge turnout of mythological gods (a much funnier book in my mind). Did Gaiman and Mieville make some sort of bet or oath over a pint? I'm turning into a conspiracy theorist, but things just get beyond odd when you consider Gaiman's new book titled Anansi Boys. Whaddup boys?? But I digress--] If you're looking for something comparably dark to King Rat, slightly tongue-in-cheek, and in the same dang location, read Neverwhere first. It's a more enjoyable, with fewer extraneous plotlines, and Gaiman doesn't seem to take himself as seriously."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"&quot;King Rat&quot; is brilliant. Mieville manages to wrap up Drum &amp; Bass culture with the underlying creepiness inherent in old fables in a mix that is reminiscent of Neil Gaiman's &quot;Neverwhere&quot;, and yet uniquely its own. Highly, HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This is a fine example of urban fantasy with a dark twist. There is certainly nothing sweet or light in this story, yet I found it utterly absorbing and strangely believable."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"A glimmering in the shadows. A new king is born. King Rat!!! The twists and turns of this novel smash the light-hearted dreams of childhood against a world woven of concrete and brick. I can't wait for China's next novel!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"It should be said from the beginning that like many reviewers here I circled around to buy King Rat after falling in love with Perdido Street Station and the Scar. Without a doubt, King Rat is suffering as much by comparison to the other more mature works as it is suffering from its own flaws.In many respects, King Rat falls neatly into the urban fantasy/urban fae genre populated by writers such as Emma Bull and Charles de Lint. The common elements of music, mixed heritage, updated fairy tale, and a world hidden under the familiar are all present. King Rat is much darker than the typical entry in this genre, but the outlines should still be familiar to long-time fantasy readers.The fact that it fits within more traditional genre lines than other Mieville novels is not (in itself) bad. The weakness of the book comes from what feel like pretty typical first novel flaws-- uneven plotting and some occasionally strange pacing.Despite these flaws, it was a gripping and often impressive read. If I had read King Rat first, I probably would still have considered him a writer to watch. He fulfils the promise in this book amply, as fans of his later books can attest.King Rat is probably not the place to begin with Mieville unless you are more interested in the urban fairy tale genre than you are in the alternative realities of New Crobuzon. Mieville fans may be a wee bit disappointed, but will probably want to give it a go anyhow. It is worth the time to read."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I loved this book. I confess I don't know squat about Jungle but that's not the core of the story anyway - how many fans of Gone With The Wind understand or care about the ins and outs of the American Civil War? What I respond to is story, and this one is wonderful. I dislike reviews that reveal too much, so I'll refrain from detail, but I recommend this book VERY HIGHLY."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"My first impression of King Rat was Wow! China Mieville is a born writer. He is a master of the English language. I love the fantasy in this story. It's simply magical.The only drawback is that you really have to suspend your disbelief. There are several questions that Mieville leaves unanswered. For instance, how in the world are these people rats...but they're also humans? I don't get it.Very well written book. Solid story. Highly recommended. This gets my choice for the best debut novel of 1998-1999."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I love the book and i hope that everyone gets a chance to read it sometime!!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"What a ho-hum of a book this was. I was waiting the entire time for some sort of depth or astounding revalation only to find that the author drivels on with all the writing talent of a 10 year old hastily tossing together something for the teacher.Not at all a book I'd reccomend to anyone who is *truly* looking for a unique read."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Great premise, great start....then we get the language of the gutter in it's fullness. This is not a book for kids, and if you are not into bad language that jumps off the page, neither are you! I loved Unlundun and decided to try this one....not the reader friendly book I imagined. The story is great, a wonder and brilliant in some areas...but there isn't a need to drive a story with such a good premise off the road with bad language.

Then you'd get the very Neil Gaiman-ish book that is King Rat. China Mieville's freshman effort, a trim, effective little novel is drenched in originality, but maybe a little too much style.Saul returns home after a night of partying to find that his father has been murdered. He becomes the prime suspect. But while in jail, someone comes to bust him out; a strange looking man who can crawl on walls, squeeze through tight spaces and who acts like, well, a rat.This is King Rat, Saul's uncle. And he is about to tell his nephew a very strange tale indeed. Soon enough, Saul becomes a rat man himself, hiding in sewers and living in the darkness of the London underground (much of this seems familiar; British authors seem to have a fascination with the London underground, as Neil Gaiman has proven with his amazing Neverwhere.).But of course, all isn't well in the underground kingdom. Because Saul soon learns that the kingdom's enemy, the Pied Piper, is in town. And it is only when the Piper starts going after Saul's friends that things really get ugly, and bloody.Very original, beautifully described and told, King Rat is a one-of-a-kind novel that practically reads itself. It is an Urban fantasy where violence and darkness seems to reside in every corner you look. It is an engaging read that always keeps you guessing.So it is very unfortunate that the book falls victim to the first-time author disease. The prose is often self-indulgent; too many words are used when just a few would have sufficed. And some of the supportive characters seem to blend together because they are all so similar. But that problem is quickly resolved with the main characters, who are very colorfu, memorable and original.I had a lot of fun reading King Rat. Fans of Neil Gaiman or Charles de Lint should like this one. And the rest of you should find enough originality in here to last you for a long time."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Chiana Melville did a fantastic job with this story. All the characters were fleshed out to the extent they needed to be. The story flowed extremely well with events seeming to occur naturally without being forced.I would recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"In this engrossing novel, China Mi&eacute;ville retells the classic Pied Piper of Hamlin myth set in the electronic dance scene of 1990s London. He has done his homework well - it's obvious that he is familiar with the electro scene and the musicians involved. His knowledge of the back streets of London is excellent. And his writing is, as usual, superb.If you like weird fantasy don't miss this book."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"The first China Mieville I've read, after years of being told I should delve into his work. King Rat is a little too uneven for my tastes, but overall an engaging and fairly quick read.The basic plot, with its vaguely sinister animal Kings fighting an old enemy with the aid of a schlubby chosen one, is not particularly mold-breaking, but has more than enough original touches to make it engrossing. The sheer violence and cruelty of the adversary, in particular, lead to some wonderful sections of the book, which are told with an immediacy and ferocity that much of the rest of the book lacks.Characters, aside from King Rat and the city of London itslef, are often sketched in, or simply not that interesting. Diction ranges from standard genre novel to oddly and immersion-breakingly pretentious, which leads to sharp diversions in tone. Or at the very least a dash to the dictionary.Like a lot of mid-range fantasy and sci-fi, the ending is a disappointment, accomplished mostly with hand-waving, which robs the reader of the triumphant feeling a satisfying tussle can provide.In the end, entertaining, but somewhat frustrating. Hopefully, his other work will prove more rewarding."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"This novel is a resplendent supernatural tale moving to the brain rattling pulse of Jungle and Drum 'n Bass. These musical styles are the natural soundtrack for the book which was published when they were reaching an apex of popularity and polish in the late '90s. The arc of the story follows the deep bass tones of the genre, reverberating into the underworld of the sewers, and clamoring with explosive hi-hat snaps and brittle piano rolls onto the tarmac and slate roofed tops of London, where the book is set. This is a city book about city music crafted in apartments and blasted from cars, boom boxes, and sound systems smuggled into disused warehouses. This is a city book about city rodents sniffling through back alleys, searching refuse bins for a bit of scran, trying to avoid the daylight eyes of the human population. It is a book that agitated my mind in a most delightful way, as it has always been my opinion that good fiction-and music--should uproot the moorings of reality. This book did so with thunderous quakes and rhythmic undulations.The story is wrapped around the life of a young man named Saul whom gets arrested on suspicion of murder after waking up to find out that his father is dead, having been flung out a window. Saul and his pop never got along very well. They tolerated each other, but his son grew bitter over his father's socialist leanings, of the Lenin book given to him for Christmas, of his tiresome fixation with the working class. It grew to the point where they barely spoke. But he certainly didn't kill his father. That doesn't stop the authorities from hauling him away.Enter King Rat, a diminutive man who smells putrid, having lurked in places most humans would not normally go, namely the sewers. But the King is more Rat than human. He breaks Saul out of the cop shop, and when they are safe from the searching eyes of the police, high on the rooftops overlooking London, King Rat gives him a new version of his family history. Saul learns that he is part rat.Much of the story concerns itself with the protagonists unraveling of his true family history, which was not like the version he got from his dad or from King Rat, who just wants to use Saul as a weapon to fight the Piper. That's right the Pied Piper, the one from Hamelin who used his flute to lure the rats infesting the town out into the river where they all drowned. King Rat was there and his subjects--little nestlings and their parents--never forgave him for not protecting his people. Unfortunately he had been just as much under the spell of the flute as the rest, and had nearly drowned himself. King Rat never forgot, and remained on the lookout for a way to off the Piper, a way to get his revenge. Saul hadn't bargained for being part of that revenge.Natasha, a Drum and Bass producer, and a good mate to Saul, gets tangled up in the drama. Working on some new tracks in her apartment, she notices with a mixture of chagrin and delight that some toff is down on the street below playing a flute solo to the accompaniment of her beats. She is surprised that it actually sounds good, but when the Piper makes the proposition that they perform together she initially recoils. She thinks the guy is kind of creepy, and that maybe he just wants to get into her pants. Yet his flute has a way of hypnotizing people, persuading them to do as he wishes, causing them to march to his tune. He is insistent, and eventually she complies, despite her fears of being ridiculed by others in the scene, of being some kind of bootleg electronic Jethro Tull. In the process Jungle music becomes the Piper's ultimate weapon.From this point the book progresses inexorably to a rave-death climax. Sandwiched between the covers are some really beautiful passages. Mieville's prose is not as intensely stylized as it became in his trilogy of Bas Lag books (Perdidio Street Station, The Scar, and Iron Council), and the police investigation element is not as highly developed as it became in The City and the City, but the novel remains a masterful first. It is not only a unique take on an already horrific fairy tale, but China shows he could have made an interesting side line for himself as a music writer. He writes, \\"The beat was all snares at first, fast and dreamy, and a sound like a choir welled up and then resolved itself into electronic orchestration, fabricated emotion, a failed search for feeling. ...And then the bass line. ... More and more often gusts of flute would appear, overlaying each other. Another and another would join in, a cacophony of simultaneous forces of nature, half-musical, half-feral, artificial, commentary, an intruder in the city that shaped it contemptuously, sculpted it...Flute, white noise, snares and bass line, stretching off for a long time, an unbroken architecture of deserted beats.\\" I would be keen to hear a song inspired by this book.This review originally appeared on Brainwashed.com and is posted here by the author of said review (Justin Patrick Moore)."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Some time ago, I've picked up \\"Perdido street station\\" upon recommendation from some friends of mine. Underneath its covers, there was a world full of detail, full of marvel, full of imagination and wild flights of fantasy. It was a China Mi&eacute;ville's world in which he moved like fish in the water. No matter how many books have you read in your lifetime, no matter how many wondrous worlds have you visited, this ability of writers - to conjure an image out of ordinary words - when done properly always leaves a lasting mark. Such was the \\"Perdido street station\\". Ordinary adventure-thriller set in a universe you wouldn't soon forget. There were, and there still are, many better books out there. Books more relevant, more poignant and more challenging - books that, despite everything, fail to compare with \\"Perdido street station\\". Reading Mi&eacute;ville's work one could almost feel his joy of imagining things, thrill of creation and of world-building. That was the power of good storyteller. Power that bound you to his creation.In a way, \\"King rat\\" - Mi&eacute;ville's first book, was much the same. This time, there was no steampunk London, there was a drum & bass world upon which everything else was built. Reading about the music from Mi&eacute;ville's pen was a fascinating experience. One could almost feel the beat emerging from the pages, enveloping the dark and gothic atmosphere of underground fairy tale London. And much like in \\"Perdido street station\\", this creation keeps you spellbound in such a manner that you're willing to overlook everything else. \\"King rat\\" pushes you in some somnabulic state in which only words and their power exist. One forgets about story, structure of the novel, allegory and everything else that one sees and understands when reading someone's book. And when you manage to take notice of these other things, you feel a bit of disappointed - much like it was with \\"Perdido street station\\".\\"King rat\\", being Mi&eacute;ville's first book, is more ambitious than PSS. Using urban fantasy, Mi&eacute;ville writes about oppression, about the struggle against the system. He does it much like he does his world-building - with passion. It's one thing writing about the music with passion - writing about politics in such a manner turns your text into a pamphlet - and that is the worst thing you can do to a novel. Yet, no matter how faulty the structure of this novel is, no matter how many times Mi&eacute;ville pulls a solution to a problem out of his ass, one can read between the lines and see a generational angst of late-nineties London. Reading about fairy tale creatures and their struggle with demented Pied Piper shows you the world of suburbia, world of underground (here in both metaphorical and literal meaning). Drum & bass parties in abandoned warehouses, middle-class kids living in the world that they built by themselves - Mieville shows you the London that is different and alien from London of fairy tales - London of Asian Dub Foundation, London of \\"Buddha from suburbia\\", London that is hidden in family TV-shows media clippings. Seeing the unrest of London inhabitants in these past few days, one cannot but feel that \\"King rat\\" has struck a chord that has been there a long, long time.In an old variant of this tale, Pied Piper is a hero - one that can rid you of unwanted things. In \\"King rat\\", Pied Piper is the enemy - one that is afraid of diversity, one that loathes freedom and one that will do anything to control it. You don't need to stretch too far out to understand this metaphor and you can read into it anything you like. System is out there and it's trying to get you. Mi&eacute;ville leaves it at that. You may look upon this as an oversimplification and that view is sort of true. Mi&eacute;ville isn't an intelligent writer - he is a powerful writer. Sometimes, it's all that you need.Despite all of its flaws (\\"King rat\\" has characters that are sort of unbelievable, characters that adapt to a radical change much too quickly, and start doing epic thing much too soon. Being a fantasy book doesn't really absolve it from lack of plausibility) I would recommend \\"King rat\\". Much like I will continue to venture into the worlds of China Mi&eacute;ville. When you compare Mi&eacute;ville's writing with bland, generic fantasy out there, heck, when you even compare it with \\"bigger\\" and more renowned authors out there - there is no contest. Mi&eacute;ville wins every time. When writer enjoys writing it becomes evident in his writings - and that joy transfers itself to the reader. Much that we want all sort of things from literature, this is one of the most important qualities of the novel. And \\"King rat\\" has it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"An amazing premise coupled with good writing for a first novel produced a unique take on the \\"city beneath the city\\" sub-genre of fantasy/horror.Mieville's imagination takes you places you never thought about going and doing what you never thought about doing. Rats, spiders, sewers, rotting food and utter filth are not usually associated with fairy tales. But when you add in the Pied Piper, gore and murder you know for sure you aren't in Kansas.I'll definitely read more of his books, if for no other reason than to see how much stranger he can get."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"China Mieville came highly recommended to me ( Thank you, Pop )and King Rat was my first choice of reading from this wonderful author. When an author can take a reader to a world completely unexpected and often terrifying, it makes for a very satisfying page-turner.The books starts out with Saul Garamond, a rather plain, slightly chubby young man riding the train to his dad's flat in London. Saul and his dad never really had a great father son releationship, but they were respectful of each other. Once at his dad's home, Saul hears the t.v. on and notices the room is freezing. He thinks maybe his dad is sleeping on the sofa and left a window open to the cool fall night. So Saul just heads to his room and goes to bed, exhausted after his long train ride. He's awoken in the wee morning hours to a pounding at his door. Before he can open the door, it is shattered and troops of police officers enter and grab Saul, demanding to what he did with/to his dad. Saul has no clue what is going on and as they haul him away, he sees a closed off crime scene outside, and now realizes that his dad was the victim of either a suicide or murder.At the police station Saul is questioned repeatedly regading his dad. He is given no phone call and pretty much no rights. While alone in his jail cell, he hears movement and sees a stranger, who tells him he is here to get him out. Saul has no idea who this odd man is or how he was able to sneak past the guards, but he goes with him and they escape undetected. How they escaped is most unusual, as Saul rode piggy-back most of the way while his rescuer scaled walls, squeezed through tight passages and did amazing acrobatic flips--all the while Saul was still hanging on to him. Turns out the stranger is King Rat and he has an amazing tale to tell Saul about who Saul really is and what he can do.This story was a great twist to the childhood tale of, \\"The Pied Piper of Hamelin\\". What if what you always grew up to believe wasn't really true? What if the, \\"Good guy\\" really wasn't? China Mieville weaves such a story, infusing humor, stark terror, music, art, suspense, and the everyday life of rats into one awesome page turning novel. The only thing I had trouble with occasionally was understanding how/what some of the main charcters spoke/meant. A cross between a cokney accent and Yoda, but it defined who the character was and where they came from."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Especially if you are into the music scene, ie drum and bass. A fun read, and I hope to read the rest of his work soon. Not as good as Perdido, but close."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"First novel by inventive left-wing fantasy author China Mieville, in which young Saul Garamond comes to terms with his true identity as a half-rat superhero, after the murder of his father. Set in the shadowy, seamy underbelly of London, this novel is also about the esoteric world of drum-and-bass music. The characterisation is fairly flat, and there really should be a bit more of a background to Saul; King Rat is not quite in the same league as the Bas-Lag novels, but still displays a brilliant imagination, and a rather anarchic mix and match approach which I find very stimulating."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I so admire Mieville's ability to create character in just a few simple sentences. The most heart-rending protrayal is of a man who barely appears in the novel alive. After so many years, it's wonderful to find fantasy this imaginative, that takes an old, old tale and puts a heretofore unimagined spin on it. Especially from a new author! I hope for more, soon."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I'd describe this as hybrid of The Alienist and the recent X-Men film--but rather better than either.

Not nearly as much discussion has been generated by his first novel, &quot;King Rat&quot;, and after reading it I'm inclined to see why. The book, an ambitious (over-ambitious, as it turns out) mix of fairy tale and urban grime which lends new meaning to the term &quot;subculture&quot;, has many aspects that are worth admiring - the wealth of ideas, genuinely gripping action sequences and gorgeous descriptions alone make it worth a read. Unfortunately, its flaws are deep-seated and impossible to ignore, resting mainly with the book's almost unbelievably one-dimensional characterisations.The human characters in the book are, without doubt, the weakest. Fabian and Natasha exist only to serve in the traditional Damsels-in-Distress role (an apt comparison, as the book is a much more traditional Good-versus-Evil tale than it likes to think it is). Inspector Crowley is even worse off: a cliched Cop-with-a-Hunch, Mieville makes some half-hearted attempts at sketching a personality for him before abandoning him altogether. Deborah, in her bizarrely brief appearance, serves no purpose whatsoever other than cheap shock value at her fate. Saul, perhaps, comes off the best of all the characters in the novel (yes, I place him squarely in the &quot;human&quot; camp, as he gives no evidence that his psychology is in any real way different from ours); we are at least privy to his true thoughts and emotions, which is more than can be said for anyone else in the book - particularly, sadly, the non-human characters (King Rat, Anansi, Loplop and the Piper), the book's most conceptually interesting people.Perhaps the biggest stumbling block here lies in Mieville's decision to feature characters who are, literally, animals in human form, and then keeping them true to their animal natures - no anthropomorphisation here, no undue human emotions. While admirable in theory, this ultimately proves to be a blind alley in terms of characterisation: animals are not capable of depth or emotional development, and as such the interesting concepts that make up these characters are ultimately all that there is to them. Loplop, in particular, is terribly mishandled - we never get to know or understand him in any way, he vows a ludicrously motivated vengeance upon Saul that never comes to pass, and, ultimately, just disappears from the book entirely, his fate never revealed, as though Mieville just forgot about him.The Piper, too, is a paper-thin character, imbued with less depth than even the most puerile of Batman's rogues. Absolutely nothing is revealed about this man - he's a sadist and he wants everyone to &quot;dance to his tune&quot;, but _why_? What made him this way? Was he once human? Is he some kind of demon or malevolent spirit, as his fate seems to imply? Unless Mieville pens a sequel - as he seems to indicate that he planned to, at least at the time of the book's writing - we'll never know.Perhaps the saddest of the missed opportunities, though, is personified by the title character, King Rat. Easily the most charismatic and intriguing of the book's characters - certainly, he's a scene-stealer whenever he shows up - he too is ultimately let down by poor characterisation: we know exactly as much about him by the book's end as we did at the beginning. Again, Mieville's decision to have his nature be purely animal, never evolving beyond sheer rat instinct, proves a fatal constraint: he and Saul have the kind of family history that demands that King Rat undergo some kind of character development (not a redemption or anything of that sort, but _some_ kind of development), yet this never happens; nor are we given any insight into his alien psychological makeup. He's just there for local colour, it seems.And this book has no lack of that, despite the monochromatic London locales; Mieville's biggest strength, as displayed here, is his descriptive language. Some of the imagery is incredibly vivid and memorable - Kay trussed up in the train station, for example, or Saul's flight from the police station. You never have any trouble picturing the characters (with the exception of the under-described Saul), or the locations.Unfortunately, however, Mieville's descriptive powers fail him when it comes to the frankly embarrassing passages dealing with Jungle music, which serve only to instantly date the book. Using a certain genre of music as a pivotal plot point in a novel is never a good idea, as the visceral experience of listening to that music never seems to come across in prose (particularly if you're like me and know precisely zilch about the relatively obscure genre of Jungle, thus making you feel at times as though this book is a club you're not cool enough to be a member of).Ultimately, &quot;King Rat&quot; is an entertaining but hollow experience: a superhero comic dressed up as thoughtful literature. Some of Mieville's beautiful descriptive passages momentarily trick you into thinking that there's more to this than meets the eye, but there really isn't; the book, with its teenage-boy superpower fantasies and simplistic Hero-versus-Villain storyline (resolved in a big fight scene, naturally), is essentially just &quot;Spider-Man does the Sewers&quot;.However, it bears remembering that this _is_ a first novel, with all the pitfalls that phrase implies; and I for one am absolutely willing to give Mieville's later works a try, as all signs seem to indicate that he has developed in leaps and bounds since writing this book. I certainly hope this is the case; he is most definitely prodigiously talented, and it is deeply refreshing to find a new novelist whose biggest flaw lies in his _over_-ambition, rather than his lack thereof."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"China Mieville, King Rat (Tor, 1998)It amazes me, after having read King Rat, that China Mieville didn't start getting widespread recognition until after his third novel, Perdido Street Station. King Rat heralded the coming of a great new writer, and most of the planet ignored it. Their loss.Saul Garamond comes home one night after a camping trip and immediately goes to bed. He is awakened the next morning by the police, who suspect him of killing his father, who took a plunge out their sixth-story apartment window sometime during Saul's absence. He's held in prison overnight, but during his stay there, a fellow who calls himself King Rat slips into Saul's cell and breaks him out. For Saul is the key to the defeat of King Rat's oldest and most powerful enemy...Set amid the Jungle craze that hit London in the mid-nineties, and spending a good deal of time in the sewers underneath London, King Rat achieves what Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere came so close to but missed by a hair-taking modern London and making it into a completely new place, filled with wonder and magic. Seeing it from a different point of view (but unlike Gaiman, Mieville gives us a point of view that actually exists inside the fantasy world-the point of view of the homeless). A number of previous reviewers have commented that it helps when reading the novel to know a good deal about Cockney rhyming slang and Jungle music. I know diddly about either, other than that they exist, and still found the novel easy enough to follow (while some of the slang terms I couldn't figure out for the life of me, the context of their use made the meanings obvious).Like Perdido Street Station, King Rat shows Mieville as more than a capable writer, but one possessed of greatness. He weaves the threads of the novel together perfectly, creating a design that, while obvious, still throw in the odd twist here and there. You've read them before, yet somehow they're still unexpected. After a while, the fantasy aspects of the novel recede into the background, and you're reading an adventure novel (albeit a very weird one); only the best fantasy can do that.If there is a problem with the book, it's that it's a little too quickly paced. The kind of pacing that works well in horror films-you drop a clue, then within two minutes you show what the clue points to (Hideo Nakata is a master at this)-doesn't translate quite so well to novel form, and there are sections that feel a bit rushed. Of course, this could be an editing problem. Editors are not happy with giving large, expansive canvases to first-time novelists. The seven hundred fifty pages of Perdido Street Station were perfect for Mieville to stretch his wings; the three hundred of King Rat seem a bit cramped. There was more to this tale, I'd warrant, that needlessly hit the cutting room floor.Still, as fine a novel as any I've read this year, save Perdido Street Station. Mieville may well be the finest new author to come along since Wendy Walker. Get in on the ground floor. ****"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I'd heard great things about Perdido Street, and the description sounded so interesting...I like urban fantasy, I like tight writing, and I like jungle, so perfect, right?So wrong. It's not that Mieville can't write -- he can. And the first few chapters were really good. But as soon as the plot began to develop, it because sadly predictable, leading to a disjointed &quot;climax&quot; I'd seen coming a mile off. Still, the worst part was the music. Other reviewers have charitably guessed that the drum &amp;bass/jungle bits (of which there are many) are more interesting or make more sense if you like the music. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. If you appreciate or make drumn &amp; bass, the musical passages come off as contrived, hysterical, and eye-rollingly embarassing.I'm sure he meant well, but jungle just isn't something you write about that way.Still, Mieville shows promise, so I'll read Perdido Street next."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is a fun read whose fantasy element is skilfully worked. Mieville has an obvious love of London's dark underside and his other sources. The problem with fantasy is that you have to believe the fantasy and not just the story. Mostly Mieville makes this leap successfully. But where the book doesn't quite succeed is in its violence (I prefer the play on dark folk tales rather than the more graphic fights) and in its passion for Jungle music - the latter is fine if you share it and makes a nice background for the modern setting of rat tales, but may be just a little too much for non-fans.But, if you're looking for a bleak, tricksy, dirty and easy to read exploration of London's real or imagined underground, this has more than a good share of thrills in story-telling and imagination for this genre."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"It's very hard to get into a story based on rats. There are some tiresome stetches of narative that could be lost."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"I came to this on a recommendation from a friend, although in fairness to the friend, it was a recommendation of Mieville generally and not of this book specifically. As things stand, I really don't have a way to evaluate that recommendation. What I can say is that this book is infuriating in a lot of ways. Mieville is undoubtably a talented writer; his sentences are crisp and engaging, his characters are well-drawn, and he is clearly out to create a fantasy book that's about more than swords and sorcery. His weaving of folklore and modern narrative into a gritty London setting is often very effective and recalls a very similar book by Neil Gaiman (Neverwhere). One can certainly do far worse than invite comparisons to Gaiman.That said, the plotting is a mess. There is too much going on by far, and about half of it feels unnecessary. There is a police procedural woven into the story that is entirely incidental; it seems to have been included to lend realistic weight (in the real world, although rarely in novels of this sort, the police would surely care that dozens of people turn up brutally murdered by a near-omnipotent sorceror) but not for any compelling aesthetic reason. Similarly, there are at least a few scenes (one involving a pudgy friend of the main character and a subway station, one involving a rat and a boat, as well as several others) that don't seem to have any function to the overall story. They're well-written and believeable, to be sure, but they aren't anything more than that.A smaller gripe I have is that I don't really know what to make of the royalty of the underground animal world. At the risk of minor spoilers, King Rat, Loplop the bird king, and Anansi the spider king left me baffled. These are anthropormorphized animals (think of the dog owners at the beginning of 101 Dalmations for a rough approximation), and Mieville makes no attempt to indicate that they are being written allegorically. They are, literally, a human-shaped rat, bird, and spider (respectively). Why would the royalty of these animal species be human? Are they shape-changers (which seems an unlikely explanation given that Mieville indicates that they can be replaced)? I have no idea, it's never explained, and there doesn't seem to be a reason for it except that Mieville needs a character who can straddle the human and animal worlds.So what we have is a novel that is quite good in a purely formal sense but that doesn't quite hold together substantively. Perhaps a different Mieville novel would make for a better - and less frustrating - place to start."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"After reading Mieville's phenomenal &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; I rushed right out to buy his first novel, &quot;King Rat.&quot; I could have delayed my haste. While also stylish and distinctively written, this dark, urban fantasy, compared to his second work, is a rough cut, much more loosely written and barely approaching the wonders or skill of writing present in the following novel. While I may be grudging of comment by comparison, &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; is a masterpiece of speculative fiction, whereas &quot;King Rat&quot; reads as a someways good but fledgling effort. In many respects there is little to distinguish it from early Charles De Lint, though Mieville comes across here as more hip and involved with the music he provides as an underlying theme.While certainly a departure from the ordinary fantasy, written with a degree of verve and suspense, drawing, as another reviewer has stated, upon the folklore of the Piper of Hamelin and tales of the rat king, placed within the context of modern day London and its vibrant, in part underground music scene, this tale lacks both the riveting use of language and the vivid world creation found in the author's second novel. Unlike &quot;Perdido Street Station,&quot; as others have additionally noted, here the characters remain relatively flat, perhaps in part intentionally reflecting the cartoon characters referenced in the novel. As earlier stated, more loosely written and evolved, the cord of metaphor underlying the basic storyline never seems as fully integrated or realized as in Mieville's second novel, unable to entirely lift the tale above the surface of its active, running narrative, or significantly set it apart from other and equally skilled writers of urban fantasy.Though I suspect fans of urban fantasy may find my observations too harsh, or critical by comparison, it is doubtful had I even not read &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot; that I would have been enamoured with this novel. Good but far from great, this is a very respectable first effort that should be applauded for what it attempts, even if not entirely successful. One catches glimpses of the brilliance later displayed and captured fully in &quot;Perdido Street Station,&quot; as well as the author's desire to push speculative fiction beyond its normal boundaries. Nonetheless, I can only give this effort at best three and a half stars."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"One theme amongst the other reviews for this marvelous book is to compare it to the author's next, Perdido Street Station which most people seem to have read first.I did not. (In fact I have not yet read Perdido, having recently and reluctantly cancelled virtually all of my magazines due to the sad realization that there was not enough time in my life to keep up with both magazines and books.)Nevertheless, I believe I would still have valued King Rat as highly as I do now.King Rat layers levels of reality the way the physical geography of the book is layered with the surface of London, the downbelow, and occsionally the air when Loplop, King of the Birds is aloft.The portrayal of the Techno - Drum and Bass milieu is perfectly realized as if by someone who must have lived it. The realm(s) of the three Kings, whom I cannot help but identify with Elementals, is both physically well drawn and (intentionally or not) an allegory for the sub-conscious.The characters are exceptionally well portrayed. The reinvention of the Pied Piper is so audacious and effective that every page where he appears is haunted by a different Kind of Music entirely.When I finished it, although probably not even the author would agree with the connection, there was nothing for it but to watch my DVD of The Sweet Hereafter, a different sort of work entirely, but one which also uses the Pied Piper as a significant metaphor.Buy it. Read it. Be moved by it."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Fantasy books are not scarce these days, when everyone wants to write one, and publishers print whatever comes in this genre.King Rat is different, however, not only by it's uncommon method of having the secondary world within the real world, but also by it's uncanny way of getting to you... This is a book that combines todays music with old folklore and mixes them with almost mythical,yet real characters to form a new genre in itself.The main character is at first just another bloke that life has given the finger, but he grows on you and becomes real, his fears tangible, his experiences real.The story is a common theme: the showdown between Good and Evil, but told in a new way, where the good forces aren't wholly good and the evil not only bad.Mi&eacute;ville has a way with the language that will make him a very good writer, a mix between the daily speech and the descriptive Britishness only a few could muster.Fantasy fan or not- read the book!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is a highly original urban fantasy.

It is set in a really strange universe, mixing fantasy horror and science fiction in a way that is unique and original. It will simply blow your mind. This writer is destined to be one of the biggest stars. Buy this novel now and then buy anything else China Mieville writes."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"In \\"King Rat\\" China Mieville has created a Pied Piper tale for the 21st century. Using the duality of the ultra-chic yet hyper-primitive culture of the London club scene as his backdrop, and writing with machine-gun pacing, Mieville has created an alternate world that is by turns amusing and terrifying. Unlike his other two novels (which are brilliant in their own right) \\"King Rat\\" is raw, there's really no other way to say it, Mieville's words drip and fester like the sewers that are his settings, and his characters resonate with appropriately primal emotion.It would be extraordinarily difficult to do any more than sketch out the storyline without blowing the plot, but, as I alluded to above, it can safely be said that this is an entirely new and unique take on the Pied Piper. Mieville has transformed the Piper from a jilted, mean-spirited employee, into a force of overawing malevolence and tremendous power. At the same time, as one might deduce from the title, we follow the rats into the sewers and watch as they, and their king, plot revenge for a thousand year old injustice.As always, Mieville's worldview is always just skewed enough to keep the reader off balance. He takes the reader inside the Piper's song, and reveals that it is a cry out to our most base desires: lust, gluttony and greed. Unlike a devil, which speaks with a deceitful tongue, he pulls back the veil that separates humans from animals, and that instills animals with self-preservation. He promises all that we ever wanted, but would never admit even to ourselves.Likewise, Mieville's characters are excellent as usual. In particular, Saul, the half-man, half-rat who forms the centerpiece of the story is supremely well conceived and written. His hesitance to turn his back on the human world even as he is lured by the rat world is fascinating, and both real and surreal at the same time. In addition, the supporting cast of characters is also excellent. Saul's human friends exude a pathos, a certain patheticism...weakness that stands in stark contrast to the animal in Saul. Finally, there are several characters that skirt the fantastic while still being utterly grounded. I don't want to ruin any surprises, but it is fair to say that each is superbly realized and effectively captures the essence that Mieville had in mind.I read both of Mieville's other novels (\`Perdido Street Station' and \`The Scar') when they came out, and I enjoyed them both thoroughly. Mieville's command of the language is second to none, and he absolutely revels in the descriptive power of the written word. His characters are always morally ambiguous, and hence completely human. That said, I never completely appreciated these novels until I explored their roots in \\"King Rat\\"; where it is raw and jarring, they are contemplative and polished. However, they all share Mieville's boundless imagination and thoughtful writing. \\"King Rat\\" is the first stepping-stone in what I expect to be a brilliant career, and as such, it is a superb work in its own right, and even more so, within the context of a greater body of work.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"A dark and twisted tale of Saul, who gets framed for the murder of his father and escapes prison with the help of King Rat, who reveals to Saul his heritage, his destiny and his involvement in King Rat's revenge upon his ancient enemy - the piper.

It is a mesmerizing, occasionally elegant, mix of the \\"King Rat\\" and \\"Pied Piper of Hamlin\\" fairy tales melded with the underground grunge musical world of late 1990's London.

Mieville sends Garamond off on a wild, thrilling odyssey through the sewers and tunnels of London."},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"King Rat is China Mieville's first major novel, and what an entry it is. However, I will say right at the beginning of this review that if you are new to Mieville, you would do better starting out with Perdido Street Station and progressing to The Scar before reading King Rat. Mieville can create worlds that boggle the imagination, but the world he creates here in King Rat is an 'alternate London', one seen from the sewers and the eyes of the nocturnal beasts that crawl through them. Rats mostly, but spiders and birds as well.And this is the world that Saul Garamond is suddenly thrust into, directly following the suspicious suicide of his father. Roused from sleep and literally drug to the jailhouse for his father's death during the night, Saul is unexpectedly freed from his cell by a strange and supernaturally stealthy and strong figure, who identifies himself as King Rat.Saul's world is forever changed as he finds out who he is and what type of blood runs in his veins. He embarks on a bold venue of self-discovery, while at the same time trying to figure out what really happened to his father. Saul is a half-rat, one of the ruler class, and related in some way to King Rat who has rescued him.There are two parallel storylines that merge smoothly in with Saul's, that of his friend Natasha, who remixes \`Urban Jungle' club music, and Detective Crowley, who's thankless job it is to pick up after the brutal murders left in Saul's wake, but not of Saul's doing. Each was very different and intriguing, and provided smooth breaks from the seedy and filthy world Saul now travels.This is a modern day fringe-fantasy story, a story of animal kingdoms and their Kings, a fantasy faery tale of the Pied Piper seen through a twisted set of spectacles perched on the quivering whiskers of rat royalty. A tale of kings and vermin and human corruption, filled with the flavor of horror, the scent of fantasy, and a ringing in the ears reminiscent of fables.I loved King Rat, and highly recommend China Mieville as one of the brightest new authors on the market today. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"King Rat","review":"Like a lot of you folks I started out getting to know China Mieville's twisted world-view through his magnificent PERDIDO STREET STATION. I was taken away by the scope of his imagination, the fantastic sprawling vision scattered almost carelessly upon the pages of that book. PERDIDO STREET STATION is a darned fine example of imaginative world-building.KING RAT is a whole 'nuther ball of moldy cheese. It's a lot more fun, more along the lines of Neil Gaiman's ANANSI BOYS or darned near anything by Christopher Moore. And yet as light as it is, the book is darned dark as well.KING RAT is a fun, beer and pretzel book for pessimistic urban dreamers. You don't really have to think as hard as you do when you're reading PERDIDO STREET STATION, and I loved this book for that. Good golly, when you think that this was Mieville's first novel, and he rolled it off just as easy as peas.Mieville has certainly grown as a writer since then, but don't discount this first little book of his. It's a darned good read, and I anticipate reading it again. It's a fun dark ride through the crawlhole's of London. Fans of Charles De Lint and Neil Gaiman are definitely going to want to check this out.I write big wordy professional reviews for several different genre mags. I like to stretch and relax when I post an Amazon review. That's the difference between KING RAT and PERDIDO STREET STATION. KING RAT is a beer and a burger and a yack with friends.

Black Elk In Paris is very highly recommended reading as an engaging and entertaining novel replete with metaphors drawn from Native American cultural beliefs."},{"Title":"Black Elk in Paris: A Novel","review":"Reviewed by Ellen Hogan for Reader Views (8/06)This is the story of Philippe Normand, a doctor in Paris, in the 1800's. Among his patients is the Balise family - Mr. & Mrs. Balise and their three daughters Cecile, Clarisse and Madeline (Madou). When Philippe would call on the Balises he would invariably be invited to supper with them, and actually looked forward to dining with the family whenever he could. Philippe counted among his close friends the Balise's daughter Madou. After the meal they would go for a walk, and just talk about anything.Mr. & Mrs. Balise confided to Philippe that they were concerned about Madou going to visit a Wild West show after dinner each evening. They thought she was getting too involved with a certain Native American named Choice. Philippe accompanied Madou after dinner to meet Choice who did not speak French, but had no problem making known what he wanted to say to Madou.When the show left Paris, Choice did not leave. Madou moved him into the Balise's apartment, and he became ill almost immediately. Philippe could not discern what was causing the problem, and decided to take Choice to the mountains. They wanted to see if the wide open space was what he was pining for. Madou told Philippe that when Choice got better that she was going to accompany him back to America. This news greatly disturbed Philippe. The time in the mountains seemed to help Choice, but after arriving back in Paris he fell ill again.Philippe asked one of his doctor friends to come and see if he could determine what was making Choice ill. Around this time another Wild West show came to town, which happened to be one Choice had once been associated. Madou contacted the show and found a friend of Choice's, learning that his name was indeed Black Elk. Madou gathered enough money to send Black Elk home again; she however, stayed in Paris.The story shows the friendship between a doctor and his patients, and the relationship each memorable character had with each other, and with Black Elk. Mrs. Balise worried about having Black Elk in her home and what the neighbors would say, while for Madou, it was the most natural thing in the world to have him stay there. The friendship and ultimate marriage of Philippe and Madou is almost an afterthought to the story.Friendship, compassion and love abound in this delightful story of two men and one woman.Received book free of charge."},{"Title":"Fundamental techniques of plastic surgery and their surgical applications","review":"It is the very essence of our specialty. Clever tips and tricks originally written by one of the most distinguished pioneers in the field of reconstructive plastic surgery, Ian McGregor. He was one of the fine surgeons that built the Canniesburn legacy. An excellent surgeon and the teacher of a myriad of followers. Ian Jackson and David Soutar to name a few.

The novel takes several unexpected twists and turns that really keeps your interest through to the very last page. I found myself wanting more when I got to the end. The main characters are very vivid and likable. Thomas does a fine job of creating real life mysteries that drive your imagination. I absolutely enjoyed this book and recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Camp Conviction (Serena Wilcox Mysteries)","review":"Let me start off by saying that I have NOT read any other books in this series. I can only give it a three because it will not appeal to everyone. I just cannot see a man finding this book too interesting even though the subject itself was very interesting. The whole business about one of the secondary characters and her life on-line would bore a man to tears and perhaps most young people. The computer scene & how to research someone was like listening to someone give you a computer lesson. Totally unnecessary. I am not being mean but I think that people need to know this. It does not mean that it is a bad book it is just that I see this book appealing to middle aged women and up. This is not an insult - I am a middle aged woman.I was also confused about whether this is a \\"religious\\" series. Obviously the subject matter has to do with an \\"extreme\\" religious right group but there was discussion about one of the characters being a conservative which just seemed so out of place (and the dialogue about the original family who contacted their detective agency & what their version of Christianity was compared to the extremists), etc. It was not preachy per say but just kind of weird. Perhaps Independent Spirit Publishing is a code for Christians? I didn't notice anyone else mentioning this in any other reviews of this author's books but the next in the series does sound Christiany. So take this with a grain of salt. I have to mention it because I know people do NOT like getting books that are Christian.I would definitely read another book by this author to figure out if I like the series or not. I like more intense mysteries and this was not an intense book by any stretch of the imagination but not all mysteries have to be intense either. I also like detectives & cops that are \\"smart\\" and I just didn't get the feeling that the two detectives fell into the top 25% of the population. It almost seemed like the two had nothing better to do so they decided to form a detective agency for something to do with no experience what-so-ever. I like quirky but not so sure about the ditsy aspect.I guess you have to read this to make up your own mind;)"},{"Title":"Camp Conviction (Serena Wilcox Mysteries)","review":"Another enjoyable book from Natalie.

This dictionary is split between three volumes. The volumes themselves are taller than your average book, wider as well. Being split over three volumes takes this dictionary out of the \\"overly-large and unwieldy\\" catagory, but you'll still want a table surface to place the volume you're perusing. I aquired a used copy of this dictionary, and in the 36 years of it's existence, the pages have only yellowed very lightly (and has aquired it's own unique older book smell). Being unabridged, there is no skimping on word definition, and occasionally it sites contextual usage of words. In all, I'm quite happy with this purchase."},{"Title":"Spirit of the Web: The Age of Information from Telegraph to Internet","review":"It is hard to think of a topic that has generated so much shallow commentary and narrow vision as the whole information technology revolution in general and the Internet in particular. Everyone with something to sell or a reputation to make has climbed on this wagon, and as a result the noise to signal ratio in relation to this immensely important subject is extremely high. But now and then someone comes along to take another look at things and really puts some meaning back into the discussion. Enter Wade Rowland. Rowland is a Canadian science writer, but what impresed me most about his book is, firstly, he effectively places the whole history of technological development in a wider social context, including some interesting commentary on on the role of philosophy, and second, he is not afraid to remind us of the much ignored human dimension. In particular Rowland's treatment of the Internet is interesting and insightful, and while rightly citical of much of what has ocurred (especially the debasement of popular culture under pressure from commercial interest) he is optimistic about the genuine liberatory qualities of the net (as opposed, for instance, to broadcast TV). In my view this is an extraordinarily successful book, and hopefully raises the bar in an area where both profound thought and good writing have been rare. If you do not read any other book about the information age and the net, read this one."},{"Title":"Spirit of the Web: The Age of Information from Telegraph to Internet","review":"This book remains one of the most relevant accounts of the development of the Web.

The path symbolized by a radius traveling from the periphery of a circle to its center illustrates the unanimity of all spiritual paths affirming the Sufi saying: \\"The ways (turuq) towards God are as numerous as the souls [nafas] of men\\" (p.114) It is those Sufis who realize themselves through knowledge, such as Muhyi-d-Din ibn 'Arabi, al-Shaykh al-Akbar (The Greatest Master), who exemplify the religion of the heart, which this work reflects unequivocally.-Journal of the Muhyiddin Ibn 'Arabi Society, Vol. 44, 2008"},{"Title":"An introduction to Sufi doctrine","review":"The only reason why I am giving this book three stars is the title is misleading. In reality it is not an introduction to Sufi doctrine but rather a philosophical discourse on some of the metaphysical theories of Ibn 'Arab and Abdul Karim Jili. I do not recommend this book to anyone who wants a basic and general introduction to Islamic Mysticism/Spirituality, ie Sufism. The author mainly discusses Ibn 'Arabi's theory of 'Wahdatul Wujood' (The Unity of Being) and Jili's theory of the 'Insan Kamil'(Perfected Man). Although these two concepts did have a lasting impact on Sufi thought, to reduce Sufism to a few metaphysical concepts is an inaccurate representation due to several reasons. Firstly, Sufism is not merely philosophical discourse but first and foremost moral and spiritual refinement. Secondly, not all Sufis accepted Ibn 'Arabi's theory of the Unity of Being. Thirdly, Sufism existed long before Ibn 'Arabi. If anyone wanted to have some exposure to Ibn 'Arabi and Jili's theories then this book might be a good start (although it is very deep and maybe is a bit advanced for an 'introduction'). However I did like how the author made connections between certain Sufi concepts and Eastern Orthodox theology/mysticism, such as Gregory Palamas' theology on the Essence and Divine Un-created Energies of God, and how this corresponds to the Sufi understanding of the Divine Essence (Dhat) and the Divine Names and Attributes. Overall, it is a good book but not as an introduction to Sufism. For a general introduction to Sufism I would recommend Martin Ling's 'What is Sufism'."},{"Title":"The Modern New Testament from Aramaic","review":"If your a Cristian, you must read this translation.

Frankly, before picking up this book, I had never heard of Olympe Bhly-Qu&eacute;num, a writer from the former French colony of Dahomey, which became Benin some years after its independence in 1960. The introduction to the book suggests that the author was ignored in the '60s because he wasn't anti-colonialist enough, because he didn't concentrate on that theme or on the racism of European colonisers. I might suggest another reason. SNARES WITHOUT END is a strange book because it is really two books, one of which probably should not have been published. The first 113 pages tell a simple, almost lyrical tale of village life, love, and tragedy. The second part is a confusing mess which tries to continue the story, using a few of the same characters, but introducing large numbers of others, none of whom are developed. The ending of the second part could have been dramatic, but instead, trickles to a close, as if the author said to himself, &quot;Well, I've got to end this someplace. Maybe here would be good.&quot; Though the book is far from a literary masterpiece, the first lyrical part is worth reading as an African view of Africa, or the African view of an ideal family and way of life. What is also interesting is the way this Dahomeyan writer presents his society. You can read the famous anthropological works of Herskovits; you can read Frank Yerby's &quot;The Dahomeyan&quot;, or Judith Gleason's &quot;Agtime&quot; or &quot;The Viceroy of Ouidah&quot; by Bruce Chatwin. All these works give an outsider's view of a fascinating part of the world. But by reading THIS book, you can get an insider's view of what all the others described as outsiders. If that interests you, get hold of this book, but don't expect great literature."},{"Title":"Holy Meal, A: The Lord's Supper in the Life of the Church","review":"This academic treatise on the concept of communion is both exciting and enthralling. If you are a person of faith, the book will grab you and help draw you into a deeper understanding of your own approach to this table, and those who come to it beside you. It begins with a tour through the Old Testament. \\"The first human parents were invited to eat, with the proviso that their eating was to be an expression of thankfulness, obedience, and dependence on God. Alas, it was in their eating that they chose to disobey.\\" (p.11) From this example in the beginning, to the meal with Abraham, through the manna in the desert, Gordon shows us the importance of eating, and the importance of the fellowship meal through the whole history of God and God's peoples.From there, Smith proceeds to examine the different interpretations of signs, sacraments and symbols. Through such, a reader will grow in understanding of others who draw near to God through this event. Then he goes on to examine the holy meal in light of seven words: remembrance, communion, forgiveness, covenant, nourishment, anticipation and Eucharist. \\"The biblical perspective, however; allows the past to shape, inform and transform our present and give significance to our lives, our relationships and our work.\\" (p.38) Then from that perspective, he takes us on a tour of force through the seven terms and their meaning, through scriptures and community and breaking of bread and how the three become one in sustaining our faith, our hope and our life.Smith draws this conclusion \\"The Lord's Supper is the meal of the church and together with the Word and prayer, the event that enables the community of faith to be a dynamic living body, drawing energy and grace from the fountainhead of life, Jesus Christ.\\" (p.121) Yet throughout all of his examinations he maintains a respect and reverence for traditions other than his own, and through this book we may come to appreciate others' approaches to this holy meal. Smith makes it clear that we each have different lingo and understanding of this event. \\"There is, though, a certain irony when it comes to the nomenclature used for this meal. Roman Catholics speak of the Eucharist, Anglicans often call it Holy Communion, and most Protestants call it the Lord's Supper. Yet it is interesting that most evangelical Protestants are a bit uncomfortable with the idea that this is actually a meal. The idea that we \`feed on Christ in our hearts' is overlooked in most evangelical contexts.\\" (p.83) Each tradition brings something from which the others can learn, and with Smith as our guide, that will happen."},{"Title":"Holy Meal, A: The Lord's Supper in the Life of the Church","review":"The author Gordon T. Smith is a former dean at Regent College, with a PhD from Loyola. I don't know what theological camp he belongs to (other tahn Evangelical), and he tries hard to be very ecumenical in this work. The fact that he quotes Tozer and A.B. Simpson 3 or 4 times (inferior sources to the others he quotes - Calvin, Wainwright, Schmemann, C.H. Dodd, Berkouwer, etc.) makes me think he might have a CMA-ish or Wesleyan background. I read a book he did on calling a few years ago, and it struck me as competent but unoriginal (a flatter Eugene Petersen-esque sort of book), and not as helpful as Os Guiness, The Call or James Petty Step by Step (1999).Anyway, this new book on the Supper is VERY helpful. Very concise -- just 114pp. of joy. Part I (30pp.) is a little cliched and dry, but Part 2 is really amazing. In seven small chapters he highlights different Biblical aspects of the meal. 1. Remembrance (its not only a memorial, but it is a memorial); 2. Communion (fellowship); 3. Forgiveness (Table of mercy); 4. Covenant (renewal of bpatismal vows); 5. Nourishment (bread from Heaven); 6. Anticipation (declaration of hope); 7. Eucharist (joyous thanksgiving).Reminds me alot of Peter Leithart's chapters in Blessed are the Hungry, but more tightly organized, less speculative, and more concise. I disagree with Smith sometimes, but these are generally good. He tries to stick with a Mere Christianity approach and is good at avoiding marking his theological boundaries or entering into the conflicts. He has a way of stating each of these 7 aspects positively and biblically so that a Calvinist, Catholic and Zwinglian could all take something away from it.A few examples of things I liked:From part I: Discusses eating as spiritual practice; a meal in which we celebrate the reign of God and communicate that we are a people who live in this reign. (p.9). \\"Our social context encourages us to make our own choices, live our own lives, and engage with others only when we think they have something to offer us. This is not a Christian spirituality. (p.10-11). I John 1:3-4 reminds us that joy is made complete when we are in fellowship with God and one another.\\"As Alexander Schmemann [Orthodox] has observed, the origianl sin of Genesis 3 is not so much that Adam and Eve acted willfully but that they were no longer hungry for God and looking to God for 'life' Their eating was a violation of life because they ate in disobedience but ALSO because they ignored God in their eating.\\" (p. 16).Part II random notes:p. 48 Richard Baxter (not as low sacramentology as other Puritans): \\"on where is God so near to man as in Jesus Christ, and NOWHERE IS CHRIST SO FAMILIARLY REPRESENTED TO US AS IN HIS HOLY SACRAMENT.\\"In the Nourishment chapter (pp.81ff.) Smith rightly gives Calvinists credit for emphasizing this aspect of the meal (bread of Heaven, means of grace). But he also notes that it is a strong image in Wesley too (something to like about Wesley for a change). He footnotes a paper by Leanne Van Dyke \\"Reformed Sacramental Theology\\" a 2002 paper given at AAR that I want to get ahold of that. She is a conservative Barthian, a very good scholar, and Reformationally oriented.In the Anticipation he gives some more interetsing stuff on Schmemann. \\"Schmemann...stresses that the L S is an event in space and time, in THIS space and time, in the here and now, in the uncertainities and discouragemnet of this time. In other words, the LS is not an escape from our time or place. ...On the contrary, this event is very much one in which we participate as those who are unavoidably in this world....when..we enter into thsi meal...we participate in what we HOPE for, the future renewal of creation....The LS cuts the cord of cynicism and defeatism.....\\" (p. 95).George Herbert on p.114."},{"Title":"Holy Meal, A: The Lord's Supper in the Life of the Church","review":"Our Bible study group chose to read this book during Lent, in part because two of our members (both men, one 26 and one 34) did not understand the importance of communion. One grew up in a home church and viewed it as ritualistic and the other did not grow up in the church at all and viewed it merely as a way to eat during church. After this study both men understood the importance of communion as a Christ-given privilege, and everyone else felt much more impacted by the incredible truths and information in the book. I cannot recommend this book enough, especially for a group study.I contacted the author and asked if he had any ideas on how to approach his book with a Bible study and here is exactly what he said to me (copied directly from his email to me on 3/6/09):If a small group were meeting weekly through Lent . . . perhaps 7 times, to reflect on the meaning of the Lord's Supper, one word at a time. The weekly gathering could perhaps be structured like this:(1) Scripture reading -- reading the text that is the focus for the word. Each chapter on the seven words references a text of Scripture that highlights that meaning of the Lord's Supper(2) Invite folks who have read the chapter in advance to comment on (a) what caught their attention and impressed them -- either a new learning or a good reminder (in that chapter); and (b) what perhaps, if anything, furrowed their brow . . . maybe they did not understand or disagreed with something or perhaps something in the chapter raised a question for them.(3) Very important to reflect out of one's own experience of the Lord's Supper and so for each word invite participants to tell how they have experienced (if they have) that dimension of meaning. Not all will have something to offer each week; but if one or two in the group can speak of the theme of remembrance . . . or communion . . .or anticipation . . . was meaningful to them of late or at some point in their own journey of faith, this would illumine this meaning for all around the table."},{"Title":"Holy Meal, A: The Lord's Supper in the Life of the Church","review":"I found this to be an excellent reading on the Biblical meaning of the Lord's Supper. The writing is not shallow, but neither is it overly academic. Often one's view of the Lord's Supper is skewed by the particular emphasis of our particular Christian tradition. Dr. Smith opens with discussion of the meaning of eating, symbol, and sacrament. He then looks at the Lord's Supper as described by the following seven chapter headings:Remembrance: The Lord's Supper as a MemorialCommunion: The Lord's Supper as Fellowship with Christ and with One AnotherForgiveness: The Lord's Supper as a Table of MercyCovenant: The Lord's Supper as a Renewal of Baptismal VowsNourishment: The Lord's Supper as Bread from HeavenAnticipation: The Lord's Supper as a Declaration of HopeEucharist: The Lord's Supper as a Joyous Thanksgiving CelebrationIn my own church background and circles the historic emphasis has been on the Lord's Supper as a memorial. As Smith rightly points out, the Lord's Supper is indeed a memorial, but it is not just a memorial. This realization makes the Table even more meaningful and personal.Smith does not separate the Supper from the Word or the working of the Holy Spirit. It is the Word that gives us the context and informs us of the meaning and purpose of the Supper. It is the Holy Spirit that makes the meaning and purpose of the Supper real to us in our corporate church life as well as in the individual lives of each believer participating. The author also understands there is a certain mystery to the Lord's Supper that our intellect will not fully comprehend, but it is also that same intellect that informs our humble obedience in observing the Supper.The reader may come across a statement or two in this book that may cause there eyebrows to raise in question or disagreement. Dr. Smith's own view of the Lord's Supper has roots that go back through John Calvin, and as such reflects an overall view of the Table that I am personally sympathetic to. Whatever few statements raised my eyebrows were far out weighed by the positive contribution Dr. Smith has made to the church's understanding of the Lord's Supper.If you are sensing that there is more to the Lord's Supper then your tradition's peculiar emphasis; that perhaps there is something about the meaning and purpose of the Lord's Supper that you are missing, this will be a helpful book to read."},{"Title":"Holy Meal, A: The Lord's Supper in the Life of the Church","review":"More than met my expectations. The author, who is very much an intellectual, manages to write in a style that engages the average reader without seeming to \\"talk down\\". His love for the Eucharist and fascination with all he learned in studying its various celebrations is interesting and, for me, makes the experience much more meaningful."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"Hester and William Monk become involved in the investigation of the murder of a railway executive in a brothel. At first, Hester and William are working on seperate cases (Hester finds that prostitutes are being abused by their clients from the women that come to her free clinic, and William is retained by the finacee of a young and successful railway executive to see if he is involved in fraud). Soon, Hester and William realize that their cases are connected, and William finds, as the investigation progresses, that his memory loss from a past accident is starting to come back, and that he may be involved with the railway fraud.Riveting and suspenseful, it was a hard book to put down. Another winner for Perry, and one of the best in the Hester and William Monk series."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"Latest in her series of protagonists William Monk and his wife, the former Hester Latterly, Death of a Stranger kept me guessing - unsuccessfully - to the last chapter. The Monks are admirable people, and Perry doesn't write down to her audience. This work is an equal in an excellent series."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"Death of a Stranger, Anne Perry's latest installment in the William Monk series, is a good, entertaining read, but it could have used a little more meat on its bones. Perhaps Perry was rushed to meet a deadline. As Hester works in a charity medical clinic in the slums and investigates the beatings of prostitutes, and as Monk looks into the possibility of railroad fraud for a woman who is afraid for her finacee, Monk finds that, though he can't discover any current fraud, he fears that in his past life he had less than honorable dealings in another railroad fraud sixteen years ago.Monk's fear of finding that he had been involved in something illegal or immoral estranges him from Hester, and Hester is uncertain what to do about it. As the action accelerates, though, that part of the story is neglected, leaving one wishing for more character-oriented material. The two storylines-- Hester's doings in Coldbath Fields and Monk's railway investigation--do not intersect enough, and at times one must assume a conversation relaying important information between them took place. Also, whether or not (or, if he does, how) Monk confides his fears and certain important events and information to Hester, we are not told, and since much of the first half of the book deals with that issue, it's strange that their interactions all but cease in the last 120 pages. Basically, I was left feeling that the book needed a few more scenes depicting Hester's and Monk's interactions were needed. Monk certainly spends a lot of time in the first half of the book agonizing about how Hester would feel about him if he had done something wrong in the past, but there is no resolution, or confrontation of this issue as one would expect. Perhaps in the next Monk/Hester novel this will come out, but it would have been appropriate in Death of a Stranger. Lack of it gives a somewhat sketchy, unfinished feel.There were also some small inconsistencies (or seeming inconsistencies) that niggle slightly. The woman Monk undertakes an investigation for, Katarina Harcus, is a strong, interesting character, but I think some readers will start to figure her out before Monk does. However, the subplot with Rathbone (who is getting over Hester) helping Hester investigate beatings of prostitutes is excellent.There are three reasons to read a Perry novel, the fine mysteries she cooks up, the descriptions of Victorian England, and the new information and insights into her characters. Unfortunately, the third element is not as srong as could be; I missed the richness of Hester and Monk's relationship that's more evident in earlier installments. An opportunity for Hester and Monk to face a real problem in their marriage is missed, and it shows. However, the unexpected (and unexpectedly action-packed) denoument is top-notch. Other positives include a practically laugh-out-loud funny sequence in which Rathbone helps Hester uncover the prostitutes' persecutor and the (re)introduction of spunky young Margaret, a well-to-do young woman who helps Hester in her clinic. Followers of the series will enjoy this latest book, and with its revelations about Monk's past, it's not to be missed."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"Death of A Stranger is the first book I've read by Anne Perry. It involves the death of a railway magnate in a sleazy brothel, which has shocked high society in Victorian London. In addition, the plot involves private investigator William Monk's acquisiton of a mysterious new client who asks him to determine whether her new fiance, a railway-firm executive, has become involved in fraudulent practices. Perry does a good job in describing the detail and mood of Victorian London and in creating interesting characters; particularly in regards to evolving her two main characters, William Monk and his wife, Heather. If mood and character development are what drive your interest in a mystery than Death Of A Stranger is right up your alley. However, while these qualities are important to me as well, I require a much faster-paced plot and some surprising twists and turns, which, unfortunately this book seriously lacks. As such, I at times found it to be tedious and somewhat boring, and oftentimes considered it to be very slow-moving. Death Of A Stranger is not a bad book, it's just not one I'd recommend highly to you."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"I recently read The Shifting Tide and was most impressed with the book. Not having read other books in the William Monk series, I decided to work backward to see what I had missed. Alas, I found that so far The Shifting Tide was the best of the lot. So if you are thinking about this book, but haven't read The Shifting Tide, I suggest you move on to that one instead . . . unless you have a compulsion to read every book in the series.William Monk is a man who doesn't know who he is. An accident cost him his memory, but in this book facts and vague memories combine to help him reconstruct part of his past. Now, he earns a living as a private enquiry agent in Victorian England. He is married to the redoubtable Hester who runs a charity clinic for ladies of the night in one of London's worst neighborhoods.As the story opens, a famous railroad entrepreneur and financier is found dead inside a notorious house of ill repute. Outraged by the apparent murder, the police are expected to cure the age-old problem of men and one of the oldest professions. Soon, everyone is starving, and the violence increases against the women. Hester is kept busy trying to sew up their wounds and setting their bones. She soon realizes that she needs to solve the murder if she is really to help her patients.William is hired by Katrina Harcus, the fianc&eacute;e of a well-to-do Londoner, who wants to be certain that her fianc&eacute; is not involved in something untoward. She's overheard scraps of conversation that make her feel that a great crime is about to happen.The plot bogs down as William is seemingly blocked by both his amnesia and a psychological inability to draw conclusions from the plain words that Katrina shares with him. It's one of the most block-headed investigations you will ever have to read about. The story is saved at the end by the tale finally unfolding in dramatic fashion.Hester's tracking down of the murderer of the magnate is the better part of the story. If William's part had been left out or edited down, this would have been a four-star book. As it is, you will have to enjoy reading lengthy self-examinations by a confused amnesiac to avoid falling to sleep as you read this slow-moving story.What makes the book fascinating are the marvelous details and local color about London's seamy side and the development of England's railways. It almost makes you wish Ms. Perry wrote nonfiction books."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"In her new clinic providing medical treatment to injured prostitutes, no questions asked, former Crimean War nurse Hester Monk takes care of several women during an apparently ordinary night. She's troubled by the severity of two women's injuries, though, and she also worries about the clinic's greedy landlord. Soon afterward a new client engages Hester's husband, private enquiry agent and former police inspector William Monk. The new client presents him with a case that stirs up buried flashes from Monk's past, before the carriage accident that robbed him of his memory. The bits and pieces he now recalls frighten him so badly that he cannot bring himself to share them with Hester, whom he met after the accident and who has married the man he is now - not the man he was then. Monk has grown used to viewing his former self as a stranger would, gleaning information from the reactions of people who knew him then and from whatever documents he can find, but he will never grow accustomed to disliking that former self. As this new case develops, he must look back into his old life and discover why the buried memories now carry unbearable guilt. What did he do, and how may knowing about it now change the new life he has built so painfully?Perry's Monk series always interests me because of the questions it asks, as its protagonist struggles with a past self he does not recall and does not even like. What really makes us who we are? William Monk is forced to find out, in this book even more than in some of the others featuring him. The plot does hinge on one huge coincidence, but it is a coincidence of the sort that happens to real people in real life. The final pages are riveting, and the conclusion a satisfying one.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Each book brings Monk closer to the truth of his life before his accident. Hester, as usual, is fighting the morals battles of women and the poor. She reasons that prostitution is bad, but that women have few avenues open for earning wages. Monk investigates fraud in land deals and the operations of the railroad. Anne Perry writes in the detailed style of Elizabeth George, but provides less psychological analysis than George.

So i picked up a copy of the book, and I must say I was rather impressed! She writes from true life and frankly, this novel gave me chills! I suggest viewing the film and then rereading her novels, it makes them far more compelling."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"I don't believe Anne Perry could write a bad book if you &lt;smile> put a derringer to her head, but William and Hester Monk's latest case \\"Death of a Stranger\\" is definitely a series milestone and a solid gold reading experience. After their return from America, William has resumed his private investigative practice while Hester is donating her time and nursing expertise at a clinic in Coldbath Square which her friend Callandra Daviot has established to provide medical care for women of the streets. When a wealthy railroad magnate is found brutally murdered in a squalid brothel in that area, suspicion falls on the women whom Hester is trying to help. Attempting to prove their innocence, she stumbles upon a plot to force gently-bred women into usurious debt and prostitution and resolves with or without Monk's assistance to put a stop toit. Naturally, she needs some help, so she turns to series regular, Sir Oliver Rathbone, with fascinating results. Meanwhile Monk has acquired a new client: Katrina Harcus, a beautiful and enigmatic woman who is concerned that her fiance, a trusted employee of the murdered man, may be involved in some kind of fraud in connection with a new and highly secret railroad project that the company is presently undertaking. When Monk agrees to handle her case and looks over the relevant papers that she has brought him, they evoke tragic echoes from his own past which start to shake him loose from his amnestic fog. Inevitably his and Hester/Rathbone's separate investigations intertwine, and another shocking death pulls the triumvirate deeper and deeper into the terrible implications of old horrors that suddenly threaten to become life-endangering present realities. The final pages of this brilliant piece of Victoriana held me completely spellbound.Anne Perry is utterly addictive. I truly envy readers who encounter her chosen milieu for the first time because they have so many wonderful adventures yet to explore. Fortunately for those of us who absolutely require a regular Pitt/Monk 'fix', Ms. Perry's fertile imagination coupled with a prolific pen keeps devising newer and increasingly intricate, psychologically-fraught investigations for each of her two detective couples to pursue, and the wait between novels is never unbearably long. Her books just keep getting better and better, but \\"Death of a Stranger\\" is an especially satisfying and rich reward for our patience."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"I admit when I read the publisher's blurb about this book claiming that William Monk would regain his memory I was very worried that after the suspense of his past being drawn out for twelve books that Anne Perry was suddenly going to play the entire card with a wishy-washy explanation for his sudden regaining of memory.Thankfully, that's not the case. This is quite probably my favorite Monk novel since \\"The Sins of the Wolf\\". Great character development, and an intriguing mystery. The details of Monk's mentor and his ruin are worth the anticipation Ms. Perry's built up over the past few books, though in no way does he regain the entire memory of his life.Katrina Harcus is a fascinating character, and while I figured out her actions, her motivation remained a mystery until the courtroom. Rathbone's moved beyond his lovelorn feelings for Hester, which is a great relief, and it was great to see *him* holding all the cards to figure out the mystery before Monk and Hester for once. Margaret Ballinger's a good match for him, and I greatly look forward to seeing more of her in future books.Now, I admit I wavered between sympathy and irritation with Monk's reticence to talk to Hester about the entire affair. It seemed to be made clear in \\"Slaves of Obsession\\" that she cared only about the man he was, not who he had been. But then, none of us can truly appreciate losing our entire memory and finding it out piece by piece, and Ms. Perry does an excellent job of suggesting what it might be like for such a man. Another bit of confusion was some dates that don't seem to fit with earlier books, but I can easily overlook that in favor of a very good tale.The mystery of railroad fraud is well-done, with the heat turned up when murder occurs. Characters both new and old are skillfully written, and it's worth reading for the details of Monk's past alone. Here's looking forward to the next entry, where perhaps Monk can finally find some peace about his past.\\"Death of a Stranger\\" is a moving book, as much about Monk's fears and longing for redemption as the actual mystery of fraud, and that sort of empathy we develop with her characters is what places Anne Perry a cut above the rest. 5 stars, happily given."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"Other reviews give excellent hints of the plot, so that is not my purpose. Rather, I like to let a potential shopper know whether or not the book being reviewed is, in my opinion, worth the cover price and whether or not he or she should go ahead and put this book in his/her shopping basket. In this case, go ahead.This is directed mostly to Anne Perry fans that normally like her &quot;William Monk&quot; series. You will enjoy this new Monk novel. Once I got to Chapter Three, I pretty much had to read the book all the way through. Once I got near the end, I couldn't put it down until the story was finished.Let me praise Ms. Perry for departing from her usual sordid crimes. This is the second such Monk book that centers around a &quot;standard&quot; crime.Let me also praise Carl D. Galian for an excellent jacket design. Sometimes I like his jackets better than the story. This time, I liked both.Although I found the mystery part of the story quite compelling, I withheld one star because I just cannot stand Ms. Perry's philosophizing. Her plots are good enough without her wasting my time filling her story with controversial issues which may be her niche, but I cannot stand it.As I said, philosophy aside, the story was great. Ms. Perry is a master at teasing the reader. Monk, as the fan knows, lost his memory in an accident. Ms. Perry begins to tease some of it back, but in just the tiniest, most tantalizing tidbits that keeps the reader nervous until the very end of the story. If you are a lip-chewer, then beware, get your lip protection cream handy.Thumbs Up for Anne Perry once again."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"I really enjoy Anne Perry's books, especially her ongoing romance between William Monk and his wife Hester. Her description of these characters and the people in their world is really detailed and fascinating. 'Death of a Stranger' is beautifully written (as always) and enjoyable. My only caviat is that Perry's in-depth look at the railway industry is almost overwhelming. She adds so much detail about the day to day workings of steam engines that is tends to draw the reader away from the plot. Granted, there are many details about steam engines that are important to solving the book's mystery, but if more chapters are needed by the publisher, more Hester and William scenes would be welcome (less historical engineering). This is a lovely, beautifully written book, and anyone who enjoys historical mysteries will be captivated."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"I always look forward to a new Anne Perry book. Every one is a winner. This one was no exception.The characters and places were so real I was transported back to Victorian times with them.William was torn between finding out about about his past andnot really wanting to know. I thought he was a litte in love with Katrina dispite his love for Hester.Hester was as strong a character as ever, working amongst and helping the prostitutes of London's East End She is determinedto solve the mystery and find the murderer in order to help William.Once again her friend and old suitor Oliver Rathbone came to her aid. This time with a hint of a romance tocome with a colleague of Hester's.As usual the plot had a few different story lines all coming together as the story unfolded. This was a real nail biter .I cant say I couldn't put it down because actually it was the audio book I listened to. Thanks again to Anne and also to Terence Hardiman for the wonderful way he bought the characters to life. Cant wait for the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"I have to admit that I was once an avid fan of the Monk/Hester series but after reading 1999's The Twisted Root and guessing in the first chapter both the social ill du jour and the identity of the murderer I gave up reading her books for a while. However, I was very pleased to see Anne Perry back in something like her old form in this book.The parts of the book dealing with Monk's partially recovered memory and Hester's battle to improve the condition of street prostitutes in London are very interesting. The morally ambiguous position Hester finds herself in provides food for thought. However, there was something a touch disturbing about the callousness of Monk's deceased mentor toward everyone but Monk and the denoument (while exciting enough) seems a bit cobbled onto the story.The story also relies too much on coincidence. The person who has the information needed is killed before he can reveal it, the person who needs most to conceal evidence lays hands on it, even after a police search of the premises. Some coincidence is understandable, but when it starts to take over the plot it becomes annoying.Also, I wish someone could explain the switching system that allowed the wreck the author describes. It seems that the switch (points in British rail terms) would be against one of the trains and it would have derailed at the switch instead of the wreck happening as she decribed."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"This novel is set in London, England, in the early 1860s. The Civil War is being fought in the United States while life goes on as usual in England. The situation described in the novel was usual for that time period, and is similar to the real circumstances that prevailed in my hometown, at that time a notorious sailing port in the U.S., during the later 19th century - a reformer trying to clean up the town soon discovered that most of the &quot;good citizens&quot; were getting their share of the pie, the prostitutes paid in cash and were a mainstay of the town's economy (see &quot;Port Townsend - An Illustrated History of Shanghaiing, Shipwrecks, Soiled Doves, and Sundry Souls&quot;).Hester Monk (who had been a nurse in the Crimea) operates an infirmary in a lower class neighborhood, offering medical services to the ladies of the evening who are suffering from injuries and diseases. Her husband, William Monk, is involved in an investigation of possible financial wrongdoing among the principals of a railroad company. The death of a &quot;respectable&quot; man outside a bordello in the area creates a turmoil and eventually events are drawn together.Circumstances reveal a brutal form of loan sharking. William's investigation brings out information about his past - he was not always a nice person. Past relationships are revealed as the case draws to a conclusion. Overall, an interesting plot, with a good picture of the underside of Victorian London."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"I am a huge fun of Anne Perry and especially William and Hester Monk. What makes this book so special, is that Monk finally breaks the barrier to his amnesia, and remembers his past life. Another reason why this was a page turner for me is that I'm a huge railway fan, and this book is so full of rich detail about 19th century building of railroads in Britain. I have done numerous papers on railways, and Ms. Perry's facts are very well researched, but the reader also gets a glimpse of what the common people had to sacrifice for the good of the Iron Horse. Progress then was opposed as it is so often now because of the loss to the environment, people, floral or fauna. This is a great book, and I can only caution that new readers to William and Hester Monk should not start with this book. I think all of the preceeding novels must be read before this one can be fully appreciated. Thank you Ms. Perry for a wonderul series."},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"William Monk considers himself very lucky that Hester loves him as much as he loves her. Their marriage is a good one despite the fact that William still suffers from amnesia and much of his past remains a blank. As an enquiry agent, William takes on various cases that his clients don't want the police to know about, such as the one with Katrina HarcusKatrina wants Monk to find out if her suitor, Michael Dolgarno, a junior partner in a company building railroads, is involved in illegal activities, possibly land fraud. The deeper Monk digs into the case, old memories begin to reawaken and the enquiry agent is afraid that at one time he may have been involved in something illegal. Unable to turn for comfort to Hester, Monk is determined to find out the truth about his past once and for all and though he knows his client is a fool he starts making inquiries.Fans of this series will be delighted to know that the tortured hero finally regains a good chunk of his memory and with it a measure of peace. The story line is fascinating with a climax so shocking that readers will remember it in the years to come and wonder how Anne Perry will top this vivid picture of what it means to be poor in the mid-nineteenth century England.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger","review":"OK, I admit I LOVE Anne Perry.

The chief fault he found with it was that no millionaire would do X to himself just to take vengeance on another person (read Chandler's essay to see what X might be). The only problem with Chandler's statement is that he is wrong! The millionaire did NOT do what Chandler says he did. And yet several \\"standard\\" reference books quote or paraphrase Chandler as if he were right. (Now THAT IS A MYSTERY. Do critics occasionally plagiarize from others without reading the books they comment on? Or do they just have faulty memories? Or are they deliberately playing fast and loose with facts and trusting that nobody can tell the difference? Or what?)TRENT'S LAST CASE is actually a very cleverly plotted mystery novel that has two major twists AFTER Philip Trent believes he has solved the shooting of millionaire Sigsbee Manderson. What this essentially means (SEMI-SPOILER ALERT) is that Trent has been mistaken in his first solution--and that the second solution, which is handed to him by another person (the one that Chandler and others seem to be remembering), is ALSO mistaken. The final twist, which occurs naturally enough in the last few pages, provides the REAL solution (which Chandler and others appear to have forgotten).Anyway, these twists (which neither Trent nor most readers could foresee) are plausible enough when they have been laid out for us, and they provide us with most of the pleasure of the story. The main fault I find with this mystery is that the embedded love story (which does serve a key role in the overall plot) does not seem believable to me. (Other readers may differ, and indeed readers of 1913 might have considered it totally in line with how people felt and acted back then.)If you read and enjoy this novel, the good news is that E. C. Bentley later wrote 13 good short mystery stories about Philip Trent that are prequels to this book. Twelve of them were published in TRENT INTERVENES (1938), and the last one, titled \\"Ministering Angel,\\" appeared in THE STRAND magazine in Nov. 1938 and has been anthologized in at least 3 books that are fairly easy to find."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case (Unabridged Classics in Audio)","review":"This quick read was an entertaining glimpse into early last century detective fare.

HOWEVER, beware of the edition published by Kessinger. It is apparently an unedited, unproofread and minimally (if at all) formatted direct printout of the open source copy available on Gutenberg.org. (This was verified by comparing the typos in the two versions. They're identical.) It appears that what this outfit does is downloads/copies/cuts-and-pastes the text file, converts it to a proportional font, and prints it as is. Superficially, the result looks respectable enough, until you start to read the thing. First, there's the book's odd format -- 7 1/2 x 9 1/4 inches -- about the size and shape of, say, your child's math workbook. It's awkward to handle and the simple mechanics of reading becomes an unpleasant chore. The text is properly single spaced, however there's a double space between each paragraph. This brings the eye up short and makes your brain involuntarily expect some sort of climax.At the end of each PARAGRAPH, mind you.Imagine a page or two of dialogue.Talk about interrupting......the flow.In short, this is a very annoying publication, made more so by the fact that there's nothing on the Amazon page or the publisher's web site to indicate the nature of this product.

Fans of Christie or Chesterton will thoroughly enjoy it. To say more might give something away, so I will not."},{"Title":"Trent's Last Case (Unabridged Classics in Audio)","review":"Scholars consider it the first modern mystery novel. Agatha Christie called it \\"one of the three best detective stories ever written;\\" G.K. Chesterton went further, calling it \\"the finest detective story of modern times.\\" The ever-erudite Dorothy Sayers flatly stated that every mystery novelist owed something to \\"its liberating and inspiring influence.\\" Today, however, the vast majority of the reading public has never even heard of it.The novel, of course, is E.C. Bentley's TRENT'S LAST CASE. By most accounts, Bentley wrote the book on a dare--much as Agatha Christie would later write THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES. When financier Sigsbee Manderson is found murdered at his country home, a London newspaper dispatches part-time artist, part-time journalist Trent to the scene. Within three days Trent cracks the case... or so he thinks. But is his solution correct? Or will it result in a terrible miscarriage of justice?From a 2005 standpoint, TRENT'S LAST CASE is not a remarkable novel. Published in 1913, it feels overwritten, wordy, more Victorian in style than modern--and while the plot itself is interesting, it hardly compares to the unexpected twists offered by the very writers who so praised it and who were so influenced by it. But the fact remains that it was the first: Poe may have created the detective story and such writers as Doyle, Collins, and Dickens may have wrung romantic changes upon the theme, but it really wasn't until TRENT'S LAST CASE that the mystery novel as we presently think of it was born.Most contemporary readers will likely find Bentley's style tough going, and although extremely influential the triple-twist plot has been done with considerably more drama in later novels. But say what you like, TRENT'S LAST CASE really is \\"the first,\\" and that counts for a lot.

Bentley (July 10, 1875 - March 30, 1956), was a popular English novelist and humorist of the early twentieth century, and the inventor of the clerihew, an irregular form of humorous verse on biographical topics.Born in London, Bentley worked as a journalist on several newspapers, including the Daily Telegraph. His first published collection of poetry, titled Biography for Beginners (1905), popularized the clerihew form; it was followed by two other collections, in 1929 and 1939. His detective novel, Trent's Last Case (1913), was much praised, numbering Dorothy L. Sayers among its admirers, and with its labyrinthine and mystifying plotting can be seen as the first truly modern mystery.

Appearing in 1913, \\"Trent's Last Case\\" is among the first classic English country murder mysteries. It's all butlers, country houses, motor-cars and dressing for dinner, sprinkled with wry observations on the manners of the wealthy, country folk, inn keepers, servants upstairs and downstairs, police inspectors, husbands, widows, American secretaries and French maids.We begin with our man Trent arriving in town to investigate a murder. The plot is brisk, without enough clues to make it a whodunit. Trent's an established painter with a national reputation as an amateur detective and newspaper correspondent. An amateur sleuth would be incomplete without a nemesis, so we have a long-time friendly rival, Inspector Murth. The presumption of a long history and the effortlessness of the characters' interactions was drawn beautifully.

The workbook holds your hand and walks you through PL/SQL programming, every step of the way."},{"Title":"Oracle PL/SQL Interactive Workbook","review":"With over twenty years in large scale IT development using Java/C++/C/Assembly languages on Unix/Windows 2000/NT platforms, but a neophyte with PL/SQL, I needed a PL/SQL package that would assume no background knowledge in PL/SQL, get me up to speed fast, and at the same time be comprehensive. In other words, I wanted everything. This package no only satisfied this need, but opened up new avenues of thought concerning approaches to database programming. The book is simply matchless (it should get 6 stars--an extra star for the terrific exercises that incorporate hidden pearls of IT wisdom), and yes I have perused others on the market. Ms. Silvestrova demonstrates that she is a consummate professional. The flow of the book, depth of the hands-on exercises, and scope of material is an inimitable combination. This so far may sound over-glowing, but a workman is worthy of her hire. I would recommend this package to any introductory or middle level PL/SQL student. If you desire to be a competent PL/SQL professional, look no further. If you desire to have a guide that provides you with a solid answer to specific types of PL/SQL problems, look no further. However, if you seek a slick product that spoon feeds you programming palaver (under the guise of teaching), fly you fool: you have many under-performing options available."},{"Title":"Oracle PL/SQL Interactive Workbook","review":"Overall this book is is great for someone new to programming and/or Oracle PL/SQL.

Choose all that apply.A) All memory holds on the data have been released.B) All data inserts are available to other users.C) You have to get married.D) The transaction is not finished because SQL statements are still pending.Well in the book they have the answers as: A, B, and Yes, EVEN C.

Yes there are a number of typos but the the associated web page for the book is mentioned many times and the first page has all the corrections.

The author makes it clear that it is impossible to learn the actual technique from this or any other book, but, as a long time meditator myself, I know that most people I've given the book to have wanted to take an in-person course after reading it.That's because it reveals in a very accessible way the deep principles underlying the mechanics of the technique rather than just reciting a series of testimonials. The technique is worth the time and money needed to take the personal course of instruction, and this book will help you determine if it's for you.

Recently, I picked up the first one, The Fellowship of the Rings, and I found that those people were flat wrong. The books have aged well. The characters are extremely interesting and loveable and the plot is well paced and exciting.The Two Towers picks up right where Fellowship left off. The narrative is split between the two divisions of the fellowship. The first two books follow Merry, Pippin, Gimli, Legolas, Aragorn, and others as they join forces with the Ents (the coolest characters in the series so far) to fight against the rising power of Saruman. The last two books in The Two Towers follow Frodo and Sams' continuing quest into Mordor to try and destroy the ring. They face some interesting obstacles, and there are quite a few plot twists in the narrative.The Two Towers is a truly entertaining read. The narrative in this is pretty fast-paces (except for one section at the beginning). There are some new characters and creatures which are really interesting. The conflicts are intense, and there are a lot of plot twists to keep you entertained. The book is especially exciting near the end. It really leaves you needing to read the last chronicle. I can't wait to experience the rest of The Lord of the Rings. I only wish I hadn't waited so long to get to it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the second piece to the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the story gets divided up into two parts. The first is concerning Arogorn and Gimli and Legolas and it is my favorite part of the series. Tolkien is a master at building up the tension and then leaving the reader hanging by moving on to another side of the story. The timing and portrail of the story is the best there is for story telling in any fashion. The second part moves on to Frodo and Sam's journey into Mordor and it is eary and dark. The description of this evil country leaves the reader thankful that he does not have to make such a journey himself. The characters grow and are quite changed by the events that surround them. I always thought that if the characters were not changed by a story, then how is the reader ever going to be affected? Well, no lack of that here. Please read and you will charish this world for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part to the Lord of the Rings and contains book three and four. Without reading Fellowship of the Ring, the part of the novel which takes place before The Two Towers, this book would not make any sense at all. However, for those who have read the first part, The Two Towers extends the story for another 400 pages or so of pure pleasure.The story begins where Fellowship of the Ring left off- orcs attacking the fellowship which has been scattered, and Frodo and his servant Sam leaving by boat on their own path to Mount Doom. As one might come to realize, The Two Towers is just as good if not better than Fellowship of the Ring. This book contains a lot of fighting, even right from the first several pages. Much like Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers leaves the reader in a very serious cliff hanger. When I read the end, I couldn't wait any longer than it took to obtain the third book; as soon as I finished the last page, I got into my car, drove to the nearest book store and picked up the third part to the series.Anyone who is a fan of the first book would be committing a crime if they didn't read the second. The Two Towers is a great book. Not at any point does this part become boring and is magnicifently composed just as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King are."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The reviewer who stated that, compared to the LOTR, all other books seem pointless and dull, really nailed it. One of its most compelling aspects for me is that practically the entire thing takes place in the mountains. Those of us who spend most of our recreational time in the hills, whether clinging to the side of a rock face, walking among ancient trees, or floating down a river, will find chapters that resonate clearly and speak to our inate sense of adventure and wonder. Tolkien clearly was a nature lover along the lines of John Muir, indeed I cannot but believe that Tolkien was exposed to Muir's writings at some point. Having read most of Tolkien's writings that are extant, my personal favorite passages are from Unfinished Tales, with its fleshed out versions of Turin's misfortunes and triumphs, and his uncle Tuor's epiphany at Vinyamar, and The Fellowship of the Ring's sojourn at Rivendell, with Bilbo's brilliant &quot;Flammifer of Westernesse&quot; poem and the ominous red star in the sky that &quot;glared above the trees&quot; like a watchful eye. But it is the chapter from The Two Towers, &quot;The Stairs of Cirith Ungol&quot;, that stands out in my mind as a pinnacle of Tolkien's art. His description of the &quot;accursed vale&quot; of Minas Morgul, and the hobbit's ascent up into it, seem to me so vivid as to have only come from someone who had experienced some of those horrors firsthand. The phrase &quot;wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay&quot; clearly refers to the gasses that rotting corpses emit, which Tolkien more than likely experienced in the trenches of World War One, and one can picture the author reacting to these and other wartime horrors as Frodo did, &quot;his senses reeling and his mind darkening&quot; ...&quot;tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side.&quot; Also, Tolkien's most fully drawn character is presented in TTT, the enslaved Gollum, and the confrontations with Shelob, replete with moving references to &quot;the back story&quot; (&quot;...as though Earendil had himself come down from the high sunset paths&quot;) and the imprisoned light of &quot;the last Silmaril&quot; blazing forth &quot;like a white torch&quot;, are sheer genius. The LOTR's power stems partly from its ability to conjure up as plausible a link between the mythology of ancient Europe and the present day as we are likely to get, and if there really is anything in English Lit that even compares, for imaginative output and for sheer storytelling ability, then I haven't read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Interestingly enough, you could read this from start to end without having read The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Ring, but why would you want to?The Two Towers is a bit faster-paced than The Fellowship of the Ring, and the imagination factor is off the scale. Tolkien will take you to places you've never been: forests where tree-like Ents rule, or dark passages where vile creatures lurk, to name a few. Tolkien uses what I think is a brilliant strategy - he splits up his group and tells one's tale for awhile before switching to the other. You'll always be wondering about Frodo and Sam, or else Aragorn and his company at any given time. Hence, you'll end up loving the characters even more.Devour every detail of this book. It is exquisitely written, and it's a book that deserves to be read slowly and deliberately so you can soak up every last word. Tolkien writes very poetic prose. A friend much smarter than I suggested that Frodo is much like Moby Dick's main character. That is, Frodo is the &quot;archetypal Christian struggling to deal with something well past his private reality&quot; (his words). I don't agree 100 percent, but it certainly is food for thought."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second part of Lord of the Rings. It was hard to come to a decision, but I have to say that this favorite out of the three parts. With most of the questions left from The Hobbit answered in The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien kicks up the action and takes the suspense to a new direction in The Two Towers. Tolkien brilliantly split the story two ways in TTT. In doing that, Tolkien allowed himself to really develope the supporting characters more easily. This becomes so apparant at times that the lesser characters seem as important as the main character, Frodo. In fact, Frodo isn't involved in about ten chapters of TTT. It gets to be noticed that the characters experience events and situations that really changes their thoughts of perceiving their world. The Two Towers is full of twists and surprises, and it leaves you wanting more. Excellent descriptions of the regions that the Fellowship pass through overflow in this book. Like in The Fellowship of the Ring, you forget that this fantasy, as the background and lore has the sense of a real and complete history. The Two Towers, overall, has a darker mood than The Fellowship of the Ring. At the end, a feeling exists encompassing the real danger that the quest might fail. The Two Towers has one real bad aspect. Near the end, the reader can feel extreme tension and suspense because of the actions in the book. Then it flat out leaves you hanging by the neck, leaving you cursing like you never cursed before, unless you have The Return of the King waiting right there to be picked up. The Lord of the Rings is not to be checked out at the library if a person wants to check out each volume seperately. Some passages will refer the reader to a Appendix, and those are in TROTK. Check out a single volume edision instead, or better yet, buy LOTR, single volume or three volume version. Lord of the Rings should be read and experienced by everyone, and acknowledge that Tolkien was a real genius. We would have suffered greatly if he wasn't born."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Two Towers is a work incomparable to anything out there. The skill with which Tolkien weaves his world creates a vivid tour through the imagination. Every word can be noted to have meaning; each race, and person for that matter, has a different style of speech. As a story, the Two Towers works alike to the Empire Strikes Back (though I am by no means comparing the two, I believe Tolkien's work far superior...Sorry Star Wars fans). It is the second act of a play, with the heros in distress and the Fellowship trying to hang together. Sam has the ring, with Frodo left for dead by the blow from Shelob. The shadow of Sauron eats evermore into the heart of Gondor, and forces are prepared by both sides. The fate of Middle-Earth hangs in the balance by the end of this novel. The Two Towers also displays a wonderful new cast of characters: we at last meet the wiles of Saruman, see the horror of Shelob, and feel the Ents' last battle. Rohan's noble Theoden and Minas Tirith's tortured Denethor also add to the mix, contrasting with each other as the Enemy's work is revealed even in the higher tiers of the Mark and Gondor. Don't miss out on the Two Towers. It is a classic of fantasy which will live on forever in the minds of those who read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings is one of the best fictional works to date. Tolkien was a masterful story teller, one without equal. Whether you like fantasy or not, this book, along with The Fellowship of the Ring, The Return of the King, and of course The Hobbit should be part of anyones library."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"For I am too young to read this book, I secretly read it at my cousin's house.I understood most of thewords.At my school I am a score of 1023,which meaning I can read the Assasination of John F.

The Fellowship now in three units - Frodo and Sam; Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas; Merry and Pippin - Tolkien deals with each unit separately, preferring for the sake of unity to relate the fortunes of each unit for long stretches. Herein is the great triumph of Part 2 - the development of character and involvement with each that the segmenting of the Fellowship allows. Here we get depth and feeling, along with high action and truly epic scope.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; begins with the aftermath of Boromir's attack on Frodo in an attempt to wrest the One Ring from him. The Fellowship disbands - Frodo and Sam leave to try to destroy the Ring on their own, Merry and Pippin try to find them, only to be captured by Orcs, and Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn attempt to track down Merry and Pippin. The apparently dead Gandalf reappears to the third party, stronger and more committed to the goal than ever. The split action of the novel, with regard to the title, concerns the ways that the members of the Fellowship deal with the major sources of crisis facing Middle-earth: the ambitious wizard Saruman at the Tower of Orthanc in Isengard and the Dark Lord, Sauron at the Tower of Barad-dur in Mordor.One cannot get too excited about the virtues of &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; The relationships between the characters are so finely rendered - for my part, the job that Tolkien does in developing Merry, Pippin, Gimli, and Legolas is magical in itself. Merry and Pippin are underestimated and undervalued by everyone, including themselves. The illumination and discussions of their doubts, fears, and modest desires against the spectacular backdrop of millennial conflict is so understated, that the two hobbits actually bring a sense of prosaic normalcy to Tolkien's epic fantasy. Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf, members of long-antagonized peoples, thrust together by the common goal of the Fellowship, is another fascinating pairing. The contrast in their characters and the process by which they become bosom friends is lovely to behold and offers one of the great homosocial relationships I've encountered in English literature. In both cases, throughout &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; Tolkien continually privileges the individual over the national, an approach which forces war and conflict to appear as it should, as an unnatural and horrific evil in the world.The minor characters add colour and vibrant life to &quot;The Two Towers.&quot; Good characters, like the melancholy Ents; evil characters, like the eternally-infighting Orcs; and ambivalent characters, like Wormtongue and Smeagol - all contribute to the development of the primary characters, while Tolkien carefully allows these minor figures the dignity of their own histories, actions, conversations, and fleshing out. All of this adds to the complexity of the Ring saga and shows more of the intricate social and even ecological effects that the anticipated War of the Ring will have on Middle-earth.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is literally and figuratively the heart of the Ring saga. Rich in content, detail, and action, here, Tolkien's epic vision is most fully realized. Choice is a major theme of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a whole, and, again, in the many individual, minute choices made by the characters throughout Part 2, Tolkien allows us to see how the fate of people and nations can hang on the most seemingly insignificant choices. In the scope of an epic, Tolkien stresses the importance of the individual and of tolerance and patient judgment in decision making. Overall, my favourite of the three parts of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Listening to a book being read aloud by one who is good at it is a totally different experience from reading it oneself -- and Rob Inglis, who reads this second volume of the beloved trilogy, is the best there is. I have read the books many times, seen the movies, and even read it aloud myself to a hearing-impaired friend -- but still, I am enjoying listening to this story, which I love so much, and am hearing more in it than I have ever experienced before. Don't miss it; it's worth every dime, and this is one audiobook that you WON'T be selling to buy another."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second volume in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. It followsThe Fellowship of the Ringand is followed byThe Return of the King.In this part of the story, the original fellowship of nine travelers is fragmented. Some seek Mordor and the forlorn hope of destroying the one ring in the volcanic fires that produced it. Others are taken captive, and pursued by would-be rescuers. As the travelers disperse, readers become acquainted with the lands and peoples of Middle Earth. We meet the independent horsemen of Rohan, the foul orcs of Mordor, the proud men of Gondor, and the shades of past oath-breakers, eager for redemption. The schemes of wizards, stewards and wraiths become more clear. The tension builds.The middle book of the trilogy covers a lot of ground, both geographically and in character development. The characters gather their strength for war with the forces of evil. Tolkien gives his characters distinct strengths which complement the abilities of their companions. There is a growing sense that each will have a part to play in the coming conflict--a unique and indispensable part.If you have already read volume one of the trilogy, you are going to read volume two. No choice, really."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second volume in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is faster-paced than the first and grapples more directly with the dual nature of good and evil that is at the heart of each of the three books. Each element of good has its opposite. There is the dark tower and the good tower of Gondor (hence, the \\"Two Towers\\"). There is the good hobbit Frodo and his opposite Gollum who, it is hinted, is a distortion of what was once a hobbit-like creature. There are elves and orcs. There is the good wizard Gandalf and the evil Sauron.Yet, while these pairs are opposite, they are also linked. Even Saruman was at one time a good personable fellow. Gandalf fears the ring because he can see himself becoming like Saruman and Sauron.Tolkien writes near the end of the book that the ring itself brings great power and insight, but not courage. Hence Gollum wears the ring and is sniveling; Sauron, we know, would not be so; and Frodo and Sam find courage from within. All these beings, it seems, start out as morally equivalent and should see themselves in the other. It is only after the repeated stresses of power and experience that we morph toward one pole or the other until we can barely see the resemblance. What is to account for which pole one morphs toward? I don't think it's some form of inherent virtue as much as it is chance and the cumulative force of making many good (or bad) choices that ultimately so forms our character as to overwhelm us.This book introduces the most appealing character in the work -- the ents. Whatever the metaphorical significance of these enormous, tree-like creatures (perhaps, like Tom Bombadil, they represent beings with a more perfect communion with nature than man is capable of), they are so charismatic and lovable as to steal the show.Mr. Inglis' reading is itself a work of art. He's a Shakespearean actor with the ability to give each character its distinctive voice. He interprets the text without overwhelming it. Inglis has a few peers, but there is no better reader.This is an entertaining story and great literature."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is, as other reviewers have said, the only unabridged BOT version of this classic book. Rob Inglis does a great job reading.But: If you plan on downloading CDs onto your MP3 player, keep reading.The book is broken into 48 CDs (all 3 books (16 CDs per book)). And each CD is broken up into 3 min tracks (about 275 tracks per disc).And no freaking consistent organization.Each CD has a completely (ugh!!!) different way of titling the tracks.So, my Ipod now has 800+ 3 minute LOTR tracks . . . in no particular order!!!There's no way I can listen to the book in chronological order. Instead my Ipod shuffles randomly between tracks, changing every 3 minutes.It's a disaster.But I love this book. So, I'm listening anyway.It's the equivalent of cutting the book into 800 pieces, throwing them in the air, and then reading them: William S. Burroughs, please meet J.R.R.

JRR tolkein made this book much more interesting by cutting down on the explaining of the setting and a lot more about the plot. I also like the addition of the ents, they are just fun charactors that make you think a lot more, like how would a living tree look, and does it have a tongue? Overall, my favorite new charactor was King Theodin, how he is a ruler with many flaws, but he is still ruler, and you can't take that away. This book is a 10 out of 10 all the way, best book I ever read, and great for anyone who loves fantasy, action, blood, gore, and book that make you think."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book starts out from where the first book, The Fellowship, ends and makes way for the sequel, The Return of the King. Frodo and Samwise have left the Fellowship, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go chasing after the orc company that has captured Merry and Pippin. Frodo and Sam meet up with a familiar face. Also, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli find someone believed to dead. If you are expecting me to elaberate, you need to go read it yourself . \\"Do not be hasty.\\" as Treebeard (A character in the book) says (J. R. R. Tolkien, 452).There are only two main characters in the book, Frodo and Aragorn. Frodo is a courageous Hobbit (halfling) from the Shire. He has never been out of his homeland before, and is not the typical hero. Aragorn is a human ranger form the north. He is the heir to the throne of Gondor, yet he does not want to become king. The story is set in Middle Earth, a typical fantasy setting. There are four main areas each with its own geography. The Shire, in the far west is mostly forest and small hills while its neighbor to the east, Rohan, is made up of grasslands with mountains to the north. Next to the east is Gondor, which is made up of a mountain range and more grassland. Finally, in the far east is Mordor, the land of the Dark Lord, Sauron. Mordor is surrounded by a mountain range and its other land is cracked and infertile. The story is set with medieval weapons like swords and bows, but gunpowder makes an appearance in the middle of the story.This book is in the fantasy genre. The story contains elves , dwarves, halflings and humans along with various mythological creatures. Tolkien did several things well in the story. The description of the natural formations is extremely detailed and all of them seem like he was really there to describe them. The characters are also taken to great detail. All of them have intricate character and all of their aspects seem believable.The problem in the story that the characters must solve is that the ring must be destroy in Mordor. Sauron tries anything to regain control of it and if he succeeds, Middle Earth is doomed to be controlled by his might given to him by the ring.This book will be enjoyed by fans of other fantasy novel such as Eragon and the Shannara series. The stories share genres along with similar mythology. They all have the same main races along with having some sort of dark lord as the antagonist. It is better than these other novel though because it has more attracted plot and character development. The sentences and thoughts are much more complex and will be hard to grasp to younger readers.In my opinion, it is the second best in the Lord of the Rings series, following The Return of the King, but ahead of The Fellowship. It is ahead of the Fellowship because its more active start but starts slower than The Return of the King. Tolkien's description is full of complex descriptions and the sentences never get old. The British style does distract from the content for the American readers, but does not put it beyond the reach of most readers. My reactions to the book were wanting to read more and I thought that it was well done. I appreciated the detail, but the confusing names prevented me from completely understanding the plot on the first read through. On the second read though, it was much easier to grasp and I was able to grasp it perfectly. Due to the dryness of the book, it was hard to read for hours at a time, but I could easily go for twenty minutes to half an hour. This allowed me to take a break and think about the events, not just rush on to the next chapter. I rate this book five out of five."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is my favorite book out of TLOTR! In my opinion, it's much more intriguing that the The Fellowship and The Return. OK, I haven't finished The Return yet. But believe me, this one is the best. The beginning didn't thrill me that much, but I couldn't stop after I got past it. The new characters and settings made me so excited.I think the last half of The Two Towers is my favorite, because it has Gollum in it, and I was excited to hear about him again after The Hobbit.

With many loveable characters, a great story, a great new fantasy world with many place to explore, and the rich, moving storytelling were nothing people have ever seen before. Now with the books, video games, fan clubs, and three great movies, LOTR is easily one of the best stories of all time.THE BASIC PLOT: (Contains spoilers, so beware.) The Fellowship has separated. Boromir has been slain by Orcs, Gandalf the Grey fell with the Balrog into the pits of Moria, and Merry and Pippin were kidnapped by the Uruk-Hai. Frodo and Sam, meanwhile, are heading to Mordor to cast the One Ring into the fires of Mount Doom.Like the first one, this story is divided into two parts (called Books.) Book III tells about Aaragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's encounter with the newly reincarnated Gandalf the White, their encounter with Theoden, king of Rohan, the fight at Helm's Deep, and their encounter with Saruman, the treacherous wizard. It also tells about how Merry and Pippin's escape, and encounter with Treebeard and the Ents of Fangorn.Book IV tells about Frodo and Sam's encounter with Gollum, the twisted creature with two egos, one being Gollum, the other being Smeagol, his original self, their encounter with Faramir, Boromir's brother, and their encounter with the evil spider Shelob.OPINONS: The Two Towers was an exciting read! Filled with great narrating and storytelling, interesting new characters, plenty of action, and most of all, detail. This is much more longer and better than the movie! J.R.R. Tolkien is one of the best authors ever!OVERALL: A must read. Make sure you read The Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring first, though!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Picking up where &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot; leaves off with the separation of fellowship, this book first details the adventures of Stridor, Gimli, and Legolas as they try to rescue Pippin and Merry and combat the evil that is growing in Isengard. In the second half of the book, we follow Frodo and Sam as they struggle to complete their quest to destroy the One Ring.Here we see the forces of good beginning to gather to combat the growing evil in the world. The underlying themes regarding this struggle become more clear as we begin to recognize that sometimes the only way to overcome evil is by standing up and fighting it. Tolkein's world remains a vividly portrayed as ever, and the tension builds as the heros struggle to conquer the awesome power of Sauron."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE TWO TOWERS by J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantastic book. I like that book because it is my favorite movie. It gives me lots of details so I can see the picture in my head while I am reading. When I was reading I could see how beautiful the setting is. The main characters are Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. The main part was the war. I like this book because it is very challenging. I think you should read this book because it is very scary and magical. I like this book and you should too! I hope you read this book!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It is a mind blowing book.

J.R.R Tolkien's \\"The Two Towers\\" is an exciting and adventurous book that will keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time you are reading. Tolkien makes it seem that each page is full of adventure and you won't want to stop reading until you are done. Once you are done you are going to want to put it down and go to the library and ask for the third book, then you won't want to stop reading that one. I really enjoyed how there is never a dull part in the book, but the only specific thing I didn't enjoy is how the books end in the middle of some of the best parts. I encourage you to also read this book it is one of the most interesting books you will ever read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the sequel to the Fellowship of The Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien. After the fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam have set off on a different way as their companions towards the dark land of Mordor. Frodo's one mission: to destroy a small gold ring that will give the Dark lord ultimate power. One small compilcation: the ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the mouth of Mt. Doom, right next to the dark fortress Barad Dur. I thought this was a good book an its one you can read more than once."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"the Two Towers continues the exciting story of the fellowship of the ring. It offers more excitement and suspense as well as several surprises. Tolkien consistently stretches the reaches of imagination, and he always provides logic and reason so that his story makes sense and follows a consistent stream of creativity.As I read the rings trilogy, I found that it was helpful to have seen to the movies to help picture the events, characters, and surroundings. Of course, the movies made much more sense after reading the books, but I found reading the books more enjoyable than the movies. I am really glad that I decided to read them at a friend's suggestion.Tolkien is an excellent writer. This book along with the others is intelligently written. It is not just kid's stuff. It is stimulating reading.He tells a great story filled with complex characters and plots. The story follows a logical and understandable path that sparks the readers full imagination and range of emotions.This book offers some of the severest character conflicts in the books as the characters must make sharp decisions about their actions and alliances. It introduces new characters and species that offer fresh starts throughout the story. This book of the story in no way serves as a filler or drags on and on. It is filled with action and suspense. There is no let up in the action at all.And don't think that since you have seen the movie, you don't need to read the book. If you liked the movie at all, you will indeed enjoy the book, especially if your one criticism of the movie is that it didn't make sense. The book will fill in the gaps and will cause you to appreciate the movie much more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this was a great book. It has a great story. I like the way that he wrote the first story about Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas and then he told the story about Frodo and Sam. I like the second book the best because I was surprised with that part because the movie left alot of things there out. I had seen the movie before I read the book. I liked in the first book when they won the battle of Helm's Deep. I also liked when Gandalf broke Saruman's staff. The book has a great ending even though it is not happy, it leaves you hanging. the movies did a bad job,in my opinion, of illistrating the books. I liked the character Gollum.He was very strange, though. I also like the fearsome Uruk Hai. Very neat charaters. The Ents must have really been hard to make up. They were pretty off the wall. All around I might say this is the best book out of the three in the series."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Have you ever imagined what the battle of Helm's Deep was like? The Bloody swords, Orcs with arrows in them, the dead Rohirrim on the walls? It's just one of the bloody battles in The Lord Of The Rings fantasy by J.R.R. Tolkien. Have you ever imagined what the Shire looks like? If you read this novel, you'll see the Shire in your head because Tolkien is very descriptive of the surroundings.The name of the main character is Frodo Baggins. Frodo is a sixty-year old Hobbit. The setting is Middle Earth in the Third age. The most important conflict is trying to destroy a Mystical ring made by the Dark Lord Sauron. In order to destroy the one ring, a fellowship is made of nine companions, each of a different race. There are Merry, Pippin, Sam, and Frodo, who are Hobbits with swords. Then there are two men, Boromir and Aragorn, who are equipped with bows and swords. There is an Elf, named Legolas, equipped with both swords and a bow and arrow. Then there is Gimli, a Dwarf with a broad battle ax. The last character is a wizard, a supernatural being named Gandalf Greyhame. This Fellowship of the ring is attacked by many agents of the dark lord -- things, like Ringwraiths, Orcs, Uru-kai, and Easterlings.I liked the book. One of the reasons I liked the book was because it had a lot of action and humor, for instance the Battle at Helm's Deep where the action and humor is contained mostly in the book. One example of humor is, and I Quote \\" Twenty-one!\\" cried Gimli. He hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last Orc before his feet. \\"Now my count passes Master Legolas again.\\" An example of the action is when Aragorn and his friend Eomer go to the gate and draw swords together. \\"Aragorn and Eomer ran to the gate. \\"look!\\" Eomer said, pointing to the Causeway. Both Orc and Easterlings ran towards the gate. Two dozen Orcs ran towards Legolas and Gimli, who were following Aragorn and Eomer. When they got to the gate, about three dozen lay slain on the ground. The only problem was that they were not dead. Eomer went to step through them, but two Orcs grabbed his heels, tripping him on the floor. They got up and were about to kill him, when Gimli sliced their heads off, just saving Eomer.\\" I liked the book because of the battles. The final reason I liked it was because in the battles, Legolas and Gimli bet each other on who would kill the most Orcs. On example is, from the text: \\"Twenty-one!\\" said Gimli, patting his axe. \\"Good!\\" said Legolas, whetting his sword. \\" but my count is now Two dozen.\\" \\"It has been real knife-work up here.\\" One reason I disliked the book was because the Fellowship split up in the novel before this one."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ever have had something that many want people want to possess? Try overcoming being chased by nonliving warriors riding dragons. Have you ever felt like the fate of the world hung around your neck? If you have experienced this then you know how Frodo Baggins from the Lord of the Rings felt. Frodo was young hobbit from the Shire who really looked for adventure when ever he could find. He wanted to meet new people and see different creatures he had never seen in his life. But the only reason Frodo got to go on adventures was because his uncle gave him the ring of power. Frodo had to get the ring to Mordor and not let the ring get into the wrong hands. The ring has such power that it could conquer the whole world.I really liked the Two Towers. It is a great fantasy novel because it contains all elements that a good fantasy novel should contain. In my opinion J.R.R Tolkien created the greatest quest in the entire fantasy genre. If you read the story very carefully you can see that Tolkien kept on switching settings between characters. For instance in one chapter Tolkien would focus on Pippin and Merry then in the next chapter he would focus on Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli. The best battle in the book in my opinion was the Battle of Helm's Deep. The only flaw was in the beginning Tolkien only focused on the other three companions that Frodo abandoned. I would highly recommend the Two Towers to any who is a fan of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I, unfortunately, saw the movie before I finished the book, so it sort of killed my imaginatic picture.

TeranPeriod: 5This book is the best book I have ever read in my life. Action, adventure, and fantasy creatures come to life throughout the book. In the begining, Sam and Frodo, two hobbits on their way to Mordor, capture an small and helpless creature who is trying to steal the ring of power away from Frodo. The creature's name was Gollum. He had been the previous owner of the ring of power until Bilbo Baggins, Frodo's uncle, found it in Gollum's cave. Gollum says that he can lead Sam and Frodo to Mordor safely if they spared his life. So they did. In another story line, Merry and Pippen , two other hobbits, found themselves captured by orcs; but one night, the Riders of Rhohan, men who are skilled archers and horsemen, had come and saved them. After their freedom, Merry and Pippen, foolishly ran into the Enchanted Forest. They were unaware of the mythical creatures that lived in the forest. They met an Ent, a tree that can walk and talk. His name was Treebeard. Treebeard took Merry and Pippen to see the white wizard to determine if they were Orc spies or not. Upon arriving, they met Gandalf. They didn't realize that he was reborn and turned into the White Wizard, who had special powers. Meanwhile, Aragon, who was the leader of the fellowship, Legolas, an elf, and Gimli, a dwarf, were in trouble at Helm's Gate. The Orcs, mutated elves, outnumbered the fellowship 10:1. Just when they thought that all hope was lost, Gandalf came out of nowhere along with the banned Riders of Rohan to kick some Orc butt. At the same time, Treebeard, Merry, Pippen and other Ents came to Isengard, the city where the evil wizard Saruman lived. So when they found out that all the trees in the city were cut down, they got mad and summoned all the Ents together and destroyed Isengard.I liked this book for many reasons. First of all, it has a lot of adventure and action. It had lots of battles between good and evil. It had me on the edge of my seat as the Orcs ran day and night trying to get to Mordor, while the fellowship was hot on their trail. Also, it has a great story line. The plot was well written because the author didn't reveal the whole story all at once. He kept building the story line chapter by chapter. In addition, I also liked it because of the mythical creatures in the story. You could visualize how the monsters looked like since the author wrote it in such great detail. For example, \\"They found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It belonged to a large Man-like, almost Troll-like, figure, at least fourteen foot high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say\\". Those was just one quote of many which are in this book.The reason why I like this book so much is because it is a fantasy. I love fantasies. I also like science fiction movies and The Lord of the Rings has all of these features. Fantasies catch my eye because it most of the things that occur in story, don't happen in real life. For example, In Lord of the Rings, there are cave trolls and talking trees. Fantasy stories are great because it puts me in a different world and I forgot where I am.My favorite part of the movie is when Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas are going into battle with the ferocious Orcs. With the sound of the battle cries the Orcs are making, thousands of these Orcs fight against just hundreds of very brave men. Before this great battle commences, an army of 4,000 Elves come to aid the brave men. Thousands of arrows are shot at the same time striking the Orcs and dropping them like flies. Then the great hand to hand combat begins. Swords and spears start flying everywhere. It looked like a swarm of bees fighting since there were so many Orcs and men fighting. The battle rages on until the gate was breached. It looked as if the Orcs were going to win this war."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Another great Tolkien novel. Characters are excellent. Story is better."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers was an excellent adventure. Of the whole book the only thing I disliked was how the beginning started out a little slow, but it defiantly picked up. I did enjoy how the book opens shortly after the destruction of the group. You have Merry and Pipen who have been captured and taken hostage by a group of Orcs. While Frodo and Sam are trying to get to Mordor to destroy the ring. Then their is Aragorn, Legolas, andGimli who are trying to locate the where about of Merry and Pipen. On their journey they come across the Riders of Rohan. The Riders tell Aragorn that they ran into the Orcs lastnight, and slaughtered them, and they didn't see any hobbits. They must have died in the battle, but actually they escaped into the Forest of Fangorn unnoticed. There the hobbitsencounter a very old ent named Treebeard. Their description of Saraman and the evil wizard's plans move Treebeard to call together all the ents of the Forest. Then they set offto wage war on Isengard.In the meantime, the three companions enter the Fangorn in pursuit of the hobbits. In the forest they are amazed to realized that Gandalf is still alive. Gandalf tells them thatMerry and Pipen will be safe, but that the city of Rohan is in great danger. The four travel to the capital or Rohan, where Gandalf tries to convince King Theoden to ride into battleagainst Isengard. Gandalf does and Theoden leads his Rides of Rohan to Helm's Deep, where they will prepare to defend against a huge army of Orcs.While all of this is going on, Frodo and Sam are traveling to Mordor, seeking Mount Doom. On there journey their is a Gollum that pursues them silently, but aftersome time the hobbits manage to ambush and capture him. The Gollum promises to lead them to Mordor, but Sam doesn't fully trust the Gollum, unlike Frodo. The Gollum leads them, and they travel for many days through the Dead Marshes and later the ruined Plain of Dagorlad. Finally they reach the Black Gate but its impenetrable, but Gollum informs the hobbits that he knows of a secret route, but further south. Frodo again agrees tofollow the Gollum. After a few days of traveling they run into the Men of Gondor, led by Faramir. After hearing the natures of Frodo's quest, Faramir agrees to let the hobbits go,and warns them that the route the plan to take is very dangerous.Once again following Gollum, Sam and Frodo eventually find themselves in the mountains outside Minas Morgul. They enter a dark tunnel and the Gollum disappears. Suddenly, a horrifying spider appears from the darkness. Will they be able to fight off the spider, and why did the Gollum disappear?Plus you must read on to find how the battle turns out with the ents destroying Isengard. Then can the three companions and the Riders of Rohan hold off the outrageousnumber of Orcs?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers is a masterpeice of tolkien. It continues the story of the Fellowship of the Ring as a sequel by bringing all the things that the fellowship had and more. It met the high bar left by the fellowship and was able to carry that mark throughout the whole book.This book so much to offer, from blood pumping battles, to the mythical Ents. It starts by telling the story of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas chasing the band of orcs that holds onto Merry and Pippin. The first few chapters switch between Pippin's party and Aragorn's party. It builds up suspense with the meeting of treebeard and the White Rider. The Helm's Deep is the climax of the first part of this book.The second book continues the journey of Master Samwise and Frodo Baggins, the ring bearer. These two meet a new friend right in the beginning. His name is smeagol. Sam feels that he is untrustworthy yet Frodo trusts his new companion and heeds his advise and uses him as a guide. Smeagol of course is trustworthy to Frodo and proves his worth through the marshes of the dead. He even show him the way into Mordor. The make in a good distance into Mordor when they are captured by their allies, Faramir. He seeks the ring for Gondor, but eventually sees his downfall with the ring and allows Frodo, Gollum (smeagol), and Sam to journey to Mount Doom.This book is simply a work of art by Tolkien.

As everyone in the world must know by now, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; basically tells how various good-hearted fantasy creatures strive to destroy a magic ring that, if acquired by the Enemy, would result in the end of decent society. Here the journey continues just as in the first volume, but Tolkien now moves much more slowly. He introduces us to fewer characters and &quot;wonders&quot; than in the first volume (most interesting, to me, were the Tree Shepherds, the revamped Gollum, and Boromir's brother), while filling many pages with tedious faux Arthurianism involving the Riders of Rohan, and with deadly landscape descriptions that are at once long-winded and vague. Nevertheless, the old excitement returns often enough -- particularly in the last few chapters -- and by the end my desire to find out what happens in the final volume was as fresh as ever."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is the second book in his trilogy of The Lord of the Rings. The book picks up exactly were the first on ends. Froto and Sam are on their way to Mordor the evil empire. The rest of the broken fellowship will trail behind and they will meet again later. The book is based on a series of mini wars that lead to the destruction of the two towers. These two towers are points on the earth were Soron and his army build and destroy.In my mind the book did an all right job at putting a few hours of film into a 300-page book, but there needs to be more dialog. I read through the book reading the author's words and nothing about what the characters thought.I also liked the two wars that they had. The author did a great job at giving you a detailed view on what is going on at the battlefield.The one thing that I have learned in the past is that you have to read over and over to get the right idea. I read the book then watch the movie to get both point of views.I would advise reading this book and not skipping it to read the last book in the trilogy. The Two Towers is an important part of the trilogy. It gives a middle ground and puts you in place for the next book Return of the King.If I were to give a grade on this book form one to ten it would be a seven. I would give it a seven because it kept my attention and keep up the pace in the trilogy. The book could be read from 16 and up. Some of the things that are going on in the book are hard to understand and keep up with if you are of a younger age."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"It's a shame to give this book only 1 star, so I gave it 2.

This one reads a lot faster than \\"Fellowship\\", in which it takes half the book to get to the Prancing Pony. Good plot twists and turns.2. Incredible storytelling, character development, and background history to the legends and mythos of middle earth.3. Not as many songs as \\"Fellowship\\"...good thing Peter Jackson exercised artistic license, or the movies would have been musicals.Cons1. Sorry, lightning might strike me, but Tolkien is no Joseph Conrad...the writing is stilted throughout...but with a storyline this great, who cares.2. If you are a hardcore fan of the movies there is some silliness throughout Jackson wisely removed from the movies. (Treebeard lives in a house and sleeps on a bed, and don't forget the gay ranger, yellow jacket wearin' Tom Bombadil from \\"Fellowship.\\")Tolkien said it took him 7 years to write the trilogy, and when he finished, there was nothing more to tell...an absolute masterpiece.

I have no choice but to say that while Tolkien made a indepth backrgound for his story that was all he did. Tolkien built a world, but he never wrote a story. I have never read a fantasy book less entertaining than these. He bores you with the details. Textbooks have fewer appendixes than his books. The only two redeming bits are the symbolism and world building. However, he missed one main concept, its all as borring as can be. Only a few obsessed people out there learn to speak elvish, for the rest of us he could have spent some time on an action scene and just written gibberish because thats all it is. His symbolism is certainly not deep enough to make the books worth reading either. The first and foremost reasons to write any book thats not a textbook is to entertain or make a point. He makes a simplistic point and keeps you saying, 'This sucks!'."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I would encourage this book for people with high reading ability, to read this book.

Before you read this book you should be sure to read the book The Fellowship of The Ring or watch the movie so you can get some background information. I like this book because it shows the friendship of each other and their willingness to stay together. The hardships that they are faced with are very trying and testing of themselves. \\"But if we hold true to each other we will do what needs to be done.\\" This is a quote from the book. The two Towers' is totally a book to read if you are into action and adventure."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Michael Simmons12/09/03Pd.7 ReadingImagine given a magical ring that could destroy the entire world if the forces of evil get it, if you don't destroy it. This is what Frodo Baggins had to do. This story is about a struggle for a ring of power in a place called middle earth. The two sides of the struggle are the free peoples and the forces of the dark lord called Sauron. Characters in the story are Frodo (a Hobbit), Sam (also a Hobbit), Legolas (an Elf), Gimli (a Dwarf), and Borimer, Arogon, Gandalf, Saruman, and Theoden (all Men). The setting takes place in a place called middle earth. In middle earth there are many regions were these different people live. Like the Shire (where the Hobbits live), Rivendel (where the Elves live), Gondor, Rohan, and Isengard (where the Men live), and all in the mountains live the Dwarfs and the Goblins (part of the evil side), and finely where the Orcs (evil) live in Mordor. The plot of the story is that a dark lord called Sauron, a spirit, has his minion's try to take the ring from Frodo. While he is doing that, armies of Sarumans from Isengard attack the people of Rohan. This is where the struggle of Rohan to survive comes in. Now the heroes have to split up.First, My over all opinion of this book is that it was a good adventure book but too many details. This book is a Fantasy book. The only way that this was a page turner book is because of the action.Last This book was Fantasy because none of the book was true. The book is part of a 3-book series, and this is the second one of the series. In conclusion, I recommend this book to people who can remember things."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I found this book to be a great companion on my recent business travels. Having enjoyed the movie version of part one with its abrupt ending... I picked up this book to ease my curious mind.I have been warned by some that Tolkien's writing is long and boring, but I did not find it to be that way at all. The book is much more detailed than I anticipated and sometimes the story goes off on tangents, but I always found them interesting.Mostly, I like this book, and the entire three part story, becuase it is filled with so many mythological symbols and lessons. I am a huge fan of Joseph Campbell and his writings on &quot;The Power of Myth&quot;. This story is such a fine example of modern myth written to not only tell a interesting story, but to continue the tradition of teaching life's lessons and secrets through mythological stories.I would highly recommend this book and the other two in the series, as well."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I liked the two towers it was an awsome book.frodo is with his best friend Sam starting an adventuerttrying to find Mordor and they help each other to stay alive while the others are looking for Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin try to stay alive without getting killed by the orcs. The neateat part was when Gandalf came back desguised as a white rider. I would recememd this book to everyone even grown adults. It's for people who love adventure books. It also has lots of expeditions and adventures in it. That is the most thrilling part."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I don't think that I need to tell anyone out there how amazing Tolkien's tales are. My cup runneth over. My imagination was thoroughly stimulated and I think I may end up reading this again in a few years."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a great and provoctive book, in my mind one of the best books of the century. J.R.R. Tolkien should have recieved a nobel prize for his works. It displays the greatest examples of fantisy and fiction in the modern and ancient world.His creatures have set the stage for all of the current and future storytellers. Tolkiens collection of creatures runs fromkobolds to hobbits he is the epitimy of what all fantisy writers should be like.The Two Towers I believe is his best book in the trilogy and to which all fiction writers should set there compasses. The detail that it includes is amazing. In some parts of the book I feel that Im there. I see what they see and the dialog is absolutly astonishing. So I recomend that this book be read by all."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book has the fellowship scattered in every which way. Frodo is traveling through Mordor with Sam, while Pippin and Merry show incredible inner strength in their encounters with orcs. Gandalf (who is supposedly killed in book 1) resurrects with gallantry as Gandalf the White. The characters begin to take on more and more challenges. Frodo is gettin guided by who but Gollum and a new type of soldier emerges--Ents. Readers are introduced to Faramir, Theoden, Wormtongue, and the Rohirrim. The trail to the final battle between good an evil narrows ever-more as the book draws to a close. Each reader has begun to see each character in a new light, truces are made, blood is shed, and now readers can begin to decide who is the most important character in the book. I personally have never been able, as all characters play such an immense part in the story of the rings. I recommend both the book and the recording (Rob Inglis is the most incredible reader)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"First off, i would like to address some of the faults that others found in this book. I noticed that a lot reviewers, thought the book was too descriptive. Yes, this book is very descriptive, but tolkein was only trying to paint a picture for his readers, and if you can understand the way he described it in, he did a very good job. You have to remember, that this book was written by a genius, and if your looking for an easy book to read, this isn't for you. Others said this book was a bit boring. In my opinion, it was quite the contrary. the book splits up essentially into two different stories, one following aragorn, legolas, gimili, merry, pippin and gandalf, and the other covers frodo and sam. Frodo's adventures are a little boring, but the rest of the fellowship had me on the edge of my seat. You also get to meet the ents, interesting creatures by far. All i can say, is read the book and decide for yourself. This isn't a book to read while your being distracted by something. and of course, make sure to read the first one before this, or you will be lost."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"First of, this is an excellent book. Although not really a life-changer it will probably do a lot to dispel the idea that fantasy books are boring. As a person who isn't a particular fan of the genre, I personally loved this book. The story is a follow up from the first novel in the set, 'The Fellowship Of The Rings'. Split into two sections it mostly concerns the aftermath of the dismemberment of the fellowship. In the first half Merry and Pippin are hobbit-napped by orcs, and Strider, Legolas and Gimli follow in pursuit, on the way meeting battle and an old friend. The second half is mostly taken up by the character Sam, as Frodo feels the weight of his task ever more, becoming ever more weary as they come closer to their destination. On the journey they find help from an unwanted ally - Gollum.Obviously there are several problems with the story, such as characters like Treebeard that are dull and often unneeded. However, despite this it can be very exciting in parts and brings a whole new dimension to the 'journey' story. All of the characters are drawn exceptionally well, even if some are clearly more interesting than others. In addition, the fight scenes are a lot more than the usual hacking and chopping but include some surprising light humour that really helps dispel the possibility of boredom. Even if the homoerotic overtones between Frodo and Sam are a little on-the-nose then at least you've got Shalob the giant spider at the end to give a pounding finale with a great cliffhanger. Plus, it's certainly a plus that Tolkien can write in a giant spider without his reader questioning it for a moment and just enjoying the moment.This is a great book, although I'm worried as to how they'll transfer characters such as Shalob onto the big screen later this year."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Gandalf is gone. Boromir is dying. Frodo and Sam are gone, and the rest of the Fellowship has been disbanded. Things couldn't be worse for the 9. But things eventually begin to go up. Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, the creature that Bilbo took the Ring from, and he promises that he'll help them get to Mordor to destroy the Ring. However, things and people aren't always what or who they seem to be. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin who were captured by Orcs. Gandalf returns to help them in their search, and plans to take on Saruman in a duel to get at least one enemy out of the way. Merry and Pippin meet up with the Ents, a species of talking trees, and they agree to help in the fight against Saruman because of Saruman's tendency to kill trees. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum meet Faramir, Boromir's brother, and then they are off to Mordor. But when they get there, things go horribly wrong... Once again, this is an amazing story, and if you liked Part 1, continue with this one."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"All I can say is out or 5 stars it gets a 7. This is the best medival book I have ever read. The word use is a little hard to grsp if you are young but the story plot was outstanding. Tolkien really knew how to write a story. He uses many interesting creatures. My favorites were the Elves. He show you many things about every race. This was a very descriptive book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"At the conclusion of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; you are left in suspense and you are craving what's to come next. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; will get you over your suspense a little, but at the end of this second installment of &quot;The Lord of the Rings,&quot; you'll be left in more suspense that you were at the conclusion of &quot;Fellowship.&quot;The first half of this book centers on Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn as they come about a big point in the book that will leave you feeling very happy. Don't worry, I won't tell you what that thing is. The Fellowship still remains split up and some things that you wanted to know at the conclusion of the last book are revealed, as said above. That is as much as I'll tell you for this book because if I tell you anymore the book will be ruined for you.As in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; J.R.R. Tolkien gives you luscious descriptions and phenomonal writing. He goes into some matters that were brought forth in the first book with such skill that only Tolkien could pull off. At the end of this book you will feel a craving to pick up &quot;The Return of the King&quot; right away.&quot;The Two Towers&quot; is the second book in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and the best of the first two volumes. Tolkien brings you into his beautiful world that you won't be able to get enough of. Before delving into this, be sure to read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first so you won't feel like you're reading material that makes no sense to you. I recommend this book to a fantasy fan or somebody that is looking for an adventurous, grand fantasy epic. Be sure to read this novel.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Having only recently delved into the works of Tolkien recently for the first time, I have to say that I wasn't all that impressed with The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Ring. While I thought that Tolkien had a fantastic and original idea for his time, his writing left much to be desired for me. I did however, enjoy The Two Towers more than the previously mentioned books despite it having a few flaws for me as well. The Fellowship of the Ring needs to be read before this book, and because of that, I am not going to recap what happens in that book for this review. So be forewarned, the following can contain spoilers for those who haven't read the first book.Frodo and Sam had taken off for Mordor by themselves, leaving the rest of the Fellowship to its fate. They encounter the mysterious creature Gollum on the way and through capture, convince him to promise to be nice and lead them along the best path to Mordor. Gollum is a tricky character though and not the most trustworthy and leads Sam and Frodo closer to their peril. Meanwhile, Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli have set off in pursuit of Merry and Pipin, who were captured by Orcs. Along the way they come across the Riders of the Kingdom of Rohan, known for their horses, and in the midst of a terrible war. The war is with the white wizard turned evil, Saruman, and his army of orcs that his is unleashing on the Southern kingdom. They decide to help and turn the odds against this horrible force that is descending upon the land.The characters in this book aren't quite as developed as in the first one. While we have plenty of background on the Fellowship characters from the previous book, we don't get much in the way of description for the Riders of Rohan or some of the other newer characters. I do have to say that Gollum is still my favorite. The interesting way he has of speaking and his interactions with the Hobbits are very interesting and a pleasure to read.The writing is very descriptive in other ways and unfortunately this can make the book slow reading at parts. It would have been nice to have more character description as opposed to the multiple instances of describing scenery and legends that aren't even really pertinent to the story. I did find that this book had less song and rhyme than the other and I appreciated that as I tend to skip over them since they distract from the flow of the book. The book isn't very offensive either and despite having battles, not really violent.I look forward to the last book and seeing if it will be my favorite out of all. My opinion has grown more positive with each book and I hope that it does improve.The HobbitBook 1: The Fellowship of the RingThe Two TowersCopyright 1954398 pagesReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Fellowship is broken. Frodo and Sam travel alone to Mordor to destroy the One Ring. The Three Runners; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli track the kidnapped hobbits, Merry and Pippin. Saruman the White sends his Uruk-hai army to destroy the kingdom of Rohan. Gandalf the Grey returns as Gandalf the White, and informs The Three Runners that the hobbits are safe, and then set out to assist in the defense of Rohan. There are many great battle scenes in this novel, which makes this book a fast and action packed novel. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a journey where there is a good fight around every corner."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second part of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers, takes up where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. When the trust that was so necessary to the fellowship comes undone so does the fellowship itself. The quest splits off and the first half of the book is instead focused on the fellowship that was left behind and their hunt for those members that were taken by the orcs. Even though you don't pick up with Frodo and the ring until half way through the book it was still very exciting to hear about the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, not to mention the remaining hobbits.Many things changed in this novel and it was great to see how many of the characters are growing and maturing, changing and finding new inner strength and wit and hope. And, even though they are no longer on the main quest Legolas and Gimli still find plenty of excuses to knock some orc heads about as they journey into Rohan and discover the treachery of Sauroman. I also loved the Ents and the magic and history they brought to the story. It was also wonderful to read about the geography of the world so you could always follow along with where everyone was easily using one of the maps included in the book.The detailed layers in the story telling in this volume helped the first half come to life as all sorts of new countries and politics, beings and histories, magic and more were brought to light. I loved the poems and the languages and the names that all flowed together to just make the story come that much more to life.The second half of the book was much more quieter. Not as many characters and not quite as much going on. Frodo and Sam continue on alone until they discover Gollum, or Smeagol if you like, has been following them and decide it is better to follow than be followed and rope him (literally) into being their guide. This part of the story ended up being much more personal and seemed to go even faster as you followed the hobbits in their quest to Mordor and see over and over again just how dangerous, perilous and foolhardy the whole thing appears to be. Not to mention every time it seems like they have reached a milestone you realize they have so very much farther still yet to go. There's a whole third book yet!Fans of the movie should really read the books as well. You can immerse yourself more in the world and really take in all of the details, the songs, the legends and the world itself on a far more intricate level that only a book can achieve."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read some of the other reviews here and I'm surprised how much people's reactions are spread across the board.

For me, the first half of the book was not all that interesting, being mostly battle -- however, there were some significant plot twists (such as the return of Gandalf and Pippin looking in the stone) and new characters (such as Treebeard and the ents) that made it worth reading. (For what it's worth, I absolutely LOVED the ents!!) The second half of the book is what really held my interest, being the journey of Frodo and Sam led by Gollum through the mountains.

The novel is split into two parts consisting of the friends' separate adventures as the tale of Middle Earth continues to unfold. The world teeters toward the brink of dark destruction with its fate resting squarely on Frodo's shoulders.Tolkien's second installment in the beloved Lord of the Rings trilogy captivates the reader with the same magical gravity and mystical allure as the Fellowship of the Ring and its predecessor, The Hobbit. However, this book did not seem to posses the same depth of substance. As a bridge between the beginning and end of the series it had more of a transient feel; a piece rather than a whole.As always Tolkien writes lyrical flowing prose which captures the very spirit and dark majesty of Middle Earth. He paints vivid pictures of fanciful landscapes, gruesome battles and creatures both terrifying and beautiful. Though the story does tend to drag at several points it never truly grows boring; Tolkien's masterful storytelling and flowery descriptive language is enough to compensate for lags in action. In the end Tolkien leaves another nail biting cliffhanger that will have you clambering for the next part of this epic adventure!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Nicely done!

From there it is told how the rest of the Company straggled on in their journey, and how Sam and Frodo tamed Gollum and went to Mordor, the Land of Shadow. I started reading this story and I couldn't stop. I liked every single chapter of this book - there was no boring parts. If you like fantasies and adventures I highly recommend this trilogy, you don't know what you're missing. And about the author, JRR Tolkien - it's true what they say: a storyteller of genius!

I HAVE ALSO READ THE SILMARILLION AND STILL LOOKING FOR THE MAP OF MIDDLE EARTH. IT'S FANTASTIC AND GREAT."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Two Towers, writer J.R.R Tolkien mixes the ideas of a traditional fantasy with the complex features of secret languages and complex descriptions. These ideal characteristics are what contribute to an ideal fantasy novel that was once the best seller for ages and ages. The book itself is a fantasy-adventure novel and its point of view is normally the simple third person, although there are a few parts where it changes to the first person point of view. The actual theme of the book is to fight to win an adventure, and to success by winning freedom. The Two Towers is actually part two of a three book series called The Lord of the Rings. Therefore this book is actually like the meat of the series, in which all the details and difficult transitions are stored. A young hobbit (creatures who are small, plump and live in holes), Frodo Baggins, is heir to a secret ring, a ring of powers beyond the skeptical minds of all humans. His primary mission is to get rid of this ring, for it corrupts people through greed and wants. He chooses to take the way of destroying the ring through going to the dangerous lands of Mordor, where the dark lord Sauron, lies on his throne. In The Fellowship of the Ring (part one of the series) Frodo begins his adventure with a small wizard called Gandalf, who is to be his chief guide throughout the journey. Frodo then sets his backpack to finally start on his dangerous adventure to the dark lands of Mordor. With him he takes Sam Gamgee, a trusted servant of his and a few friends including Gimli, the dwarf, Merry the hobbit and Pippin the hobbit. He passes throughout many adventures including the mysterious Black Riders and being stabbed by one of them. Yet still, at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo ends up reaching his goal for the time, the Elven House. There a counsel gathers to discuss matters about the ring and such other things. They decide who to bring with Frodo and who not to, yet meanwhile war tensions were going greater as the dark forces started to pile up and head for Minas Tirith (the war fortress of the good) to start that legendary battle of good and evil. Meanwhile in The Two Towers, Frodo finally decides to go to Mordor by himself because he found himself to be a bother towards his other comrades in this adventure. Tensions in Minas Tirith start to grow more and more and the land is filled with terror, terror of war. While Frodo is on his way to Mordor alone, Pippin and Merry get lost together and are caught by the terrible orcs. Then due to a little quarrel, they were able to escape and reunite with Gandalf and everyone else. Also, as time goes by, Pippin and crew reunite with Frodo and travel a long and harsh way to Mordor with many mischievous happenings. Then they all stop at the border of Mordor, looking at the dark land with a sign of trouble. The Two Towers is an extremely intriguing and breath-taking story. Tolkien uses complex descriptions and imaginary locations to combine with the traditional elements of a fantasy novel, creating an extremely successful series and novel. So far, I view this book as the best in the series and I highly recommend this book with my rating of 10/10. It always keeps you intensified and is always a pleasure to read. The reading level of this book is for junior adults for the book itself does not use complex vocabulary but rather has small print and has a reasonable amount of pages. Also, it is practically impossible to compare this to any other book because it is to good for comparison. Even the Redwall series from Brian Jaque&iexcl;s is definitely no match for Tolkien&iexcl;s The Lord of the Rings. Therefore it is highly recommended that you read this book for it was a big pleasure for me to be able to read it and it was also a very fun book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so obviously, if you haven't read The Fellowship of the Ring, you won't get it. Otherwise, it is one of the best books that I have ever read. I'll admit, the first 50 pages were kind of slow, but when Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, everything is swept along from there. I liked how Frodo almost tamed Gollum, bringing him away from the lure of the Ring. Unfortunately, he doesn't quite succeed.

He actually did a very decent job singing the songs rather than just reading them, which added a lot to the feeling of the recording.

Middle Earth is a land just over the next horizon and Tolkin makes it so believe that you can smell the evil of Mordor or hear Shelob as she moves among rock. Read this and the other two books in 'The Lord of The Rings'series I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I find it very pathetic that so many of you Tolkien fans out there wrote so much about the first book and not the second. So many bad reviews came in for The Fellowship of the Rings; who would even want to come to this page?! I think this book is AWESOME! Tolkien is a genius. I love how he takes time to develop each persons character. Some say that the characters are flat and two-dimentional, but if you think that, *you're* two-dimentional!! The 'heroes' have flaws (even Aragorn), the antagonists have their good qualities (however few). Particularly, this is where we get some really good insight into the characters of Gimli and Legolas. Fellowship is a good start, but this is the best for characterization because by Return of the King you already know what everyone is like. That's what makes this book good, apart from the absolute wonder of the trilogy as a whole."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"i think everyone should read this book"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book, along with the other two, are positively stunning, the detail in this book can go a little overboard, but it still deplicts a stunning masterpiece!Here is an exerpt of the detailed text. &quot;Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the Wold of Rohan, that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the Great River. North-westward stalked the dark forest of Fangorn; still ten leagues away stood it's shadowy eaves, and it's further slopes faded into the distant blue. Beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall Methadras, the last peak of the Misty Mountains. Out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them, it's stream now swift and narrow, and it's banks deep-cloven.&quot; A very detailed book but still absolutely stunning!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book depicts the breaking of the fellowship. Tolkien beautifully describes all the aspects of Middle Earth. Like his other novels, this book shows Tolkien's GENIUS at work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord of the Rings is a fantastic piece of literature. While all of the parts are exceptional, part two, The Two Towers, is without a doubt the best of the series. The novel starts off with Aragorn finding a wounded Boromir. Boromir explains that the Uruk-Hai ambushed him and captured Merry and Pippin. This part of the series is split up into two books (Book 3 and Book 4). While Book 4 is fantastic and details the continued adventures of the Ring-Bearer, Book 3 really shines. The chapter about the Battle of Helm's Deep might be the best chapter in any book ever. For those readers rather uninterested in what happens to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas, Book 4 will be your favorite. An old enemy of Bilbo's is back to guide Frodo and Sam, but instead leads them into a trap. One warning though. As great as this book is, do not read it unless you can soon-after beging The Return of the King. The Two Towers has even more of a cliffhanger ending than Fellowship of the Ring did. I highly recommend this great piece of work."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers includes book III and IV in the Lord of the Rings cycle. There is a ring that makes the wearer invisible, but it also corrupts that person. The ring also gives the bearer unimaginable power. In the fantasy world where The Two Towers takes place, there is the evil ruler, Sauron. To prevent the ring from falling into the hands of Sauron, it must be destroyed. The ring can only be destroyed in the volcanic caves where it was created, Mount Doom, which is at the heart of Sauron's kingdom. Frodo and Sam, the two main characters, are sent out on a quest to finish this task. Their guide is the devious, untrustworthy and deceptive creature Gollum. I especially liked this book because of all the exciting action. There were a lot of conflicts and suspensful moments, all going on at once. These events made the book entertaining to read. I would encourage every middle school student to read the Tolkien Lord of the Ring cycle."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor, like Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers follows the lives of the Fellowship, shortly after they broke up. Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and our beloved dwarf friend Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.For any fan of fantasy or fan of great writing, this is the book for you. A great sequel to &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and an excellent read.Three words: Read it now"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Although it is not light reading it is really a great book. It is part of a series and is the second one in the series. If you have not read the first one (which is called The Fellowship of the Ring ) you will not understand this book at all.The most common good races that you see in this book are: elves, dwarfs, men, and hobbits.Hobbits are very short and have curly hair. They dislike adventures, ( And in this book there are four hobbits having adventures.)This book is a great one and I hope you will read it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I admit, Tolkien is an excellent writer. He is vivid, descriptive, and ultimately creative. Unfortunately, not everyone can get into Tolkien's fantasy worlds, all thanks to our MTV-based society. Fortunately, for the illiterati, Peter Jackson has made some movies for those with movie-going attention spans.Regardless, The Two Towers follows the lives of the our loved fellowship shortly after the breaking up. Sam and Frodo press on to destroy the ring in Mt. Doom, and the rest search for the Orc-Kidnapped Merry and Pippen. This novel left me in laughter, awe, and sometimes even in tears. I don't want to spoil the ending, but I will tell you this: After I completed The Two Towers, I had to immediately start The Return of the King, just to find out if what happened really was what I thought happened (those who have read it should know of what I'm talking).Two words: Read it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book, THE TWO TOWERS by JRR Tolkien was incredible. The sheer imagination and thought power exuded by tolkien was admirable. He really created colorful characters that had the depth to keep one reading.

I would advise any smart person who likes to think and enjoy good writing to read this book, because it really stands out as a classic of American Literature."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"this book was radical. this was the awesomest stuff ever. i am recomending this to all and hope that all have read it. when Tolkien wrote this book he was definetly in another place. this guy is the man. i hope that he does not stop with his wonderful books. this man is unreal.the ideas and languae he uses to captivate his readers is awesome."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In my opinion is this is a very good peice of fictional liturature. This book can help you leave reality and live in a time when there was nothing but the horse and the swords and even sorcory. This book is the second of a a trilogy. It followes the story of a hobbit named frodo who is trying to take a ring that can destroy middle earth. Frodo has his faithful friend Sam Gamgee and also an unlickely companion called gollum. who also seeks the power of the ring. there are only two things wrong with this book however, 1 you dont know how it started unless you read the first book fellowship of the ring, and 2 you wont know how the story ends until you read the third book return of the king."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord Of The Rings gets my vote for the absolute best series of all time. Tolkien does an excellent job of showing his awesome writing skills in these books. If you have gotten a chance to see the movie, you will know what kind of brilliance Tolkien has. The book, im my opinion, is much better than the movie, because you can put a different faces on each character. There is no much more to the book, rather than the movie. It goes much more in depth than the movie. The Poems and riddles that Tolkien comes up with is amazing. This is a very good book, I would reccomend this book and the series to all ages of readers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.It begins with the death and burial of Boromir and then to the journey of Aragorn , Legolas and Gimli to rescue Pippin and Merry from the Orc captors.When we read about Pippin and Merry's captivity , we for the first time in LOTR , witness the repugnant , cruel and totally without anything redeeming way of being of the Orcs.We also meet the Ents , shepherds of the trees and the tall and fair blonde horse riders - the Rohirrim.Thus we meet Treebeard and once more for a while two of our heroes Pippin and Merry get to spend some time in one of the few havens of Middle Earth ,temporarily safe from the enveloping darkness of the Dark Lord , the Enemy , Sauron and his forces . In this book Gandalf reappears having been miraculously resurrected as Gandalf the White . More powerful than before he breaks the spell of Saruman's emissary Grima Wormtongue over the King of Rohan , Theoden . The epic Battle of Helms Deep takes place while the Ents totally destroy Saruman's evil realm of Isengard before Gandalf himself destroys Saruman's power .In The Two Towers new characters such as Boromir's brother Faramir , the warrior of Rohan Eomer and his beautiful sister Eowyn appear . Such themes as the Palantir are introduced and the Hobbits meet up with the degenerate Gollum who for a while acts as their guide before predictably betraying them to the giant spiderlike demon Shelob.more than before through Merry and Pippin , Frodo and Sam we witness the amazing quality of the Hobbits . The novel takes the saga to a dramatic climax in Mordor and the stage is set for the final conflict between Mordor and The West.Aside from the action and events we need to take time to appreciate the beauty and scope of Middle Earth.LOTR has an important message in that it rejects moral relativism and exhorts us to always choose good over evil , so important when we are faced with the challenges of terrorism and those who would destroy freedom ..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is incredible. It is equal to, if not better then The Hobbit and/or Fellowship of the Ring. The book, seperated into two independant novels, follows both the journeys of the shattered fellowship, and the excapades of Frodo and Samwise. The two novels that you'll find here can be read seperately, or together, but I found it difficult to lay the book down. Tolkien displays his unequaled genious yet again. I am seriously looking forward to the movie this December."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the continuation of the first book, &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. There are 7 members left of the Fellowship of the Ring, which was 9 to begin with. They have all been split up by the Orcs. Gimli the Dwarf, Legalos the Elf, and Aragorn, a man are together after a dreadful battle. Two hobbits named Mary and Pippen are captured by the Orcs. And no one knows where the Ring barrier Frodo, and his servant Sam is (both hobbits).The three men continue to search for the captured hobbits, but the Orcs moved too fast. But soon they met up with Gandalf the White. The wizard they lost while in a battle in the Mines of Moria. The hobbits managed to escape the Orcs, and meet up with Treebeard, half man half tree.All three seperate groups where doing well on their own, but something terrible happens. Frodo was captured and now they have to save him."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second book of The Lord of The Rings, The Two Towers is superior, in my opinion, to The Fellowship of The Ring - a fine book in its own right. This picks up right where that book left off (on a semi-cliffhanger.) The book is broken up into two parts (arguably not the best way to tell the story): the first part concerns the exploits of Aragorn, Legolas and the rest of the Party (sans Frodo and Sam.) This is a fast-moving and exciting part of the book that sets up some important events that come to fruition in The Return of The King. There are several important plot point (and surprises) in this section that would alter the course of the series. The second part concerns Frodo and Sam, and their journey to Mordor with Gollum (!) as their guide. This is a very exciting and dramatic section of the book, and it moves very fast and is a joy to read. I think it's overall better than The Fellowship of The Ring, as it is a great joy to read and very fast-paced - much tighter than The Fellowship, which could move slowly at times. But, of course, the entire series is a masterpiece, and should be read. This book ends on an extreme cliffhanger, so you will want to pick up The Return of The King right after finishing this. The Lord of The Rings is one of the true masterpieces of recent literature, and deserves to be read by everybody. No matter what kind of books you like to read, it is a masterpiece that everyone should be able to say that they've read. And this is perhaps the best overall installment in the series, though they are all essential. Read this masterpiece; it will enrich your life."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I like this book for many reasons; adventure, excitement, and a well developed plot all work together to form an excellent book.Some of the parts that I liked were in the beginning, on the trip towards Isengaurd. I also liked the journey with Gollum torads the Black Gate, although it didn't end once they reached it. This book is perfect for readers ages twelve and up. I would also reccomend the other books by J.R.R. Tolkien. They all are full of everything that anyone could want."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Sometimes the middle of a long story is accused of being boring or, at least, inferior to the story's beginning and end. This is not the case with \\"The Two Towers,\\" which lives up to its status as the second of the three volumes of J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by being the true heart of the entire work.After the death of a major character (an event depicted at the end of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\"), Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Orcs. The Three Hunters, as they call themselves, encounter a major plot surprise, meet several new characters and take part in an enormous battle before finding their friends, who have escaped their captors and encountered Treebeard, a kindly Ent, or \\"tree-herd,\\" who looks something like a walking, talking tree. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are joined on their journey to Mordor by the sinister, conflicted Gollum, a background presence in \\"Fellowship\\" who now steps into the spotlight.The scenes in the first half of the book with the Elf Legolas and the Dwarf Gimli develop their characters and their unlikely friendship to an extent not found in \\"Fellowship.\\" Tall and short, pointy-eared and gruffly emotional, Legolas and Gimli are both the C3PO and R2D2 and the Spock and McCoy of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\"; their contest to see who can kill the most Orcs during the Battle of Helm's Deep is gruesome yet delightful. The star of the second half of the book, however, is Gollum, and his interactions with Frodo and Sam serve to define their characters more strongly than before. Imagine that you and your best friend are on a long, dangerous journey with a disgusting, dangerous creature who desperately wants something your friend has and would kill to get it. All your life you have heard the story of how your friend's uncle got this object from the creature and barely escaped from him alive. You never expected to meet or even see the creature yourself, but here he is in the wilderness with you, having sworn to serve your friend. Now you wish the two of you could get rid of the creature -- but you need his help to reach your destination and thus save the entire world. That's the situation Sam Gamgee finds himself in, and the resulting interplay between Sam, Frodo and Gollum makes for great drama. In the book version of \\"Fellowship\\" Gandalf tells Frodo that Gollum both hates and loves himself; readers of \\"The Two Towers\\" will come both to love and hate Gollum. It's no wonder that when the Beatles were planning to make a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie starring themselves, John Lennon apparently desired the role of Gollum, considering it the starring role of the whole story.If you've enjoyed the book or the movie of \\"Fellowship,\\" you should enjoy reading \\"The Two Towers\\" and finding out what happens next. Even if it were not the central third of one of the great novels of the twentieth century, \\"The Two Towers\\" would be one of the world's greatest fantasies in its own right. However, be sure to have a copy of \\"The Return of the King\\" handy when you finish \\"The Two Towers,\\" which, unlike \\"Fellowship,\\" ends with a fairly spectacular cliffhanger..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Two towers is a story when the earth was young and good battled evil for dominent power. Aragorn the man, Legolas the elf, and Gimli the dwarf have done all they can to destroy the evil ring of power. While they are searching for their hobbit companions(kidnapped by orcs) Pippen and Merry, hobbits Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum to Mordor and Sauron's dwelling in an attempt to destroy the ring...The Two Towers is a book that would be properly enjoyed by older, more mature children. Tolkien uses an endless supply of powerful adjectives and description. The story is written with complex sentences and is full of emotion. Aaragorn, Gimli, and Legolas alley with the Riders of Rohan, Riders of the Mark, Gandalf the wizard, and the ents of Fanghorn to fight against Saurumon and his horde of orcs and wild men at Isenguard. The companions share both happy and terrible times with each other. Sometimes in songs and poetry or anger and harsh words.The Two Towers is written in third person point of view. There are two books or sections in The Two Towers. It is like the book is divided up into two parts. Then those parts are divided up into several chapters. The first book is about our companions fighting Saurumon then going there own seperate ways. The sceond half describes more about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum on their way to Mordor.The Two Towers is an extremely well written fantasy. There are orcs, beast, wizards, elfs, dwarfs, and everything else imaginable blended in with race of men. The Two Towers is the second book published in 1956 in the trilogy The Lord of the Rings.This brilliant written fantasy novel, The Two Towers is for the young adult or mature child reader. \\"There are very few works of genius in recent literature.

I also like Saruman even though he is evil.I think it is cool how J. R. R. Tolkien made up his own language. I wonder how the publishers wrote the elvish writing on the ring.I saw the Fellowship of the Rings movie the day it came out and I was amazed at the graphics.

Unless you have been completely spoiled by modern interpretations of fantasy, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; should be in your permanent library. Be sure to read the first volume =before= the new movie comes out, as I have heard that they changed many events, and left out others in the interest of brevity.

The second reason why i liked this book is it tells you who the person is and sometimes it tells who there father is. Another reason is it has alot of action in it. It tells you whats happening in a battle. I would recommend this book to teenagers and above because it has alot of violence in it. The book is mostly about a war with good vs evil.

Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work.

Tolkein is the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It begins right after the end of the first novel. Frodo and Sam have left the group in order to journey undetected. As Aragorn searches for Frodo, he finds Boromir mortally wounded by arrows. Before Boromir dies, he tells Aragon that Merry and Pippin were kidnapped by Saruman's Uruk-hai. With Legolas the elf and Gimli the dwarf, he begins follow the Uruk-hai captors. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin escape from the Uruk-hai into the nearby Fangorn Forest, where they encounter Treebeard, the leader of the Ents. Aragorn is able to track their prints that lead into Fangorn, where they meet Gandalf, whom they thought had died in the mines of Moria. The four ride to Rohan where Gandalf warns King Thoeden of Saruman's growing army.While all this is going on, Frodo and Sam continue on their journey towards Mordor. They discover that Gollum has been following them for several days. They capture him when Gollum attempts to steal the Ring from Frodo. Gollum promises to lead the pair to the Black Gate in exchange for his life. He leads them through the Dead Marshes in order to avoid being spied by Orcs. Upon reaching the Black Gate, Gollum stops them as the way is guarded to heavily. Gollum tells them of a secret entrance to Mordor. They head south into Gondor, where they are captured by a group of rangers led by Faramir, the brother of Boromir.J.R. Tolkein's use of language in describing Middle Earth is astonishing. Every scene of the book is described in extensive detail, not to mention the history. Tolkein has created a world, a world of men and elves, that has such a detailed history that it feels like it could exist. With it's legends, history, geography, and language, Middle Earth is quite a place. Personally I feel this book is the best out of the three, with its extensive plot and characters. If you haven't read the Lord of the Rings yet, now might be a good time to start."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Easily my favorite of all Tolkein's books.

I'm satisfied."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"*I stole the title quote from Brandon Mull. Hooray for Rob Inglis, the narrator of this audiobook! Like many Ring Geeks, I have read this book cover to cover enough times that my social developement skills have been slightly retarded; and yet having this book read to me opens meanings and images that I had managed to miss time and time again. Much less cheesey than the radio play. This really is the flagship of LOTR audio recordings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"this is the second book to the lord of the rings. this is a phenomenal series. this is an awesome book. sometimes hard to get into but really good. if you have not read this book then i recommend you do"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second volume of the Lord of the Rings, and like the first, it's divided into two \\"books.\\" Spoilers for the next five paragraphs.The first book covers the further splintering of the fellowship, as Merry and Pippin are carried off by a band of orcs, which have just killed the warrior Boromir. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas pursue them towards Isenguard, but soon discover that all the orcs were killed by the horsemen of Rohan, and the hobbits escaped into Fangorn. They pursue them, but eventually, find Gandalf; alive and dressed in white, who tells them that the hobbits will be fine.Indeed, Merry and Pippin are alright; having befriended a monstrous tree-being named Treebeard; leader of the ents. Soon, the ents are going to war with the wizard Saruman, who sent the orcs into their land.Gandalf and the others, however, travel to Rohan to muster their horsemen against Saruman's remaining forces. There's a battle at Helm's Deep, and a confrontation with the wizard Saruman himself to endure, but ultimately, it's only a foretaste of the tremendous conflict to come; with Sauron, and Mordor.The second book of the Two Towers chronicles the journey of Frodo and Sam across the lands outside of Mordor; the cliffs, the marshes, and the crossroads, where after discovering that traveling through the black gate isn't an option, they meet the Gondor captain Faramir. He finds out about the ring, but refuses to try to claim it, or take it back to Gondor with him. Instead, he lets the hobbits go on their way again, towards Cirith Ungol; where a tremendous spider lays in wait for them.Over the course of this book, the hobbits meet and befriend Gollum, who, for a while, guides them towards Mordor, but ultimately betrays them in the hopes of getting the ring back. The book ends with a climactic fight between the giant spider Shelob and Sam; struggling to protect the life of his best friend Frodo.The themes of good and evil are perhaps a bit less pronounced during the Saruman arc, but not by much. It's pretty clear that he's the bad guy from the start, and this story delves much more into the specific things that evil does to a person who was once good. The face-off scene between Saruman and Gandalf is, in my opinion, quite possibly the most complex and magnificent scene in the entire book; showcasing the true differences between the two, and the difference between minds accustomed to good, and to evil.I also found the first book just a bit more exciting than its predecessors, though I won't say it was perfect. The parts with Treebeard moved rather slowly, and at times, it became difficult to tell who was responsible for what evils. I also found the ents just a tiny bit threatening; not in terms of being scarey, but because they reminded me of modern naturalists.Still, even on those terms, anyone trying to use ents as an analogy for naturalism would be basically shooting themselves in the foot, because there's no serious comparison of the sort that could be made. Ents are intelligent, and trees aren't. If trees were intelligent, they too would have civil rights, and naturalists would be out of a job.I also feel I should say a few words about the battle at Helm's Deep. I really enjoyed reading it, and liked the way it was resolved. In fact, I'm sort of not sure which I like better; the movie version or the book version, and up to now, I've liked the movie version of most Tolkien battles better. Maybe it's just that this is the first battle he actually took time to dwell on and describe.As for the second book, I honestly think that it's the best I've read so far, out of the first four. It has tension, which doesn't really let up at any point during it, and the final battle against Shelob is one of the best in the book series. I was also very impressed with the strong relationships between the characters of Frodo and Sam, and the constant development of the character of Gollum throughout the book. His character in particular is both amusing (at times) and also an interesting illustration of what happens to a person mired in, and addicted to grave evil; how they develop when shown kindness, and how easily they betray when tempted again.I found Faramir to be an interesting character, in a sense, although many of Tolkien's human characters seem to ring a bit hollow to me, perhaps because I personally prefer stories of the fantastic, while he seems enamored with humans (a major thread in LOTR, at any rate, though less in the movies than in the books.) Faramir doesn't really suffer from this, however, because he has the chance to develop relationships with Frodo, Sam and Gollum, and to show what kind of man he is by the choices he makes. Because all this effort was put into him, I find him to be a well fleshed-out character, and a boon to this book, rather than a drag.On the whole, I was very pleased with this book, and like the others, I reccomend it to those with patience and good reading skills. It was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ya know, I thought that the Fellowship of the Ring was good. And it was, but The Two Towers makes the fellowship look like a crappy-written novel. Shelob's lair had to be my favorite chapter, I was totally immersed in the book and I felt as if I was right there in the spider's lair. It was great!!!! I would recommend this book to every living human being. GR8!!!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This narrator is very good. I have enjoyed this very much. A poor narration can ruin the best of stories."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is really great, and the audiobook is read well. The speaker includes all the songs and even sings some of them. Sometimes his voice is a little irritating in that if you already have an impression of a character his voice doesn't quite fit, (most of the issues i had with this narrator was in the hobbit with thorin) but overall he's excellent."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"honestly, I love this book, and yes I have seen the movie and I would much rather read the book again. I wanted to read it because my dad had mentioned a few scenes from the novel that weren't in the book and they sounded very interesting, so i decided to read the novel and it was amazing, of course, I started from \\"the Fellowship of the Ring\\", which i will report on next quarter but i really decided to do this book because of the 3 books, the two towers really is a good median of action and beginings. I would recommend this novel to anyone, it appeals to kids from 10 to people that have lived their days to 100, it is wonderful and i think you should consider reading this triumpful novel. -725 pages-"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read The Lord of the Rings the Two Towers. I liked it because it was a very action-packed book. It was a very adventurous book also! One of my favorite parts is the Battle of Helms Deep. I think this book is like a war book because of all the battles Aragorn, Legolas and Gimili have to go through while searching for Merry and Pippin. Then Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili have to battle Orcs, Goblins, and Ura-khai in their adventurous battle for mankind! I would recomend this book for people who like fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"(See my other reviews for \\"Fellowship\\" and \\"King\\")Of the three, \\"Two Towers\\" is without a doubt my favorite. All the fun happens here: the ents, that horrid forest, and loads of Merry and Pippen goofing around. The only thing that would have made this one better is some more mention of Rosie, because, let's face it...Rosie and Sam are adorable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Times have become darker as the inevitable battle with the evil Sauron approaches. The Fellowship has been split up during this darkest hour. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn have been sent in hot pursuit of Merry and Pippin, who were captured by the attacking Urukhai. With Gandalf lost, Sam and the highly depressed Frodo press on toward Mount Doom, their journey looking more and more hopeless as it presses on. They meet with the manic depressant schizoid Gollum/Smeagol, who guides them shadily into the vast kingdom of Sauron. How can our heroes beat an evil like Sauron when there is so much darkness engulfing all of the Fellowship? Can Frodo be strong and face this faceless opponent?This book is by far one of the greatest fictional books that I have ever read. There is almost constant action at every turn, and it can keep a person's attention for hours on end. Tolkien has used his genius to create a world of fantasy and suspense that boggles the imagination. The twists that are placed in the book and the in depth descriptions of all the characters leave no stone unturned and leave the reader with the perfect view of all the characters. This story gives you a great sense of all the times of the real world too. The way Tolkien uses the dead marshes of Mordor as a visual of what he saw in World War II and the terrible things that occurred during that war. His depictions and transitions into different storylines are almost seamless, leaving you wanting to get through the next chapter to see what happened with the first. This book is by far one of the great fiction novels of the time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read a very good book and that book was The Lord of The Rings The Two Towers.There were two things I liked in the book and that was they how Leglas shot two arrows at his enemies. Then the last thing I liked was when Gandalf was coming over the hill for Aragon with an army. I think this would be good book for everyone to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This review is in reference to what Jacobs (see review below) and others have written. I have not listened to this audio narration, but I have read the books. It's true that the story goes a little overboard when it comes to details. But it's important for everyone to realize that Tolkien was a linguist. He was most interested in languages, not fantasy. He had invented a completely new language (Elvish) and wanted to share that language with the world. Plus, he was very interested in what kinds of songs &amp; stories different races would have. The Lord of the Rings was the best way he saw to present his new language and songs to the world, to wrap it up within a story. He researched ancient myths and runes from countries around the world and put them all together to create a world called Middle Earth. So if the story seems to go too slowly for you, just remember that it was NOT Tolkien's aim to tell a great fantasy story. His primary aim was to share with the world the songs/stories of the different races, the Elvish language, and his invented Hobbit race. Naturally, that means that he'll go a little overboard describing every little detail about Hobbits and Elvish. Tolkien was surprised by the big response his trilogy recieved, and even more surprised by how many people tried to make his story into something it wasn't intended to be.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the world he created and I enjoy how he brought so many old, mythological creatures to life. If it wasn't for Tolkien, the modern fantasy genre wouldn't have taken off the way it did. If it wasn't for Tolkien, the Dungeons and Dragons world (Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, etc. books) wouldn't have existed. In fact, if it wasn't for Tolkien, many of our modern fantasy novels wouldn't be full of the dwarves, elves, and other creatures in the form they are in now. All those things took off because of the hype over his trilogy during the 1960's. I'm very grateful for the impact his story had. It's just important when you go back and read his trilogy to realize that his aim wasn't to cause any of that. His main aim was not to tell a good story. His main aim was to teach everyone what he had invented (namely, the languages and folklore of the races). I know this because Tolkien himself said so many times. Don't go into the story expecting something different."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Ok to start off im am well aware that we all have our own opinions as far as well everything, but bashing this book is only the passtime of those addicted to something not legal in the united states. hmm... where to begin, how about with the first review 1 star &quot;i didnt like this book i thought it was scary&quot; what the hell is wrong with you tell you what pull the covers over your head and turn the nighlight up so you can read you pop up books. ok next victim stated this book was boring had cheesy characters and is boring read wheel of time. Man i dont know what your on but it must be good you see all those cheesy character are the basis for all the other characters in pretty much every single fantasy ever written are based on what tolkien wrote. a dwarf is always the the way tolkien described it in this trilogy, same goes for elves wizards and halflings. Oh yea the story is mundane and cheesy as well. man oh man gotta love the simple minded. you see god knows the whole fantasy setting does seem to blend from book to book, but when tolkien wrote this masterpiece it wasn't and do you know why, because tolkien created the entire fantasy genre with this cheesy storyline. every other fantasy nad i mean every other fantasy you read you can thank tolkien for because if not for him modern fantasy writers would have to go through all the trouble he did of creating an imaginary world with divers races and settings, also a few languages, oh and like i said tha basis that modern fantasy writers use for there characters, also creating a few thousand years worth of history. So in short read the wheel of time excellent fantasy, as are many others but try to remember who put all the work into it because all of them are just this book regurgitated, sad but true"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The hardest part of being in the middle of a trilogy is its has no beginning and no ending. But was that a problem when you have the first and the third at hand?Really its not a matter for me as a reader even the writer JRR Tolkein at one time in his life writing this book feel tired and hopeless.The complexity of this novel is very clear in this second installment. The characters are not confused anymore and the journey is somehow sickening in somepart ( Frodo and Sam with ashes and irritatingly routine meals, lembas) and interesting in the others (Helm's Deep and Sam as a hero)."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkien out does the first book of his series The Fellowship of the Ring with his second book The Two Towers. This book could stand on its own without a prequel or a sequel. The level the writing takes on is phenomenal. This book concentrates more on the travels of the other companions in the fellowship than on Frodo. Several mishaps and adventures come about as the Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track their kidnapped comrades Merry and Pippin. More than a &quot;cult classic&quot;, this book serves a deeper purpose; it sheds light on the exploits of humanity. It shows the darkness and the unity man posses within himself. The story picks up with the escape of Frodo and the capture of Merry and Pippin. It includes the return of Gandolf and the battle of the Ents at Isengard. Man begins to unite in the land of Rohan. This portion of the epic ends with the Frodo and Sam nearing Mordor after a near deadly encounter with Shelob and the rest of the Fellowship trying to unite all the lands of men together for battle with Sauron."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Hello fellow readers! You have ventured into this page to read my view on the lord of the rings: the Two Towers. Let me start off with saying that the movie by New Line CInema is out December 18 in theaters. ok.The Two Towers is a continuation of the first book, the Fellowship of the ring.It starts off where The FOTR ended, Boromir is dead in Aragorns Arms(sorry if ya haven't read that yet!),Legolas and Gimli are running around fighting the last of the orcs, Merry and Pippin are captured, Frodo is in the Lothlorien boat, and Samwise in running through the forest, trying to find Frodo. Sam does find Frodo and convinces him that Frodo needs Sam there with him, and Frodo, being very fond of Sam, decides thats the best thing to do right now. They both get in the boat and paddle over to The east shore and start there treck to Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn is in a very tight spot. He could either follow Frodo and Sam, leaving Merry and Pippin to torment, or follow the Uruk-Hai and leave Frodo and Sam very much unprotected. In the end he decides for the better, that he, Legolas, and Gimli should go and track down Merry and Pippin. So renued with vigar and spirit, they set off at a fast pace. Day after day they run until they reach the plains of Rohan. They see then that even though they are running as fast as possible, with no rests, the Uruk-Hai are very far away and are running through the nights. Even though, they keep running. The hobbits are alive they find, but before they can catch up to them, they are barred by the Riders of Rohan. The Hunt continues until they find themselves in the fangorn forest, where they meet a very special friend, Gandalf! There is alway a big battle in all of the Lord of the Rings books, and in the Two Towers, it is the battle of Helm's Deep. In the second part of the book, it goes back to Frodo and Sam, and Smeagol, or Gollum as we know him. Gollum has offered to lead Frodo and Sam through Mordor safely, or will he?

Some were bracing for war against the evil of Sauron. Others were dealing with the treachery of the evil wizard Saruman.Tolkien masterfully conveys his message to the reader. The general theme of this book is that good always triumphs over evil, and the author displays this in the text very well. When the reader thinks that the fight is hopeless, a miracle happens and good triumphs in the end.When I read this book, I found it to be exhilerating and fulfilling to me.

The first book was translated to a movie which i saw. I liked the movie so much that couldn't wait for the next movie to come out, and many people told me that the movie was exactly like the book; So i decided to buy the book.the author tries to give his message to the reader by expressing it through the plot and the theme. Plot and theme is very important in a story and this book is full of it, it is very suspensful has relations to the rennaissance times in europe. In this story is about a series of rings that were given to all of the powerful leaders of the dwarfs, elves, man and one given to the dark lord of mordor. This single ring has the power to control the world but the ring was lost from the lord when he was killed. It rested for thousands of years until it as found again and given to Frodo, the hobbit. He and some key friends were sent to mordor to destroy the ring. The second book starts in the middle of their misson were all has gone wrong. frodo has taken leave with trusty friend Sam, gandalf was believed to be killed, one member of the fellowship has been killed, and two hobbits were taken prisoner. The three remaining members of the fellowship went out to rescue the hobbits where Frodo felt that he had to go alone(with the exception of his friend Sam) because the ring had a seductive power to people of the weak mind and were trying to steal it from him. The hobbits were found and Gandalf ended up not to be dead.

The ending is too good to be given away, so too bad."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Who ever said that sequels are never as good as the originals? In Tolkien's second novel, The Two Towers, Tolkien disproves this theory about sequels. The Two Towers is the second book in a three book series.Before reading this book, one should read The Fellowship of the Ring, because in this novel, Tolkien develops the main characters that are all trying to help Frodo destroy his ring. The danger and peril faced in this novel is met and possibly surpassed in the sequel. In The Fellowship of the Ring, the dangers they had to overcome were not as extreme because they were facing them as a group instead of the characters facing them separately as they did in The Two Towers. The Perils are also not as severe as those faced in The Two Towers... BR> If one is wondering how Frodo came to bear this powerful ring, one should read The Hobbit. The novel tells the story of Bilbo, Frodo's uncle, and his adventures with a fellowship of elves also in this novel Gandalf is introduced. Tolkien describes his world that he created for his characters in this novel also.Overall this reader was very interested with the novel, The Two Towers, and found the novel very entertaining. The way Tolkien wrote these fantasies was very unique. Through out the novel, Tolkien was very descriptive. This was a good and at times a bad thing. Take for example an action scene, descriptions are the key to a well-written battle and Tolkien does this very well. Also Tolkien uses good description on his characters. The only bad thing about Tolkien's descriptions is that he may get carried away and starts describing things that are not pertinent to the novel. When this happens it tends to make other things unclear and hard to understand thus makes that section boring and not important to the novel.

Aragorn (the human),Gimli (the dwarf),and Legolas (the elve)has now left Emyn Muil to save the hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orchs.Frodo and his best friend Sam now decides to enter the shadowland of Mordor alone,because it is too dangerous to enter it for the others.This book is divided in two halfs. The first half is about Legolas,Aragorn and Gimli\`s adventures. First,they meet up with Gandalf (that might come as a surprise to many)and then leaves to help King Theoden of Rohan to fight the orchs.Merry and Pippin escapes the orchs and meet up with Treebeard,who is some kind of living tree - an ent.The second half is about Frodo and Sam\`s adventures on their way to Mordor and Mount Doom,their encounter with the creature named Gollum and a really terrifying monster named Shelob.Over all,this sequel is very exciting. It is fun to read two adventures which takes place at the same time,but on different locations. The first book introduced us to the Middle Earth with detailed descriptions etc,but this one is more like just a great adventure. If you like action,this book will not disappoint you.There is a lot more action in this one.Over all,all of the books are like one great adventure. Like the first book,this book has a little unclear ending too (but I won\`t reveal what)to overgo directly in \\"Return of the King\\",the last part of the series.As for what I remember,this was the most exciting book to read as there happend so much. It doesn\`t feel slow at any time. There is always something. And Tolkien has chosen to put out the dramatic sequences here and there. There is no time when it\`s just \\"action,action,action\\" and \\"talk,talk,talk\\". He varies it deeply in all of the books.

The book is told in the third person showing all the events of Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, which made the book fun and captivating. However, I did become bored with many of Tolkien's unnecessary descriptions that I found too lengthy and often too detailed. Still, the book kept me interested to the very end.

Tolkien, tells what happens to everyone in the company after the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring. The first half of the book tells what happens to Boromir, Merry, Pippen, Aragorn, Legolas, Gandlaf, and Gimli. The second half tells of Frodo and Sam who are lost in Emyrn Muil. The book tells of how they meet a \\"friend\\" who leads them for a while they face many other dangers.Sam Gamgee is a likeable character because he comes from a different social class than the other hobbits and he still protects his master and fights with honor. Pippen seems like a likable character. He does a lot of wrong things at the wrong time, but his personality seems cute. Merry's character is very unique compared to many other hobbits. He has to face things that many hobbits would not have to face. The way the author keeps you in suspense throughout the book and does not just blurt out what he is thinking is good. The ending is both satisfactory and unsatisfactory. The author makes you think one bad thing had happened until the very end. The theme of the book is good always triumphs over evil.The author's style is overall satisfying. At some points in the book the author keeps you very interested and in other parts, he loses the reader. The author goes into very detailed descriptions but it is not too much. The vocabulary is pretty difficult. I disliked the way the book is cut in half and you don't really know what is going on with the other characters until you finish half of the book. The book would probably appeal to people from the ages of 10 all the way to adults because of the violence. It is also, appealing because of the many friendships in the book.

In The Two Towers, the second installment of the Trilogy of the Lord of the Rings, the tale of the One Ring's journey from the Shire to Mordor is continued.

The books starts out with the continued tale of Aragon the ranger, Gimli the dwarf, and Legolas the elf as they rush to save Merry and Pippen, two hobbits, from suffering in the hands of the evil wizard Saruman and his Orc servants. Along the way they are helped by the riders of Rohan, Gandalf the wizard returned from the grave, and the Ents of Fanghorn. At the same time, the story follows Frodo and Sam, the last hobbits to remain in the fellowship, as they bear the ring on. They are lead by Gollum and face the many perils of the lands around Mordor.

Take the time and pick up this book today!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What can I say? After over 65 years, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is still the ultimate fantasy epic. I won't go on and on gushing in praise. I will just note one of the brilliant literary devices that Tolkien uses that sets this book apart from so much other fantasy work. Tolkien weaves a complex narrative with many characters and plot twists, but also manages to set up brilliant parallels between them. For example we see two leaders (Theoden and Denethor) who face strikingly similar challenges, but Tolkien shows them responding differently. The former leads his men against evil, while the latter is cold and despairs. This use of paralleling gives the book so many layers and adds lasting value. Indeed, it's no wonder people can read this book many times over and not get bored. While the Peter Jackson movies are great, it doesn't - and can't - capture all of the nuance in the book. If you haven't read it yet, you're in for a treat."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It really kept me reading. I learned more about Frodo and Same and their quest to destroy the ring. While reading this book I could easily imagine the events. If you enjoyed the first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, you should read this book. There wasn't any part of the book I didn't like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is an amazing credit to all literature everywhere. The style that Tolkien uses is astounding in detail thus making you feel almost part of this epic adventure. With the twists and turns that heroes take to proceed onward through their journeys. It is astounding how he makes it able to fallow the path of multiple characters at the same time yet keep it from becoming to confusing. The way words are placed in each sentence with extreme care as not to make the plot line any more confusing is very well done, this makes the story well written and an amazing novel. The lord of the rings: the two towers sucks the reader into it's plot and keeps them there until the book is done. This is one of the few books that has actually kept my attention all the way through the book not letting me put it down by any means. The flow of the book makes you want to become one of the races of middle earth and take on the roll as one of the adventurers to fight the evil forces of Mordor and cast away the ring of power. This book is the second one in the trilogy of The Lord of the rings and is the best written of the three. The two towers helps define the meaning of and epic adventure through the hardships and challenges that the characters must face the complete their task at hand and the internal conflicts within them selves."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second installment in teh LOTR trilogy is without a doubt my favorite. Particularly the first part of the book in which Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas track down Merry and Pippin, and the Ents awake to defeat Saruman's orcish forces. This is just top notch fantasy that doesn't slow down much at all from cover to cover, keeping the reader turning pages.While I liked the first movie maybe a little more than the first book, I thought the second book was better than the movie. There are lots of good parts in the book that are left out (Faramir and the elaphaunt) or just changed completely (Sam's use of the ring of power) that change the overall feel of the story in a way that takes away from some of its attactivness. I was actually surprised to find just how much liberty the makers of the movie took in altering the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"...In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.\\" In this second book of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Frodo, the unwilling heir of the one ring, decides to journey off alone with his servant Samwise Gamgee. He makes his way eastward to Mordor and the fire mountain, Mount Doom. Meanwhile, his friends and companions from the Fellowship are caught in a bloody quarrel with the trader Saroman in his well-guarded fortress, Isengard. Saroman sends his army to destroy the main city of Rohan, but the great army of King Theoden soon beats his bloodthirsty orcs. Saroman is soon attacked by the ents of Fangorn forest, and his putrid fortress is destroyed. The book ends with the coming of the great darkness and a terrible War of the Rings. What happens to Frodo, the ring, and his friends remains to be seen in the next book.When I first picked up this book, Tolkien's marvelous writing compelled me, and made me see the emotions and terrible hardships Frodo and Sam have to endure on their journey, and also let me experience the terrible battles first hand. I recommend this book to people who have wild imaginations and who can stay on topic with the story's crazy names and titles. This book was great and I can't wait to read the final installment!Vince S.Des Plaines, IL"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring, and the second part in what is known as Lord of the Rings. This book is also the best part from the Lord of the Rings.The book is mainly divided into two parts. In the first part, we follow the acount of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. As the trio continues to search for Merry and Pippin, they run into the White Rider. Is this White Rider a friend or foe? And you will also follow them as they travel through the land of Rohan, and combine forces with Rohan's king and army. Join the crew as they travel to Helm's Deep, and face the forces of Isengaurd, and a final confrontaion with Saurman is at it's hand. The part with Saurman is very alarming and different that what one would expect.The second half of the book revolves around Frodo Baggins, and Samwise Gamgee. The duo is traveling throuh Eymn Muil, with hopes of reaching the Dark Gate, and to make their way to Mt. Doom. On their way, Smeagle, or Gollum catches up with them, demanding his Precious. The lust filled creature is somehow tamed by Frodo and Sam. Soon Gollum becomes a vauleable ally to the Hobbits. Soon the trio meet up with Faramir, Boromir's brother. Yet unlike his brother, Faramir is able to resist temptation by the Ring. But when a accident occurs, and Gollum misunderstands the situation, the outcome is disasterous.This book was beautifuly written by my favorite author JRR Tolkein. This book will leave you on end, as it did me. It has more action, and drama than the first book, and that is why it stands as my favorite of all of Tolkein's works. If you have just seen the Fellowship movie, and liked it, I highly suggest this book. If you have seen the Two Towers movie, and liked it, I very highly suggest it. This book will remain a constant favorite of mine"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is a follow up to The Fellowship of The Ring. Although The Fellowship was an outstanding book which sets up the rest of the story, it can't compete with The Two Towers. With far more action and different sides of the story to view from the reader is engaged in the action resulting in anticipation and wonder.The Two Towers is well written allowing an easy read for people of all ages. Although it is written in a different style than that of non-fantasy books, it is still written for an easy understanding. With a well devised structure and an effective flow in the way The Two Towers is written, the reader is more likely to stay interested in the story and want to read on. With such a detailed plot J.R.R Tolkien paid great attention to the description of each scene and what is going on to allow the reader to picture what is happening in their mind with extreme detail.Of course without a good story, there is no way a book could succeed. It doesn't matter how well it is written: if the story isn't interesting then there is no way the reader is going to keep reading. With a well thought out plot and many details to the story, The Two Towers can get a little confusing. There is always an appendix (located in The Return of the King) to look at if something is a little confusing. This allows the reader to stay with the story and not get lost.The way The Two Towers is written and such an engaging plot, Tolkien created a masterpiece that will keep even people who aren't into fantasy stories entertained. The attention to detail allowing for an easy read for people of all ages, The Two Towers will be a book read for decades to come."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A grim, tragic, brooding and beautiful book, shot through with heroism and hope...this is the 2nd volume in Tolkien's epic adventure. If you haven't read the 1st book then I strongly recommend that you read it before you read the second one(you won't fully understand the story if you don't read the first one).Frodo and his Companions have been beset by danger during their quest to destroy the ring of power. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the Company was attacked by Orcs(aka Goblins). Now the two hobbits, Frodo and Sam, make their way alone down the River Anduin-alone, that is, except for the mysterious creeping figure that follows wherever they go. The rest of the Company--Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli--set off in a different direction; toward the fast-marching Orcs who captured the two remaining hobbits--Merry and Pippin. The Fellowship is broken. Will Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli be able to catch up with the Orcs? What doom awaits Merry and Pippin? Will Frodo and Sam be able to reach Mordor and destroy the ring? Read the book to find out!I read this book a year ago when I was 12. The book is very detailed and has a background of measureless depth(which makes the book seem like a pre-history). For some people it may seem boring. And in truth some parts take a little longer to read(because of the detailed background). But thats what makes the events in the book seem like it actually happened. If you love fantasy books like me, and you like adventure stories, then this is the book for you. I also recomend this book to people who read and liked the 1st book, The Fellowship of the Ring. You won't be disappointed, this book is as good, or even better than the 1st book.This is a good book for people 12 years old and up. The Two Towers is one of the best books I've ever read, with elements of high adventure, suspense, mystery, poetry, and fantasy. An extraordinay work--pure excitement."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The highest I can give this is 5 stars?! That's all I can give it?! If you love mideval fantasy with extremely suspensful battle sequences, then don't pass over this book. Any of the people who give this bad ratings don't know wht they are talking about.

That book, for all its merits (and it has many) could have been called \\"LOTR: The Onset of Exposition\\" at times, so heavy does the weight of backstory fall on the reader. However, I like the backstory and find that it makes Middle-Earth richer and more realistic, knowing that for every offhand reference to some hill that the characters walk past, Tolkien came up with an entire history for that very hill and we're only hearing a tiny bit of it. I have no choice but to admire that. The other hurdle for readers of the first book was that the plot was resolutely linear in nature, since all the companions were together you basically have Point A to Point B stuff, first they walk \\"here\\" and then they go \\"here\\" and things happen and so on. Two Towers fixes those problems with style. With the Fellowship split, Tolkien divides the plot into Frodo/Sam and everyone else. Having already dealt with setting up the premise (ring=bad) he can go to town on the plot itself and it's amazing how breakneck things are, considering this is coming from a mild mannered Oxford professor. Aragorn and company range across Rohan trying to find the hobbits, trying not to get killed, running into friends and enemies while meanwhile the rest of Middle-Earth is waking up to the fact that Sauron really does want to kill everyone . . . at the same time Frodo and Sam start to realize that they might be on a bit of a suicide mission. Fantastic locations abound and Tolkien's imagination seems endless as he whips out magical setting after magical setting, switching from wondrous to horrifying to just plain beautiful in chapter after chapter. As big and epic as the events of the novels are, he never loses sight of the humanity of his characters and often contrasts the workings of the important immortal characters (Gandalf, the elves, etc) with the regular people who populate Middle-Earth and getting their perspective on things. And he never forgets to include moments of small humor and delight, Merry and Pippen finding a stash of food, Frodo and Sam discussing how people will remember their tale for years after it's over, so that the characters seem like real people who are simply caught up in things beyond their reckoning and just trying to figure out how to make it through alive. Again, it's not perfect but it's as close to the distilled essence of epic fantasy as we're likely to get. One thing I did notice that I didn't remember from my first time reading it is that the novels are almost like musicials, Tolkien must have been a frustrated songwriter because it seems like every few pages (this is more pronounced in the first novel) people stop to sing a song about something, anything. Not saying it's good or bad, just commnenting. And for those coming in from the movies, this book seems most affected by the transition from text to film, with whole sections chopped out to get crammed into the next movie and a lot of stuff simply just changed. So don't think because you've seen the films you've seen it all, the novels are still the first source and still highly preferred for those so inclined. So for all those folks who said \\"all they do is walk around!\\" this is where they start to get proven wrong."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This book continues the journey of the fellowship. Their task is to destroy the ring of power. Unfortunately, the fellowship is broken up. The hobbits, Frodo and Sam, continue on towards Mount Doom. The rest of the group race to save Merry and Pippin, who have been captured by Sauruman's troops.This book races through events and follows the two groups as the story unfolds. Where will the fellowship find help? Can Gollum be trusted? We are introduced to the people of Rowhan, Gondor and the wonderful Ents. We witness the first great battles of the war (at Isengard and Helm's Deep). We can feel the tension increase as the hobbits get closer to their goal. However, the closer they get, the harder and harder the road becomes. It is similar to a wave cresting right before crashing into the rocks.This book continues the wonderous tale of the ring. Tolkien's life long work on Middle Earth comes to fruition in these books. Tolkien's focus on the details that back up the story and myths of Middle Earth reaps tremendous rewards to the reader. It is a great read!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers continues at the point where the first book ends; Frodo leaves the fellowship to travel to Mordor with only his faithful friend Sam as his companion. Merry and Pippin have been taking captive by orcs sent by Saruman. Aragorn decides to leave Frodo to his quest and to follow the orcs in hopes of rescuing Merry and Pippin. The Two Towers is divided into two parts; the first part tells the tale of Aragorn, Gimly, Legolas, Merry, and Pippin while the second part of the book talks about the journey of Frodo and Sam. I found the first part of the book really enjoyable; this is where most of the action was and where the story became more interesting. I felt the second part of the book was a little dull, mostly consisting of tedious description. It didn't hold my interest as well as the first part of the book.During the first part of the book Aragorn's pursuit of the orcs leads him, Gimly, and Legolas to Fangorn forest where Gandalf makes his triumphant return. The four of them travel to the land of Rohan to speak with King Th&eacute;oden who is currently under the control of Saruman. After Gandalf breaks his Saruman's hold the people of Rohan flee to Helms Deep to prepare a defense against Saruman's army.Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin's encounter an Ent, kind of walking, talking tree, named Treebeard. Merry and Pippin learn of the Ent's hatred of the orcs and Saruman because of the harm that they were bringing to the forest. The Ent's agreed that Saruman must be stopped and they begin their march on Isengard after Saruman has sent his army to attack Helms Deep.There were many exciting and interesting events that happened in the first part of the book. I especially enjoyed Aragorn's pursuit of the orcs; it truly demonstrated his skills as a ranger. He was able to deduce several events that took place by simply analyzing various tracks and imprints on the ground. During this pursuit Tolkien also describes Legolas' keen senses. Legolas was able to see across great distances and make out minor details. Tolkien also mentions the great endurance that Gimly and other dwarves possess. Gimly was able to run for long periods of time without resting or getting short on breath.This was one aspect that I thought Tolkien improved on in his writing. He began to write about some of his characters in greater detail. I've always thought that his characters were interesting and now that I began to learn more about them I've come to like them more. Stories with interesting characters are far more enjoyable than stories that are entirely driven by their plots. When the characters are more interesting I become more concerned with the events surrounding them, making me more interested in the plot.This was on reason that I didn't find the second part of the book as enjoyable as the first. It didn't have the same level of excitement as the first. Much of it was tedious description of every rock and plant Sam and Frodo passed as they continued on their journey. The main reason that I was interested in the second part of the book was because of Gollum, who I thought was another very interesting character.Gollum was in possession of the ring for so long that it gave him an unnaturally long life and corrupted his mind. He practically had split personalities. His \\"better\\" half was Sm&eacute;agol, or who he used to be before he found the ring. His more evil and selfish side was Gollum, one who desired to have the ring above all else. Gollum wasn't a villain when compared to Sauron or Saruman, nor was he a hero. He was a poor twisted soul that had been corrupted by the ring's evil power.Gollum became bound to the ring; it was something that he had to have and he followed Frodo throughout most of his journey just to get it back. When Gollum finally encounters Frodo and Sam they capture Gollum. Like Bilbo, who had encountered him long ago, Frodo couldn't kill Gollum. Instead Frodo spares him. Gollum swears to serve his new master, Frodo, and to guide them to Mordor. Sam is unsuccessful in his attempt to get Frodo to either kill Gollum or leave him behind and shortly after the three continue on their journey.I found their journey dull for the most part because it didn't really compare to the journey that the others experienced in the first part of the book. It wasn't until towards the end of the book did Frodo and Sam's journey become more interesting. Gollum had led the two hobbits to Shelob's liar in an attempt to reclaim the ring. Shelob is a giant spider creature that had existed on Middle Earth since almost the beginning of time. Once Gollum leads them to the lair he leaves the two hobbits in the dark as pray for Shelob. I thought this was an interesting change of pace because it portrayed Sam as a hero and he displayed the same courage that Aragorn and the others displayed in the battle of Helms Deep.Overall I felt that the Two Towers was a good story but I thought it would've been better if Tolkien had made Frodo and Sam's subplot alternate with the subplot of Aragorn and the others instead of separating the book into two sections. It was hard for me to change from the great suspense of Aragorn's pursuit, the battle of Helms Deep, and the Ents siege on Isengard, to a much slower pace story. If they hadn't been done separately the story would've been much better in my opinion because there wouldn't be such a large change of pace between the two parts of the book. However, I still felt that this was a great story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"With the war of middle earth about to start its final hours with Aragorn, Gandalf, Merry, Pippin, Sam, Legolas, Gimli and of course the ring bearing Frodo Baggins. But before that they need to reach the lands around Mt. Doom. Now with this being in J.R.R. Tolkien's three part series, The Two Towers is the second. Along with it being in the Lord of the Rings three part trilogy, this book also has three parts. The first part is Sam and Frodo being led around Mordor to reach the mountain that can destroy the ring, the second part is Merry and Pippin's journey with orcs and ents. Now the final part is Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and Gandalf on what they did to reach Mordor. Now in the book everything seems to be running smoothly for the heroes until Frodo and Sam have a brief running with Gollum... yeah... brief... and that they find a King is possessed. Everything seems to turn around while the ring gets closer to Mt. Doom.Now with the Two Towers being the second part of the trilogy. I find it to be the best. For the reasons that without knowing the journeys to Mordor and what Sam and Frodo ha to go through, it wouldn't be as important of a story. Another reason is that Gollum doesn't get killed so he plays an important role as follow the leader. And the battle of Helms Deep is one of my favorite battles because it shows death with sadness, but soon hope. I highly recommend this book to anyone that likes fantasy, but the series needs to be read in the order of 1 2 3 or else it just won't make sense.No other books in my mind can compare to the legendary Lord of the Rings. From the facts that there are no tag-along for the fun of it characters. They all have a great role and factor to playing out the story. Also, the Lord of the Rings has to be the most serious book I've ever read. Which seems difficult to do when talking about hobbits, elves, dwarves, humans, and the supernatural. But that makes it the interesting story it is today. The Two Towers stacks up to be the best book I've ever read. So read it and be happy. ^^"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"j.r.r tolkein was a brilliant man. his books inspired millions to create and begin writting. this book starts right were the fellowship left off. bomir is dead, mary and pipen have been captured my the uruk-hai, frodo and sam have set off for mordor to destroy the one ring that sauron formed from the evil of his own body. it was the one ring TO RULE THEM ALL! frodo and sam along the way find a unexpected freind golum or also known as smeagol."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"5 Stars is definitely not enough!I love Peter Jackson's movies based on Tolkein's classics but what a tragedy it seems that there are people out there, especially kids, who may assume that Jackson's is final word on the wonderful world of Middle Earth.READ THE BOOK! The story in THE TWO TOWERS is tremendous, creative and truly profound. And don't make the mistake of thinking that this book or any of the others from Tolkein are children's books.I recognize that everything in the book cannot be translated to film but there are spectacular things in this book that were left out of the movie. Watch the extended version of the movie? Yes, but READ THE BOOK first. Some of my favorite characters and characters essential to the total story were not included. There are also some unnecessary twists taken by Jackson and his crew that are simple and beautiful in the book.THE TWO TOWERS wonderfully takes up where THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS leaves off and continues to follow the progress of The Fellowship as they continue their quest to overcome the powers of Sauron as he tries to regain the great ring and to dominate Middle Earth.But A WORD OF CAUTION: should you read THE TWO TOWERS you won't be able to stop there. The next thing you know you'll be picking up THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and then wrapping up with THE RETURN OF THE KING. You won't be able to start with this one and stop there. And if you haven't read THE HOBBIT yet you will likely be adding that one to your library as well.The GOOD NEWS is that you will not regret a single moment!I could go on and on. No shame to the movies. Jackson did a terrific job with some of the most complex and beloved stories in history but, if you liked the movies, don't miss the epic stories that await you in reading the books.THE HORSEMAN"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy - one of the bestselling books in the 20th Century. The \\"Two Towers\\" is the second part of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Reading this book without having read (or seen the movie) the first part, The Fellowship of the Ring, this book does not make any sense. This book has 398 pages and is printed pretty small. Even though the book was written for adults, many kids and teens (like me) read it. It has a 6.3 reading level.J.R.R. Tolkien describes Middle Earth in the book series \\"The History of Middle Earth\\" the book \\"The Hobbit\\" and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. The Lord of the Rings really has six books, each of the three books has two books. In the first book Frodo, a hobbit (small human-like creature) gets the Ruling Ring. He and the fellowship ride for a few months and have many adventures. The fellowship's goal is to destroy the ring. At the end the fellowship scatters. In the first part of the two towers most of the fellowship (except Frodo) fight the traitor Saruman and have adventures of their own. In the second part Frodo and his servant Samwise go to the borders of the dark land, Mordor.

Tolkien, starts to summarize the trilogy about a quest to destroy a dark, powerful ring. This book demonstrates the feelings of love, hate, peril and deception.This fiction book is about a hobbit (halfling) named Frodo and his journey to destroy a weapon of mass destruction, a ring created to rule all the peoples of Middle Earth. This book picks up where the first part of the series, The Fellowship of the Ring, left off, at the watchtower of Amon Hen. This story follows Frodo and Sam all the way to the watchtower of Cirith Ungol. It follows him through his troubles through the darkening lands before Mordor. The book also follows his companions, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas through the Gap of Rohan to their great battle at Helms Deep, and their quest to find two hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by Saruman's Uruk-hai.This book is an outstanding work of literature. It can keep you on your toes through the whole thing. J.R.R. Tolkien was not just a scholar but an amazing linguist. He came up with three languages and expanded them into over five. The story shows that no matter what, you shouldn't trust new people, no matter how trustworthy they seem. Also, no matter what, you will almost always find what you are looking for, even though there may be some unexpected twists along the way.I highly recommend this book. It is an extremely righteous piece of literature. It is a great way to follow the characters through their separate journeys, after their separation, through Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was one of the greatest books I have ever read. This book is the sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien and it continues the story of Frodo the ring bearer, and his gardener Sam. I really enjoyed this book because the story line was very well thought out and Tolkien knew exactly how he wanted to put things. I also liked how Tolkien didn't just write a fantasy book that takes place in the places and times that we know. He created his own land and his own time, and this just gave him endless abilities to make the reader get into his book. I also liked how Tolkien described his characters. He didn't just tell us what they were like, but he showed us what they were like through the choices they made. Most authors would have had a tough time trying to show the reader with words what they saw in their minds, but Tolkien using a lot of detail does an excellent job of getting the reader to see what he sees. I also like this book because it really stretches the imagination and makes you think what it would be like if the world was like it was in this book. I have read the entire Lord of the Ring series and this was my favorite by far. I loved how this book sets up the ending in the third book. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or is just looking for a good book to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers, I think, is a wonderful book as are all the Lord of the Rings series. And, I personally think that J.R.R. Tolkien was a genius."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"REVIEW OF THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERSIn the book there are 8 friends that have a quest to destroy the ring and evil forever. But in the beginning they got split apart, and Sam and Frodo are left with the ring to go to Mt.Mortar where the only the place the ring can be destroyed. Throughout the way Sam and Frodo meet a strange creature who has been acquainted with the ring before. Later on in the book they both figure out what he really is after. In the book there is kindness, love, bravery, friendship, and a life-lesson.The themes of the book are bravery, love, friendship, kindness, and a life-lesson. Bravery is when Frodo faces his fears in the journey, like when he faces orcs, and love is when Aragorn thinks about his girlfriend. Friendship in the book happens when Sam saves Frodo from almost getting killed and kindness is when Sam helps Frodo destroy the ring. Life-lesson is learned by Frodo who understands to keep your friends close. This is what the theme is in the book.The characters are Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin. In the beginning of the book Frodo and Sam run away to leave Aragorn sword-wielder, Legolas bow-master, and Gimli axe-holder behind. But later into the book they find an old and lost friend. Also Merry and Pippin are caught by the urau-kia to be taken to Sauroman, the wizard who turned evil. So the ring is left with Frodo and Sam to be destroyed, and they meet something special on the way.The setting in the story is in Middle Earth. It has lakes, streams, rivers, hills, volcanoes, mountains, cities, towns, and fortresses. Or as I would say, it is just like our planet. It also has cows, fish, wolves, dogs, cats, etc. There is also evil as black riders, trolls, goblins, orcs, cave trolls, and sarouman throughout the land.I would recommend this book because if you like a book with friends, action, and bravery, this would be the book for you. There is also kindness, love, and life-lesson to be learned in this book. Characters in the book are so courageous, brave, and loyal to one another it ads up to be one important fight throughout their travels. Another thing I like about this book is the setting because it is just like our own earth. Overall I would recommend this book to anyone who deals with friendship everyday."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have recently reviewed The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring and can only reiterate: Rob Inglis is the perfect narrator for J.R.R.

Rob Inglis stye is perfectly suited to this genre, he does credit to the wonderful and unforgettable work of Tolkien."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Authors often have difficulty with the middle volumes of trilogies: the beginning may be too concerned with bringing the reader up to speed, the end may be unsatisfying because the story is not complete, or the whole volume may be simply a setup for the final installment.Not so with \\"The Two Towers,\\" the second book in J.R.R. Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. This book contains some of the most powerful (Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, Frodo's meeting with Famamir), most humorous (the reunion of the travellers in Isengard), most vividly descriptive (the landscape of Ithilien), and most deeply moving (Gollum finding Frodo and Sam asleep, the story of the Entwives, the choices of Samwise) writing in the entire trilogy. Tolkien also introduces the reader to two completely new and richly detailed societies: the Ents and the Rohirrim. The storyline has been neatly divided in two, and one of these sections further divides in two. Tolkien handles his diverging plots skillfully and with great suspense.I firmly believe that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the greatest work of literature ever written, and a case can be made for \\"The Two Towers\\" being the best book of the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is better than the first one as all the ground work has been laid and I was familiar and attached to all of the characters by this point. It was really interesting to discover more and learn more of the character Gollum and to meet other creatures and life which wanders Middle Earth. This book was FULL of surprises that I didn't see coming with a wonderful ending that kind of gave me the creeps. I'm about the start the third and final book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was good. It has adventure and battles. It was boring and dragged on in some places. I liked it because Gandalf came back. I suggest that you read The Fellowship of The Rings first. This is the second book of a trilogy The Lord of the Rings.Boromir dies while defending the hobbits Merry and Pippin from Orcs. Merry and Pippin are taken towards Saruman by Orcs. Strider, also know as Aragon, Gimili and Legolas decide to rescue them rather than follow Frodo and Sam. Merry and Pippin have to run with the Orcs, and they do for 12 days until the men of Rohan attack. A sneaky Orc tries to run off with the two hobbits but he is shot. Merry and Pippin head into Fangorn. Fangorn is an old, musty, dusty forest but fangorn is also the name of an Ent or tree herded. The hobbits meet Fangorn or Treebeard who is curious about the \\"hasty\\" folk and asks them to tell their tale. When Treebeard hears about Saruman, he is outraged, for Saruman told him he cared about the forest where he was just trying to get the Ents out of his way. Treebeard gathers Ents and they go to Entmoot, a council to decide on what they are going to do. All the Ents become angry and they leave to destroy Isengard. Meanwhile Aragon, Gimili, and Legolas are on the Orc's trail and they see many clues such as dead Orc bodies on the side of the road. The Riders of Rohan are approaching so they hide in the grass. When they go by, Strider stands up. The Riders want to know all about them and they give them two horses so they can search for Merry and Pippin. Their horses are scared off in the night so they must travel by foot. When they reach the spot where the hobbits meet Treebeard they see an old man. The man is Gandalf who is now Gandalf the White. Together they go to the Lord of Rohan. Gandalf tries to council Theoden but Wormtongue, his servant, talks him out of it. Gandalf sends Wormtongue away and then Theoden decides to fight Mordor. The riders of Rohan ride to Helm's Deep where they are trapped by Orcs. Once they beat the Orcs they ride to Isengard. There they all see what damage the Ents did, they knocked down the wall and flooded it so the only thing remaining is the tower Orthanc. Merry and Pippin meet up with Aragon, Gimili, and Legolas again. They tell each other what has happened and they go with Eomer and Theoden to watch Gandalf talk to Saruman. They can't convince him to give up Orthanc. Wormtongue throws something down and Gandalf says it's of great value.Frodo and Sam climb down a cliff using their elfish rope. Gollum, who has been following them, has climbed down after them. They try to tie him up but he screams that it is biting him. Frodo makes Gollum swear on the ring to lead them to the Gates of Mordor. Gollum does leading them through marshes and valleys. When they get to the gate, Frodo knowing no other way in is trying to decide how to enter. Gollum begs him not to and tells them of another way that isn't guard so closely. The hobbits agree and they once again start walking. Sam while cooking, his fire stars to smoke and Men of Gondor find them. Frodo talks to Faramir who is Boromirs brother. Faramir tells them that Boromir is dead but he thinks the rest of the company survived. While they are talking Sam gets angry and let's slips that Frodo has the Ring, but Faramir doesn't care. The Men of Gondor capture Gollum and they leave after farewell gifts of fine wooden staffs. Gollum leads them to a tunnel where they climb the Straight Stair and the Winding Stair, and then he disappears. Frodo and Sam make their way through. They see light and Frodo runs ahead and Shelob, a giant spider who lives in the tunnel and feasts on all who enter, catches Frodo. After shaking of Gollum, Sam comes to his rescue. Sam thinking Frodo is dead takes Sting, the Phial, and the Ring. He begins to travel towards Mordor when he hears Orcs. They take Frodo and one says that he's not dead just sleeping. Sam, who is very angry with him, follows the Orcs.You'll like this book if you read the Fellowship of the Ring. If you like adventure and magic you will also like this book. This book is a challenge because there is a lot of big words. This book also has lots of battles and fighting so if you're interested in that kind of book you'll enjoy reading this."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second \\"Lord of the Rings\\" novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. \\"The Two Towers\\" starts heading into darker territory, and will leave readers panting for more."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord Of the Rings part II The Two Towers by: J.R.R. Tolkien is a spectacular book to read. It's full of adventure, fantasy, and twists, this book has it all. It has the action, the drama, the suspence, the romance, and the comedy. You may have seen the movie, but you haven't seen anything, until you've read the book! My friend suggested I read the Fellowship of the Rings, so I did. After about 3 chapters I fell in love with it. Then I finished the book and I was upset with how long it took for me to read it. So I went and took a reading class to improve my skills. After I finished the course my friend lent me the Two Towers...I was nervous about reading it at first because of the length. Then I had a reading assignment and so I figured why don't I read this book. This time within the first two pages I felt really involved in the book.The Two Towers is the second part to the journey of Frodo Baggins, and his quest to destroy the One Ring that could bring Middle Earth to an end. It tells two different parties stories and how they fit together. One story is Frodo's story about his journey to destory the ring, and the obsticles he must overcome to continue on his quest. The second story is Aragorn(who is heir to the throne of Gondor), Legolas(an elf of the Woodland Relm), Gimli(a dwarf, Son of Gloin), Merry and Pippin's(hobbits, who are distant relatives to Frodo) story. They were his company and were supposed to lead and protect him from harm as the venture towards Mt. Doom, which is where they must go to destroy the ring. In the first book he left his companions to keep them from danger. This is their tale and what happens to them after Frodo leaves.If you are really into fantasy, action, drama, suspencful, or science fiction books, then you will love this book. I honestly thought I would hate this book, but I soon found out I was in love with it. I would recommend this book to people over 10 because of he vocabulary that J.R.R. Tolkien uses. I really love it and if you read it you will too."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Excellent book. I love the time and thought that Tolkein put into his charcaters."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In only the form that Tolkien can give, we find that the Fellowship has all but split apart, where frodo and sam head of towards Mordor, while Strider and the others go off to save pippin and merry from a horrible death.The books takes the reader more in depth, emotionally and otherwise, with the main characters. We find that the fellowship has only been split up physically. Everyone is starting to find the strength in themselves to go on and fight for what they believe in even if it spells out their own death.This book is another reason why Tolkien is one of the best writers of his generation. A very moving book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"As the quest against Sauron continues, the Fellowship has split and gone their separate ways. The first half of the book follows the majority of the Fellowship, first as they search for their captured comrades, then as they fight the forces of Saruman. The second part chronicles the voyage of Frodo and Sam (and later Gollum), as they attempt to reach the realm of the enemy.As the book progresses, the reader can really begin to see the development of each character. The long, difficult journey undertaken by Frodo, Sam, and Gollum reveals much about each character: that Frodo is struggling with the burden of the ring, the hastiness of Sam, and the inner conflict and treachery that consumes Gollum.I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre in general, in large part due to the the massive volumes generated by authors chronicling the minute details of every quest. It's tedious to read for all but die-hard fans of the genre. This arises in the Two Towers, but Tolkien's masterful sense of setting and character manage to keep the reader's interest, in spite of the long lulls in the action.This is a wonderful second installment, bridging the gap between the first stage of the quest and the final struggle. The true magnitude of Frodo's burden becomes evident, as does the power agaist which all good must stand or be destroyed."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The two towers is an awesome book I like the action and the discriptions.

The fellowship of the ring was split into three groups. Arogon (a man), Legolas (an elf), and Gimily (a dwarf). The second is Merry and Pippin (two hobbits). Last but not least Sam and Frodo the ring bearer.Merry and Pippin escape from orc soldiers when they go into a battle with the Riders of Rohan. They go into Fangorn Forest. There they find an ent named Treebeard. Or you could say Treebeared found them. Now we go back to Arogon, Legolas, and Gimily. They're looking for Merry and Pippin they run into the Riders of Rohan and they tell them they killed the orcs and burnt their heads. Your friends might be there. So they check and don't find them but what they do find is their footprints. They take their journey into Fangorn. They find nobody except a white light. The white light is Gandalf the Gray.

It's crazy, I mean you'll be reading and cold shiver will go down your spine or you'll jump mid sentence. This is a creepy line near the end of the book: \\"For long now she has been hungry...but nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did poor Sam know!\\" I also love the action in this story here's an excerpt from my favorite chapter Helms Deep: An axe swung and swept back, two orcs fell headless, the others fled. The final strongpoint in this novel is in the descriptions of the landscapes, characters, and other things. Here is a description of and Ent's hand: \\"A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders.\\"I recommend this book to lovers of fantasy and imaginative stories.

For years she writes in this diary. When she was 7 she's told that when she's older she is to marry the Dauphine of France (prince). At the age of 13 the official marriage proposal comes from the king. There is much preparation to be done before she is married. When she meets her husband for the first time she is repulsed by him, but later grows to love him.One of the things that I didn't like about Marie and all the royal characters in general was the way they thought of the \\"common\\" people. The rule that they have that common people can not talk to a royal or noble unless spoken to first is ridiculous. though I do know that was just the way it was in the past, I'm glad people don't act like that anymore. I did like how the author made the Dauphin though. How she made Louis \\"repulsive\\" looking but a little more lovable in the end.I would not recommend this book for everyone. I think you would have to be interested in history and the lifestyles of the royals long ago, or how people then dealt with things. Though otherwise I would have to say it's a good book and I would recommend it to quite a few people."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two TowersBy: J.r.r TolkienReviewed By: J. SoonPeriod: 6This book has section 3 and 4 of the Lord of the Rings series, and tells about the companies' deeds. It all starts when Bromir, a fiends who has tried taken the ring from Frodo, dies. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin were caught by orc-guards and are taken to the city of IsenGard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are in pursuit, though. Then the riders of Rohan apper, and they destroy the orcs. The hobbits now escaped and now they meet Treebeard, the ent. Later on, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli meet Gandalf again, who has returned from the dead. When they met with Gandalf, he takes Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to King Theoden's castle. Gandalf heals the king of a curse, and they are now both allied. All of them now continue their journey towards Isengard. Meanwhile, Saruman and Wormtoung are stuck in the tower of Orthanc. Saruman was no longer a wizard after this because he would not repent towards Gandalf. Wormtongue threw a stone out the window, but it failed to Gandalf, because the stone was a palantir, one of the seeing stones of Numenor. Peregrin picks the stone up and gives it to Gandalf, but later steals it at night. Peregrin looked at it, and he is revealed at Sauron. But Gandalf forgives Pippin, and gives the stone to Aragorn, who rides away to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, in a distant land, Frodo and Samwise are lost in Emyn Muil. Gollum has been on their trail. But later on, Frodo tames Gollum and Gollum becomes Frodo's servant. Gollum leads Sam and Frodo through the Dead Marshes and then they reach Morranon, the Black Gate of the Land of Mordor in the north. They can't pass through the gate, so Gollum tells Frodo to go to a secret entrance in the Mordor Mountains. While on their journey, they met Faromir, the brother of Boromir, who was leading an army of Men of Gordon. Faramir learned about the Ring, then tried to overcome his brother, Baromir. faramir then helps the hobbits by replenishing their supplies. After that, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum make their way through Cirith Ungol, the spider's pass. Faramir warned that that place was dangerous, unliked Gollum had told. Then they reach the Cross-roads, and take the path towards Minas Morgul. Meanwhile, they see Sauron's first army, led by the Black King of Ringwraiths. Gollum then guides the hobbits to Cirith Ungol. At that same time, Gollum betrays them, and leads them to a monster called Shelob. But Gollum was frustrated after that because of Sam's bravery. Samwise chases Gollum away and hurts Shelob. After that, Frodo is stung by Shelob and dies. Samwise then realizes that he must complete the journey alone, but as he goes into Mordor, he overhears the Orcs. He now learned that Frodo is not dead, but drugged. The orcs then carry Frodo's body down a tunnel where Sam cannot catch up...I liked the book because they gave italicized poems or songs. I like the songs in this book because they are both cheerful and emotional. They also might give clues what happens next in the story. For example,\\"Trough Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows. The west wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes. What news from the west O wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight. Have you seen Boromir the Tall by moon or by starlight? \\"I saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey; I saw him in the empty lands, until he passed away in the shadows of the North. I saw him then no more. The North Wind may have heard the horn of the son of Denethor. O Boromir! From the highwalls westward I looked afar, but you came not from the empty lands where no men are.\\"This song gave me clues what would happen next, so that's what I like about the Story.What I don't like about the story is that there were too many words I couldn't pronounce. Sometimes I read pretty fast, them a hard word that I can't pronounce comes up, and then I'm going to have to read the word slowly. For example,\\"The skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to spread its great wings over Emyn Muil, upon which the dark thought of Sauron brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the vale of Anduin with hail and lightning, and casting its shadows upon Minas Tirith with threat of war.\\" In those sentences, I had to stop and pronounce the hard words I couldn't pronounce. That's what I don't like about the story.My favorite part in the story was near the end of the book. Actually, it is the end of the book. It is the part when Frodo get drugged by Shelob and then taken down to the tunnel where Samwise couldn't catch up. It reminds me of a brother and he is being taken away, and the little brother cries in tears trying to catch up to him. Also I like it because in movie format, there was so much suspense. in the movies, the orcs take away Frodo, carryng him down the tunnel, when Sam tries to get him back. Then after that, it just says \\"The End.\\""},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book will keep you on he edge of your seat.

The language of this book is excellent. It is very discritve and flows wonderfully, but the differences betwen what an elf is, and what a gnome is, is confusing. The plot I think is predictable.

I think that this is my favorite book of the three so far, but I'll have to hold back final judgment until I read The Return of the King, the final book in what has turned out to be my favorite trilogy. The story as interpreted, is broken up into two stories that combine in the end to make sense of this dramatic thriller. The first part of the book has a wide range of activity; it's about the beginning of the War of the Ring in the time of Middle Earth and it concentrates mainly on Merry and Pippins adventure through mysterious lands. As they meet some of the cruelest and unique creatures, they press on to find Frodo and Sam who are on their way to destroy the ring. The second part of the book follows Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as they try to make their way to Mordor, to the top of Mount Doom where the ring can be destroyed to preserve the world.

Tolkein, is the middle book in his science-fiction trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. This book takes place at the end of the third age in Middle Earth. Frodo the Hobbit had set out from his home in the Shire located in western Middle Earth. At the start of this book he has just broken up from the rest of his fellowship, which set out from Rivendell, an Elvish town. Frodo and his servant Sam head off to destroy the dark lord, Sauren's, ring. Elsewhere, Two other Hobbits, Maryodock Brandybuck and Paregrin Took, have been captured by Orks. Trying to defend the Hobbits, Boromir, the ere to the thrown of Gondor, was killed. Now trying to rescue the Hobbits are Aragorn, who descends from the line of Isildur (an ancient king of Gondor), Gimli the Dwarf, who comes from the lonely mountain, and Legolas the Elf, who dwelles in Mirkwood. The final member of the fellowship is thought to have been killed, in the mines of Moria. He is Gandalf the Wizard. The first half of this thrilling novel is the quest of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas to find the two captive Hobbits. As it turns out the Hobbits escaped from their captors when a battle between the Orks and the riders of Rohan occurred. The Hobbits head to the dark forrest, Fangorn. Their they meet the the Ints, a peaceful treelike people. The ints head off to destroy the citidel of Saurumen the wizard, Orthanc, who betrayed Middle Earth. The three warriors find the Riders of Rohan and go with them to battle the Orks who escaped from Orthanc. The last part of the novel tells of the journey of the ring barrer. Frodo and Sam head towards Mordor, the land of Sauren, to destroy the one ring. The two Hobbits meat Gollum, a creature who once possessed the ring. Together they head to Mordor. This book was a wonderful novel. A page-turner. It only got boring at one part for about 25 pages but spiced right back up afterwards. This book is a must read for anyone who likes science fiction."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I first read this book in the mid 1960s. I had no idea what it was about or who J R R Tolkien was. I didn't even know that it was the second book in a series of three. I had just picked it at random from a row of library books.When I started to look at it I was disappointed to see that it was the sequel to a book I hadn't read. I persevered for a few pages - and I was hooked!It was the character of Aragorn that drew me in. In other fantasies that I had read human beings were dupes or pupils of supernatural creatures. Yet here was a man to whom an elf and a dwarf deferred. The action was non-stop. I didn't know what had happened but I could empathise with the choices that Aragorn had to make and with his worries that his choices were going awry.At the half way stage when the action turned to Frodo and Samwise I was disappointed. But soon I was engrossed again.When I finished the book I went onto TRoTK to see what happened in the end, and only went back to TFoTR and The Hobbit after that.I still think that's quite a good order. TFoTR contains a lot of stuff that is boring unless you already have an overriding interest in Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book arrived quickly and it was obvious it was never used. It was also OLD, as the pages are yellowed with age all around the edges. The cover 'cracked' after the first chapter and I'm hoping the book stays intact long enough for my 5th grader to finish it. I did not like that the cover image shown on Amazon (circa 2001 Peter Jackson's movie) was not the version we received. The cover image on our book was a cheesy 70's graphic, which explains why the book is in such brittle condition."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the second book I've read by J.R.R. Tolkien, and out of the books I've read by him this definitey is one of the better. It may not be better than the Hobbit (There and Back Again) though I think it is much better than the Fellowship of the Ring. The first hundred pages might be fairly slow but that would be what it would be if it were real life. Also, the pages after the first hundred are more gripping and exciting than almost any section in the entire Fellowship of the Ring. Even after the boring pages it is still a good read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am new to the fantasy genre. As I started on the first pages of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (in anticipation of the movie), I did not know exactly what to expect and was initially put off by the many songs and by &quot;Tom Bombadil&quot;. But after that brief state of confusion, I have come to thoroughly enjoy Tolkien's writings, the luscious details of history and geography, and - of course - the characters.In THE TWO TOWERS Tolkien dazzles us with his imagination and continues to bring all the components of Middle Earth to full life, in a description so vivid that one thinks that it must exist. Each half of the book builds up to climactic experiences as we journey through the lands of men and darkness, while the presence of the hobbits - their simplicity and naivete' - anchors us firmly to the human side of the epic. Characters are given more chances to express their individuality and to prove their worth as they face physical demons, and the ones that reside in their heads. The growth in characters such as Samwise Gamgee is very genuine and gripping. We are left at the end with a cliffhanger that compels you to read the last part of the trilogy. (I wonder what Peter Jackson will do about that?)One could argue about the lack of humor and female characters, but ultimately it is the beauty and the sense of purpose behind Middle Earth, its inhabitants and its history that should win over even the most skeptical of readers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Without a doubt, the best fantasy series of all time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Wow! These books are amazing. Absolutly amazing! Tolkien writes so magically. The description in these books is fantastic. You get to know the characters and fall in love with them. (In my case-Aragorn) He used a great balance between dialogue and discription. I could not put these books down. I highly recommend The Lord of the Rings to anyone, anyone at all. Regardless of wheather they like Sci-fi fantasy books or not, they will love LotR."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second Installment in The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy.It is a most beautifully written story and you will soon find yourself on middle earth,the place where the story takes place. The creatures in the book range from Elves to Orcs and the individual characters each have Thier own personality. The main character is Frodo a small hobbit dealing with a very big responsibility. You should read this book if you like fantasy"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was an excellent novel. The creativity of J.R.R. Tolkien was aw-inspiring and strange denizens and other surprises became ubiquitous (but not overused) fast. Odd creatures and humanoid races were commonplace. Settings were amazing and truly contrived of the stuff of fantasy. Also, the storyline was unique and well concieved. All of the characters were unique and spectacularly designed and each had his/her own personality and individual dispositions. I loved the structure and how the author would describe a period in time from one place or point-of-view, and then tell what happened elsewhere during the same period of time. Ultimately it was.... well, fantastic! I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"A great book that continues Tolken's series Which shows the powrs of good and evil on the verge of war and the fate of the one ring this book is one of the greatist fantesy books ever writen!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the continuation of the Fellowship of the Ring. I would recommend this book only to those who have read the Fellowship first, for the Two Towers picks up right where the Fellowship left off. I enjoyed the Two Towers immensely. The Battle Scenes are richly detailed and present the reader with a picture that rivals the best scenes in Braveheart. I cannot wait until I purchase the Return of the King, for it is the 3rd book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I would recommend all 3 books to a reader who enjoys the fanstasy genre or even to someone who just wants an encompassing story with one of the best plots you'll ever find."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Don't let anybody tell you differently - The Lord of the Rings is one of the greatest works of fiction in the 20th century, fantasy or not. It is rich and beautiful, crafted with a skill and caring that modern fantasy writers cannot match.'The Two Towers' is the second book in this series, and serves as a bridge from the initial tale of Frodo's flight from the Shire and the Fellowship's journey to the huge scope of the larger war for Middle Earth that is at hand.Those readers with short attention spans are not likely to enjoy the amazing depth with which Tolkien shapes his world, nor are they likely to be able to tolerate a book that does not rely solely on battles to advance the plot. Those who adore epic adventure, huge stories, rich histories, and interesting places to vistit will *love* this book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I was blown away by the excitement and thrills that kept you wanting to turn the page over and over. Tolkien creates a world where you are actually there, amongst the magical creatures that are created with it, his descriptiveness and word use is the best I have read yet. The plot keeps you &quot;on the edge of your seat&quot; and is filled with wonderment. I strongly reccomend this book to all who havent read it yet, it is a must."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Fantasy tales have long been recognized for their tales of magic, mythical creatures, and far-off lands of make-believe. Magical rings have often been used in such tales of magic to provide an intriguing source of magic and mystery. Most of these rings play important roles in the stories they are found in. Howerver, there is one magical ring whose significance far exceeds the importance of any other magical ring in any other fantasy story so much that it causes an entire trilogy to evolve around it. This ring is known as the Ring of Power. The continuing story of this magical ring and its bearer, Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit of the Shire, is told the second part of J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers. The Lord of the Rings tells of the adventures of Frodo Baggins in his quest to destroy the Ring of Power. In the land of Middle-Earth, the trilogy's setting, Frodo, along with his friend, Samwise Gamgee, must take the fated voyage to the land of Mordor. When the two travelling hobbits cross paths with a villain who is having second thoughts about his villainous ways, they must decide how they will get to Mordor. Now it is up to Frodo to decide whether or not it is worth placing the entire fate of Middle-Earth into the hands of a creature that was once a member of the enemy. While reading this book I found myself totally absorbed in the story. In this sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, Tolkien once again uses vivid descriptions of people, places, battles, and thoughts to captivate his readers. Be it a character or a plain old rock, Tolkien takes the time to describe every detail. Tolkien has written the book so that there is never a dull moment in the story. The battles are so real that the reader feels that they are in the middle of the action. These are only a few of the qualities that made J.R.R. Tolkien such a great author. What lies ahead for Frodo on his journey to Mordor? Frodo and Sam both know that people who achieve something great are remembered in songs. If Frodo can accomplish this task, he could possibly be the subject of a song that will live longer than time itself. How could such a small creature like Frodo accomplish the single greatest challenge that all of Middle-Earth has ever seen? Only time will tell."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers consists of the second part of three in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Itis about a group of people and their quest to destroy the source of all evil in Middle-Earth.At the beginning of the story, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are searching for Pippin andMerry. They find them living with Ents (very big, strong, talking, walking, trees). Theyand the Ents fight a bloody battle with orcs. The action then turns to Frodo and Sam whoseparated from the \\"Fellowship\\". They are led by Gollum to Mordor, where they areattacked by a giant spider. The rest is a mystery for you until you read the book foryourself!One of my Favorite quotes in this story occurs when Gandalf, Aragorn, and therest, find Saruman in his tower and call him out for a chat. \\"Have we ridden fourth tovictory, only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with honey on his forked tongue? Sowould the trapped hound speak to the hounds, if he could.\\" This describes Saruman, avery evil man, trying to sweet-talk his way out of a jam. As you read The Two Towersyou find many unique quotes like this one. It is one of the reasons that I like the book.I would recomed this book to a patient reader who doesn't need non-stop action,and likes vivid descriptions. The author takes so much time describing the events in acertain scene that not many events really take place in the course of the story. This book,and the whole trilogy for that matter, is perfect for someone who enjoys fantasy and usingyour imagination."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I loved this book.This is my favorite book out of the three (or two, I have not yet read &quot;The Return of the King&quot;) because it really focused on the characters that in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; were just the supporting characters. The character development in this book was incredible. You start the book not really knowing anything at all about these people and end it knowing so much. I think Tolkien was able to do this because the book did not entirely focus on Frodo.My favorite part in the book is Golem. I really liked the little part he played in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; but I liked him the best in this book. It's really cool how Tolkien showed him as he loved and hated the ring and also how he had this strange affection for Frodo.This book is amazing. I loved everything about it from the way it was written to the art on the cover. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read this book after seeing the first movie. It is extremely well written, thorough storytelling. The adventures in this book are at least as exciting-if not more than-the first movie. (I say movie because I did not read the first book yet, I only saw the movie.) The characters become more interesting, more three dimensional in this second book. And the settings are spectacular. I was moved to draw several of the places mentioned in this book. I found myself wishing to visit an Ent-hall, to explore beautiful hidden caverns, to look out upon an ancient city. Absolutely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well, if you liked The Fellowship of the Ring of The Lord of the Rings series, then you'll have a ball with The Two Towers. In the second part of this story, it continues off with the scattered fellowship looking for their ring-bearer, Frodo, who somehow disappeared along with Samwise. Along with that, the quest continues with Frodo continuing his quest of destroying the ring of all evil in Mordor.J.R.R. Tolkien is a tremendous writer. Besides The Lord of the Rings, others stories like The Silmarillion is a great example of his work. This book is like an introduction of Middle-Earth, which is where The Lord of the Rings series take place. If Tolkien hadn't existed in his time, then how would fans of the him be able to live without his stories? Without J.R.R. Tolkien, then his stories wouldn't exist and how could we live with that? He also uses great imagery in his stories, which is a great asset to the series.For the fans of Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings is highly recommended, for it is written by a great author. Not only that, you don't even have to be a fan of the author. If you love stories with magic, friendship, and a fight between good and evil, then this series is a perfect match for you. For friendship, both Frodo and Sam will go far beyond the dangers of Middle-Earth to destroy that ring. If one falls, then the other falls also. That's how friendships work between Frodo and Sam. Their bond is their courage to continue on to Mordor. For me, this is why I love this story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In my review of his reading of the Fellowship of the Ring, I gave poor old Rob Inglis a bit of a drubbing (rated three stars). And, in my review of the second set, I am going to give him a bit of a break.My general comments about Inglis stand. He is a bit one paced. Because of the nature of his voice he is limited as to the range of voices he can adopt. And he as a tendency to read in an arch, almost pretentious manner which does the book and many of the characters something of a disservice. I think that because of his own age, Inglis has a tendency to make his characters sound older than they should. The best example of this is Aragorn and it was my wife who made this point first. I have always seen him as a young, vigorous man - early thirties. This is how Peter Jackson also saw him if his casting is any judge. But Inglis' rendering suggests a middle-aged man - in his mid fifties.However, my recommendation, then, as now, is to buy this version as it is the only extant unabridged version of Lord of the Rings that is available.Having said that, he seems appreciably better in his rendering of the characters in this volume of the trilogy - perhaps he grew into the reading as he went along - this often happens. There are certain characters which he has \\"nailed\\" - among them Tree Beard and most importantly of all, Gollum. Inglis' rendering of Gollum is near letter-perfect.For all my quibbles, I was completely addicted to this reading. I drive about 30 minutes to and from work each day - and have a 2 hour drive to and from our farm on weekends. If I ever found myself in the car at the end of a set of CDs, with a long drive ahead of me, I almost went stir crazy. I should also say that my brother, also a LoTR aficionado does not have the same problem with Inglis - he even likes listening to the songs! - which I still find un-listenable."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"One of the most astounding traits of Tolkein's writing is his uncanny ability to create different races that are unique in their ownright but altogether familiar to us personally. Tolkein seems to have taken a very personal vision and expressed it in a universal way. The characters are easy to relate to and the adventure is captivating...5 stars for Mr. Tolkein ..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"this is the best book for you if you liked there and back again"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers has always been my favorite book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy because there is no introductory material as in Fellowship of the Ring or winding-down material as in Return of the King. It is instead the heart of the story.Divided into two halves, the first half follows the majority of the Fellowship as they contend with the secondary but still very dangerous villain, Saruman. The second half follows the hobbits Frodo and Sam as they are forced into an uneasy alliance with the weasely Gollum and approach the hellish land of Mordor.Since this is the middle part of a larger story, few things are resolved. This is fine, as this is not meant to be read as a standalone book. It does, however, represent great storytelling, with rich detail and characters.Many have tried to imitate this trilogy and few have come even close to being near Tolkien's level. This story is not only one of the greatest fantasy stories ever, it is one of the great fictional works of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I was unhappy that I received a different cover then the one shown. I would have appreciated knowing which one I was purchasing."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers starts right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. Boromir is dead, the fellowship is broken and two hobbits are missing. Book three is the journey of Aragorn, Master Pergerin, Merry, Gilimi and Legolas search for the two missing hobbits Frodo and Master Samwise. Aragorn and the others venture through many lands and many perils. They meet with the Riders of Rohan who have light-footed horses and deadly bow accuracy, the mysterious tree type Ents who seem to be older than anything on Middle-Earth. Book four is the quest of Frodo and Master Samwise. They find themselves lost in the lands of Gondor, Rohan and at the gates of Mordor, while being followed by the elusive Smeagol. Frodo and Samwise are on a hunt to find a passage into Mordor.To me this book was not the best out of the series but the ending was good. The first hundred pages start off slow, but when Aragorn meets up with the Riders of the Mark and they begin their march to the siege of Isengard to kill Saruman the book starts to pick up. Tolkien expresses the feeling of battle well so it is easy to follow. My favorite character out of the book is Samwise. His decisions are rash at times but I think Frodo should have seeked council with him more often. It would have made the journey easier for the both of them. The end seems to express Sam as being smarter than Frodo because he seems to know what he's doing. Frodo was dazed and confused most of the time leaving Sam to do the thinking for the both of them."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this, the second book of his extraordinary series, J.R.R. Tolkien continues where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. The Fellowship has been sundered by the events which took place at the Falls of Rauros. Frodo and Sam are off towards Mordor and a date with destiny guided by the deceitful Gollum while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on a quest to save Merry and Pippin.The plot of this second novel is good, although, as it is the middle act of a three act story, it is some what slow. Tolkien is setting up the final part throughout most of the novel, so the reader should not take this as a criticism. We get a glimpse of what the war against Sauron will be like when the forces of Rohan meet those of Sauruman. Tolkien is a master story teller, one who moves his characters around as a grand master moves pieces on a chess board.The characters in this novel are well developed and continue to grow. In particular, we see the Hobbits grow out of their child-like innocence because of the weight they carry and the events they are witness to. Frodo in particular will not come out unscathed, if he is able to survive his jouney into the darkness of Mordor.If you enjoyed the first book in the series you will enjoy this one as well. You will also be eargerly awaiting the conclusion. 4.5 Stars"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After finishing the first of the series i couldn't wait to dig in to the next one.

The book is at it's best just near the end."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I liked the Hobbit and the first book quite well, yet I still have not finished reading this book. I have tried for over a year now. I lost interest because the excitement within the story is gone. It feels like the author knew how he wanted the series to end, and how he wanted to start it, but had no great ideas for the middle. The prose is slow and unenthusiastic, and the characters have not developed at all. Hobbits are reluctant heroes to the point that I wonder why they are continuing such a treacherous quest. I feel almost pained to read about these gentle, naive hobbits getting into trouble time and again. I feel bad for them, and wish they would give their quest to someone more competent and enthusiastic. I started this book right after I finished the first, and I think that was a mistake. If you want to buy this book to continue the series, put it on your wish list and wait a month. When you are really dying to know what happens, and have had a break from innocent hobbits, this book may seem less tedious."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeree eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee e e e xxx ed f d xxx Chaucer .

Strangely divided, though. The events of this book take place simultaneously in two locations, and rather than skipping back and forth, Tolkien for some reason tells all of what happens in one place, then jumps to the other parallel story, occasionally giving chronological markers -- while such and such was happening in the great battle to the north, yada yada.

Set in a land of spectacular, grandiose adventure, the Fellowship of the Ring has been split up, with Boromir's death, the capture of Merry and Pippin, and the departure of Frodo and Sam, on their way to decimate the One Ring created by Sauron, the Dark Lord. Tolkien's story of Middle-Earth is bamboozling in how a writer can accomplish so much in such a small package, with so much adventure, emotion, and tragedy!

Wait, hold on, What are hobbits?Hobbits, more formally named as halflings, are gentle folk, about as tall as your waist, and have a taste for comfort. It just so happens that Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are hobbits, hobbits with a mission. Okay, back to the subject.Middle-Earth is a land in peril, unbeknownst to most hobbits, but known to some.

Where many might abandon a mission that surely seems lost, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas continue on in pursuit of the hobbits Merry and Pippin, captured by Orks in service to the traitorous wizard Saruman, while Frodo and Sam push on into the foul land of Mordor, home of the Dark Lord and location of the volcanic Mt.

Also emphasizeddeeply the struggle of Frodo's attempt to destroy the one ring of the Dark Lord Sauron.When I read this book about three weeks ago, it helped me to understand that I didn't know anything about the true meaning of fantasy and epic adventure until I read aboutTolkien's Middle- Earth. A place where the fantasy materialize in form of a fantasticnarrative that satisfies the most demanding readers. Also it is important to consider that the book contain magnificent poems ,songs ,verses and tales that contribute in thedevelopment of a clear image about the character, the Middle Earth and the battle for thering.In this book you can explore the epic land of the Middle -Earth, the setting of the battlefor the one ring. A setting that changed constantly, from the Burien River to the forest ofFangor and from there to Rohan and then to Helm's Deep. In those chapters in the TwoTowers the main characters Aragorn the future King of Gondor,Gilmi the dwarf andLegolas the elf attempt to rescue Meriadoc and Peregrin.

Tolkien's The Two Towers brings this fantasy world of the Middle Earth to life, with his vivid description of the land around. Tolkien's epic adventure takes you on the ride right along with the characters. Though at times the tale is tedious, it is as a journey over valleys and mountains would be. If you choose to read this book, I would definitely recommend reading The Fellowship of the Ring first, it being the first book of the trilogy. That would then allow you to understand much more of the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The highest I can give this is 5 stars?! That's all I can give it?! If you love mideval fantasy with extremely suspensful battle sequences, then don't pass over this book. Any of the people who give this bad ratings don't know wht they are talking about. The plot is awesome! The coolest character is Legolas, he is like the best elven archer in Middle-earth. Elves are the best archers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well this book was cool. i am very glad i read it. i owe this to all my firends who encouragedm e to read this. it was well worht it and glad i got the chance. please do read it. it was the best."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book was a good read.

The book is faster than its prequel and it makes you want to drop every thing else until you finish it"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"JRR Tolkien's second addition to the Lord of the Rings trilogy is full of interesting plot elements and archetypes that create a very riveting and interesting story. The story itself will have you wondering what is going to happen next. At times, the book may seem slow, but in the end, it's all worth it. That being said, you may have to be a fan of The Lord of the Rings to appreciate some of the elements of the story. Simply put, it's not for everybody, but anyone can learn to appreciate the various plot elements and archetypes the author utilizes.The story has some interesting plot elements. All of the characters, such as orcs, hobbits, ents, and dwarves, help to create a very fantasy-filled setting. The dark setting adds to an already interesting story. The dark setting highlights the struggles of two principle characters, Frodo and Sam, and how difficult it is for them to guard the Ring. The Ring itself is rather interesting because of its influence over others. In the bigger picture, Tolkien probably used it to show how desperate people can get to achieve what they want and desire. But simply put, all the elements of the plot somehow create a world filled with fantasy.Tolkien's use of archetypes is very effective in establishing the meaning to the story as well as a means of communicating with the reader. The author could be using the Ring as a symbol of addiction, because it seems that whenever someone comes across it, they become infatuated by it. The character Frodo can be seen as someone with free-will because for whatever reason, he never lets himself be overcome by the Ring's power. Tolkien also uses Mother Nature as a means of communicating to the audience. By using the ents and their leader, Fangorn, and the impending conflict with the Orcs of Isengard he adds meaning to the story by possibly suggesting that people respect Mother Nature or people will get what is coming to them.Overall, The Two Towers is very effective at creating a world of fantasy while putting some worthwhile plot elements into it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The LOTR movies are great, but I like these even better!Inglis is fantastic doing all the characters--you are drawn in from the very start.The books are classics, but written in an old style, somewhat difficult to read.I'd get this over just about anything else in audible, and I've got over 50+ audible books."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I love the Lord of the Rings, and grew up with familiar covers.

The only reason I gave this book 4 stars is because of Book 3. I found it pretty boring, except for a few surprises here and there.

Although The Fellowship was an outstanding book which sets up the rest of the story, it can't compete with The Two Towers. With far more action and different sides of the story to view from the reader is engaged in the action resulting in anticipation and wonder.The Two Towers is well written allowing an easy read for people of all ages. Although it is written in a different style than that of non-fantasy books, it is still written for an easy understanding. With a well devised structure and an effective flow in the way The Two Towers is written, the reader is more likely to stay interested in the story and want to read on. With such a detailed plot J.R.R Tolkien paid great attention to the description of each scene and what is going on to allow the reader to picture what is happening in their mind with extreme detail.Of course without a good story, there is no way a book could succeed. It doesn't matter how well it is written: if the story isn't interesting then there is no way the reader is going to keep reading. With a well thought out plot and many details to the story, The Two Towers can get a little confusing. There is always an appendix (located in The Return of the King) to look at if something is a little confusing. This allows the reader to stay with the story and not get lost.The way The Two Towers is written and such an engaging plot, Tolkien created a masterpiece that will keep even people who aren't into fantasy stories entertained. The attention to detail allowing for an easy read for people of all ages, The Two Towers will be a book read for decades to come."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien is a wonderful read. It is the continuation of the journey of the Fellowship. However, in this part of the book, the fellowship is broken. In the beginning, they are deciding where to go and they end up with an ambush of orcs. Boromir dies defending Merry and Pippin who are taken away by the orcs. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn fight off the orcs and end up not finding any of the hobbits. Frodo decides that he must go to Mordor alone but sure enough, loveable Sam ends up going with him. The book is broken up into showing the journey of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli and what Merry and Pippin do as well. Another part is the travel of Sam and Frodo to Mordor that takes place at the end of the book.I have to be honest and say that I was already a fan after seeing the first movie and then reading the first book. I had to read this book and I ended up loving it because of being a fan of Tolkien. Nevertheless, it is how he writes that makes me and so many other people love his work.There was action in it that helped get me through the book. Some parts I enjoyed were Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn on the hunt of orcs to rescue Merry and Pippin. Nevertheless, Merry and Pippin end up escaping and enter Fangorn Forest where they meet a new creature called an Ent. Actually, the Ents are the tree people, who are able to move around and talk but they look like trees and are very old.Some other neat parts are the destruction of Isengard and the defeat of Saruman and a very exciting battle at Helm's Deep that is in a way my favorite part of the book.However, for me it is somewhat hard to choose my favorite part since I like the book so much. Not every part however was as exciting as the battle at Helm's Deep, there were some down times when reading the book, but I have come to expect that when reading Tolkien.I love this book and I recommend it to anyone at all interested in The Lord of the Rings. It is worth taking the time to read which will fly by when reading such an exciting book. You will be transported into another world that is so interesting and fun. Go read The Lord of the Rings and step into the world that is Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This second volume of Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" begins with chaos. Boromir is found dead, pierced by O rc's arrows, and Merry and Pippin are gone. Frodo has tried to escape and journey to Mordor alone, but his faithful comrade Sam followed. The remains of the Fellowship, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli decide to let Frodo be. Their part of the task is over, now it is time for other battles. They try to save Merry and Pippin instead (who save themselves pretty well), and then they all travel to Isengard where the once so mighty and good wizard Saruman dwells...On the way they meet some new characters, for example the old Ents, and the riders of Rohan. At the same time Frodo and Sam struggles on to Mordor, a long and weary journey . However , they are getting some unexpected help.The Darkness is rising, and the only one who can save Middle-earth is the once so cheerfullittle hobbit who deeply regrets his thirst for adventure...The turns in this story are pretty interesting, the characters change as the great war draws nearer, and so does Middle-earth. It becomes darker, and not as cheerful as before. The Elves are going westwards as Sauron's forces draws nearer. This part of \\"The felllowship of the Ring\\" is a lot more mysterious and misty than \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". Frodo, who used to be happy ,and mild realises what he is about to do, and the heavy burden on his shoulders almost kills him. Only one thing keeps him going, -his task, to save Middle-earth which makes him a good deal more powerful in his way of talking and acting . Luckily he has got atrustworthy comrade on the road. Sam would never betray Frodo ; even though his master is not always nice to him.. Another one who has changed a great deal since \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" is Gandalf, who returns from what everybody thought was death. Saruman has in his desperate search for power allied with Sauron, and is no longer on the side of the good. This task is now Gandalf's, he has become Gandalf the White, the mightiest wizard in Middle-earth. When he meet s Merry and Pippin they are at first afraid of him. He is very powerful and not as cosy as before. Aragorn is also changing, from the Ranger to the King.I think that it is a pleasure throughout to read \\"The Two Towers\\". In one way, it is kind of strange since the only thing they do is walk, and maybe fight a little sometimes.There must be something in Tolkien's way of writing that makes \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" so extremely good. But what? I think it is because of the fact that nothing is predictable.Suddenly a new character runs out of the forest and the story turns violently ( for example the Ent Fangorn,or Faramir). We should not forget the Palant&iacute;r who is overcome in Isengard. The stone has been the window between Mordor and Saruman since his betrayal. Now at least that link is broken. The most fascinating thing though is the change of Middle-earth. At least I was left in the \\"Shire-mood\\" longer than I probably should have , thecheerful and bright fairytale . It was a bit of a shock when suddenly everything was dark and serious. Perils and battle are one thing, but the creeping darkness is another. No one is asinnocent and light of heart as before. That is the greatest difference between \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\". Tolkien also uses the language to create this mood. His way of writing is wonderful, after all he has come up with new languages, and new letters. It is fair, and often as wellthought over as in a poem. I have never read later fantasy with a more beautiful language.Even though the movie was extremely good, you can't compare it with the book. But promise me that whoever is reading this lousy bookreview will both watch the movie and read the books..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tolkien was a great book. The book was full of action, suspense, and a great thriller. Aragorn is my favorite character. He leads the battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn is very brave and heroic. Frodo is the ring-bearer. He is the one who must toss the ring into the fires of Mordor. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves action and suspense."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I am not a dedicated \\"fantasy literature\\" fan, but I've been a \\"Lord of the Rings\\" fan since I was in college (er...back in the late 1970s - OK, I've dated myself). Anyway, I still remember getting to the end of \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (a book assigned in a Reading Lit class), and being left hanging as the fellowship was broken. I finished that book one evening, and I couldn't wait to get to the bookstore the next day to pick up a copy of \\"The Two Towers\\"...which I then proceeded to devour.I've read this entire series several times since those heady college days, and the Lord of the Rings (trilogy) remains one of my favorite stories.What should you know about \\"The Two Towers\\" if you are thinking about picking up a copy?1) Make sure that you buy not only this book, but the other two books in the Lord of the Rings trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the RingsThe Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings)2) Each of the books in the trilogy do not stand alone. You need to not only read all three, but you need to read them in order. Tolkien wrote the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" as one cohesive story, but because of the length of the story it was published in three volumes. The first two books end abruptly, and the story picks right up in each of the following volumes...so you'll want to have all three handy when you start reading.3) The writing and imagery is crisp and vivid. The world Tolkien created and the people and other creatures that live there will draw you in.4) I prefer to read this book in a quiet, somewhat dimly lit room...it adds to the atmosphere.5) There is no foul language in these books. They are a pleasure to read.6) These books work well for readers of many ages - I actually read all of these books to my children when they were still in their elementary school years (years before the movies were produced). They remain favorites of some of my children and got them started on their own adventures in reading.This series is certainly in my top-10 list of books, and depending on the day, almost always falls out near the top of that list.This is not a book to be missed.5 stars, no doubt and no mistake!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the sequel to J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy classic,The Hobbit. The Two Towers is the second book (preceeded byThe Fellowship of the Ring: Being the First Part of The Lord of the Ringsand followed byThe Return of the King: Being the Third Part of The Lord of the Rings), but it is actually one epic tale.More adult oriented concepts are included than in The Hobbit, and there are refferences to the pre-history Tolkien was developing and published in various \\"Middle Earth\\" books, making this a more challenging read (I always have trouble getting through the first part of The Two Towers).This is an epic tale, with many story lines running concurrently. This has it all, Monsters, Wizards, Battles, Treason, Love, Self Sacrifice and much more!Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings needs no review by me. It is what it is, a timeless classic. This edition is a very high quality paperback, and a big enough format that the book is easy and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I recently reviewed Recorded Books Incorporated's unabridged rendition of Fellowship of the Ring. I return now to review the second installment of the trilogy, The Two Towers. The Two Towers pics up right where Fellowship left off. Frodo and Sam have left to find a way into Mordor, while Merri and Pippin have gone in search of them. Aragorn, drawn away from his search for Frodo by the urgent call of Boromir's horn, finds the man mortally wounded in a clearing, surrounded by the bodies of many Orcs. With his last breath, Boromir confesses his attempt to take the ring from Frodo and warns that Pippin and Merri have been captured by the Orcs. After a simple ceremony in which the body of Boromir is laid to rest in one of the three Elven-made boats in which they travelled and sent down the river to the falls of Rauros, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimley resolve to hunt down the Orcs and rescue the captive Hobbits.Thus begins the second installment of Lord of the Rings. As before Rob Englis delivers a top notch performance. He continues his trend of actually singing the songs in his good tenor rather than just reciting them as other narrators have done. He portrays each new character very well as far as I'm concerned, which makes for a great listen. From the opening lines to the end, this book should keep you under its spell, even if you've read it many times before."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is amazing.

Even at the price of $12 this book is WELL worth the money."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"With this book, the second installment in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" (a single extremely long novel, not a trilogy), things start to fall into place.The Fellowship of the Ringwas great, but it felt like it was basically build-up for bigger things to come. Well, by the time \\"The Two Towers\\" starts, the ball is rolling, and fast.I was weary about the decision to split the book into two halves, one half dealing with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin, and the other half dealing with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, because I thought it might have been a wiser decision to mix it up a bit; have one chapter deal with Aragorn and company, the next with Frodo and company, and so on. However, the way it is set up is probably for the better. Each half read very well, advancing this classic story in big ways.Again, as I mentioned in my review for \\"Fellowship,\\" Tolkien's work isn't for the impatient reader. His beefy sentences demand that you comb through them, soaking in the language and appreciating the intensely thought-out sub-creation of Tolkien's Middle-earth. Thing is, that kind of writing isn't for everyone. I've read pompous reviewers insulting those who don't appreciate Tolkien's style, but the \\"get on with the story, Tolkien\\" complaints are not without merit. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Two Towers\\" and consider the overall arc ofThe Lord of the Ringsto be a classic and timeless story, but the style of writing can, at times, grate against one's patience.So I'll end my review for this book by including something I said in my review for \\"Fellowship,\\" which very much applies here: \\"Pour a cup of tea. Heck, sit it on a tea cozy. Turn off your phone, and absorb the writing. Visualize the mountains, rivers, all of the scenery. Feel what is happening, don't just read it. True, there is a lot of back story that could have been taken out, but it wasn't. So deal, and read it--most of it, if not all, is interesting.\\"PS: The character arc of Gollum (and his dialogue!) alone is worth reading this book. We loves it, my precious!10/10 Classic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Two Towers', by JRR Tolkien, tells of the continued adventures of the Fellowship after its breaking.

This \\"trilogy\\" (originally meant to be published as one book) contains lush imagery, rich and detailed description, heart-pounding action and you can really immerse yourself in the world of Middle Earth.In The Two Towers, Frodo and Sam continue their solitary journey to Mordor, and are eventually overtaken by Gollum (Sm&eacute;agol). Gollum agrees to guide them to the Black Gate of Mordor, but their journey is fraught with danger (not the least of which is Gollum's dual-personality dilemma). Tolkien cleverly wrote his master epic in six books - two books for each volume which was eventually published. In The Two Towers, the books show the division between the Frodo/Sam storyline and the remainder of the Fellowship. Pippin and Merry become separated from the rest of the Fellowship and flee into an ancient forest full of strange and wondrous creatures. A fantastic journey filled with Orcs, Ents, a confrontation with Saruman and a reunion, not only with the remainder of the broken Fellowship, but with the reborn Gandalf, this chapter of the adventure is definitely a page-turner. Even if words on a page don't tend to excite you, this will keep you enthralled.

This book is really great, the battle at Helms Deep was a lot different than what they showed in the movie! You have got to read this book, but be prepared it's a long one!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"By the time one gets to The Two Towers, after traveling through The Fellowship of the Ring, one feels quite at home in Middle-earth. Unlike the first novel, where the action is fairly linear, this second installment of The Lord of the Rings is divided into two books. The first chronicles Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they try to rescue Merry and Pippin, meet the king of Rohan, and fight the battle of Helm's Deep. The second half jumps back in time to follow Frodo and Samwise as they try to make their way into Mordor.I enjoyed this book even more than Fellowship - possibly because there is more action in it. Also, the story feels more compressed, as it deals with a relatively short amount time (a month, perhaps?) whereas Fellowship told a leisurely story that occurred over several months. Once again, as I read, I was convinced that the point of these books is not to arrive at the end of the tale, but to simply enjoy the journey. Because Tolkien is so good at his job, and has created a fully-realized world with three-dimensional characters, it is easy to understand how so many readers have come to lose themselves in the books.At this point in time, I cannot not talk about the movies. If one comes to this book AFTER SEEING the films, one will realize that Peter Jackson played around with endings. The beginning of the book The Two Towers is actually the end of the movie The Fellowship of the Ring. Also, the adventures in this book take us far into the movie, The Return of the King. I was pleased to find this out because the Hobbits' encounter with Shelob is one of my favorite parts in the story."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book truly enchanted me right through the begining. At first I was confused with all the orthanc and all the orc and good guy names. Then, after reading the book a couple of times and watching the movie, I really got the hang of it.

If anybody tries to copy this book you will notice it right away because it is so unique."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"The Two Towers\\" is the second part of the classic \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, widely regarded by many as the greatest fantasy epic ever written. The novel is far more sweeping in scope than Peter Jackson's acclaimed film adaptation, especially when the latter comprises only one half of \\"The Two Towers\\" (\\"The Two Towers\\" has scenes which appear in the first and final installments of Jackson's film trilogy.). The title refers to the twin towers held by Middle-earth's dark lords; Orthanc, at Isengard, the home of the traitorous wizard Saruman and Bard-dur, the Dark Tower of Sauron in Mordor. This splendid novel continues the chronicles of Frodo Baggins, the Ring Bearer, and his companions and friends as they seek to destroy the accursed ring, and free Middle-earth once and for all from the threat posed by the Dark Lord Sauron.Book Five recounts the exploits of Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry and Pippin. It opens with Boromir's deathbed confession to Aragorn, admitting that he tried to seize The Ring from Frodo Baggins. Before he dies, Aragorn assures Boromir that he has regained his honor by fighting bravely in defense of Merry and Pippin, now captives of orcs - some from Isengard, and the others from Mordor - returning to Isengard with their prisoners. Soon Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli follow in pursuit of these orcs into the land of Rohan. Merry and Pippin escape and flee into the old forest of Fangorn, meeting Treebeard, the eldest of the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli venture into Fangorn too, and are reunited with Gandalf, newly risen from the dead, after his fierce struggle with the Balrog from Moria. Eventually their paths will cross in Rohan, at the capital city of Edoras, soon after a successful defense of the kingdom from Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep led by King Theoden, his nephew Eomer and Aragorn. And Merry and Pippin will see Saruman's power destroyed and his fortress of Isengard wrecked by vengeful Ents led by Treebeard.Book Six chronicles Frodo's and Sam's eastward trek towards Mordor. They meet Gollum, who is tamed - at least for a while - by Frodo, acting as their guide into Mordor. They also encounter Faramir, Captain of Gondor, Boromir's younger brother, who offers them friendship and advice regarding their journey. It is a journey that becomes more perilous due to Gollum's renewed treachery, as the trio head towards the dark pass of Cirith Ungol and the ancient evil lurking within."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I read Lord Of The Rings Part Two The Two Towers.

Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin were still in the clutches of the Orcs. Arogorn, Gimli, and Legolas were still on the trail of the Orcs. Merry and Pippin escaped one night, but they went into Fanghorn Forest by mistake. Arogorn, Gimli, and Legolas went into the forest and met Gandalf the White. The four rode off to see King Theadon. When Gandalf convinced him to fight, they fled for Helms Deep. Gandalf knew they were heading into a trap. When the war had started Legolas and Gimli competition to see who killed the most Orcs. After the war Arogorn, Gimli, Legolas, Gandalf and the King left for Isengaurd. When they got there, they met two unexpected hobbits.To like this trilogy you must like fighting and medieval times. I can&#65533;t say if I like the movie or the book more they both have their ups and downs."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Jacob A With, your a dumbass. You must have no imagination because thats all it takes to enjoy a Tolkien novel. JRR's world of fantacy world is brilliant. Anyone interested in the LOTR read a summary of one of the books and you'll want to read the whole thing. I recommend this book to anyone with an imagination."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is another amazing book in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Be sure you have read the Hobbit and the Fellowship of the Ring before reading this book. The only difference in this and the first is that the action heats up at the begining, right where the first left off. There are parts with Marry and Pippen and the tree people (the Ents) that can we boring, but you won't be able to put it down. The novel is filled with many battles, surprises, wit, and wisdom. If you liked the Fellowship of the Ring, you'll love the Two Towers."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of The Rings: Two Towers is far better than the first although the fist one was needed for ground work so that the second to make any sense at all. Part 2 is very well written with vivid battle scenes and intricate plot twists that were completely unexpected by me or anyone who i know who read it. The way the timeline of when the movie is set is congruent with the introduction of explosives and tactical warfare. The two towers in otherwords is a well written book that sticks to some kind of historical guidelines. I would encourage anyone who thinks they can read it and stick with the existing plot should try it."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger.\\" The second book in the trilogy of the lord of the rings. The book starts with the company broken into to three groups; one group is Arogorn, Legolas, and Gimli. The other group is the made up of the hobbits Sam and Frodo, Frodo is the leader of the fellowship. The final and most pitiful group is the group with Marry and Pippin the two other hobbits who have been stolen by orcs and are on there way to Isengard. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili are following marry and pippin day and night. Sam and Frodo are headed to Morodor but are lost in a endless fog of ridges and hills. On their way to catch Marry and Pippin the men of Rohan slottered all the orcs and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili are know looking for Marry and Pippins. They meet up with pippin and Marry in the most unlikely of places. Sam and Frodo come across some very unfortunate encounters.I would recommend this book to adventurous people. If you really love the Middle Ages this is a great book. The book goes along at a rather slow pace. If I could find one downfall of this book it would be too much description. But overall it is a great book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is a must getter!

In this action-filled book Tolkien is able to use the astounding characters that he developed in the first part of the trilogy. These characters go on a dangerous journey to save Middle-earth from a second darkness that will destroy the world. Two of these characters must go into Mordor the land of the dark lord to destroy the ring of power.The turmoil starts early in the book and keeps on coming with new twists and new unimaginable danger. Some of the new characters that come in to this book are quick to develop and quick to go into action. Tolkien creates this strongly weaved tale that will come to life before your very eyes.The Two Towers is a heart-stopping book and will keep you stuck to the pages and then make you come back for more of this epic tale. I have not yet found any thing in this book that I do not like. I recommend this book to everyone who has read or seen the Fellowship of the Ring.

Tolkien is an epic tale about two courageous hobbits. Their fate separates them from the rest of the Fellowship when attacked by a group of orcs. In the attack, Boromir is slain and the hobbits Pippin and Merry are taken captive. The other two hobbits, Frodo the ring bearer and Samwise his trusty servant, leave during the attack on a quest to destroy the evil Ring of Power in the feared land of Mordor. The remaining members of the fellowship Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli begin their chase of the orcs to save the captured Pippin and Merry. While Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli were hunting the orcs, Frodo and Sam find an unlikely guide who takes them to the gates of Mordor and beyond. Frodo and Sam meet untold perils on their trek to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legalos, and Gimli take part in an epic battle that leads to a turning point in the war against Sauron, and begins Pippin and Merry on their road to fame and glory.I recommend this book to people who like action, drama and fantsy. Before you read this book you should read two other books written by J.R.R. Tolkien. These are \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", the prologue and first book in the The Lord of the Rings trilogy, respectively. These books are all very good books and are definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"this series &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is absolutely fantastic. I have to admit, I was a &quot;late bloomer&quot; when it came to reading these books, but now that I am done, i wish i had done it a long time ago!&quot;The Two Towers&quot; might possibly be overlooked (being the one in the middle), if it wasn't for the story (i know what you're thinking--and you're right). &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is absolutely vital to the whole picture. While the really important stuff happens mostly in &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, the pieces in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; will help you understand all that has happened and all that will happen (or the things that have not yet come to pass--if you will--hahaha). Anyway, BUY THIS BOOK! But make sure that you read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; first, otherwise, you're not going to know what the heck is going on. And don't rely solely on the movie, there is sooooo much more in the book that they left out (for obvious reasons). AND don't read &quot;The Return of the King&quot; UNTIL you have read this one. Fair enough?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In this , the second volume of Tolkein's classic trilogy , the pace of the action really picks up! After a modestly slow start in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; , all of the major characters are in place and an action filled epic unfolds in a magical world best viewed in the marvelous images created by the author in one's own mind. Each reader has his own mental image of Frodo--of Gandalf--and of the despicable orcs.After the fall into the abyss of Gandalf the Grey with the Balrog in &quot;The Fellowship&quot;, we see a new and awesomely powerful Gandalf the White emerge (an almost Biblical resurrection , to make a comparison).In this volume Treebeard the Ent is introduced , and the episodes of Merry and Pippin with the Ents are marvelously entertaining. The little folk , the Hobbits , show an unforseen inner strength that is one of the things I enjoy most in this tale.The strength of will and devotion of Samwise Gamgee to Frodo is heartwarming. The segement &quot;In Shelob's Lair&quot; is one of the more genuinely scary parts of the book.I probably shouldn't reveal too much more about what transpires in the story and spoil it for a first-time reader ; of the three volumes in the trilogy this is probably the most action filled and fun reading one , and is therefore my favorite.If you haven't read it yet--what are you waiting for?!

Samwise and Frodo trek on to destroy the ring at Mt. Doom, and the rest, including Aragorn, Legolas and our beloved dwarf friend Gimli search for Merry and Pippin, who had been kidnapped by Orcs. Fierce battles, amazing dialogue and very memorable characters made &quot;The Two Towers&quot; a great read. I won't spoil the ending, but, I'll tell you this: After I completed &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, I immediately went out and purchased &quot;Return of the King&quot; to see how it would end.For any fan of fantasy or fan of great writing, this is the book for you.

I debated whether to go with this cassette version of LOTR or the newly-released BBC CD set with Sir Ian Holm. Thank goodness for Amazon reviews because after reading that the CD set was NOT truly unabridged (how could they leave out Tom Bombadil?!), it simplified my decision. Rob Inglis is outstanding reader and does a fine job selecting an appropriate voice for each of the characters. I personally find it much more pleasing than a host of voices (of course if Sir Ian had done the entire CD version, I'd be back to a difficult decision). The point for me when listening to a book is to hear the story and use my imagination; too many voices or sound effects can be distracting."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In my reviews of The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, both read by British Shakesperean actor Rob Inglis, I wrote that the sound quality on these audio books is crystal clear (neither too high, too low or distorted in any way), Inglis's characterizations are spot-on and the story itself (presented here in the only unabridged version available) is engrossing.The Two Towers continues the story begun in The Fellowship of the Ring but introduces new characters, more battle scenes and a nearly palpable feeling of impending doom as Sauron and Saruman search for the ring.Speaking of new characters, I don't think you'll ever find characters more fascinating than Ents. Ents are walking, talking trees found in Fanghorn Forest. Treebeard (a most &quot;unhasty&quot; Ent) is their leader. He's the oldest living thing in Middle Earth. As Inglis read these passages, I could almost picture the unhasty trees talking to Merry and Pippin. And I longed to look into their very old, wise eyes as they did.The bottom line: The Two Towers (part two of the Lord of the Rings &quot;trilogy&quot;) is equal to the previous books in every way.Which means there really isn't much more that needs to be written. This is, without doubt, the best audio books edition of The Lord of the Rings available.How do you know if The Two Towers read by Rob Inglis is right for you? Well, if you...1. Love Tolkien's stories.2. Have drive time on your hands.3. Enjoy hearing a British voice.4. Don't want to here a &quot;dramatized,&quot; multi-voiced version.5.

Have a cat you'd like to keep company during the day while you're at work (simply load up your CD changer, push &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Repeat All&quot; and let Rob Inglis serenade your feline)THEN...This unabridged audio books edition of Tokien's masterpiece read by Rob Inglis is exactly what you need."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkiens trilogy continues in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, the second book of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy. The first book, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; (read my review on it, too!) end with the breaking up of the Fellowship. The Company is faced with a choice, whether to continue on with Frodo the hobbit to Mount Doom to destroy the ring, or travel to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, to help fight the evil Sauron's forces. But in the end, Frodo secretly goes off alone with his faithful hobbit friend, Sam, to Mount Doom. The other members split up to try to find them.Here is where &quot;The Two Towers&quot; story begins. Boromir is killed while trying to protect hobbits Merry and Pippin from the evil orcs. The three other members of the Company, Aragorn the Ranger, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf, set out to rescue them. They realize that the orcs are not of the forces of Sauron, but someone else. Then a member of the Fellowship Gandalf the wizard, whom they thought was killed, tells them that the orcs are working under the wizard Saruman. Before Saruman had been good but had turned to evil and wants the powers of the Ring. Gandalf tells them that Merry and Pippin have escaped are in the capable hands of Treebeard and the Ents. Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to instead go to the lands of Rohan to help King Theoden in the upcoming war from the forces of Saruman. Here ends part one of the book. The second part tells about Frodo and Sam's quest to the land of Mordor with the unexpected help of... Gollum!J.R.R. Tolkien is certainly a genius, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy have such a depth to it! Middle-Earth is so believable with all the legends, history, geography, language, and races so thought out. Reading the books, I was captivated and couldn't put the books down. Probably one of the best books I've ever read, or will ever read.One of my favorite characters is Legolas the Elf. Elves are so fascinating to me. They're so mysterious, so a part of nature, and a good companion to have. It's so funny how though Elves and Dwarves don't get along too well, Legolas and Gimli are the best of companions and inseparable. Another favorite character is Pippin the hobbit. He's so cheerful, brave, and seems to always get into trouble!I can't honestly say which of the books if my favorite since they're all fantastic. My suggestion to you is that if you are planning to read the books, you should have the whole trilogy on hand, &quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, and &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Also I think it will be a good idea to read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, which is a prelude to the trilogy and it tells how Frodo's uncle, Bilbo Baggins, go a hold of the Ring. Most enjoyable I think for ages 12 and up since I think the books will be a little complicated for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book starts off exactly where, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; (see my review) ends.

Yet I didn't read &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; until a few months ago, in anticipation of the new film. Once again I fell in love with Tolkien's Middle-Earth and story-telling ability. I loved the dramatic twists at the end of &quot;The Fellowship;&quot; indeed, I thought I had never read anything quite like it at the time. But the story of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; blew me away.In the first half, Book III, Aragorn leads Gimli and Legolas in hot pursuit of Saruman's band of orcs, who have nabbed hobbits Merry and Pippin. These five members of the now-broken Fellowship find unexpected allies in the Riders of Rohan, and the Ents, ancient dwellers of the Fanghorn forest. The battle at Helm's Deep with the servants of Saruman was riveting.Book IV, which deals with Frodo and Sam's journey towards Mordor, seemed very slow-moving after the events of Books I-III. Still, there are incredible descriptions of the often-barren, mountainous landscape, the hobbits' dealings with Smeagol, and occasional settings of staggering beauty (the groves and thickets of Ithilien, the Window of the Sunset). The sense of impending doom builds as the hobbits draw closer to Mordor. Yet I realized that there was no other way Tolkien could have built up to the conclusion more deliberately or masterfully as I read, late last night and spellbound, the staggering events in the final two chapters of this book.I never thought it possible that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; could be better than &quot;The Fellowship,&quot; but there you have it. I loved Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents, and the tree-creatures' deliberate ways. As a student of geology, I couldn't get enough of the beautiful descriptions of mountains and landscapes. I loved how everything in Middle-Earth is steeped in history and lore - even magical objects like the Palantir, with an ambiguous, almost-forgotten history, take on a deeper dimension. Most of all, I loved the moments of the truest kind of friendship. Friendship grows between Gimli and Legolas, two (initially) unlikely companions. And Frodo and Sam, always drawing closer towards the heartland of the Dark Lord, realize that now, more than ever, they must rely on their companionship and loyalty to each other.I couldn't recommend anything more highly, and would also caution you to have &quot;The Return of the King&quot; close at hand!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"What happens when destiny breaks up the fellowship?You will find out when you read the Two Towers.In this second part, the deeds of all the members of the company after the Fellowship was broken, are told.Frodo and his inseperable Sam sneak away towards Mordor, while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas have to change their plans when they discover that Pippin and Merry have been kidnapped by orcs. These decisions that they make, take each character on its own path and the events that take place in this book really help in developing the complete tale.The whole story really takes shape in it. Loads of things start happening, and many different characters take center stage.

Boromir, eldest son of the Steward of Gondor, is killed by marauding Orcs intent on capturing Merry and Pippin. In a sense, his heroic death is an act of redemption on his part, after trying to seize the Ring from Frodo. Merry and Pippin are carried off by these Orcs, servants of the corrupt wizard Saruman. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas begin their trek towards Minas Tirith, the capital of Gondor, hoping to overtake Saruman's Orcs. And Frodo and Samwise proceed towards Mordor and Mount Doom.This second installment of &quot;The Lord Of The Rings&quot; is in two parts; the first deals with the exploits of Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas. The second recounts Frodo's and Samwise's perilous journey to Mordor. Without a doubt, this is the most character driven installment of the entire &quot;Lord Of The Rings&quot; saga. Without giving away the plot, the book is an insightful survey of the main characters and their motivations. Suffice it to say that their interactions amongst themselves as well as with important minor characters such as Fangorn, the chief of the Ents, play an important part in determining the outcome of the war of the Ring.Much of Tolkien's best writing can be found in this book. I found &quot;The Two Towers&quot; as engrossing as either &quot;Fellowship Of The Ring&quot; or &quot;The Return Of The King&quot;, the third book in the trilogy. Incidentally, &quot;The Two Towers&quot; refers to Saruman's tower, Orthanc, at Isengard, and the Dark Lord Sauron's tower in Mordor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"ROb Inglis does a great great job reading LOTR. HE manages a recongizable difference and identity for every character without overdoing it. This was my main concern with this edition, since some dramatizations (esp BBC's dramatization of The Hobbit) are a bit overdone, and this draws attention from the story.But this reading manages just right. I had read LOTR several times before, but I enjoyed this reading almost more than the original books.The only thing I missed was a list of the tracks. I listened to the book in a walkman that starts from the exact same point where it was left, but if you change players you will take some time to find the exact spot you left. But that is just a detail in a great product. Absolutely recommended"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book continues the events that took place in the Fellowship of the Ring, as now the Fellowship is broken up.

Aragorn, Legolas and Gimili explore the fields of Rohan, Merry and Pippin befriend a survivor of an ancient race, and Frodo and Sam go straight into Mordor, leaded by the creature, Gollum. This was a great book and keeps you interested all the time. It really is hard to put it down once you start reading it. Afte rteh Fellowship of the Ring, I strongly suggest picking this book up (whether it be from a library or a store) and read it! It will keep you wondering what will happen in the third edition of the series....."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Inevitably, after reading The Fellowship of the Ring, the natural reaction is to reach for The Two Towers. The second part of a classic trilogy, The Two Towers picks up exactly where The Fellowship of the Ring left off. With most of the main characters already established and the main focus of the journey identified, the truly exciting scenes begin to take place. The novel splits up into a pair of books that take the reader through two different adventures based on the now divided characters. The two books take place during the same time line, which I felt was a very interesting way to observe the storylines. Talking about all the amazing qualities of Two Towers might spoil your own experience, but if you are ready to read Two Towers, you are already have an idea of what type of brilliance lies ahead.The imagery laid forth by Tolkien is simply dazzling, he was a master of the written word and this book exemplifies as well as magnifies that fact.Full of excitement and adventure, this continuation of the quest to rid the world from the threat of evil takes the reader right through the heart of one of the most colorful, well known and amazing fantasy adventures of all-time. After being left breathless at the end of this one, the reader will take part in his or her own journey to get their hands on The Return of the King to finish out the trilogy.

The book cover showed obvious signs of wear, although the innards were fine. It was acceptable, but was questionable as a gift!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The second volume of Tolkien's epic trilogy never even wavers. If anything, it seems steadier and more controlled than \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" as several characters become more central and the plot focus widens to envelop all of Middle Earth. It suffers from a bit of sequelitis in places, but the overall book is just as enthralling as the first.Aragorn finds that Merry and Pippin have been abducted rather than killed -- for what reason, no one knows. Frodo and Sam have left on their own. So Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli race to find the orcs and retrieve the hobbits, but are stopped by the fierce Riders of Rohan, and then by an old and dear friend: Gandalf, who has been resurrected in the new form of a White wizard. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin must use all of their wits to escape the orcs, and then find a strange band of allies that no one could have hoped for.Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam head into Mordor -- with an eerily familiar figure, Gollum, following them. Frodo subjugates Gollum, forcing him to swear on \\"the precious\\" that he won't harm him. In return, Gollum promises to guide the two hobbits through Mordor, straight to Mount Doom. But the Ring is weighing more heavily than ever on Frodo, and is starting to reassert its old sway on Gollum...One of the most noticeable changes in this book is the shift of focus. \\"Fellowship\\" was Frodo-centric, since the narration revolved around him, as did all the events and thoughts. But with the breaking of the Fellowship, the narration falls into three categories: Frodo and Sam; Merry and Pippin; Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. This triple style allows individuals to shine more brightly, when they are called on to do more than hike with Frodo.Tolkien also presented a wider view of Middle-Earth in general. While the slow slog through Mordor doesn't really tell or show readers much -- aside from what a hellhole Sauron is the middle of -- it's shocking to see the the effects of the orcs, Saruman and Sauron on places such as Gondor and Rohan.Changes can be seen in Frodo even in this book, and which become more pronounced in the third book of the trilogy, \\"Return of the King.\\" He becomes sadder and more introspective, and the Ring's growing hold on him can be glimpsed at times. Aragorn is also changing. He is no longer merely the rugged outcast Ranger, but displays the hints of a future great king, if he can only get to his throne.Merry and Pippin also change: these two innocent young hobbits have to suddenly Sam is more promiment in this book, as Frodo's friend and personal pillar of strength.But where Tolkien really outdid himself is Gollum. Gollum returns, in a substantially different state. Oh, he's still addled and addicted to the Ring, but he displays a dual love/loathing for the Ring, a weird affection for Frodo (who, from his point of view, is probably the only person who has been kind to him), and displays a Ring-induced multiple-personality syndrome. Very rarely can bad guys elicit the sort of loathing and pity from the reader that Gollum does.One noticeable aspect of this book is friendship. When the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell, virtually everyone is a stranger, with the exception of the hobbits. However, in this book we get our view of how much Sam loves Frodo and wants to help him. Sam is fully aware of how much Frodo needs emotional support, and he's quite willing to be a pillar of strength for his friend. We see Gimli and Legolas's affection for Merry and Pippin; and Legolas's willingness to kill Eomer if Eomer hurts Gimli shows how far this Elf and Dwarf have come.This book is substantially darker than \\"Fellowship.\\" Frodo is starting to stumble under the weight of the Ring, and other characters die or are seriously hurt. The scene where Pippin's mind is trapped by Sauron is a very disturbing one, as is a violent and saddening scene late in the book. But there is also some wry humor: Gandalf's joke as he hears Saruman throttling Grima Wormtongue, Legolas's snippy comments about pipeweed as Gimli and the hobbits smoke up a storm, and Sam's debate with Gollum about whether they should cook the rabbits.Tolkien's second Lord of the Rings novel is a thrilling fantasy adventure, exploring more of his invented world than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" did. A truly enthralling experience."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"THE TWO TOWERS was more enjoyable than I remember THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING being. There's more action and intrigue, and the thickening of the plot was enough to want me to read THE RETURN OF THE KING as soon as I was finished. There's much good to say about this book, but its two flaws are more interesting.The first flaw is endemic to Tolkien. Its what I think of as the \\"eagles drop out of the sky\\" problem. Too often, Tolkien paints his characters into seemingly inescapable situations, only to be rescued by some new, external force. I was most annoyed by this by rescuing eagles in THE HOBBIT, but the problem re-occurs, albeit to a lesser extent, in THE TWO TOWERS. The problem here is that the characters rely on un-foreshadowed luck rather than their wits, or some element introduced earlier in the book (or series). This problem is especially acute near the end of the book, where a hobbit humbles a giant spider that apparently has been so formidable for years than even armies of orcs had been at its mercy.But the ending has other problems as well, not the least of which being the missed chance for Tolkien to fool the reader into thinking that Frodo, one of the main characters, is dead (until the next book). We think that for a few pages, but the book ends, serial-like, with Frodo's friend Sam realizing that he's alive. Not only do we miss the suspense generated by Gandalf's apparent death at the end of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, but the ending seems too unresolved, even for a middle book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Towers is a good book. Frodo and Sam travel closer to Mordor with Gollum as their guide. The rest of the fellowship gets the Ents (trees) to help destroy Isengard and Gandalf come back. I would recommend this book more to adults becaus they talk alot and some parts get boring. But some parts are good and make you keep reading. I recommend this book to 10 year olds and up."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I think it&#65533;s fair to say that this book is not as good as the first one in the series, nor is it as good as The Hobbit. But as the middle piece of the trilogy of Middle Earth, it serves a method for getting from point A (Fellowship of the Ring) to point B (Return of the King). And in that, it does a good enough job.When it comes down to it, here's the truth of the matter. This is the least enjoyable of the trilogy. But if you're going to read the first and last books, you can't skip the second book. It just doesn&#65533;t make sense. Too much of the story transpires in book 2, and since the trilogy is ultimately 1 huge book divided into 3 segments, there's no way to skip to book 3 without first stopping at this one.My main problem with this book is that there isn&#65533;t enough action nor dialogue. It might be better stated that there&#65533;s too much transition and not enough action. I believe Tolkien does his best work when he's writing about character interactions in any given scene. The Two Towers lacks in presenting the reader with enough of those situations to keep them interested.The story is generally good enough, though at times you do scratch your head. Some of the story lines seem to come to a point where Tolkien didn&#65533;t know what to do next. I think, all in all, that's how this book struggles the most.The struggle is one of trying to put a few good ideas in book of this length. There simply aren&#65533;t enough of those ideas to make it go as far as it needs to go. With that, it seems to me that Tolkien invents new scenes that enable him to add pages to his story. These scenes often times seem forced, as if he didn&#65533;t even buy into them.All in all, the book does a fair job as the middle child in this 3 step series. It doesn't bore you to the point of putting it down. Ultimately, the main story line is consistent with the main arrow of the narrative; a narrative which has good doing battle with evil in 2 different arenas.As a stand alone book, this one would never be a keeper. But as it is, this trilogy is not meant to be 3 individual books but 3 read in succession. So there's no need to look at it as a book on its own.This review serves to warn the reader that #2 is not going to be as exciting as any of the other 3 in this story (including the Hobbit). However, since the reader undoubtedly will buy and read the trilogy as one, few people will be reading any review here with an eye towards trying to decide to read this book or not.So proceed on with the trilogy, get ready for a bit of a slower ride than either of the previous 2 books, and chew off as much of this one as you can as you make your way to book #3."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"ummm... where is the american kindle version? fellowship and return of the king have kindle versions in the states... please make two towers as well... then i can give you money"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Why is this book not available on American Kindle yet? This book will definitely get 5 stars when I can read it again. I've read this series so often, I've had to replace my books. I've even watched the movie version ( which I rarely do as they never compete with the books. I got my Kindle for Christmas this year and wanted to place this series on it just to find I couldn't. what's the deal?"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"NOTE: This review contains major spoilers. So if you haven't read the book or haven't seen the film, then don't read what's below this sentence.-----------------------------------------It's fairly obvious that there are differences between the film and the book. And it's safe to say that there are some (but not all) improvements that were made for the film.First off, this second volume of Lord of the Rings contains two parts. The Fellowship of the Ring has separated: the first part deals with Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, the return of Gandalf, and the people of Rohan. It also contains Merry and Pippin finding themselves in Fangorn Forest, home of the ancient Ents. These two plots are connected with Isengard in both its rise and fall from grace. Then the second part deals with Frodo, Sam, and the creature Gollum as they journey to the land of Mordor, where Mount Doom and Barad-Dur stand with the shadows. Before I read Two Towers, I knew that this book separated Frodo and Sam's adventures away from the Rohan/Isengard storyline. And having watched the (Extended) film many times, I went ahead and read the book as if I watched the film. For example, I read the chapter \\"The Black Gate is Closed\\" as soon as I finished reading \\"Treebeard\\" and \\"The White Rider\\". It may not be what Tolkien intended, but I enjoyed it this way. I still don't understand why Tolkien didn't have all three main adventures integrated in with each other, instead of segregating Frodo/Sam's adventures away from the journeys of Pippin/Merry & Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas/Rohan. Maybe in the 50's, that way of storytelling never occured to anybody. Oh well.Anyway, \\"The Two Towers\\" is far more exciting than \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\". For one thing, you have The people of Rohan. Their bonding with horses fascinates me: they're vikings, but with mammals instead of ships. Then, you have the Dead Marshes, which is probably THE scariest setting in the fantasy genre. You also have the dark and gloomy lair of Shelob: the sequence is so intense that the goosebumps are a must. Now in the film, I found Gollum to be a bit too exaggerated and very annoying at times. But in the book, his schizophrenic personality really works. And finally, it's nice to see a completely different Faramir in the book, though the film version is much better: Denethor wanting the Ring makes for a big motive when you really want to impress your father.But of course, this book does have its disadvantages. Having Boromir die in the very first chapter seems a bit too improper. The son of Denethor dies and it all turns exciting, but then in the next chapter, all Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli do are run across the river Entwash and in the fields of Rohan. That slows the whole book down, unfortunately. SEcondly, the return of Gandalf wasn't really at all shocking: when you bring back a character that's presumed dead, that's more like a typical Hollywood moment. Maybe it's just me and that I've seen way too much mature films and TV shows.Then, we have Eowyn. To tell you the truth, I have to thank P. Jackson, F. Walsh, and P. Boyens for making her more of a central supporting character in the film. In the book, she's almost pushed aside (though, in \\"Return of the King,\\" she gets her chance with what she has to say and do). It's arguable whether Tolkien was a sexist (or even a racist), because there are hardly any female characters about. The Fellowship is consisted of only males. I know that LOTR is a trilogy for males, but the author could've at least make one of the four hobbits female, or maybe Legolas. Luckily, Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series gets a point for giving females a chance at breaking the female cliche found in fantasy.Theodin as the good and noble king is also a tired old cliche. The character's way too nice; again, the film version improves on this very greatly. Here, he's much praised by his people and he makes all the right decisions and yadda yadda yadda. Makes me want to read George R.R. Martin's \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series immediately after finishing LOTR.With all the things that got me down while reading \\"Towers\\", I still enjoyed the book nonetheless. There are plenty of action, humor, drama, thrills, chills, and huge spiders. Memorable characters and interesting races make it all the more compelling.And I have to give credit to Tolkien and his LOTR trilogy, because without LOTR, there wouldn't have been The Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Farseer Trilogy, etc.Grade: B"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Brilliant. Awe-inspiring. Masterfully written.J.R.R. Tolkien creates another world--indeed, another culture and language--in what many consider the greatest novel of the 20th Century, \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" A sweeping, all-encompassing tale of a make-believe world, LOTR is the product of an imagination that may never be equalled again.THE TWO TOWERS, the second part of Tolkien's LOTR trilogy, takes the reader on a remarkable, almost breathless journey: chasing orcs who have captured Merry and Pippen; galloping across the plains of Rohan with Riders of the Rohirrim; the bloody battle of Helm's Deep; the vast wasteland of Isengard; the perilous journey of Frodo and Sam to the borders of Mordor, accompanied by a most unlikely ally. Unlike \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" Tolkien's first installment, which at times was compelled to slow to a snail's pace to patiently set up the story, THE TWO TOWERS moves the reader along at a rapid clip, from the first page to the last.Here we are also introduced to a rich variety of new characters: Eomer, King Theoden, the evil Wormtongue, Treebeard the Ent, Faramir of Gondor, and a nasty assortment of snarling orcs. Tolkien's mastery of the written word brings these characters, and the places of Middle-earth they inhabit--to colorful life. The rich imagery he creates is unsurpassed; THE TWO TOWERS is storytelling unsurpassed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The fact that US customers can buy Kindle versions of Fellowship, Return Of The King, The Hobbit and even The Silmarillion but NOT The Two Towers is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!! What possible reason could there be for excluding just the middle volume of a trilogy???"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is excellent! If you haven't read The Hobbit, you'll understand the first one a little better. Only one problem, but it has nothing to do with the way the book is written. Now, most people who read this book says that Shelob the spider is right from Harry Potter. EXCUSE ME, BUT THIS BOOK HAPPENED TO BE WRITTEN PRACTICALLY 50 YEARS BEFORE THE HARRY POTTER SERIES(around 1955). WHAT I THINK IS HARRY POTTER'S SPIDERS ARE FROM LOTR. TOLKIEN IS MY FAVORITE AUTHOR AND I'M SURE HE'D BE INSULTED THAT SOME PEOPLE ACCUSE HIM OF COPYING A MUNDANE BOOK CALLED HARRY POTTER, WHERE KIDS LEARN MAGIC TRICKS THAT HAVE PEOPLE \\"FLINCH\\" AT A SINGLE, PATHETIC NAME, \\"VOLDEMORT\\", AND ALSO THE LOTR MOVIES ARE BETTER THAN HARRY POTTER, WHERE EVERYTHING IS MADE OF COTTON,AND PLASTIC."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"People have a love affair with Tolkien. People I admire and respect, not just bozos either, people who know good books and good writing and who say Tolkien works are the be-all and end-all of fantasy. Open your eyes.That might have been true when his works were first published. Tolkien deserves all the credit for putting fantasy on the map, for legitimizing the epic quest subgenre. But today, his books fall short when compared to contemporary works in the field.I think the reason for all the love is that people read The Lord of the Rings when they were young, and therefore look back at Tolkien with longing and nostalgia of better days. I read The Fellowship of the Ring when I was twenty-three, and The Two Towers when I was twenty-five, after having received a BA in English and beginning an MFA in Creative Writing. I can't, in good concious, say that any of his works match up with the powerful stories of George R. R. Marting and Terry Goodkind.Let's look at this book specifically. The one thing I liked were the Ents. Aside from that, the structure of the book is all whacked. The first half is spent entirely with Aragorn and his crew. Frodo doesn't even make it on stage until close to the last third of the book. Is this considered good, when your main character is not even present for the majority of the book? The effect of Tolkiens structure is disorienting. Once getting to a certain point in time with one group of characters, he moves to the next group and recounts what happened to them through the same period of time. Why not intersperse their chapters and weave the events together?Once we finally do get to Frodo, the same problem persists as did in Fellowship: Frodo can't really do anything. He takes one significant action, and that's to spare Gollum and bring the little runt with him and Sam. Sam does more than Frodo, saving him from a huge spider-demon. That was a great scene, by the way, but scenes like that are few and far between in this and the previous book.To sum up, after reading Fellowship, I swore off all Tolkien's books, but the movie got me excited again. I thought, well, maybe I was wrong, let's give it another shot. I did, and struggle mightily to finish this book. The only thing that will get me to read the final book is if the second movie rocks. Now, I know many of you will consider this review blasphemy, so go ahead and bash me. But before you do, pick up the book again, and read it with open eyes."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This story is about an epic adventure of the fellowship and the battle for Middle Earth.

It is called the Two Towers because each evil sorcerer has a tower, Saruman has Orthanc and Sauron has Barad Dur. I think when you read this book you should be about ten to fifteen years old because it gets really complicated at parts. This thrilling, action-packed fantasy takes place long ago and starts with Boromir, a man of Gondor, getting shot with arrows by orcs (creatures who are like evil men) who capture Merry and Pippen, two little hobbits. Two other brave hobbits, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, who have the Ring, are journeying to Mordor, the one place the Ring may be destroyed, because that is where it was created, in the fires of Mount Doom. Mordor is the land where the wicked lord Sauron lives. The Ring is a power that is beyond any others. It can drive a man mad and, if in Sauron's hands, it could end the world. In it is his hatred and power. A curious creature named Smeagol or Gollum later joins them and acts as a guide to Mordor. Meanwhile the rest of the company, Aragorn, the son of Arathorn a ranger and leader, Gimli, son of Gloin the dwarf, Legolas, a greenleaf elf and Gandalf the Grey, a wizard are battling Saruman the White and his grand orc army the Uruk-hai. Other creatures help like ents and huorns. This is a book where characters learn bravery and loyalty. Will Middle Earth survive? J.R.R. Tolkien is a fantastic author who loves action. You will learn much about warfare and hope because many times there are huge battles and there are some very despairing times. I thought it was good because it is a fantastic plot and has a whole world of its own. This is by the author of The Hobbit, The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Fellowship of the Ring has broken up. Although they banded together to protect Frodo and the One Ring to Rule Them All in the first book of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, at the end they were going three different directions. Frodo and Sam snuck off to Mordor so the others could not follow them. Merry and Pippin were taken by the Orcs. The remaining human, elf, and dwarf know they cannot follow Frodo. Instead they attempt to rescue the kidnapped hobbits.They get involved with more Men, warriors, and the Riders of Rohan. They have to abandon their quest and go with the Riders. Mordor is growing stronger. The Orc armies are attacking further into Middle Earth and all are in danger. Merry and Pippin find themselves in strange company. The Orcs want them alive. They want to escape. Pippin is able to use his wits to prepare for that chance. He also is able to leave a message for the others in their group that he and Merry are alive. One battle kills off almost all the Orcs with them. He and Merry escape and meet the Ents. Treebeard is probably the oldest, and oddest, being in Middle Earth. Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli find unexpected help from an old friend. They then band together with the armies of Men to fight the beings from Mordor. The war will not be easy, but must be fought. Frodo and Sam discover it is no easier getting into Mordor than it is getting out. The dark land is well guarded. They gain an unexpected companion and guide, Gollum. Gollum wants the ring. Frodo has it. He promises not to hurt Frodo; he doesn't give up his dream of owning the ring. Sam doesn't trust Gollum. Gollum hates Sam. The trio have an uneasy truce as Gollum leads them through hidden paths into the Dark Lord's lands.This middle book of the trilogy is filled with lengthy battles and wars. The Ents help make this book lighter, but this is the darkest third of the trilogy. It is difficult whether to feel sorry for Gollum or to despise him for what he has become. Everything that happens in this book is needed to bridge the beginning and the end in The Return of the King. Although only my second favorite of the three books so far, the description of Middle Earth, the characters, and the battles are outstanding."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I hadn't read this book since the eighth grade and wanted to re-visit it before seeing the movie. I should say that I am not a Lord of the Rings afficianado, nor do I want to be. The book moves a bit faster than Fellowship and doesn't have quite as many long poems to disrupt its flow. It is interesting to read this book from a geopolitical perspective to see how the themes that Tolkien touches on get played out in todays world, probably one reason for the book's lasting appeal. Once you get used to Tolkien's somewhat annoying style of writing and into the tale, the story really moves along."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers by J.R.R.

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves action and suspense."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien's The Two Towers continues the delightful adventures of the now-divided Fellowship. The story moves at a faster clip than the first book with action bouncing through the story of Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn and a terrific sense of suspense crawling and creeping through the story of Frodo and Sam. The emotional resonances among the characters are also much deeper in this volume, particularly in such aspects as the relationship between Sam and Frodo. The two main reasons, though, for this readers' joy are the Ents and Gollum. The ents are the most dazzling creation by the author of Middle Earth and Treebeard should live as one of the most memorable fantasy figures of all time.

Since I read it long after seeing the movies I was not prepared for what I read, there are so many small parts that either were left out or changed slightly that its like reading a story you don't know entirely. I have to say that I love the movies and if not for them I would never have wanted to read the books.

Mr. Inglis has the perfect voice for these readings (referring to the whole series). Highly recommend to other fans."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" continues \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" history in two books after the breaking of the Fellowship of the Ring as the first part follows Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Merry and Pippin the Hobbits seeing as the second half addresses the eventful journey of Frodo and Samwise the Hobbits towards the land of Mordor. The author expertly introduces more fascinating creatures, timeless scenarios, and awesome battles in a dark and ominous fantasy.Continuing the creative progression, amazing entities such as an Ent or objects like the palantir provide further depth to a phenomenal epic. Insight into the menacing Enemy forces arrayed against the good people of Middle-earth is realized with the many layers of deception and intrigue while maintaining a sensible yet young reading level. Shocking reunions and unforgettable events deliver quality entertainment with subtle environmental messages.Unlike most novels, \\"The Two Towers\\" divides the separate group plotlines from the original Fellowship instead of intermixing them down a chronological perspective. The method might be confusing but minor references and a moderately short time span helps organize the proceedings.The collection I own has \\"The Hobbit\\" along with all books of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series. As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In The Two Towers by J.R.R. Tokien, the eight remaining members of the fellowship continue on their quest to destroy the One Ring, the cause of much sadness in Middle Earth for many centuries.The first half of the book is about Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, Pippin, and Gandalf as they pass through Rohan, Isenguard, and Fangorn and meet Th&eacute;oden, Wormtongue, Saruman, Treebeard, and many other characters. They fight battles, talk to trees, and it is very exciting. The second half of the book is about Sam and Frodo as they make their way through mountains led by Gollum (Sm&eacute;agol). It is vey different from the first half, but is still very good.This is one of the best books I have ever read; five out of five stars. The plot was exciting and unpredictable, the characters were well developed and greatly detailed. The chaptyers were broken at the best cliffhanger spots, so I found I could never put the book down.If you are under ten, I suggest that you wait a few years before reading this book, there is some difficult language and some of the ideas are very complex. If you arer not under ten, then you should read this book now, just make sure you read The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rong first, and make sure you have plenty of time to read because you won't be able to put the book down once you start reading!--By Audrey;[...]"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\\"The Two Towers\\" continues the epic saga of Frodo and his companions on their journey to rid Middle Earth of the evil One Ring and defeat the evil Sauron and his nefarious followers. This novel contains more action and is faster-paced than \\"Fellowship of the Rings.\\" As the reader has been already acquainted with much of the lore and mythology of Middle Earth, Tolkien seeks a quicker pace in their adventure tale.Tolkien continues to paint a mythological world of wonder and enchantment. The battle scenes are particularly vivid, as the Rohan riders and the fellowship attempt to stave off an assault by Orcs. Through brilliant detail, Tolkien delivers a graphic and realistic picture of a heroic battle. Indeed, Tolkien's skill for painting masterful pictures in the reader's mind continues. Although Tolkien is not flowery in his language, he nonetheless presents the sweeping battle scenes and panoramic vistas in a straightforward, yet illustrious manner.Throughout this novel, the importance of fellowship and friendship become more evident. Sam and Frodo elicit a friendship bond that may be stronger than brotherhood. Although they were certainly close at the start of their epic, their bond has grown stronger. Their loyalty to each other cannot be broken - not by Gollum, the Orcs, or any other evil creature or power. Legolas and Grimli also put aside historic animosity between elves and dwarves and become battle-tested companions. Although they may not be as close as Sam and Frodo, they display the same loyalty and camaraderie that are essential to the strength of the fellowship, and the foundation of victory for the forces of good.Saruman remains a stark reminder of the ability of absolute power to corrupt. Although he was once the highest and most trust-worthy of wizards, he has evolved into a calculating, power-hungry fiend. It is the power and lure of the One Ring that has corrupted him and turned a once powerful ally into a hideous enemy.The character of Sam continues to develop from a comic sidekick to a true hero. By the end of the novel, Sam has become a noble hero and combatant. Although he is still a pudgy hobbit, he shows valor in the face of adversary. Although he briefly abandons Frodo when he thinks all hope is lost, he quickly understands that his role may not be as the ultimate hero, but as Frodo's loyal companion, come what may. Indeed, Tolkien reminds us that one need not might and strength to become a hero, for the potential to be a hero resides in all of us, no matter how small and insignificant we may deem ourselves.The narrative leaves us hanging, as the \\"Return of the King\\" will bring us the conclusion of their quest. Yet, even though their quest may end, Tolkien will no doubt leave open many mysteries and legends of Middle Earth."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Consider, if you will, an imposing book so flawed that it is filled with uber-heroes, beatific heroines, irredeemable villains, archaic diction, puffed up prose, overwrought melodrama, entire races consigned to evil, and motivations that are told rather than shown. I am thinking, of course, of... \\"War and Peace\\", or perhaps it is \\"Les Miserables\\". Then again, it may be \\"The Odyssey\\", or \\"The Merchant of Venice\\". Come to think of it, this is a pretty accurate description of the Bible.As its detractors so tediously note, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" has flaws. However, these critics get so absorbed in picking their nits they fail to notice that, like its fellow classics, this work's pre-eminence renders its flaws inconsequential. If one is intent on fault-finding, faults one will find. But one is thereby blinded to the greater glory.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is indeed one of the most glorious of literary classics. It attains a majestic tone matched only by a handful of its peers: \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" perhaps, or \\"Paradise Lost\\", where the dimension is epic, and the settings, characters and themes pass into the collective consciousness as archetypes. Such archetypes are not formed by chance; they occur only when a creation taps into universal truths and the most essential elements of human nature.Middle Earth, the One Ring, Hobbits and Wraiths, the quest not imposed but willingly undertaken, strength not of body but of will, courage not of battle but of endurance, the smallest in stature carrying the heaviest of burdens and doing the greatest of deeds: these images and themes have passed into the common culture. How we respond to these archetypes depends on the person we are.\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" offends by turns: effete intellectuals because it is unashamedly mainstream, the attention challenged because it is lengthy, and jaded cynics because it wears its heart on its sleeve. If you hold membership in any of these clubs, then this book is not for you. Like the best classical literature, this work demands qualities in the reader that are sadly now out of fashion: things like tolerance for detail, a sense of history, a linguistic ear, a love of epic grandeur and an appreciation for literary convention. Most of all, it requires an innocence and an exuberance that runs counter to the existential nihilism of the day. There are no angst-ridden antiheroes in Tolkien, no moral malaise, no self-absorbed ghouls paralysed by the futility of existence. If you must have these things, then look to Michael Moorcock and his Elric sagas. What you find in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is Tolkien's rejection of such thinking.Ultimately, Tolkien's creation is for the life affirming. It comes from a perspective where life has meaning--where even suffering and death have meaning--and the act of living is not an end in itself but is dedicated to a higher purpose. For those willing to embrace such virtues, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" makes a sublime connection to our hearts through its grace, its compassion and its incomparable genius."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This story begins with a young hobbit named Frodo whose uncle found a ring that turned the person wearing it invisible. Then Bilbo (Frodo's uncle) had to leave the Shire. So Frodo took the ring. Then, Frodo went to Rivendell were he met Legolas and Gimli who helped on the quest to destroy the ring in the fires of Mt. Doom, which was in Mordor. On the quest Frodo got separated from all of his companions except Sam.I liked this book because it has a lot of action in it. I also think that J.R.R. Tolkien has a great sense of mystery and action. My favorite character is Legolas because the way the author writes about him is awesome."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The book, Lord of the Rings the Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien is great! The fellowship is separated into three parts. Gimli, Aragorn, and Legalos, Frodo and Sam, and Merry and Pippin. Gimli, Aragorn and Legalos are trying to find Merry and Pippin. Merry and Pippin are in for a big surprise! Frodo and Sam are trying to get into Mordor, they're getting led by a mysterious creature! Will the fellowship ever get back together? Read this book to find out! I would definitely recommend this book to a friend!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. The book starts off in a forest where Orcs--evil creatures who act under the direction of Saruman--have been sent to find the Fellowship (which consists of hobbits--Frodo, Pippin, Merry, and Sam; two men--Aragorn and Boromir; an elf--Legolas; and a dwarf--Gimli), kidnap the hobbits, and bring them to Saruman--alive.The main character, Frodo, is the bearer of the One Ring, created by Sauron, which holds an immense amount of power and evil. This is why the Orcs must capture the hobbits. The book had very good imagery included, giving us vibrant descriptions of the characters and scenes.During the battle between the Orcs and the Fellowship, Boromir is shot with arrows while trying to save Merry and Pippin--who get kidnapped by the Orcs--and dies when Aragorn finally makes it to him. This really teaches a moral to the Fellowship, because Boromir had tried to take the ring from Frodo not much earlier.Luckily, Frodo escapes from the Orcs and ends up heading towards Mordor (which is the one place that the ring can be destroyed) alone. That is, until his &quot;loyal servant&quot; Sam catches up and comes along. This splits up the plot, of whole flow of the story, into three different parts--Frodo and Sam trying to make it to Mordor, Merry and Pippin's attempts to escape from the Orcs, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli's attempts to track down and find the Orcs to hopefully save Merry and Pippin.Eventually, Frodo and Sam encounter the creature Gollum--or Sm&eacute;agol--who helps lead them to Mordor. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin escape the Orcs, heading off into the Fangorn Forest, where they meet Treebeard and the other Ents (tree-like, living, talking, walking creatures).I like this book because the way J.R.R. Tolkien writes is very creative, as are his ideas. In it a whole new world is created, where there is a seemingly endless war going on. I loved the fantasy elements and the new creatures and places. The whole concept just adds to the great sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I finished this one right around the end of October 2002. I found this installment to be a much easier read than the first, with fewer expository sections. The action was fast-paced and relentless. The detail was outstanding, though I was expecting no less after reading the first part. There was a surprising amount of character development nestled within the combat and plotting. I found myself laughing out loud more than once at the burgeoning friendship between Legolas and Gimli. I also found Tolkien's characterization of Gollum masterful. I felt sympathy for him even in my suspicion. The book was truly epic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I had read the Lord of the Rings trilogy several times before in the past but this year with the realease of the film trilogy by New Line Cinema I decided to read them once more.The Two Towers is the second book in the trilogy. It begins right where the first one left off with Frodo and Sam just beginning to venture into the dark land of Mordor. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are heading off in search of the captured friends Merry and Pippin.The main conflict in this book is an large advancing army of Uruk-hai, large disgusting beasts bread for the single purpose of destroying life. This army was created by the evil wizard Saruman who is now in alliance with the Dark Lord Sauron, thus the books name, after each of these characters places of residence.The book ends with the army defeated and the country of Rohan saved but with much work still to be done. Sauron's power is still great and Frodo has not yet destroyed the ring.The story continues in the third book, The Return of the King. I reccomend this trilogy to all readers, fantasy lover or not. This series is one of the greatest literary works ever published. The depth and detail with witch Tolkien writes is amazing."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkien continues the first part of an adventure The Fellowship of the Ring with this great sequel The Two Towers. This book took the first part and made it look dull compared to all the adventure and action in this one. I loved this book because it makes a whole new world of imagination and has description that it makes it seem like your actually apart of the journey. I also liked it because of the adventure and action sequences that take place in this book. But even though this book has action and adventure there is also the emotion that may even make you emotional. I don't really relate to my book except for when it comes to the characters, because I do relate to the characters.

JRR Tolkien is a genius. Who ever likes good fantasy story telling, most read the works of Tolkien. Most of all The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit. Ones you start reading this books you never want to stop. If you found Harry Potter wonderful, JRR Tolkiens work will blow you away."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you haven't read &quot;the Fellowship of the Rings&quot;, but saw the movie,you will still be sufficiently primed for the next chapter in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Interestingly the book is divided into two complete sections: one devoted to Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf, and the second to Frodo and Sam.This &quot;chapter&quot; of the trilogy for me contained much more heart pounding action as the stories wind up to their climaxes in the last book.Being a big fan of the Robert Jordan &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series, I became very aware of the many similarities between the two, and where Jordan most likely got a lot of his inspiration.Reading this you can see why it's considered one of the great classic pieces of literature, while still being as vibrant and exciting as any modern work on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this book was enjoyable to read because of the setting and it being a fantasy. Another reason why I enjoyed it because of the battle parts, I thought that those were so discriptive. I chose a quote from the battle seen at the Rock. \\"Yet there are many that cry in the Dunland tongue,\\"said Gamling. \\"I know that tongue. It is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in many western valleys of the Mark. Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for our doom seems certain to them. 'The king, the king!' They cry. 'We will take their king. Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers of the North!'\\"To me the theme of the book is the battle of good and evil and not letting evil over take you. And also not to let evil possesions control your life and what you were meant to be in life. It relates to my life and probably everyone's life because the battle of good and evil will always be there forever.I would recommend this book to the people that have read this trilogy because if you didn't it would be very confusing. Especially if you didn't read that Hobbit, the first book, because you wouldn't know the characters in the story and you wouldn't know the struggles with the Ring and how it came about. Also if you have seen the movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, then read the book also because the movie left out some of the parts."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"'The Two Towers,' in my opinion, proves itself to be superior to its predecessor, 'Fellowship Of The Ring.' One reason that I feel 'The Two Towers' is able to accomplish this is the story's overall pace. At one point in 'Fellowship of the Ring,' seventeen years went by where almost nothing took place. In 'The Two Towers,' there is very little room for our main characters to sit and rest. There is far more action in 'TTT' than that of 'FOTR,' and it is because of this that the second of the three books in the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy is all the more enjoyable. Even the ending (which I refuse to spoil for those who've not read it) is far superior. This one leaves you thinking, \\"No! They can't end it like that!!\\" Fortunately, it doesn't end here, and next on my reading list is the final chapter of the \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" trilogy, 'Return Of The King.' After completing 'The Two Towers,' I can begin to see where George Lucas got many of his ideas for 'The Empire Strikes Back,' just as I could see how J. Michael Straczynski had gotten many ideas from 'Fellowship Of The Ring' (as well as the other two 'LOTR' novels) for his TV show 'Babylon 5.'"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I dislike the second part of the two towers although I did enjoy the first section because it moved much faster then the 2nd section. And the characters seemed to take forever to move from one spot to the next. However the characters themselves were devloped well and had distinct personalities.My favorite part of the book was the ending. Where Sam and Frodo were attacked by the spider like creature Shelob. This happend after thay had walked through caves for days and were betrayed by what they thought was there loyal and faithfull guide. Then beliving his master was dead Sam left him ther and went on only to find out later that his master, Frodo was only stunned.The charaecters were very vivd to me because of there ability to use what they had in the wild.

In it, the fellowship of nine that was once created in Elrond has broken up so that only the two hobbits from the Shire in Middle Earth, Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee, remain on the journey to Mordor.Meanwhile, a wizard and former friend of Gandalf's, Sauron the White, has built a large army in Mordor that includes orcs, humans, and a creature that is a mix of both, and is growing stronger by the hour. He needs only one thing for his plans to rule the world to succeed.It is Frodo's mission to destroy this thing, which he happens to have in his possesion; the Ring that rules all of the other Rings of power. This ring has a power so great that if one wears it they become invisible. However, the only way it can be destroyed is to return it to where it was made, the Cracks of Doom in Mordor.On their journey, the hobbits encounter many foul-and welcome-surprises. It is for the reader to find out what these events are.A high point in The Two Towers is when Pippin and Merry enter the Forbidden Forest and come across the long-forgotten Ents. It is exciting because it keeps you wondering how dangerous these creatures are. The low points, thought, are when the author writes about parts of the journey that can be a bit boring.

The first book, The Fellowship of the Ring, told of the forming of the Company of the Ring, nine companions, who embarked on a perilous quest to the land of the Dark Lord, the land of Mordor. In the Company Frodo the Hobbit was the bearer of the accursed Ring of Power, which Sauron forged in secret eons ago, and which must be destroyed in the fires of the Cracks of Doom, the one place where the Ring can be destroyed, in order to save Middle-earth from annihilation.The Two Towers begins exactly where the first book left off.

I would recommend this book to any good reader, for his dream of a great book might come true."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers picks up the action right where it left off in Fellowship of the Ring. This installment is has a darker and more desperate tone than Fellowship. With the Fellowship sundered, there is a sense of fear and urgancy among its members. Sam and Frodo continue their journey to Mordor with the Ring. Along the way they make an unusual alliance they hope will speed their trip. At the same time, Aragorn must concern himself with treachery of Saruman while coming to grips with his own destiny.There are more &quot;action&quot; sequences in this book than in Fellowship and that may appeal to those who found the first novel dull. More interesting to me, though was how the notion of fate pervades the book. Aragorn, Frodo, Sam, and Theoden all must put a bit of faith in destiny and undertake tasks that they fear might destroy them. The notion of personal sacrifice helps put in perspective the danger that faces Middle-earth. How dreadful must Sauron be if so many are willing to lay down their lives to stop him."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkien's writing is full of life. I have always felt as though I was watching the exiting events rather then reading them. In the continuing saga of The Fellowship of the Ring, the bond of the &quot;Nine&quot; characters proves their loyalty and unselfishness to the Ring and it's bearer. Though they are torn apart, the &quot;Nine&quot; do not break their friendship. All still play a great part in the threatening mission of the destroying the Ring. I can feel the heavy oppression all around them as they must face nightmarish reality and go where Elves fear to tread. Each characters' action determines whether all is lost or won. My only regret is that I can't read as fast as I've got to know what will happen next. Tolkien's Middle Earth is so full of unexpected creatures, humor and sorrow. He makes me want to know the intriguing stories of the Elves better, and hate the evil Orcs and Goblins with a vengeance. All the songs and poetry he writes in his books seem as though he were only translating them from the real Middle Earth itself. He puts such feeling into all the corners of his writing that it makes it seem as believable as our own history. If you have already read the Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers will take you to places you've never been, into doom or glory. Will the bond of the Fellowship save Middle Earth from destruction? Find out! Read this book of mystery, magic, love and sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Tolkein was the original fantasy author, The Lord of the Rings his masterwork. This is the best book of the trilogy, my own copy has been reread enough that the confrontation with Sauruman is taped in, the last bit of index is missing, and the cover is well repaired. This is darker than the first, and more action packed. As the Fellowship devides, but still travels eastward along roughly the same route, we see more of Middle Earth, meet new characters, and see more action. This in an absolutely indespensible item for anyone who claims to be well read in fantasy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book is a great fantasy adventure full of action and suspense.In fact, I hardly ever read but with this book I read straight through! It took me through the make believe world known as Middle Earth, going into vivid details and descriptions of each area that the characters must go. From the vast forest of Entwash to the chaotic and dark kingdom of Mordor. Also, the flow of the book was steady and enjoyable because there was constant action and the book added effect by having multiple main characters.I recommend this book for everyone who wants to know what a great fantasy is like."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Well, Tolkien obviously has many many devotees and there are lots of reviews below mine, so I'll keep my comments brief. I like this series a lot and this book is a worthy successor to &quot;Fellowship of the Ring&quot;. The only additional comment I'll make is that I like this series much more as an adult (I'm almost 30&quot; than I did as a child. There is a lot of interpersonal interaction &amp; emotion and not so much swordplay &amp; action. Consequently this series is certainly acceptable for children but I think it's more geared towards the adult reader."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Im gonna make this short and sweet.

Tolkien is the best author i know of."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers has become one of my favorite literary works. The Fellowship of the Rings left the reader hanging, but this novel builds more anticipation than the first. All I can say is I am glad I already own the Return of the King, so I can begin reading it immediately. I have read other fantasy novels and there is something about Tolkien's work that isn't in other novels. I think it is emotion. I can feel the sadness felt be Gimli when he leaves Lorien. When Aragorn is on the hill in Lorien and it reads, he never came there again as a living man, I am saddened. In the Two Towers, I can feel the emotions of Sam at Cirith Ungol. I guess that is the difference between Tolkien and other fantasy authors. An author can write a great novel, but it may only stimulate anticipation and excitement. Tolkien creates anticipation and excitement while stimulating other emotions.What Happens. It begins at the Rauros. With Sam and Frodo gone, the remaining members of the fellowship seek those taken captive. The pursuers reach Rohan in time of peril and find one they do not expect. They ride with Theoden and Eomer to Helm's Deep to make battle with Sauraman's Orcs. Wormtongue deals a heavy loss to his master. Book four begins with Smeagol joining Sam and Frodo. They journey first to the black gates and then to Cirith Ungol. They meet Faramir along the way, but he does not detour them.Tolkien is the best fantasy author I have read. I encourage you to purchase this book if you liked the movie, because if you read it once, you will probably read it again."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Lord of the Rings The Two TowersBy: J.R.R.

It's a real thriller and I recommend it to anyone and everyoneIn this book Frodo Baggins is still on his way to Mordor trying to defeat the dark lord Sauron by destroying his ring in the fires of Mount Doom. While the strange creature gollum is leading Frodo and Samwise to Mordor Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn are battling the Oruci at helms deep. With all this in mind there is still more to tell, Merry and Pippin are also in this book escaping from the Oruci and convincing the Treefolk to wage war with Saruman himself.I'd say the climax of the story is at the very end when the Treefolk are crushing Isengod with their Giant stone hammers and boulders at the feet of Saruman's castle itself."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The two towers is an awesome book. The fellowship has now broken into three groups, and the book follows the whereabouts and events of Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and Frodo and Sam.

Frodo and Sam are hopelessly trying to fufill their quest to destroy the ring with the deceitful Gollum as their guide.

After retreating to the fortress of Helm's Deep, Aragorn leads the battle to make a final stand...This is a fantastic book that i recommend to readers ages 14 and up. There is a lot going on a one time that might be hard for younger kids to understand. I had to read the series over again to make sure i understood."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is the best book from the trilogy. It has every thing a book by J.R.R. Tolkien should have. The Two Towers starts off where Sam and Frodo are on their way to Mordor to destroy the ring of power, while Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, and Gandalf are trapped in Heim's Deep by the Orcs. It's the best book ever because of the suspense, action, and surprises in it. The only bad thing is he only talks about The Two Towers once in the whole book"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I thought that this version of the two towers on cassate is awesome. It was like listening to the movie on tape or something like that, I finshed it in one day!! I recommened this to any Lord of The Rings fan!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers' takes over, where TFotR ended. J.R.R. Tolkien takes us once again back to Middle-Earth, his fairy world populated with unique forms of life and filled with ancient myths. And amidst this enchanting setting, we accompany our merry band of Hobbits on their exciting adventures that carry them to places far beyond their and the readers imagination.After the fellowship broke apart at the waterfalls of Rauros, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas set out to rescue the two young Hobbits, Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by orcs to be brought to the traitor wizard Saruman. The chase itself is as fast paced as the second part of Tolkien's first book had been since the departure from Elrond's home. The events that unfold around the three hunters culminate in a furious battle at Helm's Deep where the riders of Rohan clash with Saruman's mighty forces. These chapters possibly form the most intense string of chapters of the whole LotR trilogy.In contrast to the classical epic fantasy style of the first part, the second part of TTT focuses on the journey of Frodo and his faithful companion Sam to Mount Doom, the mighty fortress of evil Sauron. While the first part of TTT is filled with strife and warfare, the second part is also a journey to the true meaning of friendship, trust, betrayal and courage. Frodo and Sam find assistance when they least expect it by the hands of Faramir, brother to late Boromir, who succeeds in uncovering Frodo's secret task, but rather gives the weary Hobbits hope than despair as he resists the temptation to take the one ring from Frodo when he has the chance to do that. And they experience betrayal at the hands of Gollum, who first brings them closer to their final destination, but eventually leads them into a fatal trap. But it's the courage of dear Sam, who prevails when things appear to have been lost and evil is just one final step from victory...And that's probably the key to 'The Two Towers'. Where TFotR focussed on the adventures of a group of heroes set out to defend good from evil, TTT teaches us about friendship and faith, all spiced up by exciting battles and mysterious riddles. That's what makes Tolkien's epic so unique, as it is more than just a string of adventures in a world of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book was very good. J.R.R. Tolkien does a great job of painting a clear picture of his world and its characters. One thing he does often that bugged me is he tends to babble on and on about the smallest things. Perhaps this is was makes his books so detailed and descriptive. I've read all the books in the trilogy and I think that if you liked the movies, then you'll love the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is an awesome novel. The first time I read the Lord of the Rings, I thought the Two Towers was the weakest of the three novels. Since then I have read it again and believe it to be much better than The Hobbit or The Fellowship of the Rings. After I finished reading The Fellowship of the Rings for the second time, I remember thinking, &quot;Hopefully the Two Towers won't be too dull.&quot; I got my wish. In fact, each page of the Two Towers built my enthusiasm and anticipation. I could not put it down. The Fellowship of the Ring creates a masterful plot, and the Two Towers magnifies it.The Two Towers recieves it names from the towers of Orthanc and Minus Morgul. At Orthanc the deeds of Aragorn, Merry, Pippen, Gandalf, Gimli, and Legolas are performed. In Rohan they bring about the destruction of Isengard. The latter part of the novel returns to Frodo and Sam and their journey across Mordor and Ithilien to Minas Morgul. The book closes with disaster approaching the quest of the ring and war coming to Minas Tirith.Tolkien is an awesome author whose imagination and skill has inspired my own imagination on many journeys."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is my favorite book in the Lord of the Rings series. From the first pages when Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas being running, running in search of Merry and Pippen, I am hooked every time I open the book. The battle at Helm's Deep is intense. During the battle, Gimli is separated from Aragorn and Legolas. When Legolas hears of this, he betrays his concern for Gimli saying, &quot;But I wish that he had come this way. I desired to tell Master Gimli that my tale is thirty-nine.&quot; A wonderful friendship is born.We meet the King of Rohan, Eomer, and of course Eowyn, the White Lady of Rohan. Women everywhere cheer when she appears! Later we meet Faramir, brother of Boromir, who appears to have the inner strength that Boromir lacks, however he remains in the shadow of his older brother. We travel with Frodo and dear, dear Sam while their guide, Gollum (oh, yes) takes them past the ghosts and battlefields of the Last Alliance.But it is the Ents that absolutely enchant me. Fangorn and his brother Ents (you'll have to read it to find out what an Ent is) are slow, steady, and peaceful creatures. Until they are riled enough to fight. And when they fight...let's say you just want them on your side.Enjoy this book. The middle of a trilogy is often seen as just a tie-in between the beginning and the end of a story where 'nothing really happens'. EVERYthing happens in this book. Don't skip it. It's fabulous."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"If you haven't read &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy and are even remotely interested, please do. I won't waste time extolling the trilogy's virtues as a piece of fantasy. Suffice it to say that Tolkien crafted an incredibly believable fantasy world. Each time I read the series I become (almost) convinced that Middle Earth does indeed exist. The story, land, and characters feed the imagination and envelope the mind.With a work that's so highly regarded, it's always a bit dangerous to offer a negative criticism. I do have a (dare I say) problem with &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. I'll call it a problem of pacing. The novel is divided into two books. The first book details the adventures of all the members of the fellowship except Frodo and Sam. The second book concerns only Sam and Frodo. The narratives in both books cover roughly the same time frame. While the first book is fairly fast paced, the second book (with a few notable exceptions) moves along slowly. In the second book, Tolkien recounts how Sam and Frodo make their way into Mordor. To be honest, not much happens. Much of the text is devoted to them walking from place to place, camping along the way. The story is never boring, and I would never suggest removing a word of it. However, I can't help but wonder if it might have worked better if the two books had been intermingled. Not only would the reader get a better sense of the chronology but it would have broken up Sam and Frodo's travels with the adventures of the rest.This is really just a very small complaint I have. It should never stop someone from reading the the trilogy. Keep in mind that, at his worst, Tolkien wrote better books than 95% of fantasy writers before or after him."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This product came within a reasonable amount of time and as described.

Tolkien's three piece story. It has a lot of action and suspense. The book has basically two different stories intwined togather. One of the stories is the becoming of a king. The other story is about the small hobbit who has to save the world by destroying the magical ring of power. Aragorn and his fellow friends are trying to tarck down their other friends who were captured by some orcs. The two hobbits that were captured gathered up some tree-like creatures and destroyed one of the two towers it was called Isengard. While the small hobbit named Frodo is led on by an evil being named Gollum who leads Frodo it to a trap near the end. This book is a real page turner. You may never want to put this one down.

It's a pretty good book--a nice continuation of the Fellowship's story. If you survived the endless pages and detail of the first book, you can survive this one too. It's long, but it's good. And don't forget to see the movie--it provides a nice visual image to all the action."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"After watching the first film from the trilogy I start reading THE TWO TOWERS. It has a sad beginning with Boromir getting killed and Merry and Pippin being captured by the Uruk - Hai and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli run in pursuit of them. When the three hunters find a trail leading to Fanghorn forrest they meet Gandalf again. After learning that Merry and Pippin are with Treebeard (an ancient being of Middle Earth), the four men decide to stop the corruptive undoings of Grima Wormtoungue in Rohan and make King Theoden and his Rohirrim army fight against Isengard. The Rohirrim army go to Helm's Deep to fight off Saruman's Orcs. After Rohan has won the battle, King Theoden,Aragorn,Legolas,Gimli,and Gandalf goes to Isengard to comfront Saruman. The five reach ruined like Isengard where they meet Merry and Pippin. After the Voice Of Saruman episode, Gandalf breaks Saruman's staff and Wormtoungue throws the palantir at them and there Pippin looks into it and is terrified and is taken by gandalf into Gondor.Book 4 is my favorite with Frodo and Sam meeting with Gollum and making him their guide to Mordor. His shortcuts he takes them are long and perilious like the Dead Marshes. On their way they meet Faramir, Boromir's brother and is taken to a forbidden pool area where Gondor rangers hide out. After the hobbits tell Faramir about the ring he lets them go. At the end, Gollum betrays the hobbits and take them to Shelob the spider where Sam wounds her and Frodo is poisoned by her. The Orcs take Frodo away and Sam is left alone in the darkness of Mordor. THE TWO TOWERS is fast paced and is much better to understand than THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.

The final strongpoint in this novel is in the descriptions of the landscapes, characters, and other things.

I had forgotten so much and yet it was an old friend that was good to visit with again."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Despite its staggering length and dreary descriptions of every leaf, Fellowship of the Ring has a certain fairy-tale sheen and epic sweep that make it readable for all. The Two Towers, though, is mostly for diehard Tolkein fans.The first 200 pages or so climax with a huge battle for Helm's Deep, but for most of that time we have to endure the stupefying company of the warriors of Rohan. These beefy blonde Nordic guys have NO sense of humor, and drone on endlessly about their ancestry (who CARES?) when they're not indulging in soporfific courtesies. I always feel uneasy around these hulks--I expect to see swastikas appear on their shields at any moment. Tolkein was channeling the Viking types immortalized in coma-inducing epics like Beowulf and Lord are these fellows boring!However, hobbits to the rescue! At one point we switch to Merry and Pippin, and once they appear, the story moves again and we can enjoy characters with human foibles. These two doughty halflings endure capture and torment by orcs (goblins, who are much more entertaining than the ski-instructor types) and then wander into the world of the ents. If you thought tree-hugger Tom Bombadil was weird, these creatures will get you howling with laughter. They are tree-shepherds (I'm not making this up) and they more or less look like trees, but they go around saying things like &quot;Hm. Hroom&quot; and drinking lots of water. Later on, they turn out to be pretty tough, bringing down a whole walled city in minutes. Treebeard is their leader and he's right out of some Saturday morning cartoon show.The second half of the book brings us back to Frodo and Sam, and their journey to Mordor. They team up with Gollum, who was much creepier in The Hobbit. Here, he's a whiny reptilian nuisance and we must conclude that Frodo is an idiot for trusting him since anyone can tell he's up to no good. When he sells out his companions to a gigantic spider, we're not surprised. Tolkien manages some wonderful descriptions in this part, of the suffocating, foggy, wet, evil weather in Mordor (sounds like Long Island in the summer). The spider Shelob is a hoot, a creature who needed to wait for computer generated graphics.Again, most of the text is filled with dreary step by step schlepping from place to place, with tedious descriptions of EVERYTHING. There are superb moments (the orcs boiling out of their hiding places like swarms of ants, the disgusting marshes) and as anyone with half a brain knew, Gandalf returns (and he is the BEST character of all). The scene where Gandalf humiliates the evil wizard Saruman is worth the price of admission. And the slinking, cowardly Wormtongue is a great creation--if Tolkein hadn't written this in the 1940's, I'd swear he was based on Henry Kissinger.So enter at your own risk. Some exciting scenes, lots of sludge, basically a bridge from Fellowship of the Ring to The Return of the King. Not for anyone with arachnophobia."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"i didn't read the Two Towers until last month I thought it would be great, which is it is. It's a fun and exciting book that will entertain anyone who reads it. But it lacks something that the movies really did a good job in. the movies went into more depth and details of the characters. Which isn't something you expect a movie to do. But the book left me hangin' on some of the charcters. The only character that truly gets your attention every time he appears is Gandalf. My reccomdations: don't read this book if you have high expectations from the movie. I'm not discouraging you from reading it but I'm just warning you. It's an intruiging book that will captivate you until the very end. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"\`The Two Towers', the second of the three volume novel, \`Lord of the Rings' by philologist J. R. R. Tolkien is one of the most influential popular novels of the 20th century. Other bases of big motion pictures such as \`Ben-Hur' and \`Gone With the Wind' can't hold a candle to it as it had an influence far beyond its role as the basis for a movie script. For starters, \`Lord of the Rings' has had a large and growing readership from its original publication in the mid 1950s to the present, while I suspect practically no one reads Lew Wallace's \`Ben-Hur' any more and few people have recently read Margaret Mitchell's \`Gone With the Wind'. Another \`Lord of the Rings' offspring is the whole \`Dungeons and Dragons' role playing games phenomenon. This game originally appeared a few years after the second blooming of \`Lord of the Rings' popularity in 1965, when the books were published in paperback by Houghton Mifflin in response to a pirated copy published by Ace. This is when I first became enraptured by the stories of Middle Earth.In many ways, it is almost impossible to speak of any one of the three volumes which do not in the usual sense of the word form a trilogy of three independent novels related by common characters, location, and history. \`The Lord of the Rings' is a single novel which was serialized in three volumes published over two and a half years in the mid 1950's. When the three titles are published in a single volume, it is not hard to see that the work is really not much longer than \`Gone With the Wind' and it is certainly shorter than some notable novels such as \`Atlas Shrugged'. One virtue we did get from the division into three titles by Tolkien is that Peter Jackson had a valid basis on which to split a single story into three long movies totaling close to 10 hours of viewing time.Unlike the movies of the first and third books, almost every major scene of the book \`The Two Towers', is captured in the movie. The chapters of Merry and Pippin with Treebeard and the Ents are shortened a bit. Seems as if the Ents are much too slow for 21st century cinema. One thing the movie did get wrong in its promotional artwork is the suggestion that the two towers of the title were Orthanc and Baradur, the fortress of Sauron. Actually, the second tower of the title is Minas Morgul, the city of Gondor, originally named Minas Ithil, but renamed when the Nazgul captured it several years before the start of the events in \`Lord of the Rings'. The only piece of action I really miss is the role of Fangorn in the defeat of the besiegers of the Hornburg. And, in one of the very rare Peter Jackson additions to the story, I thought the skirmish between the Rohrrim / Aragorn and Saruman's warg riders was great cinema action, but just too much of a replay of Gandalf at the bridge in Moria, where a principle character is thought to have been killed and lost.I have read \`The Lord of the Rings' at least 10 times, and the story of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli from the banks of the Anduin to the victory at the Hornburg is by far one of my favorite parts of the novel. Treebeard comes in a close second, as he is a piece of the same ancient history of Middle Earth to which only the faintest hints are given in the stories of Fangorn, The Old Forest by the Shire, and Tom Bombadil. Basically, Bombadil and the Ents stand for what is most worth saving from the evil of Sauron. This innocence is something that is tainted even in the sheltered lives of the Hobbits.In contrast, after about the third or fourth reading, I often became anxious to get through the chapters about Frodo, Sam, and Gollum as quickly as possible. One of the greatest of Jackson's accomplishments in the films was to breath life into the characterization of Frodo Baggins, who always seemed to be to be something of a wimp, drawn along by the inexorable hand of fate. Sam, on the other hand, was pursuing the quest entirely out of love and grit. Another great service of the movie was the realization of Gollum. I think that Gollum's implementation may be about as close as we will come for a long time in seeing a computer generated character be nominated for an Academy Award for acting.Even though \`The Two Towers' is the middle third of the complete novel, it really has a much more satisfying ending than \`The Fellowship of the Ring'. One starts to see how it may be possible to defeat the great evil challanging all the good guys in the story, but of course, the difficulty of Saruman's defeat is just a way of showing that defeating Sauron will be just that much more difficult.The second of the great three part classic!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"In the story Lord of the Ring the Two Towers its about the main character Frodo Baggins from the \\"Shire\\". This story has moral and themes that seem more realistic since the movie came out for it also addresses death, light, purity, hope, and innocence, betrayal, darkness, and redemption. Throughout the book of the Lord of the Ring the Two towers golem is constantly manipulating Frodo's mind into thinking that his friends were against him. This story is a 4 star book because of the way it deals with real life issues, and it also addresses how friendship can come over and triumph over anything because in the story it seem that friendship is the only thing that keeps Frodo pure and uncorrupt in this story friendship, purity, and hope intertwine and overlap into one another.

Tolkien's epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, and begins right where the previous book left off: the Fellowship has been sundered, with the death of Boromir, the escape of Frodo and Sam, the capture of Merry and Pippen, and the chase that ensues on the part of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Like the other two installments in the series \\"The Two Towers\\" is split into two books, in this case it is Book Three and Book Four.Book Three alternates between the journey of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in their cross country race across forest and plain in order to rescue Merry and Pippen. Their pursuit takes them into Rohan, the province of King Theoden and his people, known as the Horse-Lords due to their skill and affinity with horses.Meanwhile Merry and Pippen are held captive by the terrible orcs as they race their way back to their master, the White Wizard Saruman, who has betrayed his calling and given in to his desire for the Ring. Now he wages war on Rohan, filling the court with his spies, and sends his orcs out on a mission to find the Ring before the Dark Lord himself does.The two stories conjoin when Merry and Pippen are able to escape into Fangorn Forest, where they fall into the company of Treebeard - a mighty Ent, a tree-like guardian of the forestlands who is not happy with Saruman's treatment of his land. Likewise, the three hunters also find their way into the forest, only to meet someone that they thought was lost to them...In Book Four we join up again with Frodo and Sam, who are making their lonely way toward the land of Mordor and the volcanic Mount Doom in order to destroy the Ruling One Ring. There the secretive figure that has been trailing them since Moria finally shows itself: it is the twisted creature Gollum, once a hobbit, who fell to the power of the Ring and nursed it for many years. Now Frodo employs him as their guide - despite the mistrust of Sam - to take them into the dangerous lands ahead.But they too have their fair share of danger: as always the agents of the Dark Lord are abroad, and even the \\"good guys\\" can pose a threat, considering the constant lure of the Ring - enter Faramir, Boromir's own brother, who takes the hobbits into his custody.\\"The Two Towers\\" suffers like many 'middle' books do - it inevitably does not start anything, and it does not finish anything. But one must keep in mind that Tolkien hated the idea of his work being separated into three separate volumes; he intended them to be published in a single book. The publishers however had other plans, and since then we have been subject to authors who think their books are not proper books unless they are split into multiple volumes.But \\"The Two Towers\\" continues to expand and enlarge Tolkien's most wonderful creation - Middle-Earth itself. We are introduced to the dank and mysterious depths of Fangorn Forest and the plainlands of Rohan, based on the Nordic and Scandinavian culture that Tolkien was fascinated with. Just exploring these beautiful places is reason enough to read \\"The Two Towers\\".With the release of Peter Jackson's adaptation of the three books, it is always interesting to compare and contrast the two. Often the movies fall short in certain ways - often by reducing the nobility and goodness of several supporting characters, such as Faramir, Theoden and Treebeard, who need more pushing from the likes of Aragorn, Frodo and Gandalf to do the right thing rather than reach their own decisions. However, other times Jackson takes the opportunity to divulge further into little subplots and details that Tolkien only briefly touches on - the prime example being the relationship between Eowyn and Wormtongue. In Tolkien's words Wormtongue's lust is only briefly mentioned; but Jackson devotes a fascinating little sequence to it, with Wormtongue attempting to weaken Eowyn to his will.Either way, the movie is as must-see as the book is must-read, though if you have only seen the movie and decide that it's not worth reading the book, I strongly suggest otherwise. Although Jackson creates a near-perfect visual duplicate of Middle-Earth, the book contains details and information that the movie must skim over, or neglect completely. If you want to know where Shadowfax came from, or where Gandalf went after defeating the Balrog, or Shelob's origins, then you'll have to consult the book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Great continuation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.May 11, 2004The continuation of the Fellowship of the Ring the Lord of the Rings: Two Towers is an excellent sequel. It is the continued story of Frodo Baggins and his journey to destroy the one ring. As Legolas, Aragorn, Gimli, Gandalf the White, and the armies of Rohan are fighting Orcs at Helm's Deep Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum and ask for his aid to the gates of Mordor. J.R.R Tolkien does a great job in the second Lord of the Rings book. For children that have enjoyed the first book The Fellowship of the Ring, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers will be equally enjoyable. If children wish to find out what happens after the end of The Two Towers, children should read the last book in the series The Return of the King. For children wishing to know how Bilbo got the one ring, they should read The Hobbit a prequel of The Fellowship of the Ring."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The adventures continue for the fellowship in book 2, The Two Towers. There seemed to be a lot more action and fighting in this book than the first. Tolkien's writing style makes this book just as magical as the first, however, I did feel that it dragged on in a few spots and just didn't seem to hold my attention quite like the 1st book. However, I would recommend this book to anybody who loves the movies and anybody who loves the 1st book or the Hobbit."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This story is aboout a small shire man named frodo with his friends, sam, merry, pippin, legolas, aragorn, and a dwarf named gimli and you cant forget smeagel and Gandolf. These are all the warriors and adventurers in this story. Frodo and the rest of the fellowship try to bring the ring of power to mount doom.so far they have not succeeded but they are close. This is a great stroy to read if you like fantasy and war scenes then this is your book."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This is a hard hitting story about war and quest to destroy the ring of power. This book is definetly a best buy"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the J.R.R Tolkein Classic Trilogy, Lord of The Rings.The Book starts at the ending of the first book in the Lord Of The Rings, Fellowship of the Ring, when The Fellowship splits and goes different paths. The hobbits Frodo and Sam go to Mordor to finish the quest of destroying the Ring Of Power. As they pass towards Mordor, Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, who has been stalking after them for the ring.They force him to be their guide to Mordor. As they pass into the edge of Mordor, They go to Cirith Ungol to take a hidden route though the mountains. Gollum tricks Frodo and Sam by taking them to the Shelob, a giant spider. They sneak through its cave and Sam kills the Shelob. But Frodo was poisoned and taken by Orcs to a guardhouse.As Sam and Frodo are on their quest in Mordor, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are tracking The Orcs who stole Merry and Pippin. The Orcs are killed by Riders of The Mark. Merry and Pippin escape and meet Faragorn,part of large living tree race known as the Ents. Faragorn and the other ents attack Sauraman and defeat him with the help of the Riders of The Mark and Gandalf after their battle at Helm's Deep. Aragorn , Gimili, and Legolas rejoin Merry and Pippin and head to Tithral Minias to aid Gondor from Mordor's Attacks.I thought that this was a very enjoyable book and I would read it again. The book added many interest creatures and charaters that made J.R.R Tolkein's series famous such as the Ents.I liked how it showed the charaters progression as they passed on their separate quest and conflicts and how they fit into the bigger picture. Each charater developed a distinct personality and showed how they changed from the beginning of the book to the end. The problem with the book was if you had not seen the movie or read the first book , you would be completly lost. At times the book was confusing but eventully it made sense.I think this was a very enjoyable book and should be read with the rest of the Lord of the Rings trilogy."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"J.R.R Tolkiens novel The Two Towers is an outstanding book. Being the second part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy it is the heart of the story. The book starts off on the run and stays that way for it's entirity.Tolkien creates a world, Middle Earth, that is so real and so believable, it seems to be an actual place. This makes the book better than most fantasy tales and provides a backdrop which works perfectly for the characters, which are very unique and diverse. The felloship travels in two groups through Middle Earth climbing a seemingly unsurmountable mountain, by fighting a war against evil, but being held together by their friendship and driven by their will to survive with hopes of saving the world."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"The Two Towers is the second book in the Fellowship of the Ring series by J.R.R. Tolkien. It is a follow up to the Lord of the Rings. The novel is very suspenseful at times, while other times it is more relaxing and simply fun to read. Tolkien does a good job of creating a fantasy world with many interesting characters.The novel picks up with Sam and Frodo. Sam and Frodo are two hobbits that are trying to take the evil ring to the one place that it can be destroyed. Along their journey they are given help by an unlikely character. Golem is a monster that owned the ring many years ago. He is following Sam and Frodo because they have the ring and he wants it back. However, when he meets with the hobbits, he helps them when they aer met with troubles in the swamps along their journey.The novels also picks up with Pippen and Mary, two other members in the fellowship of the ring. Mary and Pippen are first captured by the evil Orcs. They are saved though by my favorite characters, the Imps. Imps are large walking trees that stomp almost anything in their way. One of my favorite parts in the book is when the Imps discuss how all trees are alive and have feelings, even though they do not all speak. I think Tolkien was making an important statement about how the environment was being treated when he wrote the book. Another highlight in the novel is when Gandolf returns. he comes back as Gandolf the White, meaning he has more power than he did in the previous novel.The heroes are faced with many evil and very deceitful enemies, but with help, they are able to continue on their journey. Tolkein does a very good job in continuing his series. I feel this book is very good for most teenagers to read and might even be good for some adults. I recommend this novel if you have first read Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have started reading the Lord of the rings series and greatly enjoyed the first book. Now, coming to a close of the second book in the trilogy, i find myself not as satisfied as i was with the first book. Now, it is an excellent read for fantasy lovers and Tolkien is absolutely amazing at creating these complex cultures of men, elves, dwarves, and hobbits, but by Tolkien measures, i don't believe this was his best book. At this point, he is continuing on the first book and leading into the thrid, making more of a means of connection then an individual story. There is also a lot of walking. A good read nonethless. 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I find this the most impressive of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, no mean feat for the middle book-- as the companions are separated, the world grows darker and darker. Tolkein deftly builds a brooding atmosphere that is only deepened by the contrast afforded in the flashes of humor."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I have read already The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Rings and I have one thing to say about The Two Towers, it is awesome. After the Fellpwship you know Gandalf is dead, the fellowship is probably going to be scattered, and Frodo is going with the faithful Samwise to Mordor alone. The Two Towers, like the first book, is split in to two sections. One is with Strider, Legolas, and Gimli to set out and find Merry and Pippim and deal with the treachory of Saruman(and on hint, there is a huge suprise in store). The second is all about Frodo and Sam on the trek to Mordor with the treachorous Gollum. At first he seems to be different and wants to be called his old name, Smeagol,but you quickly learn that Gollum has two sides(named by Sam as Slinker and Stinker). It all ends with a perfect setting for the next book, The Return of the King. All in all The Two Towers is one of the best books you'll ever read in your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"more blood and turmoil then the rest of the books combined! this one made this series!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"JRR Tolkien beautifully interweaves the plot in The Two Towers, told from a third person point of view. His bright adjectives are amazing in his descriptions of cities, forests, and characters. In this story, the second part of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Tolkien narrates the story of Frodo the Ringbearer and the rest of the Fellowship of the Ring. When Frodo and his servant Sam leave the Fellowship for Mordor, ill things come to the rest of the group. An Orc ambush leaves Boromir dead and the two hobbits Merry and Pippin captives. Ever since the fall of Gandalf, Aragorn the Ranger led the group. Now he leads Legolas the spirited Elf and Gimli the surly Dwarf on the chase of the Orcs. When the Orcs were near their destination of Orthanc, the stronghold of Saruman the traitor, the trio of warriors and the Riders of Rohan that they met with, finally catch up to the Orcs. The five score Riders overcome the vicious army of Orcs in a battle at the break of dawn near the mysterious forest of Fangorn. The hobbits, confused, retreat to Fangorn. After a vicious, bloody battle between the Rohirrim and the thousands of Orcs, Isengard is defeated. But Gandalf had returned, and spurred the King of Rohan to attack Orthanc. Gandalf had broken Saruman's staff and banished him finally after the slow, but vicious Ents had destroyed and flooded Isengard, defeating the traitor ultimately. When all of that is going on, Frodo and Sam journey over a wasteland of hills and rock. The evil character Gollum has caught up to them, and they knew they were being followed. With an ingenious plan Frodo captures Gollum and almost trains him to guide them to Mordor. As he writes, JRR Tolkien intricately describes the places that the hobbits pass through, the setting almost telling the future of the story. As the hobbits journey with Gollum as their guide, they meet Faramir and the soldiers of Gondor, and end up befriending the proud warriors. Later Gollum leads them to Mordor, and to an unknown resolve to the story... One of the best parts of the book to my opinion was when Tolkien told of the soldiers of Gondor as though he personally knew them. He closely detailed their clothing, weapons, armor and gear as though he was one of them. The second part of my favorite scene is when the soldiers are fighting the evil men under Sauron's control. Tolkien consistently describes everything going on around, from individual men to how the setting affects the battle. \\"Four tall Men stood there. Two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads. Two had great bows, almost of their own height, and great quivers of long green- feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of Ithilien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and bright.\\" This book is masterfully crafted by Tolkien's genius, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure or fantasy or both. The beginning was slow, maybe the first 40 pages or so, but it is a wonderful tale. I really loved it and I'm going to also read the final book to find out the ending. I think you should find out what happens too..."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"This book has to be one of the best books ever written. I don't see why so many people have read The Fellowship of the Ring but have never even heard of The Two Towers, which is by far superior.It has every thing you could ask for in a fantasy: adventure,strange and mysterious creatures,characters you care about, drama, betrayal,suspense, and even some humor.In the first half of the book Orces attack the remainder of the fellowship, kill Boromir, and kidnap Merry and Pippin. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli try to rescue them but are soon caught up in their own problems; defending the people of Rohan and fighting Saruman. This half is mostly told by Aragorn and Pippin while the second part is seen from Sam's point of view.In the later half Frodo and Sam try to get into Mordor and the only one to lead them is Gollum, former owner of the ring.I highly recommend this book, don't leave it unread."},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I spent alot of time finding the right version of this book so that it would match the other ones that I had. After spending a long while finding the book with the right design(because they make like a million versions of LOTR), I bought it. When I received the book, it wasn't the same book in the picture and now I have a mismatched set. Thanks a bunch Amazon"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"I've read the whole trilogy, including the Hobbit, and I personally loved ALL of them! I definently recomend reading them, but they MUST be read in order, or else you'll ruin the experience.Basicly, I'd recomend this to anyone who enjoys reading. The writting is exquisit and the descriptions of Middle Earth make you feel like youre there, watching everything happen. This is definently a book series to make you cry and laugh. You will fall in love with the characters and feel what they feel. Definently a must read for lovers of fantasy and medieval times!"},{"Title":"The Two Towers","review":"Now that the fellowship was scattered, Frodo and Sam are alone, off to the land of darkness. The rest of the fellowship are off to senguard to defeat the traitor Saruman. To do that, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli have to save the hobbitnapped hobbits, Pippin and Merry. Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are being followed by the sneaky Gollum and they join up with him. Can he be trusted? Will they destroy the ring and kill the traitor? Find out by reading the second in this fabulous series which has been read through these long lasting years.I thought this book was a good follow up to the Fellowship of the Ring. The only part I was annoyed about was that there were 2 parts in the book. The first part they only talked about Merry and Pippin being captured and you had to read the whole half of the book to find out what happened to Frodo and Sam. Otherwise this is a good book and it ends again like the first.
