The criticism usually centers on her use of Freudian psychobiographical techniques to ascertain a historical figure's experiences and motivations through a psychological interpretation of their writings.Although this seminal work is still the most analytical and provocative biography written on Smith, the following four problems are conspicuous with Brodie's research:1) Before beginning her examination of sources, she was already convinced that Joseph Smith's religious experiences were unauthentic. Thus, the volume's naturalistic perspectives (along with its limiting choices of explanatory categories) were preconceived before the research began.2) She also chose not to access the documents in the LDS Historical Archives at Salt Lake City. Consequently, her volume lacks both the balance and information available from the single largest collection on Mormonism.3) By ignoring the aforementioned collection she was ignorant of the fact that most of Joseph Smith's papers and diaries were written by scribes in first-person for him, thus, her psychobiographical theories were actually based on other people's writings; and4) Her libraries of research were located mainly in New York, Connecticut, Chicago and Missouri, which in the 1940's were chiefly anti-Mormon collections. Ergo, her book reflects an anti-Mormon attitude.A more balanced but less piercing treatment may be found in Bushman's, Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling.If you really want to know the background of both Brodie and her first work, an excellent book that details both is Newell G. Bringhurst's, Reconsidering No Man Knows My History.Two scholarly LDS reviews on Brodie's volume are: Marvin S. Hill, \\"Secular or Sectarian History? A Critique of \`No Man Knows My History,'\\" Church History 43 (March 1974) 78 96; and Louis Midgley, \\"The Brodie Connection: Thomas Jefferson and Joseph Smith,\\" Brigham Young University Studies 20 (Fall 1979) 59-67."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"No Man Knows My History was a direct attack on critical Mormon beliefs about Joseph Smith. In 1946, The Improvement Era, the official periodical of the Church, said that many of the book's citations arose from doubtful sources and that the biography was \\"of no interest to Latter-day Saints who have correct knowledge of the history of Joseph Smith.\\" The \\"Church News\\" section of the Deseret News provided a lengthy critique that acknowledged the biography's \\"fine literary style\\" and then denounced it as \\"a composite of all anti-Mormon books that have gone before.\\"BYU professor and LDS historian and apologist Hugh Nibley challenged Brodie in another booklet, No, Ma'am, That's Not History, asserting that Brodie had cited sources supportive only of her conclusions while conveniently ignoring others. Brodie herself thought the Deseret News pamphlet \\"a well-written, clever piece of Mormon propaganda\\", but she dismissed the ultimately more popular No, Ma'am, That's Not History as \\"a flippant and shallow piece.\\"Brodie's controversial depiction of Joseph Smith is in the same vein as her other Psychoanalysis works of fiction. I say fiction because the psychoanalytical babbling of the insane is just that - psychoanalytical babbling without substance or fact. Brodie incorporates in her work Freudian psychology. Psychoanalysis is a work of the devil for sure, based on dreams and unprovable and unsupported assumptions. Her psycho biography of Thomas Jefferson became a best-seller base on the same psychoanalytical babbling And most important, Brodie's study of the early Richard Nixon, completed while she was dying of cancer, demonstrated the hazards of psycho biography in the hands of an author who loathed her subject. Brodie grew up disliking the LDS religion with full support from her mother. Brodie had access to church historical records because of her family connections to the church. She deviously betrayed the trust of church historians by misusing and misrepresenting the material.Psychoanalysis is a body of knowledge developed by Sigmund Freud and his followers, devoted to the study of human psychological functioning and behavior. Freudian psychoanalysis refers to a specific type of treatment in which the patient verbalizes thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the unconscious conflicts causing the patient's symptoms and character problems, and interprets them for the patient to create insight for resolution of the problems.Both Fawn Brodie and her husband subjected themselves to psychoanalysis, he for insomnia and she for chronic mild depression and sexual problems. (Bernard's employer, the RAND Corporation, paid most of the bills.) If the problems of everyday life had been insufficient to maintain Brodie's interest in psychology, there was the case of her mother, who during this period attempted suicide three times, the second by cutting herself with a Catholic crucifix and the third (which succeeded) by setting herself on fire.One should be careful what they read and adopt as gospel truth. The infamous Mark Hofmann read Brodie's No Man Knows My History before he bombed and kill two prominent Salt Lake City residents in 1985. Hofmann set out to destroy the LDS church. Hofmann's favorite text to discredit the Mormon church was Fawn's Brodie's No Man Knows My History. In my opinion Brodie's book is a work of the devil for sure, based on the psychoanalytical babbling of the insane."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is a disgrace to being scholarly and should not even be included a website that sells such great scholarly works as Steinbeck. It is like reading a lot of conjecture and speculation with no references but to other sources that do the same. All of her references are by either antagonistic sources or are taken out of context by real LDS sources. It is a flat-out waste of money. If you think you will find something fair and balanced you are in for a suprise."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book has been around for a long time because people who do not know the facts are deceived by it.

The author reads into an event her own explanation and then says that is the only reason that event occured. Truth is totally obscured in this book. A waste of time and money.

In this book Brodie takes accounts that fit her intent to show that the Prophet Joseph Smith is a false prophet who means well. She uses accounts from people who are not reliable in there stories and who from the beginning didnt like the prophet. This is just another person trying to jump on the band wagon of anti-mormon books who likes to use lies to prove there point. Its time to get a life people and not continue trying to look for things that are not true to prove your point. You want to know the real history of the prophet Joseph Smith ask a missionary from the LDS church. Dont go to a Ford dealerhip to get information on a Chevy you'll get Ford's side of the story not Chevy's. Let think logical.

Wixom says Brodie is an eloquent novelist, a bankrupt historian. Wixom gives many examples. Even Brodie admitted in her 1945 \\"expose\\" that if she speculated in her work that it had condescended to fiction. Yet, she has these statements in her supposed work of historicity: \\"He [Joseph Smith] knew that she thought him a coward.\\" No footnote. So, Brodie knew that Emma knew that Joseph knew what Emma was thinking.Or we have this: \\"Joseph stood proudly before his men betraying nothing of the tumult and anxiety raging within him.\\" And \\"Nancy [Rigdon] threatened to scream.\\" Threatened? Even if Brodie was there, which she wasn't, how does Brodie know Nancy threatened?Brodie might have gotten away with saying, \\"it might have been,\\" or \\"considering the results\\"...but Brodie knows much more than she could know 150 years after the fact. She may have done considerable resource on Mormondom's prophet Joseph Smith but has few sources for her conclusions. In fact, Wixom found that one of Brodie's \\"documented\\" sources attributed to a St. Louis newspaper didn't even in existence in the year given by Brodie.Prof. Hugh Nibley very ably dissected Brodie's \\"No Man\\" with \\"No, Ma'm That's Not History.\\" But His pamphlet was lamented by some historian in that it was too brief; it did not go into detail. Lou MIdgely of BYU's FARMS did go into great detail investigating Brodie's troubled life and marriage, as well as her highly controversial biography of Thomas Jefferson. Midgely noted that the same criticisms leveled at the Jefferson work (speculation and unfounded conclusions) could be aimed at the biography of Joseph Smith. These were, indeed, darts in Brodie's balloon.But Wixom's major contributions as a former investigative reporter for several daily newspapers and post-graduate work in history at two universities , was this: he cited the many eastern newspapers and magazines (including TIME) which acclaimed Brodie's \\"objectivity.\\" Wixom's master's thesis was on the topic of objectivity as it was expounded by such creditable entities as the Associated Press. \\"Tell both sides; keep your own opinions out of it; use reliable sources; avoid unfounded speculation.\\" Under these guidelines, Wixom labels Brodie's \\"objectivity\\" as selective, a disservice to credible historicity.As Wixom points out, Fawn Brodie took the position from the beginning that she was going to expose Joseph Smith. As the niece of LDS Church president David O. McKay, she showed bravado in going against her family; but what did it avail her if she could not prove her point?Even anti-Mormon author Vardis Fisher lamented that Brodie relied mostly on blatant enemies of the LDS Church. Her work was one-sided. Bernard De Voto praised Brodie for \\"avoiding the supernatural.\\" That would also toss the Bible in the trash can. But how does DeVoto explain the accomplishments of Joseph Smith if he did it all by himself? (The Book of Mormon brought forth by Joseph Smith at age 23-24 is now embraced by 14 millions Mormons). De Voto, like Brodie, does not try to explain it. Neither one make any valid attempt.With all of the above, it would seem that neither Marvin Hill nor anyone can continue to say that No Man Knows My History has \\"gone so long without effective criticism.\\" It is the opening of a new era. Let Brodie be recognized as a creative genius with a slant toward Charles Dickens or Mark Twain. But historian? Hardly.Note: Hartt Wixom has written three other books dealing with LDS history in addition to Critiquing the Critics of Joseph Smith: Profiles in Mormon Courage, Edward Partridge, Jacob Hamblin. Wixom has bachelors and masters degrees in communications from Brigham Young University and 50 post graduate hours of history from the University of Utah."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Before the age of the internet and all its instant access to Mormon Histoy, Fawn Brodie steped into the line of fire as she told the History that the church wanted to forget.

This book can and should shake the faith of any Mormon. The truth hurts and in this case it is devastating to the claims of Joseph Smith and his church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Because this book tells a story that many people may find offensive; I think it's best that there's different recommendations for different groups of people.For currently practicing Mormons who are happy in their religion:this probably isn't a book you want to read. Ms. Brodie talks about a lot of things that will be upsetting to you and your faith. If you're happy in your religion you might just prefer to stay away from this book.For non-Mormons:If you're interested in religion, charasmatic leaders and movements, or just like biographies I think you'll find this book very interesting and readable. Joseph Smith is an interesting historical character who was able to raise up a religion with thousands of followers around him which has grown into millions of adherents today. Much of that religion still gathers strength from Smith's charisma and personality. Understanding him better can help you learn so much more about personality, religion, and psychology. It's worth your time if you have any interest.For ex-Mormons and Mormons who aren't happy in their religion:This is the group that I fit into. This book helped me to finally break away from the Mormon church. There were so many things that never made sense, but once you can better understand Joseph Smith and how he founded his religion you can better understand Mormonism today. Knowing the truth about Mormonism makes it so much easier to to leave because when it comes down to it Joseph's stories were lies and he constantly did things to better his own position in life. Joseph Smith was the first major cult leader in America and understanding that can help you get away. So I definitely recommend this book for people who are having a difficult time leaving the church or have had a difficult time staying away."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I had always been under the assumption that this was a mean-spirited book about Joseph Smith.I was surprised to find that it wasn't.Obviously Brodie doesn't believe that Smith was a prophet, so the book is written from a &quot;secular&quot; perspective.However, I felt that she was simpathetic and offered some interesting insights into his life.I came out respecting Smith for who he was and what he accomplished, regardless of whether I believed his claim or not.He is a vivid individual, and Brodie reflect him as such in her writing."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I was a lifetime Mormon till I went through a divorce and decided to take a critical look at my own beliefs. Having been born in the Church, serving a full time Mission and marrying in the temple I thought I knew all about Joseph Smith and the history of Mormonism. This book changed my life more than the Book of Mormon ever could have. For the first time many missing parts of the Mormon puzzle began to fit together and my life, as I understood it came crashing down. I literally threw up as I discovered what a bastard Joseph Smith was. No, this book isn't perfect, but having been written in 1945, it has proven itself to be the definitive expose of Mormonism's founder. I bear witness it has more truth in it than you will find inside the whitewashed history of the Mormon Church. I found myself unable to return my copy to the library and chose to pay the replacement cost. It is one of my most cherished possessions."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"How I wish I had read this book 35 years ago before going on a mission.

Fawn Brodie grew up as a Mormon, and I'm sure it pained her to uncover the facts that she did in her extensive research. (She was later excommunicated from the LDS Church, which I think is the wrong thing to do. She merely wrote a historical book; did the LDS leaders truly want her to repress the facts?) In No Man Knows my History, she uncovered the real Smith, the one who wanted to be prophet/military commander/president, etc. He is not the same person many Mormons have perceived him to be.The research is sound and, while very historical (obviously, since that was Brodie's specialty), extremely readable. It kept my interest throughout the book. I think it behooves a person to be very critical when it comes to following any leader. If the leader is from God, I think this will prove itself. If he is not, then common sense says to leave and search after what is real truth. This truth is only found in the God of the Bible, not the God that Joseph Smith said was &quot;once as we are now, and is an exalted man, and sits enthroned on yonder heavens.&quot; I think Brodie has gotten many followers of Joseph Smith to rethink their faith, and I am glad it is so very popular today."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Fawn McKay Brodie, trained historian and wordsmith, was raised in the LDS (Mormon) church. During her scholarly study of Joseph Smith's early writings and those of his contemporaries, she was given special access to historical archives of the LDS church - probably due to her relation to LDS general authority David O. McKay. The resulting history, with its rich and enjoyable literary style, easily qualifies as the first truly full biography of Joseph Smith, Jr. Mrs. Brodie gives credit where credit is due: &quot;The Prophet&quot; is credited with an aversion to violence, a genuine love for people (especially tender affection for children), manful behavior during his lengthy Liberty Jail incarceration, the power to win over even many of his enemies once personally introduced, and a powerful, driving imagination and energy. Proper criticisms are levelled against his lack of financial acumen, his inclination to see apparently fictional &quot;historical evidences&quot; in the things around him, his likely inability to constructively examine himself, and his extra-marital dalliances which more likely served as the cause of &quot;plural marriage&quot; rather than the effect of it. Her pointed examination of the Book of Abraham appears to have been vindicated in later years. (I have the 1954 edition.) And so on. While not a perfect work (is any writing of man or woman?), its strengths are sufficient to make it a must-have, must-read for anyone interested in Mormon studies."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Mormonism is said to be one of the fastest growing religions in the world, and No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith provides a fascinating and detail look into the life of Mormonism's founder. Detailed alongside, is the formation and growth of the early church and its key players.Mormonism is the only major religion to have its early, formative days chronicled by local newspapers, government and court records. Virtually every movement of the church and its principals--both controversial--were not only chronichled widely but histrionically editorialized about.The author, Fawn Brodie, maintains the hard-to-balance line of even reporting for such a controversial subject. The early church leaders could have been labeled either opportunistic whackos or divinely-inspired men of God. She does neither.Mormonism is quite popular and very widespread in the American West, and the United States has its very first Mormon presidential candidate. As a westerner, myself, I have a number of friends and acquaintances who are Mormon. After reading this book, I couldn't help but think, \\"Do these people really know this history of their church?\\"This reading experience left me somewhat doubting the validity and veracity of all orgnized religions. Read it."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"For me, a non-Mormon living in Utah for many years, this was a fascinating look into Joseph Smith's life and origins of the Mormon Church.It will never be popular with the Mormon faithful (see the many 1 star reviews here) because it is simply an honest account of Smith and his new church. And that honesty exposes Smith as a charlatan. The book is scholarly and well-documented, though Mormons have put a great deal of effort into making it seem otherwise."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I've consummed a library of books on Mormon studies, and had held off on reading &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; because I had already read a considerable quantity of biographical material on Joseph Smith. I capitulated at last only because it is among the most well known books on early Mormon history. I am so glad I did. No book could have pulled it all together and made sense of it all as well as Fawn Brodie's book. It is as valuable today as it was when it was first written over half a century ago. None of the objective scholarship of recent years contradicts her conclusions, but rather validates her, page after page after page. Her insight is piercing, her style is almost poetic, and her message is powerful.It is not any easy book for a Mormon to read, as is evidenced by some of the reactionary attacks Brodie receives in some of the reviews already written. The faithful do not want to hear that Joseph Smith was an &quot;evolutionary revolutionary,&quot; his doctrine growing with his ego and sense of personal magnificence. But this is no mean swipe at the character of Joseph Smith...if anything, you come away with a sense of awe at the creative genius, the charismatic giant that he must have been. If he brought scorn and violence upon himself and his people, it was a measure of the power he produced and the fear that he struck in lesser men with whom he shared his time and space. Nevertheless, Brodie's exploration of the world of Joseph Smith and the context within which his doctrine evolved is brilliant. She is adept at recognizing the role that projection has played throughout his career, beginning with the Book of Mormon, and continuing on through all of his other writings, including the History of the Church. Ms. Brodie says it best herself in the opening lines of Chapter 19: &quot;A man's memory is bound to be a distortion of his past in accordance with his present interests, and the most faithful autobiography is likely to mirror less what a man was than what he has become.&quot; Or as is so often the case, &quot;less what a man was than what he wished he had become.&quot; To one who has studied the role of paradigms in shaping the way we interpret our world, Brodie's book makes the most beautiful sense. To one who's faith is at stake, however, her book may serve to threaten the idylic, heroic legend of Joseph Smith that has been carefully nurtured since his murder in 1844.This is among the finest pieces of historical literature I have had the priveledge of reading. Her scholarship and writing and fearless approach to tackle controversial issues with objectivity and sensitivity is matched only by Juanita Brooks in the realm of Mormon studies. This is a book not just to read, but to consume."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"After hearing about the \\"controversial\\" nature of this book amongst my peers and how \\"horribly\\" written it was I decided I would read it for myself.Needless to say I was enthralled from the very beginning of the book. I found the book and the subject matter fascinating. I had expected the book to have a clear bias, but I felt Brodie presented the information very fairly and in a suprisingly unbiased way... oftentimes giving both perspectives and the information where both sides claims come from (i.e. she'll present people's claims that Joseph Smith was a moneydigger and occultist, and than show the court documents where he was on trial for doing so, and than she would show the other side's argument.).In fact the only part of the book that I felt had a truly negative biased tone was the \\"afterword\\" that was added several years after the author's excommunication.In the end though, I would have to say that the part I enjoyed most about the book was that it not only gave a detailed account of Joseph Smith, but of other church history figures such as Sidney Rigdon, Brigham Young, John D. Lee, etc. I felt like a picture of what life was like back then was painted.Granted true blue Mormons will be offended when reading this book because they haven't heard anything but the filtered down version, AND they will gnash their teeth and bash on Fawn Brodie... BUT give her a break! It was the first biography of its kind and it was written in the 40's for heaven sakes. All the teeth gnashing looks ridiculous as if you're trying too hard to prove your obedience and faith.A good product will sell itself, and this book has sold suprisingly well despite being restricted to a small fraction of the world who actually knows what a \\"mormon\\" or who \\"Joseph Smith\\" was. I enjoyed the book very much, thank you Fawn Brodie."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I will spare the reader of this review another exhaustive summary of the book contents, since the contents are well-documented and reviewed by innumerable other reviewers (the book was initially published in 1945). At any rate, I found the book well-written, the material neatly couched &amp; contextualized into the era it occurred, and a conscientous effort given to both 'official' mormon history and 'unofficial' mormon history. In spite of one's religious beliefs, this book ought to be required reading for both the scholar of mormon history and the devout mormon churchgoer. Ultimately, this book should serve as a springboard for further investigation and research by BOTH earnest mormon scholars and pious mormons alike."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"As a Mormon, I expected to find myself offended by this book, but it simply wasn't the case. Granted, Brodie approaches Smith with the assumption that he was not a real prophet...but once you understand that, her true facination and, yes, admiration for the man comes through.On the downside, she does try to psychoanalyze Smith using 20th century standards, and loses much of her credibility in the process. On the other hand, though, I've never read a more riveting account of the Missouri period. This book gives a flavor for what a truly remarkable man Smith was...whether one believed his claims or not.My advice to Mormons is: Read this book if you truly have an open mind and can appreciate a non-believer's point of view. To non-Mormomns I'd say: Remember, this book doesn't tell the whole story.All authors on Mormon history approach the subject matter from preconceived notions of belief or unelief, and that orientation clouds whatever comes after. Contrary to other reviewers, my feeling is that a book of this kind will never help someone to understand whether a religion is genuine or not. Those decisions come from other places in one's mind...and heart."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Like Ben Franklin, Kit Carson, Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, Joseph Smith was incandescent in a uniquely American way. The church he founded is America's most successful home grown religion. A century and a half after Smith's murder by an Illinois mob, the Mormon Church flourishes, with over 12 million members worldwide. You don't have to believe he was divinely inspired - and Fawn Brodie clearly doesn't - to be impressed by his vision, energy, resilience, entrepreneurial skill and improvisational brilliance. Smith was undoubtedly a religious \\"genius\\" - William James' term for charismatic founders of new religious movements. This superb biography gives us the life in all its tumult and glory while skillfully refuting the larger than life myths it spawned.As Brodie shows, even as a semi-literate farm boy in upstate New York, Smith was a magnet for the social and theological currents whirling through 1820s America. His Book of Mormon, a mythic tale of warring tribes in the primordial American wilderness, drew upon magic, folklore, superstition, Masonic ritual, the old and new testaments of the Christian bible, racial prejudice against blacks and Indians, and the crude anthropology of his day. He grounded its authenticity in the Angel Moroni, who allegedly led him to the golden plates on which the book was inscribed in ancient hieroglyphics. He, Joseph, claimed only to be the messenger.Brodie has less interest in the mysteries of divine revelation than she does in the mysteries of human charisma. Smith's powerful voice, penetrating gaze and bluff, good-natured personality drew men and women from all walks of life into his orbit. His followers loved the man, according to Brodie, and saw in him the physical embodiment of their church. He was also shrewd enough to custom fit his religion to the character of his time, making Mormonism an ingenious meld of the secular and the spiritual. To a people eager for miracles, he proclaimed several. He gave Mormonism a patina of democracy, creating governing councils and making each member accountable for the overall health of the church. He also played on the willingness of Americans to see evidence of God's favor in the size of their bank balances. In Smith's religion, there was little friction between the good life on earth and the one that comes after.As the Mormons migrated west through Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, Smith updated his theology through periodic revelations from the Almighty. His most controversial revelation had to do with the taking of multiple wives. Interestingly, it wasn't the practice of polygamy that led to Mormon persecution during Smith's lifetime. Polygamy was too explosive for even Smith to sell to his followers, so he kept this revelation a secret outside his inner circle. The persecution the sect endured in Missouri and Illinois had to do with local fears that Smith's religious army would tip the balance of political power. That the prophet and his followers were cruelly persecuted, particularly in Missouri, is beyond dispute. By being tone deaf to their neighbors' concerns and by proclaiming themselves above secular authority, they created a decent portion of the resistance they encountered.At the time of his death in 1844, Smith was in the middle of a run for President of the United States. He was presiding over his church, the town of Nauvoo, a private military army, a vast financial and real estate empire, and a secret squadron of \\"fifty of so\\" wives. As he said in a sermon to his followers, \\"I don't blame anyone for not believing in my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I could not have believed it myself.\\"His was one of the most thrilling high wire acts ever seen in America. Brodie tells the life clearly, does an outstanding job of documenting her assertions, and gives credit where it's due. While not overlooking his tendency to claim divine justification for all too human urges, she has sympathy for the struggle he waged between \\"what he really was and what he most desperately wanted to be.\\" If you believe Smith had an actual pipeline to God, you'll probably see this book as a hatchet job. If you see him as a brilliant but flawed human being, you'll appreciate this balanced, clear-eyed biography."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Whether you believe Joseph Smith is a true prophet of God, a complete charlatan, or some mixture of the two does not change the fact that he is one of the most fascinating and underrated figures in American history. His life and the religion he founded say a lot about this country.This is the most famous (or infamous) biography of Joseph Smith. At the time of its publication it was a watershed event. No one with an 'outside' perspective had been given quite the access that Historian Fawn Brodie had.So after hearing all of the praise and condemnation heaped upon this book, what do I think? Pretty good, for the most part. Mrs. Brodie is a compelling storyteller. As a narrative, it has great flow and keeps your interest. From my perspective, the book's greatest strength is placing Joseph Smith's life within the context of the world views and cosmological theories prevalent in the United States in the early 19th Century. Some of Mrs. Brodie's sources ('Mormonism Unveiled' for example) have been largely discredited, so a careful reading is required, especially when considering the quotes of the some of the more vociferous opponents of Smith.Is Joseph Smith a true religious prophet or not? You definitely get the feeling that Mrs. Brodie does not think so, but even she is amazed at Joseph Smith's life and transformations.Historical books about religious figures are bound to be controversial. My advice would be read this book, as well as other about the life of Joseph Smith. But this book, although imperfect, is still an valuable and compelling part of the history of the history of Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is the second edition of Fawn M. Brodie's classic 1945 biography of the Mormon prophet Joseph Smith. Brodie is well-known for her other highly respected biographies on Thomas Jefferson, Richard Nixon, Sir Richard F. Burton, and Thaddeus Stevens. The book is a detailed dispassionate factual narration of Joseph Smith's life and the early days of the Mormon Church until his murder by a lynch mob at age 39 in 1844.While Brodie is careful not to disparage Joseph Smith, she presents him as a human with normal inclinations and faults, and Mormons might not like to think of him in this way. In fact, the Mormon Church excommunicated her because of this book. She writes that the \\"major original premises of this biography was that Joseph Smith's assumption of the role of a religious prophet was an evolutionary process, that he began as a bucolic scryer, using the primitive techniques of the folklore of magic common to his area, most of which he discarded as he evolved into a preacher-prophet.\\"Brodie offers evidence showing that Joseph Smith began his career offering to help gullible farmers find buried fortunes on their land. He originally intended to compose a fictional novel about buried treasures but then altered it into a true account of a revelation delivered to him on golden plates in a foreign language with tools to translate them. Brodie discusses the belief that much of this Book of Mormon was plagiarized from another person's novel. Joseph Smith claimed that he had his first vision of God and Jesus, who had human forms because God was once human, in 1820 when he was fourteen. Brodie shows that this dating is \\"sheer invention... he dictated at least three different descriptions of the \`first vision' between 1831 or 1832 and 1839, and these descriptions differ strikingly in detail.\\" The revelation states that American Indians descended from Israel's \\"Ten Lost Tribes\\" who sailed to America around 600 BCE. (Actually, the ten tribes were driven out of Israel in 722 BCE.)The Book of Mormon disparages all people of color, although Indians are better than blacks. Women are also belittled. Their role both in life and in the after-life is to care for their husbands. A wife cannot enter the after-life unless her husband allows her entry.Joseph Smith called his new religion Mormon saying that the word is Egyptian and means \\"good.\\" But he didn't know Egyptian. Brodie describes a trick pulled on him where he was told that a document apparently contained Egyptian writing, and he was asked to translate it. Smith didn't know that the person was an Egyptian scholar and gave a totally wrong imaginative translation. He later called his church the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.Shortly before his murder, Smith and some of his saints began to practice polygamy, while publically insisting that the practice was wrong. Brodie names and describes over forty women that he married. Over a dozen were married to other men and their husbands apparently knew nothing of the liaisons. These included five pairs of sisters and one mother and daughter. Some women whom he approached turned him down. His wife was opposed to polygamy and claimed that he never engaged in it. She married a non-Mormon after his death.Smith was charismatic and able to draw thousands of people to his new religion. Because of repeated vicious persecutions, he had to lead his saints to Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois. He was imprisoned for treason when the lynch mob stormed his jail cell and murdered him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"A nice fluffy series of reviews, but it's time to honor Ms. Brodie's excellent work and call a spade a spade. Joseph Smith was certainly a remarkable human being, but as anyone with a clear objective mind can see, he was a charlatan of the highest order. He made up a religion from whole cloth, or rather, from a patchwork quilt of what he had at hand. His \\"scriptures\\" had a resonance in his day, but his writings and his church derive from brazen and bold lies and fantasies, plain and simple.The Mormon church now consists of some millions who deeply believe that Joe Smith was a \\"prophet of God\\". They are convinced that the hilarious mish-mash of biblical, masonic, and early 19th century historical and world views that make up the sacred doctrines and rituals of their Church are a sufficient explanation for the wonder of life and human existence on this planet and in this universe.Don't misunderstand me, Smith's Church is no worse than any organized religion. But in this case (not unlike Scientology), too much has been documented for a rational mind not to expose it. Moreover, the well documented beginning, expansion, and solidification of Smith's church into the Fortune 400 economic powerhouse that it is today (faithful member must pay 10% of their pre-tax income)is extremely illuminating as to how all \\"great\\" religions get established."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I have an original copy of this book because my grandfather purchased one in 1945 in Salt Lake City, Utah. My grandfather told the family that in 1945 when the book was first published it appeared with great fanfare at the LDS book store, Deseret Book, in Salt Lake, which is still in existence.It was heavily advertised as a great work and a must read due to the fact that it was written by an LDS scholar, was well researched and of course was written by one of their own. Those in charge of the book store at the time apparently trusted that the book would be a great and positive write and did not review the contents of the book. It only took a very short time for the reports to flood into the book store concerning its contents, and just as quickly the book was removed from that particular book store.My grandfather, having left the LDS faith as did the rest of his once converted family, had to have a copy and bought it immediately from one of the many other non-LDS book sellers that quickly picked it up to sell. Another book purchased by my grandfather, Lights and Shadows of Mormonism, which is an interesting read, but is more of a one person perspective of life in early LDS Utah. Both books are fascinating reads for anyone wanting to research further information involved in the early LDS Church and early Utah in general."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The best things about Brodie's work:1)She is accurate. Even though it's been decades since this book has been out, it is still a widely-read text. She is a competent historian, which is a must if you want to learn about things as they reflect reality.2)She is readable. You can actually -enjoy- reading this one! It makes things much easier when a historian can write well, and Brodie does.3)She has a fascinating subject. Joseph Smith is one interesting fellow, as evidenced by the successful church that has sprung up in Utah. For some orthodox Mormons, reading this may even be quite adventuresome, as they learn about Smith from another perspective! I think everyone can read this and be intrigued by a complex person.If I have any complaint, it's that Brodie tries to psychoanalyze Smith too much. Obviously every biography is going to involve some speculation - unless you can actually interview the person yourself - but I thought she went too far at times in assuming she knew &quot;why&quot; Smith did certain things.Overall I highly recommend the book and I think it is still after all these years the best biography on Smith you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"A completely suspect read, this book's unqualified criticism becomes all the more clear when viewed in tandem with Miss Brodie's manufactured bio on Thomas Jefferson (&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;).For a critical rereading of this book, see &quot;Tinkling Cymbal and Sounding Brass,&quot; an excellent deconstruction by Hugh Nibley of Miss Brodie's methodology."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The autor clearly is a poor writer of history, she actually claims to know what the charactors are thinking.

She took actual events and then twisted them ever so slightly to add a negative bent to the event. How do I know this - I have spent the last two years in extensive research of Joseph Smith, Jr. I read dozens of books, diaries, letters and journals. Fawn Brodie's was by far, the worst one I read because she took a personal agenda and applied it to an historic subject. She should have stuck to the truth, not created quotes and sources, then she may have had a real book on Joseph Smith, Jr."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The author has a clear opinion about joseph smith. She seems to be trying to prove him to be a fruad from the beginning instead of being a true scholarly historian and simply examining the facts. Instead of a history you get an opinion."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"If you are looking for a one sided attack on the LDS Church this is the book for you. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has enemies both inside and outside of the Church who delight in tearing it down. While Fawn Brodie was a member of the Church when this book was written, that in no way should imply that this was a fair and accurate study. For various reasons there are a certain number of people who stay in the Church, even though they don't believe it is true any longer. There are also those who leave the Church but who can't leave it alone.Some... eager individuals... lecture the rest of us about Church doctrines in which they no longer believe. They criticize the use of Church resources to which they no longer contribute. They condescendingly seek to counsel the Brethren whom they no longer sustain. They leave the Church but they cannot leave the Church alone.-Neal Maxwell, Ensign, May 1996, 68.Lest you think I digress, I tell you these things to put this book into perspective. Miss. Brodie, an acknowleged agnostic, and many like her who are critical of the Church, write and love books like this which justify their apostate sympathies or actions. I suspect that is why there are so many favorable reviews of this book. Faithful Church members have no reason to want to read this book, which they know is filled with half truths and inuendo, so they don't come here to review it.Fawn Brodie pretends to know what was in the mind of Joseph Smith when he supposedly did what he did. This book comes closer to being a novel than an historical text. Her methodology was also terribly flawed. While at first glance it looks like her efforts have merit. All one has to do is look at her much discredited work on Thomas Jefferson (&quot;Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History&quot;) and compare it with this work to see the parallels.For a critical rereading of this book, see &quot;Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass,&quot; an excellent deconstruction by Hugh Nibley of Fawn Brodie's methodology."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is an example of an anti-mormon trying to write an historical account and remain sitting on the fence. This cannot be accomplished and Fawn Brodie failes. This is not the history of Joseph Smith the man or the prophet. The background resrearch is horrible and the commentary leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the reader. The only message I got from this book is that Fawn Brodie is bitter and cannot write without this bitterness coming out in here book. One of the worst biographies on Joseph Smith that I have read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"My entire life has included constant exposure to this attempt to capture,beat and bury poor old Joe Smith.She is a many decade favorite with those who like to throw rocks at all things LDS.Living in VA,in the shadow of Monticello,her horrible,discredited \\"biography\\"of our beloved Mr.Jefferson,should show the casual reader that her scholarship is extremely suspect.Reading her book is like going to a Harry Reid/Nancy Pelosi press party for ALL your info on the Bush administration.Her view of Smith is so twisted,so fabricated,so devoid of actual truth, as to make one wonder why anyone would care.But itching ears go for what fits their desires.Many desire to dismiss Smith as a charlatan,fake,fraud-Keep trying.Ain't gonna happen.In this bicentennial year of his birth,there has been a huge amount of scholarly research released,symposiums conducted,including one at the library of congress.The picture of Smith that emerges is one that paints a better portrait, that shows more of the depth of this giant on the American scene.His status as one of the most important figures in US history is undeniable.His influence in the US and,indeed,the entire world just grows.By their fruits,ye shall know them.The fruits of the life of Joseph Smith are sweet and welcome by those who know truth from gossip,something Ms.Brodie did NOT.The fact that most historians agree that he is the most important American religious figure ever produced, shows the futility of those who killed him,as well as those who continue to slander him."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Seeking to be primarily an exposition on Mormonism's founder, Joseph Smith, and his life, this biased and typically unscholarly work depicts the life of Joseph Smith as anything but prophet-like. Her twisted and oft times distorted view makes this book completely unreliable and, therefore, not quite the &quot;brilliant&quot; work some may suppose.At the time of its original publishing, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; was considered the best anti-Mormon literature around. Ms. Brodie attempted to disclose supposed &quot;secrets&quot; about Joseph Smith's life and whisked away any notion of a his prophetic calling. With deceit in her heart, she believed it was necessary to perhaps logically explaining every condition, circumstance and story with more believable worldly circumstances. She even used psychoanalysis as a justification of her distorted views. Just as science sometimes attempts to explain there is no God, Ms. Brodie wants to show there is no such thing as a modern-day prophet!I was significantly disheartened to hear from some that this book of blatant untruths is probably the best reading material on Joseph Smith around. Obviously, not too inept to study, ponder and pray, these multitudes of ignoramuses are too quick to judge and probably not willing to seriously study in-depth (and from different perspectives) the life of a man too great in personal stature and unique spirituality to be told all in one book. No one book completely encases nor sufficiently explains the sheer virtuosity and dynamic life of Joseph Smith.I hope that others may know Ms. Brodie's book is not the end-all-discussion authority on Joseph Smith, nor will it ever be. I would recommend other reading material, but this book by no means gives a proper perspective!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The author proves the title statement made by Smith and further extends it: No woman knows his history, either.

It did not seem that way to me. Brodie's tone seemed far more judicious and moderate than that of most critics, and her research extensive and thoughtfully sifted.If you expect a white horse, a zebra's dark stripes will surprise you, but if you look for a black horse, his white stripes will likely catch your eye. My impression of Joseph Smith was pretty negative, before reading this book, which may be why it seemed more positive to me than to many Mormon readers. I had noticed parallels between Smith and \\"religious revolutionaries\\" like Mohammed and Karl Marx; Brodie persuaded me though that unlike them, he was not a violent man by nature. I knew Smith manipulated women, and (like Mohammed) quoted God to justify hoarding them; Brodie showed that he also seemed to really care for his (first) wife, and defer to her at times. From the Book of Mormon, and one rather wild sermon, I got the impression that Smith completely lacked literary talent; Brodie again argued me wrong. (\\"Now he was developing into a preacher of uncommon talent.\\") All in all, while I still think him a scoundrel, Brodie forced me to modify my prior impression of Joseph Smith in a more positive direction.It is human nature to make excuses for successful tyrants: criticism of Marx or Mohammed usually draws the same ire as many reviews below display. Brodie is mildly affected by this weakness. Brodie tells of disreputable deeds, or quotes words that sound a bit mad, then follows with a paragraph that says in effect, \\"Boys will be boys,\\" insisting on (and arguing for) Smith's greatness despite such contrary evidence. But for her, the facts seem to come first; interpretation is kept distinct. All in all, she has written a fascinating, readable, and fairly believable work of historical narrative.And what a story she has to tell! If you doubt truth can be wilder than fiction, ponder this tale of the \\"peep stone\\" artist who invented a theology, founded cities, recreated polygamy and polytheism almost from scratch, wrote an alternate history of the Americas and persuaded twenty million people to believe it, and died in a shootout with a lynch mob, leaving dozens of grieving widows.While Brodie shows that Smith was not inherently violent, the story does confirm other commonalities that struck me when I studied Marxism, Islam, and the Tai Ping Rebellion in China. She describes Smith's theology as a \\"potpourri\\" of influences; true of the ideological genius of Mohammed and Marx as well. She relates the evolution of Smith's thinking on economic \\"communism.\\" Parallels between Smith's \\"revelations\\" about the use and control of women, and those of Mohammed and the Chinese visionary, Hong Xiuquan, also emerge. Lyman Wight's description of unbelievers as \\"devils, infernal hob-goblins, and ghosts\\" is also closely paralleled by the dehumanizing language of the Cultural Revolution and the Tai Ping movement.author, Jesus and the Religions of Man"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"First, let me say that I am a 'recovering Mormon.' This book helped me open my eyes and step into the light, and out of the darkness in which I was raised. The light of truth is invigorating and refreshing.... I think it must have been similar for people in the former Soviet Union when their blinders were finally pulled off, and they saw that they had been living... and believing in...the fiction that was the USSR and its banckrupt ideology/false history since they were children.And I'm sorry if it will offend believers, but Mormonism really is 'out there' on the fringe, if you will, with Wicca and Scientology. A close reading of this book and other non-apologetic works on the development of the church, as well on the character and personality of Joseph Smith, shows that the Mormon religion is essentially rooted in magic and the occult. There are many 'cult-like' activities and practices established within the church and among its adherents as well.No Man Knows My History by Fawn Brodie shows that the emperor (Joe Smith, the great American heretic and apostate) has no clothes. It's the one book Mormons don't want the rest of the world to read, because it conflicts with the official, sanitized, fictionalized version of Joseph Smith's life promulgated by the LDS church.It saddens me that so many unknowing Christians are drawn to the Mormon religion through its hyper-intensive missionary (marketing) tactics.... and it saddens me even more that the future of Christendom will be tainted and vitiated by the heresy of Joseph Smith.Hopefully Mormons will read it too.

On the already established credibility of Christianity, this guy invented his own religion out of thin air."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Let's play three blind men feeling different parts of an elephant. Said elephant is Fawn M. Brodie's biography of Mormon prophet-founder Joseph Smith, Jr., NO MAN KNOWS MY HISTORY. Some readers gravitate to Smith's optimistic vision of a human nature capable of infinite perfectibility; others gnash their teeth over Fawn Brodie's reading Smith's mind, somewhat as Smith allegedly read Egyptian texts at the bottom of his hat. For my part, I am fascinated by the biography's following passage:\\"... [T]he book is one of the earliest examples of frontier fiction, the first long Yankee narrative that owes nothing to English literary fashions. Except for the borrowings from the King James Bible, its sources are absolutely American ... nothing can detract from the fact that many people have found it convincing history.\\" (Chapter V).American frontier fiction? I thought that that flowed from New England narratives of Indian wars and Cotton Mather's sermons on the wilderness as the seat of all evil. I thought world-class American frontier fiction came of age with Indian-sympathizer James Fenimore Cooper and characters in THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, WYANDOTTE and THE WEPT OF WISH-TON-WISH.Fiction? Prophecy? Truth? Whatever the BOOK OF MORMON, THE BOOK OF ABRAHAM and other Smith writings are, they are products of a powerful, assimilative imagination. Smith was only 38 when he died violently in 1844. His formal education had largely ended when he left New England for New York as a boy with his family. But he had a hugely retentive memory and read widely. He had sensitive antennae for what bothered the frontier people around him. One contemporary observer said that Old Joe Smith exemplified every major truth and error agitating New York in a particular decade.One such national and frontier preoccupation was with American Indians. Their high mysterious mounds were being ransacked. And buried Spanish treasure was thought to be everywhere. Writers, one actually got it right, were theorizing that Indians had come to North America from somewhere else, from Israel -- or from across the Bering Straits. Joseph Smith picked these ideas up, along with notions in the air about healthy eating and drinking, living in communities, plural wives, Masonic rituals, etc. and wove them into his various writings and translations.Smith sent early missionaries westward into Indian Territory with the \\"good news\\" revealed to him by God about their pre-history, which they should find religiously, culturally and politically liberating. What strikes me is that Joseph Smith liked and admired Indians at a time when all too few other Americans did. His were the years of Georgians grabbing Cherokee land after gold was discovered on it. This was the era of Andrew Jackson and the Indians' \\"Trail of Tears.\\" These were also the years of war, uprooting or trouble for Creeks, Choctaws, Seminoles and other \\"redskins\\" -- years in which another writer of the frontier, James Fenimore Cooper, wrote religion-flavored frontier fiction and clearly loved and admired American Indians. Not many Americans had anything good to say about those \\"merciless savages.\\"So I say three cheers for that fun-loving wrestler Old Joe Smith and dour, serious, at times ponderous James Fenimore Cooper! If there had been a million more articulate Americans who were pro-Indian, then America today might be a more just nation. -OOO-"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"One theme that emerges from reading the reviews of this book on Amazon.com is that almost all of the non-Mormons appreciated the book and thought it was worth a read. Most, if not all, of the reviews by Mormons were scathing reviews of both the book and Ms. Brodie's personal character. This is no doubt because the author writes of Joseph Smith's life, the gold-mongering, the rampant polygamy (justified by a revelation-of course), and the other very human desires and actions of Joseph Smith factually and without bias. If an unbiased look into the life of Joseph Smith is what you're looking for, then this book is for you. If you wish to believe that the character of Joseph Smith is unmarred by greed, power-mongering, murder and adultery, then you should stick to LDS-sanctioned biographies; since this bio will leave the honest reader seeing Joseph Smith as, very much, just a man; who, although full of charisma, charm and vision, certainly lacked in honor."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"To say this book is a riviting account of an outlandish American character is an understatement. Brodie's work is still the standard by which all other biographies of Smith must be measured. Having unparalled access to LDS archives gave Brodie a leg up on all other biographers (other than official LDS &quot;historians&quot; assigned the task of whitewashing the life of their church's founder). Since this work no one has been allowed the access to official LDS records which Brodie enjoyed because of her pedigree as the descendant of an LDS President. Brodie's writing style is professional and interesting. I will fault her with speculating on the feelings and thoughts of Joseph Smith's mother at the time of his birth (1st edition). Other than that Brodie does an excellent job of sticking to the facts and setting forth the character of Joseph Smith more thouroughly than any historian before or since. History has proven Brodie right and her critics wrong concerning controversies on some of her writings. This book is the type of tour de force one expects from a University of Chicago scholar, which Brodie is. If only all biographies were this well researched and written. LDS apologists will not like this book because it presents the shaddy side of Smith (conviction for disorderly conduct, what we would today describe as fraud, his illegal banking scam in Ohio, having affairs with married women and then latter coming up with the doctrine of poligamy)and the politically maniacal side of Smith (organizing a 6,000 member malitia and terrorizing his non-Morman neighbors by marching around the county, attacking and destroying private property because a newspaper pointed out the facts of his doings in the church and city). Brodie is fair and points out the positive aspects of Smith as well. Smith's great intelligence and familiarity with the King James Translation of the Holy Bible is very evident from this biography. The problems with the official LDS account of the discovery and translation of the book of Mormon become evident because of Brodie's thourough handling of this area of Smith's life. If you only read one book on Mormanism or Joseph Smith in our life, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is a classic, and is generally recognized as such. The topic, which is the life of Joseph Smith, found its ideal author in Fawn Brodie, a Mormon who was on the verge of excommunication and who as about as sympathetic to Smith as an honest historian could be. One is tempted to say that Smith is presented, warts and all. But it would be more helpful to say that Smith is presented, virtues and all, because a man who concocts what purports to be holy scripture, who fakes divine revelation, who organizes three Waco-type compounds, who institutes militias and secret societies to kill his enemies, who decrees polygamy to satify the lusts of himself and his male colleagues, who orders the destruction of his enemies and who lies about most of these things probably has more warts than virtues.Brodie wrestles constantly with the issue of how a man of such limited education and rather obvious fraudulent intent could attract thousands of dedicated followers. It is no wonder that Brodie in her later works became so attracted to psycho-history. She advances a rather attractive hypothesis which suggests how Smith could have deluded himself into believing his own nonsense: Since all our thoughts are the product of previous states of mind, and since these states include all the factors which go into our perceptions, concepts and mental \\"programs\\", there is no essential difference between our control over our waking thoughts and our control over our dreams, reveries, and other semi-conscious states. We just think there is, because the illusion of control is part of the nature of the mental state we call \\"consciousness.\\" If that is so, then it can be argued that a \\"revelation\\" which derives from our past state of mind is no more originated by our own will than the conscious perception that we are being visited by the angel Moroni.Of course, this line of thought comes dangerously close to solipsism, and solipsism comes dangerously close to autotheism (if there is nothing else in the universe but oneself, then everything there is must be an extension of oneself, and hence one must be God). Toward the end of his life, Smith's megalomania was indeed headed in this direction.Brodie does a wonderful job describing how Charismatic Smith must have been. To have persuaded people of real intelligence and ability like Brigham Young and his own wife Emma into believing and supporting him throughout his career, and to have, as she puts it, \\"Caused men to see visions\\" is no mean feat. And to have created a religion which, for all its faults, is far more admirable than its own founder bespeaks one of the most fascinating characters in American history. Everyone interested in religion, psychology, and American History should read this book."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I read and enjoyed this book. This book is worth reading although it must certainly read with a grain of salt and a critical mind. It contains historical fact frequently mixed with the author's own opinions and interpretations. The author promotes the sponge theory of the Book of Mormon- simply that Joseph Smith absorbed what was in the air and squeezed it and out came The Book of Mormon. To me this seems a bit far- fetched. If this is true, then The Book of Mormon has been one of the most successful hoaxes in the history of the world. The author does provide some interesting and detailed information about Joseph Smith and his polygamous activities in Nauvoo- information that the average Mormon probably does not know about and would probably find quite disturbing if they did. The current policy of the LDS church is to basically ignore parts of church history which are not faith inspiring. LDS church members are fed a very edited version of the history of Joseph Smith which is specifically intended to be faith inspiring. The average Mormon also probably does not know about Joseph's campaign for President of the United States. This book can help you to know who Joseph Smith really was although it must be read with a critical mind like I said before."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" is a brilliantly researched history of the life of Mormonism's Prophet, the charismatic and gifted Joseph Smith. As a nonbeliever, myself, I approach almost everything from a secular level, as does Brodie, therefore I'm bound to agree with her approach, recognizing, at the same time, that some of her sources are questionable, in that they are derived from people who hated Josph and/or his strange religion.Brodie seeks to understand the young Joseph growing up in hard-scrabble Vermont and Western New York. We see a talented, ambitious and highly imaginative young dreamer trapped amongst largely uneducated people who were both superstitious and, oftentimes, painfully gullible. Young Joseph, who isn't enamored with farming, is fascinated by Indian mounds and treasure finding. He finds a stone thru which he claims can divine the location of hidden treasure. He is persuasive enough [alternatively, people are so gullible] that he makes a modest living from selling his talents although there is no evidence that he, or anyone else, was ever enriched by them. As a matter of fact, he is successfully sued by one angry man who regards himself as cheated.Over a period of time, and unlike Mormon preachments, Joseph morphs into something like a religious mystic. He claims he has found a 'Golden Bible' although the circumstances of finding it are initially vague. The Golden Bible has some interesting characteristics. Smith generally keeps it--whatever it is--hidden in a box or under cloth. It seems that few people can visualize it, except himself, although--according to witnesses--it has weight and heft. Also, despite the fact that others can't see it, Joseph reports hiding it from place to place so that it won't be stolen for its golden value.Using magical implements, including stones, Joseph 'translates' his golden plates into the document later known as the Book of Mormon. Joseph's tale of visions of angels, God and Jesus seem to have, for the most part, post-dated the translation of the gold. The nature of these visions, the number of angels, personages etc. seems to have morphed over time.Joseph is now well on his way to becoming a prophet and world-shaker. He gains increasing number of adherents. The question is, 'how much of this does Joseph believe, himself?' We'll probably never know but, I suspect that over time and with increasing adulation, that he comes to believe that he is the true instrument of God's Power on earth. Like most powerful men, women flock to him as bees do to honey. He has additional 'revelations' including the desireability of faithful men taking multiple wives. This revelation has the force of a commandment and Joseph, without the apparent consent or even knowledge of his wife, Emma, takes on multiple women as religious wives.The newly-founded sect finds it persecuted for its communistic and polygamist practices. They are forced to move, almost en masse, from one place to another, until founding the city of Nauvoo, Illinois on the banks of the Mississippi. The city is successful, perhaps too much so. Joseph sets himself up as General of the militia and orders the destruction of a printing press that has criticized him. He is arrested by secular authorities and, while imprisoned in the upper floor of a jailhouse, he and his brother, Hyram, are shot to death by an anti-Mormon mob. Joseph is dead but a martyr is born.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Yes, buy and read this book. You can see from the reviews that it is controversial. Reading controversial literature generally makes people more well rounded.The controversy doesn't revolve around the merits of the book. Any book that touches a religious theme has the same source of antagonism. A large number of people reading the history of Joseph Smith are doing so to ask the question: Was Smith truly the divine relevator of God or was he a charlatan?Such controversies are always mysteries.Accurate historical and scientific research has a wreckless history of messing with beliefs based on revelation. Look at the job that Copernicus did on the Catholic Church with his little diagrams suggesting the earth was round.Ms. Brodie was a faithful member of the LDS Church who changed her mind on this issue while doing her historical research. Yes, she is an apostate. She brings to the surface many of the facts that led to her conclusions.Of course, it should be noted that she is researching in a field where others have done twisting of facts to cast Smith as a living saint.Over all, it appears to be an extremely well researched work in a field where all of the research is questionable in nature. If you are interested in LDS or Utah history, I would strongly recommend the book.If your are wanting to read the accepted version of Joseph Smith's life, I would recommend reading The Work and The Glory by Gerald Lund.If you enjoy learning, I would pick up Brodie's book, it is far more interesting."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is the most comprehensive, factual book about Joseph Smith's life to date. The author backs up every statement with references on where the information was obtained and how the research was acquired. Very objective and educational."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I wish that Amazon had a way to search for books that get rated as zero or one star AND five stars by various readers! I am sure that the resulting list would consist of wonderful, challenging, interesting books. This is such a book. Joseph Smith was one of the most interesting and, in the end, important Americans of the Nineteenth century. Sadly, his followers today are offended by much of what Joseph Smith, the man, was. Fawn Brodie tells this story faithfully and well. Attacks on the author's methodology notwithstanding, this is a great and truthful biography, which gives insight into the man, his age and the American soul. It should be read open-mindedly by anyone who wishes insight into the forces that shape the American mind."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Teaming with documentation! Library of Congress, Court documents, letters, diaries, even the the Mormon's own church history books (with certain phrases selectively removed, of course). How can any Mormon deny that they don't know ALL the truth about their own religion after reading this book! If you truly believe in the Mormon church you should be willing to read this book. After all, the &quot;Glory of God is Intelligence,&quot; right?"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This work will spark either extreme -- because Mormons are taught to view Brodie as the antichrist (I know -- i grew up as a mormon and left the church in adulthood). But Brodie also began the book as a devout mormon, and had access to the intimate holdings of the church before its wave of antihistorical paranoia set in about the time of her book! As an historian, I also see some flaws in her attribution and other methodological issues that historians can disagree with. But the picture she paints of the life of Joseph smith is fascinating, thought provoking and the book is a must-have for anyone interested in the subject."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"In this exhaustive biography of America's most controversial religious leader, Fawn Brodie goes all out to tell the tale of the embattled Mormon Church founder. Her status within the LDS church gave her unmatched access to historical documentation, which she also follows up tirelessly matching various newspapers and court records of the time to paint an unflinching portrait of the finer and weaker points of Joseph Smith. I dont believe I have ever read a more thoroughly footnoted biography. Whether you are a true believer and think Joseph Smith was a martyr, on the opposite end of the spectrum and think he was a gifted bilker, or anywhere in between, if you want to know the story of Joseph without Church bias, this is your guide."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Very insightful and eye opening into the origins of the Mormon church.

One could simply focus on validating her sources (many have been locked away in the archives by the LDS Church, some are becoming increasingly harder to find due to time and nothing else) to develop a deep understanding of Mormonism and it's remarkable founder - as well as late 19th Century America.In fact one could simply follow Brodies bibliographical and end note trail to become a leading Mormon Studies Scholar or expert on Joseph Smith, Jr.Read it first, or read it last, but this work can't be avoided if you are even remotely interested in Early Mormon History."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"A well documented book about a very controversial subject.

I feel that she was fair to her subject and appreciative of his strengths and abilities as a religious leader, even if not, perhaps, an actual prophet of God."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The first line of Brodie's 1945 biography of Joseph Smith (1805-1844) alludes to the New England in which the prophet was born in 1805. Raised in Vermont to dirt poor farmers he and the family moved to Palmyra New York. His poor schoolteacher father and mother were odd. They enjoyed hunting for buried treasure! From an early age Joseph enjoyed dreaming and fantasizing schemes regarding the finding of treasure and empire.It was in Palmyra that Joseph Smith claimed the angel Moroni appeared to him bearing huge golden plates covered in Egyptian script. The revelation he received was published as the Book of Mormon in 1830.Brodie who was raised in an LSD home but later renounced the religion claims that Smith actually wrote the Book of Mormon. He used Masonic and mystery religion cultic language mixed in with huge portions of the Bible. The book claims that Jesus Christ came to America; the North American Indians are descendants of the ten lost tribes of Israel and the Nephites lost to the Laminites in an apocalyptic battle on the North American continent. The Book of Mormon became a bestseller with thousands of converts to Mormonism in the United States and abroad.Smith was always involved in numerous law suits dealing with everything from bank fraud, polygamous charges, disorderly conduct and treason to the state.Smith married many wives (Brodie says we don't know the exact number but he probably had over 50 spouses). He was interested in land speculation, banking and military affairs. In 1844 he ran for President of the United States. Smith died as a mob shot him down in Carthage, Illinois along with his brother Hyrum in June 1844. The Mormon Church officially renounced polygamy in 1890 in an effort to qualify for U.S. statehood and keep peace with the faith's many vocal and hostile critics.Charlatan or great religion leader? He was probably a mixture of both elements. Smith had a massive ego, brooked no opposition and was an authority figure to thousands of early Mormons. He fought with factions within his church as well as state and local officials. He was anti-black but held the American Indians in high regard. Smith could be friendly, jovial and forgiving but he could also be harsh, judgmental, jealous and bellicose. He was poorly educated but made schooling an important belief in the Mormon faith lexicon. Smith and his followers enjoyed secret and elaborate rituals in their various temples.Whatever your beliefs might be this will nevertheless be a book of interest to anyone seeking to know more about the Mormons, Smith, nineteenth century American history and religious persecution.Smith's dream of an empire in Kirtland Ohio and Nauvoo Illinois failed but his successor Brigham Young led the Mormons on a trek to a glorious future in Salt Lake City Utah. Joseph Smith was an American original who is deserving of study and reflection."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Sorry folks but you can't use the Ensign as a quotable source. It's called argument from authority. (My God is right also, so were does that leave us?). It's not accepted in accepted discussions. Also standing behind Nibley as an unofficial spokesman for your church instead of the policy makers in the western Vatican isn't kosher. Maybe you can get Nibley to show the genetic connection between the American Indians and the Israelites which is the main theme of the Joe's book anyway. (Mormon supercession ). The Mormons themselves can't even with the new genetics department at BYU. Even with the largest and most costly archeological expedition launched anywhere to Central America the efforts have been unable to substantiate his contention. Brodie, an often-overlooked fact, was a professor at one of the better universities that study folklore and cults. Her book is not only well written, but historically accurate, by way of research and not just genealogical connections. But why stop here. Read \\"Joseph Smith and the Orgins of The Book of Mormon\\", by David Persuitte. \\"By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus\\", by Charles M. Larson is a must. Both of these validate Brodies claims. The question for me is much simpler however. I just want to know where the horses came from, and the elephants, and the steel, and the wheels, and the silk."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"When Fawn Brodies book was first published it appeared to finally be a scholarly work on the prophet Joseph Smith. Although she did discredited some of the stories sensational stories about Joseph Smith, her book suffers from two major flaws.1. She tends to ignore information and resources that don't support her preconceived ideas.2. The book reads more like a novel than a true history. She knows more about what Joseph is thinking than any biographer can know. This criticism was dismissed by her supporters, but when she used the same technique on a biography of Thomas Jefferson, then those who knew better were strong in their denunciation of her work"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Joseph Smith is probably the best-documented &quot;prophet&quot; of all time, and this book traces his career in highly illuminating detail.But first, let me try to get one question out of the way. That question is: &quot;Did Joseph Smith REALLY receive a divine revelation which he set down in the Book of Mormon?&quot; If your answer to that question is &quot;Yes,&quot; then you get to explain how the Native Americans were the Lost Tribes of Israel! This is, of course, impossible to do, since the Native Americans are now known to be of Asian origin -- through studies of linguistics and DNA. And that's one of the big problems with the &quot;Book of Mormon&quot; -- its claims are so specific that they are actually falsifiable (unlike e.g. the generalities and moralizing found in the Koran).That question set aside (hopefully), this biography documents with meticulous detail Smith's exact sources for his holy forgery, including Ethan Smith's &quot;View of the Hebrews&quot; and the contemporary political uproars over Freemasonry.This view of the Native Americans may have seemed plausible in the 1820's, but why would anyone follow Joseph Smith, whose previous line of work was divining and gold-digging? The only answer seems to be: this is embedded in human nature. There are a lot of people out there who have a need to believe, and they flit from one cult to another, never for a moment imagining that they could have an independent life outside of a cult.The story of Joseph Smith is also the story of Muhammad. In just the same way, an uneducated man &quot;received&quot; a divine book and created a whole new religion. And the adherents of that religion argue that it must be true because &quot;so many&quot; people believe in it. Well, there are 3 million Mormons. :-)This is also the story of what I have seen in my own lifetime: the Hare Krishnas (still going in Australia, by the way), the Moonies, the Rajneeshies, the Branch Davidians, and -- most recently -- the Islamic suicide cults led by the likes of Osama Bin Laden. (Not to mention Jonestown, or those weirdos in Rancho Santa Fe who committed mass suicide over the arrival of a comet.) In every case, we find a leader who fits the &quot;imposter&quot; psychological pattern, and who has the charisma to attract followers, associated with a group of &quot;believers&quot; who apparently have no standard of truth whatever, but rush around looking for imposters to follow. (Oh, I forgot Scientology, Mme Blavatsky, and Gurdjieff.)Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Written from a very factual point - no punches held, but not overly critical and judgmental on Mrs. Brodie's part."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"All my life, I have know quite a bit about the Mormons and their ways BUT I never really knew much about Joseph Smith. This is a problem when a person is trying to understand a cult since a cult is defined by it's leader as well as it's followers. This book really shines the light on who this man was, looking at him from many diffrent angles, from his Con artist days convincing people to give him money in exchange for helping the land owner find gold all the way to the last days of his life where he had angered almost everyone in the state. This is really a book everyone should read, as it really looks at what some people call a prophet. (My feeling, I know some don't aggre with my view)It is a real look at Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Wow! Great book that has stood the test of time. I can understand why Mormons don't really care for Ms. Brodie. Ouch! She exposes Joseph Smith for what he was....a delusional con artist. Mr. Smith had quite an imagination and was an exceptionaly creative man. Unfortunately, he got a little carried away and started thinking he was a prophet, king and general.I know, I know..... Brigham Young had nothing to do with the massacre at Mountain Meadows, there IS such a language as 'reformed Egyptian', and there REALLY were golden tablets buried in some hill. If you believe in Santa Claus you probably won't like this book."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book should be required reading in American History courses. It lucidly and coherently explains the rise of the cult of mormonism and spares no expense in trying to hide its occult beginnings, Joseph Smith's megalomania, polygamy, bizarre temple rituals, racism, and all of the other nonsense found in the beginnings of this non-Christian religion. Surprisingly, the author refused to kowtow to the whims of the cult when she wrote this masterpiece; one that clearly exposed the brazen hypocrisy behind its basic tenets.One can't but wonder why any thinking human being wouldn't be swayed from joining (or remaining in) the cult after reading this dazzling biography that so eloquently details Smith's flagrant charlatanism and barefaced deceit as he gazed through seer stones, created stars (such as Kolob) where gods have celestial whoopee, \\"revelations\\" designed to pray upon the feeble minds of his followers, secret holy underwear (still worn by cult members), and a whole plethora of other nonsense.Of course, the cult also can't stand the fact that this book is remarkably well-documented and researched. This masterpiece has already withstood the test of time (originally written during the 1940's) and for good reason: it provides a solid foundation upon which all other studies on the cult must not ignore."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"There are few biographies of merit regarding Joseph Smith. It seems difficult for biographers to be neutral on him. Although the author genuinely attempts to be unbiased, she often takes facts from his life and comes up with a negative interpretation of his actions: much the way a church member would take the same events and come up with a positive interpretation.The book is very readable and there is factual information in the book that is difficult to find in other places. These are the highlights of this biography.The downside is the author's unintentional slant against Joseph which leads to many assumptions that may or may not be accurate.In sum, to better understand the life of Joseph Smith this would be a good book to read, but the reader should certainly get more than this one view point before making any firm judgements."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I found this book to be greatly informative and interesting. Great book!No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie once confided with a close friend and fellow author prior to completing this work: \\"More and more I am coming to believe that the great biography of Joseph Smith will be a fictionalized one. There is plenty of evidence to write a book without fictionalizing, but to bring to life the man's inner character, to display all the facets of his infinitely complex character, requires I think the novelist's perception rather than the historians digging\\".This biography does indeed read like a novel which presents Smith's life as a marvellous adventure of a man living life to the fullest, and yet deceiving thousands (and possibly himself). It is obvious that Brodie has performed many years of extensive research in producing this material. Unfortunately her content, while based on genuine historical documents, is completely biased in the way it attempts to portray Joseph Smith's life.The book presents Smith as a man intent on deceiving the world, and Brodie attempts to focus each event as being a calculated decision to further that intent. She uses both well known and also not so well known sources, but does so selectively in a way to support her viewpoint. As a result, she often omits equally valid sources and material that would counter her personal belief. She highlights each \\"mistake\\" Smith makes and attempts to identify the motive that drove him to do the things he did. This bias is her major downfall as a historian - a role I believe which should be focused on documenting historical facts, not personal supposition.Fortunately, about halfway through the book, when Smith's \\"revelations\\" settle down to only a few in his final ten years of life, the author's agenda also settles down somewhat and the second half makes for a captivating, not so agenda driven, account.On a positive note, this book contains a fair amount of material not found in other accounts, and for me personally, that makes it worth the time to read it. It covers from his birth right through to his murder with significant details of his life in between.Whether Joseph Smith was or was not what he claimed to be, can never be \\"proven\\", as there are logical arguments on his life's history that support or discredit whatever it is you want to believe. If you are looking for arguments to support he was not what he claimed to be, you will absolutely love this book.In summary, I found this book to be an easy read and a classic work on the life of Joseph Smith, with portions that cannot be easily dismissed or ignored. Brodie has produced a pioneering and thorough biography on a man you'll either love or come to despise. Just don't let the author's personal beliefs influence your own opinion on who Joseph Smith was (or was not). The answer won't be found from reading one un-objective account.N.B. For the record, I believe this statement is just as true for \\"pro\\" Smith authors like Bushman and many others.Edit: Three days after writing this review I completed readingReconsidering No Man Knows My History(see my review). It contains an essay by Newell G. Bringhurst that included comments, better voiced than my own. One of Brodie's contemporaries reviewed her work upon publication (in 1945) by stating that she quotes \\"copiously . . . from books by embittered apostates\\" asserting that \\"now and then she appears to state as undisputable facts what can only be regarded as conjectures supported by doubtful evidence.\\" That her book was \\"almost more a novel than a biography because she rarely hesitates to give the content of a mind or to explain motives which at best can only be surmised.\\" That same reviewer ended their review with \\"It is nevertheless a probing and very satisfying volume.\\"(p.49)"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Is the real author Peter Dimock or Fawn Brodie?

Previous reviewers have listed other debunking sources. I used to lump anti-Mormon literature into three categories: outright lies, half-truths and truths made to look foolish.

I have read many reviews of this great book calling it tripe and that it is a rag written by a someone with an axe to grind. Sorry, but if you read, REALLY read this book, then you will see that it was not put together on a whim and that it was footnoted and researched to the nth degree. The only reason that this book gets negative reviews is that the people reading it giving those reviews do not WANT to accept the truth and want to keep their minds closed. I have not seen one valid argument from an opponent of this book other than to say it is trash and is full of lies and half-truths. Well, back those statements up with facts as Ms. Brodie has done in her wonderful book. I recommend this book wholeheartedly to people wishing to know the truth about the birth of Mormonism. Don't take my word for it though, read it through and make your own judgement, but I think you will see that at a a time when America was gullible and open to new religions, Joseph Smith took advantage of that and preyed on the minds of those people and many an individual, myself included, have been lured into it since that time."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is a good book for anyone looking for a historical understanding of Joseph Smith.

I got exactly that. It wasn't a real page turner though. In fact, I had to force myself to continue reading it about half way through.Mrs Brodie seems to have done a lot of research and presents it pretty well. There were a couple of instances where I thought she was reaching a bit, but she indicated herself that these instances were only theories, or possibilites, so in that regard I have to give her a lot of credit. These instances were also very trivial matters, in my opinion. The more substantial claims, such as the \\"translation\\" of the plates, and the polygamy can be verified through LDS sources, and are much more damaging to the church's credibility than this book could ever be.In fairness, I attempted to read \\"No Ma'am, that's not history\\" by Hugh Nibley. I say \\"attempted\\", because like most apologists, Mr Nibley seems to dance around issues rather than addressing them directly. I got tired of waiting for him to make a point and quit reading.In conclusion, if you want to learn about Joseph Smith, and read a very credible explaination for the circumstances regarding the foundation of the LDS church, read this book."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is considered anti-mormon by many but reading it I didn't feel that way.

Ms. Brodie also manages to make it a very interesting book, in spite of the fact that there are more names and dates contained in it than any average history book. (Proof, I suppose, of the author's exhaustive research.) The book is not completely objective; it takes the viewpoint of the skeptic investigating the Mormon Church (she even includes quotes by Mark Twain regarding the Mormons!)

Now that my life is changed, and with the eyes of a writer, a re-read of this material gives me new appreciation and respect for Fawn Brodie's genius and courage.

She is a very talented writer with the ability to share historical facts and still be gripping.I sense from some LDS responses that there appears to be a level of doubt relating to the truthfulness of her text.In looking at the evidence, the foundation of the LDS church risks being likened to one built upon sand whereby, the floods will come, and the winds will blow, and will beat upon that house, and it will fall, and great will be the fall of it. Sand would represent contradiction in \\"scripture\\" and historical cover up of events, practices and documentation.Truth will be the ultimate test for Joseph's work.Fawn's research appears to be in line with truth, and she was very faithful to carefully include resource information and excellent documentation. Her coverage of Joseph's multiple wives proved to be very eye opening for me.

Hoff"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This was my first (and so far, only) foray into what the LDS would label \\"Anti-Mormon\\" literature. Brodie has done some good research into the life of the founder of the LDS church.It also describes an early LDS church that was quite charismatic - certainly different from the gerontocracy that governs the church today.Although this book does specifically refer to accounts that are damning to Joseph Smith, I did not find this book to be a total character assassination of him. The book portrays a very human person in what the LDS believe to be a true prophet. I particularly find warming such accounts as Joseph caring for babies that he and Emma agreed to take care of or coming short of promising to cure an ailing infant during the many blessings he gave when the church was first established. Even Brodie's assertion that Smith was writing the Book of Mormon to try to save his family's farm provides the reader with an even-handed explanation of his character. The book of course stops short of extolling him as a great prophet who restored \\"God's kingdom on earth\\", and that's what I imagine does not sit well with the LDS faithful."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This is a very well written book, which accounts for some of its considerable impact. Readers should know, however, that it was written from a profoundly naturalistic perspective. Some, of course, will love that. Others, however, will (or should) find it troubling. It's amusing, for instance, to see some of the apparent evangelical Christians below praising the book. They don't seem to realize that Mrs. Brodie's attitude toward their beliefs would have been essentially the same as her attitude toward the beliefs she herself had rejected. She was an outspoken agnostic or atheist. The other fundamental flaw of this book is its practice of psychohistory -- the same technique that she used in her approaches to Thaddeus Stevens, Richard Nixon, Sir Richard Burton, and, rather disastrously, to Thomas Jefferson. In the cases of Smith, Stevens, Nixon, and Burton, Mrs. Brodie was dealing with marginal, unfashionable, or even unpopular characters, who had no influential constituency to defend them. When she took on Mr. Jefferson, however, many scholars (my personal favorite is Garry Wills) came down on her like the proverbial ton of bricks. The methodological flaws that they identified in her Jefferson book were precisely those that her earlier critics had noted in her earlier books -- when nobody was willing to listen. Final verdict: Well written, worth a read, not to be trusted as the final word. Nor anything close thereunto."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie's book is a MUST-READ for those interested in Mormonism. She provides information about Joseph Smith that the Mormon Church doesn't want you to know."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Have you noticed who hates this book? Why do you suppose that is? Those in the Church will naturally rail against Brodie's sources and facts--if that's possible. How do you rail against someone who cited everything she has written? Say nothing for the fact that it's a little difficult to get your hands on things written 200 years ago. However, the FACTS are (and you may not like them), but Fawn Brodie left no stone unturned. She listed everything that we have to document the life of Joseph Smith, so any unsuspecting Mormon inquirer could form his/her own conclusions. Fawn Brodie has written a wonderfully detailed book that capitvates the reader. She cites every single source, including those from the LDS church itself. Perhaps Mormons would prefer the kind of History one can find in the \\"Book of Mormon\\" or the \\"History of Mormon Church,\\" published by the LDS Church. But if you're interested in ALL the facts, not just the ones that the LDS Church wants you to know, read this book. And more importantly, if you're thinking of joining the LDS Church, I beg you, please, READ THIS BOOK first."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Ms Brodie's book is an important book to read if someone is wanting to understand mormonism and its founder Joseph Smith. Her scholarship is fair and balanced. With her access to the LDS church's archives,(her uncle was one of church's &quot;prophets&quot; ) she was given and invaluable look into that church's history .The substanciated information and details she gives in her book is something that the church prefers that its membership not know about.If someone is truly and objectively looking at the LDS church, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot; is one book that is a must read as they consider what the LDS church has to offer."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"It's not often that a book's first few paragraphs confirm its vaunted reputation, but Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" is one of those works whose greatness is obvious from the very first page. With tight, artistic prose, and the masterful use of evocative, archaic American words- gazetteer, midwives, scryers, schoolmasters- she transports us, almost as involuntarily as Joseph Smith's powers made the faithful see his visions, to a distant setting, to the beginning of our story in old New England. The cast of characters are not, however, made up of those stern Pilgrims or Revolutionary icons in powdered wigs so familiar from shorthand history, but of a different and lesser known people- those sturdy Anglo-Saxon farmers, from whom Joseph Smith descended, who cleared the western forests and, in the freedom of their isolation, discarded time-honored religious orthodoxies and made their own terms with God. Some became skeptics and rationalists. Some practiced magic, dreamed dreams and lost themselves in the delirium of ecstatic Christianity. Some, like Joseph Smith, went completely beyond the boundary walls of the imagination and birthed entirely new cosmologies on the American frontier. Surpassing all other such homegrown seers, gurus, and shamans, in the breadth, beauty, and continuing vitality of his universe, Joseph Smith is the apotheosis of the American mythmaker, in a country that practically breeds them. In Fawn Brodie's classic biography, we are treated to the authoritative study of the man whom I regard as perhaps the most fascinating character in American history. If, as some impartial scholars estimate, his church might claim over 200 million adherents by the end of the century, he may well be regarded as America's most influential figure as well.As excellent as the prose is, as previously mentioned, it is matched only by the author's research. Being the first non-LDS biography of Joseph Smith (although as an ex-Mormon, the author had a natural understanding of the more recondite LDS concepts and controversies), this book is no regurgitation or compilation of other authors' works. Mrs. Brodie blazed a trail through a mountain of diaries, letters, newspapers and public records to paint an original biographical portrait of beating, breathing vitality. Scholarly, scientific and painstakingly thorough, I can't conceive that very many details were missed. You will know the facts of Joseph Smith's life to the last available jot and tittle, and gain some understanding of his mind to the extent that it is possible to extrapolate theories from the evidence.I don't know Mrs. Brodie's religious beliefs, besides the fact that she was an ex-Mormon, but never for a moment in this biography does she give the slightest credence to Joseph Smith's supernatural experiences. That's not to say, as some online sources have, that she is necessarily \\"secular\\" or \\"atheistic.\\" Even the most credulous theist must dismiss Joseph Smith's claims after examining the weight of evidence. The contradictions and absurdities of his Scriptures and prophecies are just too overwhelmingly damning. However, it's hard to resist some speculation, psychological and historical. Was Joseph Smith a complete fraud? After all, his own friend testified that Smith admitted to him that his story about the golden plates started out as a prank on his family. Did he start to really believe his own story (as Mrs. Brodie conjectures) or was Smith fully aware that his revelation was a pure imposture from the beginning to the end?Or, to be even more provoking, is it possible that Joseph Smith actually did experience \\"something\\" on that hill in New York? Demonic influence or even possession can't be discounted, especially considering Smith's youthful necromantic experimentation. If one wishes to be completely rationalist, we can still wonder whether he might have found \\"something\\" on Cumorah Hill. Mrs. Brodie briefly muses that he could have found a bronze (I think) breastplate, as such artifacts were not unheard of in the region. What if he did find some sort of engraving? Surely not the Book of Mormon, but some tangible artifact around which he chose to weave an imaginative and profitable story, rather than submit it to the prosaic interpretations of linguists and scholars? After all, the evidence for a pre-Columbian European presence in North America, from Washington to Minnesota to New England, is too numerous and compelling to ignore. Eight witnesses testified that they had seen the golden plates, not in a state of \\"entrancement\\" as had the Three Witnesses, but in reality. Did Joseph Smith show them some Viking carving or Irish engraving? It's a fact that even though most of the witnesses broke with the Mormon church, they never denied the existence of the golden plates. On the other hand, John Bennett testified that Smith asked him to go to New York City and have golden plates secretly made so that they could be exhibited for profit. What accounted for all the visions and supernatural experiences of people close to Joseph Smith? Was the Prophet an expert on the effects of psychedelic mushrooms, as is common with shamans? Did he use them himself or surreptitiously have his friends ingest them? Or did he merely possess an unnaturally strong power of hypnotism? Or was the whole thing a moneymaking conspiracy? None of these explanations can be ruled out.One criticism I have is the author's rejection of the Spalding-Rigdon theory, which posits that the Book of Mormon was plagiarized in part from an earlier work of fiction. I agree with Mrs. Brodie that, based on the chronology, Rigdon probably had no part in it. However, I disagree that Spalding's influence should be ruled out. Let's not forget that it was the people of Conneaut, OH who approached Philastus Hurlbut with their suspicions and rather specific memories, not the other way around. Also, the discovery of the \\"Manuscript Story\\" is irrelevant; the Conneaut witnesses specified that the story they heard Spalding read was entitled \\"Manuscript Found\\" and contained many distinctive parallels with the Book of Mormon that just couldn't be a mere coincidence, such as the unique names of the protagonists Nephi and Lehi and other uncanny similarities in names and incidents. We don't know how Joseph Smith got a hold of Spalding's manuscript, but I think we can be sure that he did. It's also likely that \\"Manuscript Found\\" is lost forever, as there was probably no more than 1 existing copy of Spalding's handwritten novel, and Joseph Smith would surely have destroyed the evidence of his plagiarism.To sum up an overlong review, never mind the condemnation of religiously-motivated critics. This is a masterpiece of biography. This book is a necessary component of any education about Mormonism."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book, now nearly 60 years old, remains the definitive source on Joseph Smith and serves as a key source for more recent works, notably John Krakauer's \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\". The book provides a remarkably tangible portrait of Smith, from his early days in Vermont and New York through the growth of his church and his murder in Carthage. A fascinating character, Brodie's Smith is a far more human and fallible character than the sanitized version in official LDS histories (the LDS church has offered pointed rebuttals to this work). Brodie's work remains definitive in large part because official church records and documents are off-limits to unofficial (read: non-LDS-sanctioned) historians.For a 60 year old biograhpy, \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" reads beautifully, a testament to the author's superior writing. This, as is noted by a reviewer on the book jacket, is an outstanding example of the biographer's art.Anyone who has an interest in the world's fastest growing church should read Brodie's book."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"If you want the best biography ever written on Smith,this is the one.No punches pulled or apologies.And it is readable,is it ever you'll have trouble putting it down cause it reads like a novel,not like a choppy biography,and even better the story is true.Smith comes off as a circus barker promoting the greatest show on earth,that is \\"his own\\".Brodie mentions strongly that with Smith's family's penchant for seeking treasures in the earth,quests for lost pirate's gold,divinig, etc. the book of Mormon may have been an attempt to create a bestseller in colonial times. Hence the Book of Mormon may have been a cult classic that became so big people believed it to be true.This is not entirely unplausable seeing that Poe was able to manufacture a ballon travel hoax at the same time that the general public believed to be true. This is not to mention Orson Welles \\"War of the Worlds\\" hoax which so many people initially believed it was a scandal.Brodie has written a classic and it was written 50 years ago.i particularly liked the picture of the Canopic Jars used by the Egyptians for storing mummified organs.According to Smith's telepathic interpretation these jars are representations of biblical beings.No mention of organs.Caught red-handed in a speculation presented as a pronounced truth.And this is just a surface observation,Brodie goes alot deeper and even more probing..Then every other page as the book progresses later on someone is being denounced who 3 pages earlier was proclaimed a saint.(How can this be)?The big draw for Smiths followers as i see it from reading this book was free land and a fresh start in the American west for working paupers of old Europe and the new world.Security and family first. Theology? well maybe later.By the way I was turned on to this book by an Amazon reader!I read the new Bushman book but it was too sanitized and when there are only a limited number of primary sources available any omissions can present a completely different portrait in a biography.Then instead of reading a bio,you get a source book,and that's a bottomless pit.If you can only read one book on Smith,read this because it is a genuine attempt to portray the whole Smith family from people who lived with them.There are some good pictures of Joe's kids by his multiple wives and on some of them,the baby face of Smith is so obvious that a DNA test would be superfluous.I would like to see more info in a biography about Smith regarding the Great Awakening period in American History(1830's),apparently religious fervency was heightened by an expectancy of the \\"final times\\".Stump speakers and prophets were a dime a dozen,rising and disappearing equally as fast just like the 1980's in the USA.I get the feeling it must have been amusing hearing those preachers barking their condemnations with the animation of a circus carney.Smith was THE MASTER,pulling off his own Greatest Show on Earth,complete with a book and an organization, still intact when he was assasinated.After reading Brodie you would have to conclude that Smith was either a prophet or a sophisticated,calculating,charlottan,who may have slighty miscalculated in regard to himself, but he couldn't be both.But Brodie never answers the why of Smith's subterfugic polygamy.The most simplest answer:so the others don't find out-at least until they're already captured.The true caliph's collection --how ego flattering."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Brodie is very fair to Joseph Smith and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It's a real and amazing look on how Smith became the prophet and seer of his own church."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"This book is the very first book to take a detailed look at the life of Joseph Smith. It is ground breaking and it revolutionized the way Mormons study their history. Unfortunately it is a deeply flawed work and there are now many far better works. Instead, I would recommend the book \\"Rough Stone Rolling\\" by Richard Lyman Bushman which has been described by numerous (non-Mormon) critics as the best or the definitive biography of Joseph Smith.Meanwhile, \\"No Man Knows My History\\" has flaws in the following specific areas:1. Sources and Research2. Methodology3. ObjectivityI will discuss each one of these problems, but only in summary fashion, since most people do not want to read a big long report here on line.RESEARCH AND SOURCE CRITIQUESThere is no doubt that Fawn Brodie wrote a detailed blockbuster of a book. She researched very hard and because her uncle was a leader of the LDS Church she was given access to very private records. It was the first book about Joseph Smith to be so carefully researched. The depth of the footnotes makes the book large and impressive. Unfortunately not all of this research is honest.Almost immediately after the book was published, a brief response to it was also published. Hugh Nibley, a famous Mormon apologist wrote it and in that critique he gave many instances where her research was simply not as it appeared. She intentionally misquoted her sources and ignored statements from sources that did not agree with her theories but then used those same sources when they did agree. And of the book's popularity he said, \\"Having been presented to the world as a work of literature Mrs. Brodie's biography of Joseph Smith enjoyed with its reviewers the license of creative writing (which it was) and an indulgence that would never have been accorded it had those reviewers been historians and not literary men.\\" (You can read his full critique at http[...]) He meant, of course, that the reviewers who praised the book did not have a grasp of the true history or historical methods; they enjoyed its writing style, which Nibley admitted was good.Another problem with her sources is that although she had access to a wide variety of sources, she relied most heavily upon sources that were enemies of Joseph Smith. While no historian should reasonably disregard an enemy's perspectives, they should not give them undue credit. To paraphrase Art Linkletter \\"Enemies wills say the darndest things!\\". One of those few historians that Nibley said should review the book was Vardis Fisher. Even Dale Morgan, Brody's good friend and virtual co-author agreed that Vardis was one of the three most competent men to discuss Mormon History (Dale being one of the other two). But when Vardis reviewed the book he found it flawed because it relied almost exclusively on the statements of apostates and enemies. (Vardis' review greatly distressed Brodie at the time).METHODOLOGY CRITIQUESIn the 20th century a new process for conducting history was developed that goes by the name of psychohistory or psychobiography. This is a process that is supposed to use psychological insights to understand the motives of historical figures. I am not sure that it is possible to read the minds and motives of living people around us, much less people who are dead, so I have some problems with this whole notion anyway. But even if you accept this concept as valid, Brodie has problems. She was only in her 20's when she wrote this book; hardly an age with great and deep experiences from which to inform a \\"psychological\\" imagining of what Joseph Smith was thinking. This shows in her writing, where, not finding enough to work with in psychological speculation, she just removes the psychology and goes right into shear speculation and fantasy with theoretical ideas. But this is where her writing skill combined with selective sources helps move the book along. She simply *asserts* things as true that cannot be known or worse... are known to be untrue! So she just out and out says things like this without any substantiation at all:o Dream images came easy to this youth (She states but has no knowledge)o He was immune to religious influence of any sort (She imagines, but contradicts herself later)o He did not have the inner turmoil that preceded the spiritual fervor of so many great religious figures of the past. (She reads the minds of both Joseph Smith and other unnamed Religious leaders here)o The Book of Mormon must have been a source of secret worry (Yet he never indicated it was)o He knew that (Emma) thought him a coward. (How on earth did he know that - it probably was not true -- and how does Brodie know?)o Mormon ritual doubtless had its roots in the same unconscious drives that led the prophet to polygamy, (note the word \\"doubtless\\". She affirms something but it is absolutely unsupported.)She also writes her history by insinuations that are her way of letting her imagined events get told. For example, tells a story of an attempt by Joseph Smith to walk on the water. She admits the story is not true and was never told by any Mormon or Joseph Smith but still, though it is false, she says \\"Baseless though this story may be, it is none the less symbolic\\" The reader is told that though no justification exists for believing the story, Joseph Smith must always have been doing silly things like that, and that makes it \\"symbolic.\\" She does that sort of thing a great deal, often quoting stories that even she admits are false or untrustworthy but then using them to draw conclusions. In another example she quotes a bitter enemy of Joseph Smith, and draws conclusions from those statements about Joseph Smith's character, but she admits that her source is an \\"unreliable witness to say the least\\". It is perhaps reasonable at this point to mention that Brodie herself said that she \\"always wanted to write a book of fiction\\" and \\"More and more I am coming to realize that the great biography of Joseph Smith will be a fictionalized one.... To bring to life the mans inner character, to display all the facets of his infinitely complex nature, requires I think the novelists perception rather than the historian's digging.\\"When she wrote her biography of Joseph Smith, she was plowing relatively virgin territory. Not even very many Mormons were familiar with that history, so if she said something, it was taken as truth. But with her book on Thomas Jefferson, she ventured forth into territory where hundreds of recognized scholars already knew a great deal. And her technique of psychobiography was roundly criticized:Michael Kammen who was actually a friend said that she was: \\"a historical gossip incapable of distinguishing between cause and effect.\\"T. Harry Williams said that Fawn Brodie had \\"badly set back the calling of psychobiography.\\"The most biting and accurate critique was from Gary Wills: \\"Two vast things, each wondrous in itself, combine to make this book a prodigy --- the author's industry, and her ignorance. One can only be so intricately wrong by deep study and long effort, enough to make Ms. Brodie the fasting hermit and very saint of ignorance. The result has an eerie perfection, as if all the world's greatest builders had agreed to rear, with infinite skill, the world's ugliest building.\\"OBJECTIVITY CRITIQUESPsychobiography requires a degree of objectivity. But Fawn Brodie admitted many times that she was far from objective. Her writing of this book was not the work of the ordinary historian, writing about an historical figure. It was instead an act of rebellion (she called it liberating) on her part. She admitted that she wrote the book looking for ways to prove that Joseph Smith was a bad person and to destroy the beliefs of the Mormons. Here are some quotes:\\"Writing the biography of Joseph Smith was a *desperate effort* to come to terms with my childhood.\\" (emphasis is mine)\\"I was convinced before I ever began writing the book that Joseph Smith was not a true prophet.\\"\\"I was angered at the obvious nature of the fraud in his writing of the Book of Mormon; I felt that the revelations all came out of the needs of the moment and had nothing to do with God. \\"\\"Just as the autobiographical novel serves many other writers, (writing the biography) has been a kind of catharsis (for me).\\"\\"I am trying to make a move against (the Church)\\" (said about an earlier effort before the book was written).She said that Joseph Smith \\"Did not deserve\\" his good reputation. Later, when writing another biography of a person who had been badly treated by history, she made an overt attempt to historically rehabilitate him (another obvious example of her bias leading her history) and she said that she was doing \\"a total about face\\" vs what she had done to Joseph Smith.Thus we see that Fawn Brodie created a work with a goal. That goal was to be as negative about her subject as she could be. And so she selectively uses sources. And she allowed her imagination to run away with her and then called this research. An historian does not have to believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet, but a good historian will suspend personal beliefs and work for accuracy. Fawn failed to do that. It was too emotional for her.SUMMARYIt is a deeply flawed book, but it has been extraordinarily valuable. Brodie's efforts caused a great many Mormons to re-examine the history of their Church and Faith. This has led to greater openness and honesty and a greater level of true and accurate research in the origins of their beliefs. Even though Brodie;s work is flawed, it had a good influence. Because it is so flawed as a history it would get zero stars. But because it is influential and it is a fairly good read, it gets 3 stars.Incidentally, to understand at least some of the root causes for Brodie's slanted view of Joseph Smith, the following incident may be helpful.M Wilford Poulson, a psychology professor at BYU had studied the secret coded writings of J.J. Strang, a rather unusual character, He was a renegade Mormon who who crowned himself King of Beaver Island in Michigan and was shot and killed by his followers. Fawn Brodie knew Poulson well and was interested in his research. From this research Brodie read about Strangs dictatorial and licentious ways. At this time, Brodie applied Strang's attitudes to Joseph Smith. So, in some ways, the biography of Joseph Smith is a conflation of the historical Joseph Smith and the imagined Shadow of JJ Strang cast upon Joseph Smith."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I am only 70% through reading this book and I would like to say that I already learned a lot of details about the background in which the Mormon religion was invented and modified over the years by Joseph Smith.

He also loved life. He loved women. He was not a conventional prophet.Brody's book will take you through all this. I believe the journey was as long for her as for Smith. Read the Epilogue. This sums up her understanding of the man and his fantasy - how the fantasy evolved and how it was absorbed into his life and became a reality.An amazing book about an amazing man.

If she were writing today, however, Brodie's book would be twice as long because so much new information has come to light--especially about Joseph Smith's involvement in magic. See D. Michael Quinn's massively documented, yet very readable, \\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World View.\\"Early Mormonism and the Magic World ViewLike Brodie, Quinn was excommunicated for telling the truth about Joseph Smith.You know that Fawn Brodie has come a long way when even Mormons can praise it. In \\"Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism,\\" the distinguished Mormon historian Richard Bushman wrote:\\"As notable for its journalistic brilliance as for its scholarship, \`No Man Knows My History' presented Riley's arguments and findings in a form more palatable to twentieth-century tastes\\" (p. 191).The critics of Brodie have also failed. In \\"Critiquing the Critics,\\" Haart Wixom (p. 120-121) writes the following about an article Brodie quoted from the \\"St. Louis Bulletin\\" about Martha Brotherton who left polygamy. It \\"appears Brodie made up at least part, if not all, of the Brotherton story. Whether she knowingly gave a wrong reference or not, it is nevertheless bogus.\\"Just previously, Wixom condescendingly refers to Brodie as \\"the woman,\\" and he denies that the newspaper even existed. It does exist.Actually the name of the newspaper is the \\"American Bulletin,\\" published in St. Louis--a minor error on Brodie's part, and one that I discovered in two minutes of research on the Internet.The article describes the methods used at Nauvoo by early Mormons, including Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, to get young women to marry them (Smith married a daughter and then her mother--Patty and Silvia Sessions; Young two sisters).In another case, Wixom erroneously writes: \\"She (Brodie) says Joseph probably got his idea for a higher priesthood from a book written by James Gray, giving no title or footnotes\\" (p. 177). On the contrary, Gray's book is footnoted on page 111 of Brodie's book. Nevertheless, this is an odd criticism for Wixom to make because he doesn't mention the title of Gray's book. The title is easy to find. Just google \\"James Gray, Melchesedec.\\"Brodie wrote: \\"It seems likely that Joseph that Joseph concept of duel priesthood came directly from James Gray's \`Dissertation on the Coincidence between the Priesthoods of Jesus Christ and Melchisedec' (Philadelphia, 1810). Her comment is reasonable: it does seem \\"likely.\\" The title of Gray's book will catch the eye of anyone familiar with Mormonism.My criticism would be that Brodie could have made a stronger case by putting the name of Gray's book in the text rather than in a footnote. She also could have quoted from Gray's 121 page pamphlet-book. In just an hour of reading, an intelligent person would have a complete scriptural justification for the Melchisedec priesthood in a church--not just an idea for the Melchisedec priesthood, but detailed justification.I would say this in criticism of Brodie. She completely dismisses the Spalding theory. While I believe that Brodie is correct in saying that Joseph Smith composed the Book of Mormon himself, the similarities of the plot elements in \\"Manuscript Found\\" are troubling. They insure that Solomon Spalding's ghost will never rest.It seems possible that Joseph Smith could have heard about Spalding's story without actually having seen it. Thus, it could have had an influence on Joseph Smith.Nevertheless, here are the plot elements of \\"Manuscript Found\\" compared to those of the Book of Mormon (plot elements never listed by Mormon writers for fear of opening a can of worms--Brodie did not list them either).In about 1812, the Reverend Solomon Spalding wrote a novel about two races in ancient America. Spalding lived in Connecut, Ohio, less than 200 miles from Palmyra (on the Great Lake's trade route, so traveler could have told Joseph Smith about Spalding's story).Spalding described an ancient American civilization in as much detail as is found in the Book of Mormon (1830). Spalding even read passages of his novel to his congregation (thus insuring that it was spread far and wide).So we have two stories, each purporting to be a history, and each featuring a \\"translator,\\" who finds an ancient account of a lost white American civilization.In each story, the civilization is described in detail, including its laws, religion, priests, money system, tools, animals, agricultural products, as well as a magical seer stone possessed by its prophets. Letters are exchanged between leaders (the Book of Mormon has \\"epistles\\"), \\"Censors\\" are the rulers (\\"Judges\\" in the Book of Mormon), and lists of generals are given for armies of tens of thousands.The dead from great battles are heaped up in mounds (false explanations for the orderly Indian burial mounds of real history). In both works, the white race has continuous wars with a darker-skinned race, but hundreds of years of peace are established by a great teacher (\\"Bosaka\\" in \\"Manuscript Found\\" and Christ in the Book of Mormon).This extraordinarily long period of peace ends in a battle near a hill. In this last battle in which the white race is exterminated, there is an incident in which a man is beheaded in a sword fight.Each account also claims that the ancient Americans possessed the modern knowledge that the earth rotates around the sun, rather than vise verse. Both stories feature an item of technology consistent with the 1800s, rather than thousands of years ago. The Book of Mormon has submarines; the American Robert Fulton built his famous Nautilus in 1800; Spalding's story has a hot-air balloon (note the famous French balloon flights of the 1780s). These hot technologies of the day were story elements of the newly-born American literature. Spalding and Smith were perhaps the first American writers to include them in a novel.There are other coincidences. The world's first reconstructed mammoth skeleton, \\"the ninth wonder of the world,\\" went on display in Philadelphia in 1802, and coincidentally \\"elephants\\" are found in the Book of Mormon (1830) and \\"mamoons\\" in \\"Manuscript Found\\" (1812).One would think that the plot elements of the two stories would at least be discussed by Mormon writers out to disprove the Spalding Theory. But no, they shift the focus to how did Joseph Smith come to read Spalding's manuscript? Some critics said that the link between the stories was Syndey Rigdon, the first major convert to Mormonism. Rigdon had lived in Pittsburg and was known at the printshop where Spalding sent his manuscript.Although I believe that Joseph Smith was the author of the Book of Mormon, the \\"Pittsburgh coincidence\\" has never set well with me. Like a detective investigating an unsolved murder, the possibility that Smith in some way borrowed from Spalding story will never be laid to rest.Curiously, one Mormon writer in criticising the Spalding Theory said there are \\"no complex Chiasms appear in MS (Manuscript Found).\\" See \\"Refuting the Critics: Evidences of the Book of Mormon's Authenticity,\\" by Michael Griffith, p. 81. Griffith's statement is an admission that \\"chiamus\\" (parallelisms in Hebrew poetry) were around in 1812. They have been pointed out by proponents of the Spalding Theory. See my review of \\"By the Hand of Mormon,\\" by Terryl L. Givens. Click here:By the Hand of Mormon: The American Scripture that Launched a New World ReligionRobert Silverberg in the \\"Mound Builders: The Archaeology of a Myth\\" is dispassionate about these similarities of plot elements to those of the Book of Mormon. \\"Neutral observers,\\" he writes, \\"generally suggest the possibility that both works drew their inspiration from the fund of Mound Builder legends then in circulation, leaving aside the question of possible borrowing by Smith from Spaulding\\" (p. 96).Silverberg's book is a must-read for anyone interested in the world of Joseph Smith and the great Mound Builder myth.

It is meticulously researched with footnotes and references to help you validate every statement the author makes about Joseph Smith. I was surprised at how much I learned, so much that I had never heard from LDS approved sources before."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I wasnt sure what to expect with Fawn McKay Brodie being a close relative of a former LDS Church President. However, I must say it was a fascinating read and also well-documented. The heavy footnotes are essential in a book of this nature as the Mormons are notorious for having a selective history. An excellent book from someone who experienced the religion first hand."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"If there had been no Fawn Brodie, Mormons would probably have had to invent her. Ever since she published \\"No Man Knows My History: The Life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet\\" in 1945, calling into serious question most of the faith claims based on Mormonism's early history, an enormous amount of energy has been expended by Mormon historians, apologists, and critics of all backgrounds and persuasions either to defend or to deny her conclusions. The themes explored by Mormon historians since that time have often responded to Brodie's analysis.When Brodie published \\"No Man Knows My History\\" in 1945, she analyzed Mormonism's founder using the standards of secular scholarship. She interpreted him as a charlatan at first motivated by self-serving desires but gradually coming to believe in his own prophetic mission. She also acknowledged his very real accomplishments in forming an important religious movement in the United States. In many ways it was a seminal study that served as a transition point between what has been inaccurately called the old and the new Mormon history, the \\"old\\" generally viewed as polemical while the \\"new\\" was considered less concerned with questions of religious truth and more interested in understanding why events unfolded as they did. It is a measure of the success of her biography of Smith that it is still considered more than fifty years later the standard work on the subject and the starting point for all analyses of Mormonism. A second edition of this book, published in 1971, revised some of her earlier conclusions, especially her contention that Smith had been a charlatan, and incorporated recent trends from psychohistory to explain him more as a self-deluded imposter.Brodie, perhaps intentionally, dealt a damaging blow to many of the Mormon foundational beliefs when she questioned most of the basic assumptions about Mormon origins in her biography of Joseph Smith. In \\"No Man Knows My History\\" she systematically dealt with five basic issues that have challenged Mormon historians ever since. One of the most important was Joseph Smith's \\"First Vision,\\" for which she emphatically denied that there was any valid evidence until Smith fabricated it in 1838 when he began dictating his history to provide a starting point for his prophetic career that would counter charges that he was involved in treasure seeking. A second was the whole issue of treasure seeking itself and its relationship both to Smith and Mormon origins. Third, Brodie questioned the origins and content of the Book of Mormon, asserting that it was a product of Joseph Smith's vivid imagination and not an actual history of any group of people who came to America. Fourth, she explored in depth the origins of plural marriage and the duplicity Smith registered in originating it to justify what she thought was his licentious nature. Finally, Brodie interpreted Smith as a would-be tyrant seeking to take over some or all of the territory of the United States to create his own theocratic state with himself in charge.She provides an in depth analysis of each of these themes in her biography of Smith, and those perspectives still hold a powerful sway over Mormon historiography. One cannot begin to understand the development of the Mormon religion without grappling with the issues raised by Fawn Brodie."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I don't know how any knowledgeable, educated person can read this book and not conclude that Joseph Smith was a fraud who pulled off a whopper of a scam. I've never read a more thoroughly researched, documented and footnoted book. I'm a former Mormon who found this book to be an eye-opener."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"As a non-Morman living in Utah, I am often confronted with Mormon rhetoric. One hears propoganda about the religion and, without the knowledge base, one can't help but believe what many Mormons are so earnest about...their religion. However, after reading Brodie's book, I am now armed with questions, facts and details that refute what Mormon's are raised to believe. What I can't understand is how so many Mormon's refuse to read this factual, well-documented history of the man they basically worship? If they don't buy into Brodie's actual words, why don't they dig through the references she readily supplies? I am so intrigued that a man of such proposterous ethics can create such a following? And, how can so many truly intelligent Mormons not question the integrity of this man and this religion? This book is very, very insightful."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Like all good history, this book's chief aim is simply to provide the evidence as best as it can while leaving readers to their own conclusions.To the over twenty million Mormon faithful, Brodie readily concedes that Joseph Smith gave birth to a religion that now spans the globe, spreading word of its good news.And to the \\"gentile\\" non Mormons, this book asks by its history the very pointed question of how such a religion could have come to be and survived its not inconsiderable obstacles were it not ordained of God.For my part, all the history relating to Joseph Smith's all too human frailities...his 1826 conviction for disorderly conduct (essentially a fraud charge), his sometimes contradictory revelations from above and of course his documented plural marriages...do not cast him and his movement in a light less than other religions but rather reminiscent of them.In rallying against those who would do violence to Mormons I was reminded of Old Testament vitriol against nonbelievers. In practicing (if not necessarily espousing) plural marriage I was reminded of course of that other prophet Mohammed. And of course, with with reference to its historical tendency to bring all too Earthly suffering to those for whom it sought to give eternal deliverance, I was reminded of all religion.While Brodie's book for its part enigmatically refuses to answer that ultimate question of the verite of Joseph Smith's prophetic status, a careful reading of it does suggest perhaps his limitations are one with all religion.And as long as our celestial witnesses are human, we will be left seeing that great eternity through only the limitations of their refracted mortal gaze."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"The last US Presidential elections came and went. President Obama won a re-election, the Republican contender, Mitt Romney, lost. Mitt is a Mormon and this would be one of the books he could have banned if he were the President. This book reveals the true story behind the man who created American's biggest corporate cult that poses as a \\"religion\\", successfully usurped an entire US state, and whose members have no qualms investing in vice to enrich themselves.This classic biography of the insane founder of Mormonism takes you behind the scenes of a disturbed man, who spent his time dabbling in the dark with peep stones, communication with ghosts and spirits who led him to treasures. The founding of a new American religion grew out of Mr. Smith's wild imaginations and charismatic personality, so prevalent in Protestantism.Mormonism is just another off-shoot of Protestantism, holding the same principles, and changing them as the times see fit. Their self-declared prophets talk like elementary school children, with absolutely no depth in theological knowledge. Then again, what can you expect from a Prot by-product that creates a god out of their fantasies. Oh, do remember to contribute at least 10% of your monthly income to your local \\"church\\", no wait, Mormons don't have a church, they've a stake house that doesn't even display a decent cross in sight!Now, how many wives can I now legally have if I were a reformed or fundamentalist Mormon? Once upon a time, Mormon men could marry multiple women, they changed that view not because they received a coded message from God, but because their cult wanted to survive for another generation and had to play by decent moral codes of conduct. Once upon a time, Mormons were totally racists, accepting only blue eyed blondes (and some brunettes), now they just had to change that Nazi \\"theology\\" so that they can swindle more money from non-Americans to enlarge their Utah corporation. So very Protestant in nature!When Mormons can't give a logical explanation to their \\"theology\\", worldview and history, they resort to FEELINGS as a vindication of their \\"truth\\". What a form of Prot escapism, often seen in Prot cults and sects. They can't think or reason in a coherent fashion and when they can't answer questions, always resort to violence or feelings as proof of their \\"truths\\".How can 14+ MILLION adherents of Mormonism be do DUMB as to believe in a cult whose founder founded his new religion on personal lusts for women, ghostly spectres and a mishmash of Protestantism? Jim Jones of the People's Temple was just as crazy and he had over 900 followers. Protestantism is just like diarrhea, is it, each one of these sects and cults read the same bible and yet speak of wild gods that lead them into different directions of \\"truth\\"."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"A very well documented account, and cronologicaly written. This follows Joseph Smith from his very beginning, his dabbling in mystasism,to an elaborate frabricated \\"Revalation\\" of avisit from the angel Moroni, and his finding the golden books of Mormon.The book can get a bit over detailed at times, and the reading becomes tedious, but very enlightening. Avery good read."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"In my humble opinion, Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows my History\\" is an absolute tour de force. I read the entire book in 4 days..I don't know if \\"read\\" is the correct word, but shall I say \\"consumed\\"!If Joseph Smith's \\"The Book of Mormon\\", and his subsequent revelations, are based upon Mr. Smith's dreams, visions, treasure hunts and edicts - coming directly to Mr. Smith from the all mighty Lord no less; then I will argue that Fawn Brodie's \\"No Man Knows my History\\" is based upon the exact opposite. Ms. Brodie's work is instead clearly based upon reason, logic, meticulous research, clear documentation and a comprehensive understanding of historical context in which Mr. Smith lived...it is truly a magnificent piece of scholarship.To me, \\"No Man\\" is to non-Mormons (and those interesting in understanding the origins of Mormonism), what the \\"Book of Mormons\\" is the practicing Mormons...If the only true good that comes of the Book of Mormon is that it allowed for such a wonderful piece of research to be written, then Joseph Smith's life was indeed not a farce...However, given that Fawn Brodie was a Mormon, I have to question if present day practicing Mormons are worshiping their true Prophet..."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"While it was an interesting read, though to be fair quite negative of the Mormons, further research into her sources reveals that she does appear to pull some of them out of thin air. Some of the sources simply do not exist that I can find. A few are quoted accurately. Others are quoted out of context or misquoted entirely. Some are second-hand accounts from people who felt slighted or were disgruntled. Such accounts do not make for very objective research.I did read Hugh Nibley's rebuttal, and while it is somewhat polemical, it does answer ms. Brodies half-hearted effort to discredit the Mormon church, which she belonged to as a child. While some Mormon practices do seem weird, they are no less peculiar than those of any other faith, such as Islam or even Reformed Presbyterianism.What strikes me most is the virtual absence of any positive information about the Mormons founder Joseph Smith other than a token \\"he meant well.\\" Despite her access to official Mormon archives, ms. Brodie failed to bring out any original material from the single most authoritative source. The Mormons have spent tens of thousands acquiring documents, some true and some discredited forgeries, regarding their history, and have perhaps the most complete history of any church, so far as original documentation is concerned.When reviewing this book, don't simply look at the fact that she cites everything, look into those citations to ensure that they really are accurate, and that they truly exist.If you are looking to educate yourself about the Mormons, use a balanced approach. Read material from both sides, preferrably that which is written from an objective point of view. I would also recommend reading from Hugh Nibley's extensive writings (particularly \\"Tinkling Bells and Sounding Brass\\") if you are interested in Mormon theology. While it is geared for the Mormon believer, it can offer valuable insights to the Mormon church.Don't take this book at face value."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I read this book because of it's notoriety. With both staunch Mormons and anti-Mormons screaming bloody murder at each other over this (as can be seen in previous reviews), I knew there was something to discover. What I found, however, was extremely disappointing.I read this book thinking it was history--it's not. That thought was quickly dispelled from the start when I read, with no small degree of wonder, just how much Brodie claims to have known from inside the mind of Joseph Smith. Where true history relates the event, Brodie touches upon it and then proceeds to tell why Smith did it, what he was feeling, and just what he hoped to accomplish by it. What's even more disturbing, she has the arrogance to present her wild speculations as facts.Whether or not you believe that Smith was a prophet, Brodie's story is too much. Does she really believe that he could have dictated the entire Book of Mormon, without stopping or revising, and in the sentence structure in which it now appears, and do it so fluently that those writing for him did not know he was just making it up as he went along? That's fine if you don't believe in the veracity of the Book of Mormon, but at least come up with a more plausible story than that one. By making this allegation, she attributes to Smith a literary talent above most any other person in history. Who else can write a 500 page book that lasts over 150 years without revision?Of course, those who see Smith as a fraud anyway will see this as a wonderful standard under which to rally. But those of us who seek real history, without the zeal of religion (or anti-religion) will be utterly disgusted by the author's blatant negligence of sources. Many quickly praise that she has \\"done her homework\\", and, upon scanning the bibliography, it appears she has. Upon closer examination, however, it is easy to see that the bibliography does little more than take up space.The majority of her allegations, as well as the inferences she draws, have no source. They are either not documented, or simply products of Brodie's imagination. When she does give a source, it is many times the testimony or work of a bitter enemy of Smith which, though such testimonies may be useful, should not compose the bulk of the work. As for her other sources (Church History, newspapers, etc.), they leave much to be desired.As I was reading, I was so shocked by some of her claims that I checked up on some of her sources. What I found was a great example of document-splicing. In many cases she manipulated her sources to an almost unrecognizable extent, often insinuating things the author clearly did not intend. Sometimes, she misquoted the source altogether. Come now, Mrs. Brodie, did you really think that noone who ever read your book was going to have access to any of your sources?In my opinion, this book was nothing more than a feeble attempt of the author's to lash back at the society by which she felt restricted. The work is so saturated with the author's bias and speculation that it can scarcely pass as non-fiction.Mormon and non-Mormon alike should avoid this book, simply because it's a horrible attempt at biography. In giving this book one star, I take none of my personal feelings on the subject into account. It simply is bad history. Rather you believe in Smith or not, this book will profit you nothing."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"Let me save you the time of trying to read every review on Amazon. Each review falls into one of two categories. Non-LDS individuals who want to slam Joseph Smith and LDS individuals who support Joseph Smith. Depending on which camp the reviewer is in will dictate their review of the book. Anyone who tells you they are indifferent is simply avoiding the truth. Only Mormons or anti-mormons would take the time to read this worthless book.Anti-mormons will point to Ms. Brodie's scholarly reputation. Because this book wasn't written by Ed Decker or (Dr.) Martin it somehow doesn't fall into the anti-mormon category. Rather, this now becomes pure history. Please keep in mind that just because Ms. Brodie attempts to be scholarly doesn't actually mean that she is scholarly. Putting worthless footnotes after every sentence doesn't make you a historian or a good writer. But being able to discriminate between reliable and unreliable sources does. Ms. Brodie, from a scholastic perspective, fails miserably.Some have argued that she didn't have an axe to grind or that she was still a friend to the Mormons even after publishing this book. Yeah right. I have yet to meet a Mormon who has read her book and thought that it was an unbiased review of the life of Joseph Smith. It sure sounds good to claim that Mormon's in high places have read and enjoyed your book. I just want to know who those people are.The moral of the story is simple. If you want to &quot;debunk&quot; the LDS church then go ahead and drop some change on this classic. It is full of things that aren't true, but they sure sound good. The information can prove to be very useful in writing a good anti-mormon sermon or gearing up for a crusade night.If you are a latter-day saint don't waste your money on this. It is the same old recycled garbage that has floated around about the church for almost 200 years. Rumors, stories from apostates, anecdotes by individuals who had a clear agenda to bring down the church line every page of this book. If you want a truly critical and accurate review of the life of Joseph Smith there are a hundred books better suited for your sincere quest for knowlegde.Ms. Brodie has succeeded in one thing. This book, above all else, shows just how pathetic scholarly attempts at bringing down the LDS church have been. When you have to resort to half-truths, lies, and fables, it only verifies and validates my belief. Christ always taught by truth. Those that oppose him taught with hate and inaccuracies. Christ doesn't need to support his position by making things up or by relying on people that lie at every chance they have to distort the truth. In the end the ultimate source of truth won't be found in the books written by man. In the end an answer to a prayer will lead the pure in heart to our Heavenly Father's truth."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"I'd compare this book to the movie, Shakespeare in Love. It's based on a lot of facts, but she's used some creative liberties. Fawn Brodie is totally inept when it comes to real scholarship. For example, one of her sources was a group of people who had claimed to see ghosts and claimed that Joseph Smith was some sort of sorcerer... she also uses a source from a man who described Joseph Smith as short and dumb-looking and claimed Joseph Smith used phrases like \\"can't not.\\" (Joseph Smith was over 6' tall and very distinguished looking as well as extremely articulate). Both sources were proven liars, but she used both of them even though their stories completely contradicted other reliable sources that she left out! Furthermore, she ignored countless first-hand witnesses and simply took from a grab bag of contradictory testimonies, even though yellow journalism and discrimination were rampant. Her novel is entertaining, but that's partly because of her amazing mind-reading of those who died 150 years ago and her intuition about what people REALLY meant when they spoke. Fawn Brodie is a nerd and is obviously an atheist/agnostic. She's not even a scholar... she could probably write fiction or work for Enquirer magazine. If one wanted to buy this, one might check the ridiculous book she wrote about Thomas Jefferson... critics spotted that one as a sham immediately... the exact same scholarly follies are practiced in this novel as well. She's a rotten scholar, but her writing is interesting in a Jerry Springer sort of way. Don't get me wrong, she takes a lot of facts and things that people ACTUALLY said. However, Joseph Smith was the target of so many contradictory reports, you can make up just about any theory and simply pick and choose sources at your leasure. At least she put something coherrant together, which is almost a mircale. That's the only reason this book is highly regarded. She was apparently the first to figure out that as long as you had a theory about him, you could put a coherrant book together using evidence... however, the evidence could support about ANY theory, strangely enough. Joseph Smith is still a mystery to historians and will continue to remain so, unless they are believers. If one were to follow the trail, like the skeptical Martin Harris mortgaging his property right after showing Professor Charles Anthon the Book of Mormon, or actually including the testimonies of those closest to Joseph Smith (all of which were believers), one would be writing like a historian. If your book about Joseph SMith is believable to atheists, you didn't utilize proven scholarly methods. Proven scholarly methods would be forced to go to people like David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdry and Joseph's immediate family, all of whom directly contradict Fawn's central thesis and unproven theory."},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"When this author somehow supplies what Joseph Smith &quot;must have been thinking&quot; and puts together a senario from that, as to why things happened instead of looking at what he and others said is the reason, then readers should take care. If you have read other non prejudiced books then you will be able to see the distortions here. If anybody REALLY wants to know facts, get The Encyclopedia of Mormonism by McMillian, it is only four volumes and was not put out by the LDS (they took a year to review it before they endorsed it!) though many LDS were asked to submit articles (only makes sense if it is about them) there is even a whole subject on Anti-LDS of over several pages which gi ves titles of Anti-LDS books and authors!"},{"Title":"No man knows my history: The life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet","review":"How tiresome.

If you are an anti-Mormon, then have at it, but remember that none of the references withstand empirical investigation.

Brodie is a master at brushing by events that do not support her agena. Much more than her poor presentation of facts, I am concerned that Brodie seems to &quot;know&quot; what Smith and others were thinking when the events unfolded. Most of her conclusions could be argued if not absolutely proven false.

She also did some hatchet jobs on some of our nations' founding fathers. She presumes to read Joseph Smith's mind, omits important information, distorts and abuses the facts. A couple of little books written in rebuttle have been No Ma'am That's Not History, by Hugh Nibley, and Exploding the Myth about Joseph Smith, the Mormon Prophet, by F.L.Stewart. A fair book about Joseph Smith I would reccommend is Joseph Smith, an American Prophet by John Henry Evans (a non-Mormon) or the The History of Joseph Smith by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith.

I could take more time explaining but I've got lots better things to do than waste time on this collection of fictional tidbits. I think the words \\"trashy\\" and \\"amateurish\\" would best describe this book that includes long lists of footnotes that are in some cases outright fabrications and in other instances refer to fabrications printed by some other author who also fabricated information regarding Joseph Smith when they couldn't find anything bad.If you are truly interested in Joseph Smith or the origins of The Church of Jesus Christ (Mormon) I suggest Donna Hill's (author is not a Mormon but an Historian) \\"Joseph Smith:The First Mormon\\". Even better would be to read Joseph Smith himself in \\"The Book of Mormon\\" or \\"Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith\\". The Library of America, in a volume entitled \\"American Sermons\\", has included a complete funeral sermon given by Joseph Smith just prior to his murder called \\"The King Follett Sermon\\". (King Follett was a friend of Joseph Smith's and Smith gives an overview of theology that is nothing short of astounding.) Ms. Brodie's book is really only a collection of discredited psychobabble and distortion that is quite disorganized and boring.And isn't it fascinating that this brief, year's old review that is buried way back in the list of reviews receives so many negative votes? Could it be that the supporters of this trashy novel have a bigoted agenda and lots of time on their hands?

Powerfully written, it is the centerpiece of the book, and in 1977 was adapted into a very popular and much-praised film starring Jane Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave.It was at this point, however, that controversy arose. The film caught the attention of Muriel Gardner, who promptly asserted that she was 'Julia' and the story itself was significantly based on her own life and work in pre-World War II Germany. She also stated that she had never met Lillian Hellman--but it transpired that she and Hellman had at one time shared the same attorney, who was well aware of her past and who could have described it to Hellman.Hellman flatly stated that Gardner was not 'Julia' and insisted that the story, while altered re details and circumstances to protect the identities of those involved, was indeed factual. As more details of Gardner's life came to light, however, it seemed increasingly likely that Hellman had indeed made use of it in creating the story, and the dispute continues to provoke strong feelings even some thirty years after the deaths of both Hellman and Gardner.It was not the first time Hellman had been accused of literary fraud and it would not be last. During her long love affair with novelist Dashiell Hammett, Hellman was frequently accused of draining his ideas to further her own work. In 1979 writer and critic Mary McCarthy prompted a suit for slander when she described Hellman's work by saying \\"every word she writes is a lie, and that includes 'and' and 'the!'\\" But regardless of how Hellman came by her ideas, there is no getting around the fact that she had the gift: at her best, she was the equal of the best of the best, turning out several masterpiece dramas and three autobiographical works that jolted best seller lists from end of the country to the other.PENTIMENTO is the second of these autobiographies, published in 1973 between the equally famous UNFINISHED WOMAN (1969) and SCOUNDREL TIME (1976.) And although \\"Julia\\" remains the most famous--or perhaps most infamous--work in the collection, Hellman is actually at her finest in the other stories she tells, most particularly those that center on her childhood home of New Orleans.In both these writings and others, Hellman shows a remarkable gift for capturing place, time, and character, zeroing in on her New Orleans family, her lover Hammett, and the legendary Tallulah Bankhead to name but a few. From the lunacy of personalizing condoms in Hollywood to the drunken jitters of opening night on Broadway, Hellman makes you see it, feel it, touch it, taste it. It is a brilliant accomplishment--and if you suspect that the stories on which she hangs these talents are at best misrecalled, at worst deliberate falsifications--is this not, after all, what we demand that writers do? Recast reality in order to spin a good story? Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Pentimento (Back Bay Books)","review":"Pentimento is a brilliant--and entertaining--portrait of a woman's life seen through the doubleness of \\"then and now.\\" Hellman sketches the people within her life, now housed in her memory. Although dubbed a memoir, it transcends a mere record of Lillian Hellman's life and portrays instead the way in which a woman's history merges with the memory of it. Each chapter is a portrait of someone or something symbolically important, and each is written in a different style reflecting its content and theme. Not history, not autobiography, not fiction, Hellman tried instead to get the feeling of her life right, to find something individual and universal. Drama, humor, tragedy--it's here, and it's important."},{"Title":"Pentimento (Back Bay Books)","review":"Lillian Hellman, one of the greatest playwrights of the Twentieth Century, bares her soul in this electrifying collection of vignettes about her life in the theatre; her friends and family; her complex relationship with the great Dashiell Hammett; and much more.Reading this book is like listening to Hellman talk intimately about her life. It is a true memoir; she does not remember details; the conversations tend to be fragmented, and she freely admits that her memories may have been blurred by the passage of time (and in some instances, Hellman's enthusiastic consumption of liquor).Hellman was an extraordinary writer and an extraordinary woman. In PENTIMENTO she reveals herself as few writers have ever done. She makes no attempt to portray herself as a hero or a villain, but as a real, living, breathing woman with changing views and difficult but fascinating relationships.One of the vignettes tells of her friendship with \\"Julia,\\" a woman whom she had known from girlhood who became an anti-Nazi resistance fighter and eventually was murdered by the Gestapo. There have been several cries of \\"FAKE!\\" and \\"LIAR!\\" concerning the Julia chapter, particularly from a woman named Muriel Gardiner, who claimed to be the model for the Julia character in both Hellmann's book and the subsequent film adaptation (a brilliant one directed by Fred Zinnemann). To be sure, Hellmann was known by her friends and family to be a woman who exaggerated things; it's what made her such a great playwright. But the only thing I can say in Hellmann's defense regarding the \\"Julia\\" chapter is that Muriel Gardiner, what ever she herself did or did not do during WWII, it is indisputable that she emerged from it with life and limb intact. Assuming that she was in fact a real person, \\"Julia,\\" whoever she was, did not.In fact the very weaknesses that have been cited for this book over the years are, to me, its greatest strengths. The memory lapses, the sometimes fragmented nature of what she recalls and what she does not (And when she did not recall, she simply said so. Certainly she did not make up cover stories; if she did, one suspects that she would have played the role of the heroine in the Julia tale when in point of fact she was such a klutz when it came to subterfuge that she nearly got caught several times.Hellman does not claim to be an historian; she is merely a human being talking about the things, places, and people of her life. And like most reminiscences, there are always things forgotten, things only half remembered, things you THINK you remember only to discover later that you were quite mistaken, and so on. Had she been making it up, one suspects the dominant figure of the story would have been not Julia, but Hellmann Which is precisely what happened in the film because they decided to go with a frame storyline in which Hellmann is the narrator, making Jane Fonda the titular female lead and relegating Vanessa Redgrave (who won an Oscar) to the background. Yet despite Vanessa's win as SUPPORTING actress, and despite the fact that Hellmann is sort of the \\"front woman\\" of this tale, the Julia character, despite limited screen time, permeates the whole film. As she does in the book: it is Hellmann's voice, but often it is Julia's words we hear.It is precisely because the book is so fragmented and uneven that it rings so true.All in all, a MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"Pentimento (Back Bay Books)","review":"I do not have the knowledge or tools to judge whether Hellman has written the truth here. However, what I do know is that it is splendidly written in a quirky style, which I studied when younger, and the stories are full of psychological depth and personal reflection. While I find her plays and scripts somewhat shallow with easy-to-label characters, I admit that I liked this book as a fully realized work of art.While I do think it matters if she consciously fictionalized her life, whatever the facts this is a good read. I will leave it to scholars and critics to hash out the debate.There are many memorable scenes that live in my mind: her floating in a storm and remembering an incident of killing a snapping turtle, with reminiscences of Hammett as her great love. The scene wanders into a rumination of death and loss, which I thought was real literature. Of course, there is the story of Julia, but there are many other notable scenes, like Hemingway competing with Hammett over his sppon-bending abilities. It is also a window into the past that is vividly rendered.Warmly recommended."},{"Title":"Pentimento (Back Bay Books)","review":"Pentimento is a fine example, not only of Hellman's writing, but of her imaginative style. The story 'Julia' stands out in this collection because of its basis in reality.The character of Julia is based, at least partly, on the adventures of the New York psychiatrist, Muriel Gardiner. Like the fictitious Julia, Gardiner studied in pre-war Vienna where she became involved with an anti-Nazi group. Hellman, who also lived for a time in New York, heard bits and pieces of Gardiner's story. Though Gardiner did not lose a leg and obviously survived, her story piqued Hellman's imagination. Hellman's portrait of Julia does not exactly parallel the life of Muriel Gardiner but it was sufficiently close, especially the Vienna section, for some critics to accuse Hellman of purloining Dr Gardiner's story.Dr Gardiner produced her own memoir in 1983, a book titled 'Code Name \\"Mary\\" '. Though she had an exciting time in Vienna, her story is not nearly as fascinating as Hellman's 'Julia'. The ending is especially poignant and avoids the happy ending that brought Dr. Gardiner's book to a close."},{"Title":"Pentimento (Back Bay Books)","review":"Pentimento: A Book of Portraits is electrfying in its earnestness and candor, incisive in its tone, acerbic in its wit and picturesque in its mental imagery - a memoir (unlike An Unfinished Woman) that is a bit more honed and focused and less formless in how the recollections and diary entries jump from one to the next. Be that as it may, let it not mitigate the merit of An Unfinished Woman, for in its own right, it is a very worthy read and most deserving of its National Book Award. Each chapter in Pentimento is framed, each segment representing a person, place or experience that had a certain signifigance to Lillian Hellman's life and development not only as a playwrite but as a person. The book chapters are listed as thus: Bethe, Willy, Julia, Theatre, Arthur W.A. Cowan, Turtle, and Pentimento. The writing fluidity is fragmented, almost jarring, but the fierce, explicit prose enhances the flavor of the volatile, broken mishmash of truth and hyperbole, a choice style that is not a detriment to what Hellman has to say. With magnetic intimacy, the portraits all have something meaningful to declare; they range from the profound to the wittily bizarre. The latter is best represented in the portraits entitled &quot;Arthur W.A. Cowan&quot; and &quot;Turtle.&quot; It is in these two portraits where Hellman's mordant humor especially shines.From Arthur W.A. Cowan:I said, &quot;Oh, shut up, Arthur.&quot;And he did, but that night as he paid the dinner check, he wrote out another check and handed it to me. It was for a thousand dollars.I said, &quot;What's this for?&quot; &quot;Anybody you want.&quot;I handed it back.He said, &quot;Oh, for Christ sake take it and tell yourself it's for putting up with me.&quot;&quot;Then it's not enough money.&quot; (P.235)AndFrom Turtle:Toward afternoon I telephoned the New York Zoological Society of which I was a member. I had a hard time being transferred to somebody who knew about turtles. When I finished, the young voice said, &quot;Yes, the Chelydra serpentina. A ferocious foe. Where did you meet it?&quot;&quot;Meet it?&quot;&quot;Encounter it?&quot;&quot;At a literary cocktail party by a lake.&quot; (P.278)Considering the period, the one-liners are quite sharp; the portrait that obviously stands out the most is &quot;Julia,&quot; the 'supposed' friendship that developed between Hellman and a Freud disciple who happened to be an anti-facist supporter - a 'friendship' that later formed the basis for the Academy Award-winning film of the same title. Whether the story is fact or fiction, that is up for the reader to decide. Whether &quot;Julia&quot; represented a single woman or a group of dedicated individuals fighting to stop/lessen the evils of war whom Hellman truly admired and who thus wanted her name associated with, may also never be known. But what can be said of the Julia portrait is that it is a written down homage to a person or persons who tried to make a positive difference in that dark epoch of our global history."},{"Title":"Pentimento (Back Bay Books)","review":"If you have never read \\"Pentimento,\\" you should find a way to rectify that fact.

Our spirits are &quot;vacuum-packed&quot; and cannot be touched with disease or sin for that matter. So, healing doesn't apply to our spirits for there is no such thing as &quot;spirtual healing&quot; per se.

Yes, God is merciful and compassionate. He heals today. But when we start using the terminology \\"Divine Healing\\" - that God MUST heal you ... this can cause all kinds of problems for people in the church. EW Kenyon - who was influenced by new age, mind science books - believed that everyone should always walk in healing because it is never God's will for anyone to be sick. There are various reasons why people DON'T get healed. Basically, it's always someone's fault - the poor sick person or the person praying for them. This is nonsense. Please just take a minute to think about how this could affect a sick person's faith - that they're not getting healed because of something they're NOT doing. What a horrible burden to place upon the sick and hurting. This trash, often promoted by televangelists is a \\"name it, claim it\\" or \\"word of faith\\" mentality. It all came EW Kenyon!!! Kenneth Hagin plagiarized his books and propagated this filth. They're the same preachers that go to third world countries and preach that God's will is for everyone to be wealthy and rich.Does God really want everyone to be healthy and wealthy at all times? Sure he does, says Bosworth. It's one of the main reasons why Christ died for us. That's simply not true. First we must ask the question - Why did Jesus do miracles? Everyone whom he healed eventually got sick again and died!!! The reason was to point people to himself and teach them a deeper truth. Take a look at the gospel of John and see how Jesus is always teaching people with his miracles. Jesus put mud on a blind man's eyes and told him to go and wash himself in a pool called \\"sent\\". He was teaching everyone especially those religious teachers that all are blind until they accept him as being sent from God. Jesus multiplied the bread. What was the point of that? So that we will never go hungry? No, Jesus was teaching that he is the bread of life. Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. What was the point in that? Was he teaching us that all obedient Christians who have faith should never experience death? Obviously not. He was using this as a witness to the fact that the resurrection which will happen at the end of the age comes through him. It is this reason why Matthew quotes Isaiah 53 - a spiritual truth that has HEALED us from our SINS ... we are unhealthy and sick in our offenses toward God and the suffering servant (Christ) paid for our atonement. This is what Isaiah 53 is all about. So when Christ healed the masses ... it was confirming and pointing to a GREATER TRUTH. Not that people should never be sick again ... if that was the case, these people would still be alive today! Jesus is the suffering servant who has taken our sins and made us whole again! This does not teach that Jesus died so that we should never have to experience sickness. Please think this through logically. If that was the casethen the original disciples and even Kenyon himself would still be alive! What is death anyway? Death is what happens when our bodies can't recover from sickness. Sickness is when our body stops working right. When Paul wrote to Timothy about his bad stomach, did he command him to claim his healing through the atonement of Christ? No, he instructed him to drink some wine - some practical advice here. But what about that scripture in James that says confess your sins so that you will be healed? Doesn't that tell us that sickness is caused by sin? No, similar passages can be found in other Jewish literature (Ben Sira). Jewish thought holds that one should not ask God for healing or anything for that matter, if they have not first made things right with their neighbor. One should own up or confess that that they were wrong if they have offended their neighbor. THEN they can come before God to worship him or make a request (healing) or ask for forgiveness. Jesus taught this very thing! We find the same thing here in James. Confess your offenses to one another so that you can ask God for healing! And since we know that God is merciful we can ask him for healing. But ultimately it is up to Him. For He is sovereign. Who is going to approach the talented, well known Christian quadriplegic Joni Eareckson Tada and tell her that she is not in will of God because she isn't walking? No one would dare (at least I hope not). But when you buy these books and circulate them through the church ... you will damage people lives, because you are propagating something that sounds great and Biblical - but sadly not true.Look what Paul wrote in 2 Corinthians:\\"I have worked much harder, been in prison more frequently, been flogged more severely, and been exposed to death again and again. Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked, I spent a night and a day in the open sea, I have been constantly on the move. I have been in danger from rivers, in danger from bandits, in danger from my own countrymen, in danger from Gentiles; in danger in the city, in danger in the country, in danger at sea; and in danger from false brothers. I have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep; I have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food; I have been cold and naked. Besides everything else, I face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches. Who is weak, and I do not feel weak? Who is led into sin, and I do not inwardly burn?\\"Paul challenges us to leave our fast-food faith and follow Christ in his sufferings and to one day share in his resurrection. The truth is this - until God creates the new skies and new earth ... until we are removed from these fallen bodies in this fallen world ... we will experience emotional pain - heartache, distress, worry, anger, etc AND physical pain - common colds, the flu, cancer, injuries, stonings, etc.God is sovereign and merciful my friends. You don't need to remove either one from Him. Nor do you need a manual for His healing. Of course, we aren't comfortable with these truths. We want to be in control and manipulate God. Well you can't. If you want a manual, read the book of Job! It's what happens when we experience pain and sickness. Your faith is under fire as close ones tell you to abandon God. Your friends talk crap about you and try to figure it all out - what you're not doing right and the all reasons why you're not getting better (Bosworth's book). Then God shows up and tells everyone to shut up! He is in control and watches over the faithful. God is sovereign and merciful, so please pray for the sick and help the hurting - but give them truth!"},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer","review":"the book came in good time this book is a grate book on belving and help you renew your mind to gods word"},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer","review":"Jesus the healer by E.W.

I read this book, the more I read the angrier I got, how any one dare put this illness as my fault. I am a very strong Christian and total believe, that if it be God's will, you will be healed. I have prayed for a miracle healing, but God chose to heal me through the doctors and not through denial of this illness. I refuse to believe it is my fault that God did not make this illness just disappear, like it was never there. I feel God allows things to happen to strength your faith, not to accuse you of lack of faith. I have grown even closer to him because of this illness and if you received this book because you have an illness just keep praying to God to keep you strong. God knows we have weakness but he still loves you and is there for you. Just keep your eyes on him and do not feel guilty for an illness that is satan's fault not yours."},{"Title":"Jesus the Healer","review":"I have not read it yet. Give me two weeks on my vacation.

His first wife with whom he did not have any kids was a mature and decent woman. His second was a nightmare. Their marriage was doomed from the beginning because of the disparity in temperament and intellect. My husband was single for six years when we got married.Well, I lived in hell for the first two years of my marriage. I was all confused, miserable, and was at a loss as to how to deal with the situation before I read this book. Knowing that there are others facing the same situation and that I was not responsible for my husband's ex and his kids' behavior made me feel stronger. I now put my boundaries firmly for my husband, his over-spoiled kids, and his wicked ex-wife. Things are under control and we live in relative peace now. My advice to women contemplating marriage to men with kids is that BEFORE MARRIAGE make sure that:1. he puts his priorities right (his life partner should be his first priority)2. he is supportive of you3. he has a healthy relationship with his kids which involves love, respect, structure and discipline4. he is firm with his ex5. he and you see eye to eye with each other's expectations of marriageNever, ever marry an over-indulgent father with a bitter ex-wife in the background, unless you are seeking martyrdom, not happiness and companionship. If he cannot keep his baggage from his previous relationships under control, the marriage is not worth saving. Get out while you can and learn from the experience. Remember, only \\"he\\" can keep his house in order, not you. And contrary to what some people believe, it's the ex-wives who have to bend over backwards to get along with new wives so that these new wives will treat their step-kids right. That is, if these ex-wives' priority is their children's happiness. It is completely unacceptable for ex-wives to take out their bitterness and failures on their ex-husbands by turning their kids against their fathers, using their kids for emotional blackmail, and sabotaging their ex-husbands' new marriages by creating havoc in their households. If you are caught in an unhappy situation like this, just look into yourself, see how much you can take, and set appropriate boundaries to keep your sanity and happiness. Don't be overly concerned with what others might think. You can succeed if your husband is with you. If he is not with you, again, the marriage is not worth saving."},{"Title":"Ex-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife","review":"I had really been struggling w/ my boyfriends ex wife and his ex life. When I seen this book I knew I had to get it and I am glad I did. So many things in the book were exactly what I had been going through. This book not only helps you learn how to cope and deal w/ your significant other's past but it also helps validate your feelings. I got a peace of mind from this book realizing that it was not just me. That the things I have been experiencing are normal and to be expected. I also let my boyfriend read it so that he could see and understand for himself what I go through. The book is well written and blunt, the author does not sugar coat the issues, which I like. The book will help you realize that it does not matter that there was one (or however many) before you, all that matters are you are here now. The book said something that I had never really thought about before and that is the fact that although I may never be the first wife I can be the last and that is all that matters.

This book was more realistic than others in the feelings a new wife may have, but it really doesn't get into the dirt. I never had bad feelings or jealousy toward my husband's first wife until she barged into our lives and started acting like she was still married to him. In no way should you be, as the author said \\"the forgotten toy at the bottom of the toy box\\". If you are, then you're doing it all wrong. I've (after much prodding from friends) have decided to write my own thoughts and maybe one day my book will be here. Until then, if you're a new wife and need some consoling that you are not crazy, selfish or alone in your feelings, then by all means read this book. Welcome to the sisterhood."},{"Title":"Ex-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife","review":"I just finished readingEx-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife. Wow, what a turkey. Where do I even begin?How about with grammar and usage. This book could have really benefited from an editor, and preferably one who wasn't absent the day they explained where the commas go. It's like she just randomly threw them in anywhere. It makes reading an already tedious book even more so.Second, there's the religion. Nothing about this book's title or description led me to believe that it would be full of religion, but I assure you, it is. If, like me, you were not raised in a Christian household, you may find it very off-putting. I was looking for a book to help with dealing with my partner's ex, not a lesson in Jesus, Matthew, or Job.And speaking of help dealing with an ex, that's what this book is supposed to be about, right? Sadly, there's not much help to be found here. The author gave *some* scenarios which were situations I'd not thought to anticipate, but then offered precious little in the way of advice for dealing with them. The advice she did give can more or less be summed up in two words: Be perfect. Don't grumble or grouse, don't be caught even *whispering* a negative thought ... just sit quietly with a smile on your face and everything will work out.Great. Thanks. I'll get right on that.One final word. I have no idea why this bothered me so much, but it did: The expression is \\"TUNE in,\\" not \\"TONE in.\\" For the love of Mike, woman: FIND YOURSELF AN EDITOR!"},{"Title":"Ex-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife","review":"This is a great book for women who are going into a blended family remarriage. I am now into this situation and did not have any clue what I was going to get into in the beginning. Ex-wives are a pain in the marriage especially if the ex wife is the bitter one. If your new found love is not committed and will not put you in his priority list then it is useless for you to even try to get into it. He should be strong enough to not worry about what his ex feels but should worry more about how you the next wife feels. Almost most of the situations described in this book happened into my remarriage. LOVE is the only strongest hold in this kind of relationship. I give this book a 5 star rating. If you know of somebody going into this remarriage into a blended family situation, gift her with this book. She will appreciate your thoughts."},{"Title":"Ex-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, even though I'm not the next wife ... but I am the next husband!

The have both tried every trick in this book. and they are good firends! I was looking for something more about how to handle the ex-wives.This is a good read if you have both been married before and you are having trouble with the kids and ex-wives not being accepting to you or if your husband is not being very supportive of the situation.

Reading the review below I must comment. I met my husband 3 yrs. ago (we were in our 40's) and we have been married 2 yrs. He has an 18 yr. old son. Yes, step families can be difficult. But if you handle yourself with maturity and grace, you'll be fine. My marriage is as close to perfect as it gets. In my husbands eyes, I am number one. Listen, its not that the children don't count. Of course they count and I have no problem \\"sharing\\" my love with my step son. My husband and his son have a dynamic relationship and I respect that. In turn, my step son respects his dads relationship with me. And I fit in too with my step son. Yes, it can take time to establish a comfort zone. But don't allow children from a past marriage to dictate whether you will marry or not. I agree with the one reviewer who said something like you should never settle being second best. A couple that marry should know they are Twin Flames. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as important as your marriage. This is the person who is with you through all of lifes trials! My father taught me that my mother comes 1st and I understand and respect it. I saw that love when she got breast cancer the first time. He was the only person who could love & comfort her THAT much. Not her children. Not her mother. But her soul mate - my father, more importantly, HER husband. My husband is like this with me. Never in my life have I loved this much or felt this much love back. So, if you are thinking of marrying a person w/kids, and you are in love with each other, don't fear it. You can, with patience and love, make it work.As for ex wives or husbands, you can't control how THEY act, but you can control how YOU handle an obsessive ex. My step sons mother was a bit possessive/obsessive with phone calls every day concerning their son. But I expressed my concern over it because my husband was annoyed at her. HE was the one who handled her. He said - \\"Please don't call when my son gets a new tooth brush. Important things only, please.\\" She did back off. I also established a contact with her so that she could feel comfortable phoning our house with important issues. Yes, she will be in my husbands life. Does that bother me? No. I know who he loves.So read the book if you like, but in my view, if you handle things without yelling and screaming, again, with maturity and grace, you will get the respect you deserve."},{"Title":"Ex-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife","review":"Although I generally liked the book, I would have liked to have had more \\"solutions\\" along with the scenarios Engler introduces."},{"Title":"Ex-Wives and Ex-Lives: Survival Guide for the Next Wife","review":"I did not get quite what I was looking for when I purchased this book.

Paula Egner took a potentially overwhelming subject and created a light, easy read that was still helpful and informative. The scripture references throughout the book helped keep things in perspective and brought a good balance to the well-placed humor throughout.

It also discusses how scientific evidence is used in making policy and how the values of researchers and policy makers are intrinsically part of such decisions. By exploring these connections, Moore raises important questions about how science is used in society, how values need to be an explicit part of decision making, and our stewardship of the environment. Despite the serious nature of these issues, the book often reads like a historical detective story as it chronicles the efforts of pioneering researchers in environmental science.Parents will be particularly interested in this book because of its focus on children and its practical advice on how to protect them from environmental toxins. The tone is not alarmist, but cautionary and balanced. Parents need to understand how lead, PCBs, pesticides, and other potential toxins were (and are) evaluated prior to their use.Even seasoned scientists will find much worth considering in Moore's careful and accessible analysis of scientific evidence and values. While clearly written for a lay audience, the volume also contains some startling examples of science gone wrong. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Silent Scourge: Children, Pollution, and Why Scientists Disagree","review":"Professor Moore,I have an \\"off the record\\" comment about your book. I was reading your book today and realized how much I like it. It is a great scientific review of some really important research. The content of this class is tremendously important to current events, the environment, and our future. I think your book is a great source for summarizing a number of issues. The risk assessment chapter was really informative and well laid-out.Politically, I am a moderately \\"conservative\\" person. I am fairly liberal on most social issues, but somewhat conservative on a lot of other issues. I know that politics are personal beliefs, and do not deserve a place in the classroom, but discussion of the environment is an inherently political discussion.Last semester, I studied abroad in Greece, and took a Conservation class. I have taken the intro biology classes and I am now enrolled in your Psychology of the Environment class. As you can tell, the environment is a very important issue to me. Education is another \\"issue\\" that is high on my priority list. Your book does an outstanding job of discussing the extensive damage that has occurred to so many children because of pollutants.Some parts of chapter 5 were so disturbing that I was having trouble getting through the pages. You were stating how there needs to be more research on pesticides, and there is no way to tell the vast amount of damage that has occurred to children's lives because of these unreported problems.But ultimately, as a moderately conservative student, I find portions of your book pretty unpersuasive. For example, a lot of it seems to work with the premise that \\"regulation\\" and \\"research funding\\" are the answers. What level should the regulations or recommendations be set at? Where do we need more research? How much more funding is needed? I remember presenting my first article in class, and you asked me if it comes down to a question of \\"money vs. health.\\" I answered, \\"it is not as simple as that.\\"I find much of the class creating unfortunate confrontations between the idea of \\"wealth creation\\" and \\"research.\\" Even if there are some cases where business and environmental interests compete, both groups can work together to create optimal ends.I have a proposition. I really, really enjoy your class. I think the content is extremely important and I like your teaching style.Please let me know how you feel about any of these ideas. I apologize if I overstepped the boundaries of the student-professor relationship with this e-mail.

This is the first one of her books I've read, and I am eager to move on to another volume, perhaps Child Life in Colonial Days. Mrs. Earle's &quot;Home Life&quot; is a fascinating description of everyday life --- the chores, the tools, the dwelling places, the foods, the sights and sounds --- that Colonial Americans knew. Have you ever seen a strange tool or implement in a museum, an antique shop, or hanging on the wall at a country restaurant, and no one seems to know exactly what it is or what it was used for? Read this book: its many illustrations will more than likely include that mysterious object; and Mrs. Earle will describe clearly what it was and how it was used. This book should be in the library of every enthusiast of American antiques. Without a doubt, this book contains information found nowhere else in a book now in print. This is not a history of Colonial America --- although it contains many interesting tidbits about our country's earliest days. It is, however, an excellent description of everyday life in America, 1600 - 1800, with special emphasis on New England and Virginia. As such, this book would be useful not just to historians and antique collectors, but to writers, museum curators, and anyone who wants to understand Colonial America."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"This hundred-year-old work retains its vitality and usefulness.In her wonderfully readable narrative, Earle conveys life in the colonies with vividness missing from most conventional texts. Starting with basic shelter, which were sometimes actually caves in the earliest days, she goes on to describe in detail the critical element of food supply, with careful explanations of culinary practices and useful drawings to illustrate the often-obscure utensils. (This latter feature will fascinate antique buffs.) Also covered are the home production of textiles, the dress of the colonists, travel, religious and social practices, flower gardens, and other matters, providing modern readers an insight into everyday colonial life hard to find elsewhere.Earle's work is a feast of enjoyable information for history readers, collectors, and anyone else who wants to know how the early settlers lived.

She often speaks of things that they were still doing or using in the late 1800's that I have never heard of and she'll say \\"much like we still use\\" when she spoke of how they cleared snow from roads with horses and plows.Each chapter is more interesting than I could have imagined:Homes of ColonistsThe Light of Other DaysThe Kitchen FiresideThe Serving of MealsFood from Forest and seaIndian CornMeat and DrinkFlax Culture and SpinningWool Culture and Spinning (and cotton)Hand-WeavingGirls' OccupationsDress of the ColonistsJack-knife IndustriesTravel, Transportation and TavernsSunday in the coloniesColonial NeighborlinessOld-time Flower GardensAlice went over in detail the tools, fixtures, techniques and reasons for techniques. It was amazing to read about how much exercise and time women spent making material for clothes.She talks about the earliest forms of tools and how they developed and why they developed and often mentions important inventors, most of whom we would never think about, because we don't have these crafts or trades like flax weaving anymore.She writes about sustainability and surprised me in the weaving chapters on how colonists were able to gain freedom from England with their abilities and work ethics.There are line drawings so we can grasp a better understanding of what these objects and tools looked like.The transportation chapter was fascinating when she wrote about old travel routes like the \\"New Connecticut Path\\" and what travel conditions were like and the time it took to get from one place to another.She was most sentimental about gardens and olden day flowers and she wrote about invasive plants that still plague us today.She uses interesting quotes and writings from writers who lived in Colonial times and I appreciated that because those writers are probably not published and there are wonderful descriptions from people who lived thru these experiences. Alice also includes the old spelling.Some might find her writing to be too descriptive and sentimental but I loved it and highly recommend reading it if you are interested in this era. Home Life in Colonial Days is an engaging read.One last, probably not important, tid bit, is that the book I read was published by American Classics, not DoDo Press - does it make a difference? I don't know ..."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"I found this book to be the most helpful one I found for doing research on life in colonial times. It was heavily weighted toward the New England region, but there was also information about the middle and southern colonies. In addition, more attention was given to the 1600's than the 1700's. Even though the language is a bit stilted for today's reader, I found it excellent for setting the mood and telling about the colonial way of life."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"I purchased Alice Morse Earle's \\"Home Life in Colonial Days\\", which in its full, illustrated form, is extremely valuable to someone interested in colonial life. I paid the highest price I could afford, $27, thinking the edition would be a good one. It wasn't. The text was all run together, not even a separate page for titles, dedication, or chapters. There were NO ILLUSTRATIONS! Anyone who has held the true book in his/her hand would NOT appreciate such treatment of a dear classic. I'm still looking for the real book."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"A 1970s reprint of a very interesting 1898 look back at what were even then somewhat distant and fading pioneering/colonial days, and an antique way of life that was already mostly gone by then and which is, now, wholly gone; the mind-set, machinery, techniques, grit, determination, work ethic, industry, and vocabulary of our pioneer and founding days.A wealth of information here, but what struck me most was how industrious our ancestors were, and how unremitting was their toil.Very often they had only the ersatz and farthest approximation of the \\"finer things\\" in life but, nonetheless, every day, from dawn to well after dusk, by the inadequate, wavering, smoky light of pine knot, candle, or fireplace, in sweltering heat but more often in the icy cold, there was always hard work to be done--by everyone, high and low--if they were to survive (and, then, sometimes, prosper), and they persevered and did it. Grunt work some of it, but some of it precise; over twenty distinct, careful, intricate, labor-intensive steps--taking weeks worth of labor--needed just to process flax to the point where it could be spun into thread to be woven into the varieties of linen that clothed many people in those days, and that weaving process involving many more steps.Soft, spoiled, lacking their grit and enterprise, and largely unaware and unappreciative of their skills and sacrifices, as most of us are today, we are not anywhere near their equal."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"A. M. Earls's Home Life in Colonial Days is a very interesting view of history as they were written in the the late 19th century. It is apparent that Earls did much research, visited many locations, and quotes from many sources and poems to support her observations, but as a product of the time,she did not use citations or footnotes. The edition I purchased of A. M. Earls' Home Life in in Colonial days is disappointing in that it is lacking the figures and plates which were originally included. Most of Earls' discussions center on New England then some on Pennsylvania and a little on Virgina. I found the the writing style easy to read with a noticable but not overbaring Victorian romantic style. There is no chonological or regional organization. The chapters are arranged by broad topics such as Food from the Land, Jack Knife Industries, Wool and Weaving, Transportation and Inns. There were incites and descriptions of lifeways and crafts which I have not before encountered. There are many nuggets of interesting informaion contained through out the work. Modern scholars would have a hard time using this work due to its lack of citations, but the Living History participant will be happy to read this book."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"Home Life in the Colonial DaysI purchased Home Life in Colonial Days and was very disappointed to discover that even though the text regularly refers to illustrations on this page or that, there is not even one included in the book. It's rather like listening to a movie. Not at all what I had expected."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"Not an easy read and it spent too much time on stuff like telling the reader how to make soap when I was more interested in stuff like how often they used the soap to wash their clothes - which was also included but I just could have done without the soap making instructions. So I wound up skimming over some parts like that. But there were some details here and there of interest. I found the modern textbook \\"Family Life in 17th- And 18th-Century America\\" much more focused on things of interest but of course it's expensive whereas this is free as an ebook."},{"Title":"Home life in colonial days","review":"I had seen a quoted excerpt from this book that referred to the accompanying illustrations. That was part of the initial appeal of this book to me. To my surprise and disappointment, however, this book contains ZERO illustrations -- even though the text and the Foreword repeatedly mention them. This book is not worth half the advertised price."},{"Title":"Nevada: Magnificent Wilderness","review":"A wonderful book! I am far from my home in Nevada and swear I can smell the sagebrush, cattle and mountain streams as I turn the pages. This book brings the Silver State alive! I have had many comments from visitors who pick up the book and are amazed. Most are unaware of the beauty in this area generally thought of as a desolate &quot;wasteland&quot;.

Diet Journal","review":"This is a very good food journal. It leaves out nothing. The charts are fabulous. The daily tips on the log sheet is excellent. I like the mini journal you can use to take in your purse. I have nothing bad to say about this food and exercise journal"},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time! Diet Journal","review":"I started using this journal on Jan 9, 2011 as well as exercising 5-6 days a week. Keeping track of EVERYTHING that goes in has been extremely helpful. There is absolutely no room for error if you are writing it down AND being honest with yourself. I love the portable mini journal, I actually take it to the gym with me to write down my treadmill info each day. I love that there is a place at the bottom of each day to write my thoughts and progress down. It's helpful to see how much water you are drinking compared to how much you SHOULD be drinking. I find the \\"personal goals, plans and achievements\\" section helpful. I've used each one (you're given 3) as mini goals for myself. I love using the chart to see how well I'm doing each week with my weight loss and I think the cute little gold \\"I did it\\" stars help keep it fun. I will be purchasing another book soon.Now onto the down sides of this book. I hate the binding/spiral. You can't flip the book in half to write and when you are on the left side of the book, the spiral binding tends to get in the way. The book also is very short. I was hoping that it would last me 6 months, but that won't happen. I will run out of room mid April. I think the snack area could be smaller and the exercise area larger.Those are my only complaints about this book. For the most part, it's the best book I've found and I truly do love it. Oh and if you're wondering if it REALLY works...Yes it does as long as you actually do the work and are honest with yourself. I've lost 24lbs since I started this book."},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time!

The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because it only comes with 3 months worth of &#34;I Did It&#34; stickers. This booklet is for 6 months of usage. If it only has 3 months worth of stickers it feels like it's only going to be halfway successful. Every little bit helps when it comes to personal motivation. I would still recommend this to my friends."},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time!

This diet journal has wonderful information on losing weight and helpful tips to keep you motivated. It is very easy to use. The key is to be honest and record everything. For example, I use the amount column on the Daily Nutrional Intake for monitoring my sodium. I have used this journal for over a month now and I could not have been as successful on my diet without it. As a recently diagnosed type 2 diabetic, I encourage anyone trying to lose weight to purchase this journal. Better yet, buy two and ask a friend, spouse or relative who is struggling with their weight to use this diet journal with you. You truly will be amazed at your weight loss success. Thanks Alex Lluch for a superior diet journal which can be used with any diet program."},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time! Diet Journal","review":"One thing I learned after being successful at Weight Watchers is that keeping track of what you are actually putting in your mouth. It's so easy to forget that peice of candy that you grabbed at work, or the bag of chips that came with your sandwich. Journaling helps keep you honest, and allows you to see what is really going on with your eating habits. You can track your progress, to understand why some weeks you were successful and other weeks not so much, by looking back at your journal.This is a simple to use journal that will fit just about any eating program you are using. Each day allows you to enter your food consumed, activities (i.e. exercise), water... as well as a place to enter your thoughts and I feelings. You get a graph to chart your progress, a small journal to use while traveling, and a list of many foods in the back with their basic nutritional information. The book also contains a great deal of practical advice that many can find helpful.This book will not solve your weight issues, and it doesn't promise a magic bullet that will keep you thin forever. What it will do is give you an extremely useful tool that will help keep you on your program and allow you to accurately track your progress."},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time! Diet Journal","review":"Best diet journal I've ever used in a lifetime of ups and downs. I've found that to be successful, I MUST journal. This book is user friendly and loaded with motivational perks to keep you recording daily - it reinforces daily recording over the long haul. There is a weight loss graph in the front to mark daily progress (very encouraging). The daily log page includes space for all nutritional info, a place for your daily weight, energy level, calorie totals, exercise totals and comments. In the back is a comprehensive calorie index and in the front an exercise index. There is information about your weight loss journey and daily weigh-ins, and education about normal daily fluctuations. My husband got interested in this program after I'd lost 20# and started a more consistent exercise program. I ordered the book for him and now he's hooked and I'm still enthusiastic after 2 months of dieting! The best thing about this particular journal is we are becoming more educated about our personal eating habits and how many calories we must have been consuming before. I'm expecting by the time we hit our goals next fall, we'll be more savvy about calories (and kinds of calories) we are taking in. I enthusiastically recommend this book and wish you all success."},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time! Diet Journal","review":"I actually went to a bookstore to compare this \\"I will LOSE WEIGHT this time\\" Journal with \\"DietMinder Personal Food & Fitness Journal\\". Both are good, but I find this book more simply and efficiently designed to write down, and each columns are more spacious and wider than the other one. DietMinder has more sections and room unnecessarily such as too many column for snacks, and bigger space for Vitamines than for Excercise ( I wish they'd saved more column for Excersice), while this journal has only essential things I need. Please refer to the photos of the journal I placed here. The most attractive thing to me of this journal is that this has a graph chart in the front and if you are a visible person I am sure that looking at your weight loss progress each time you open this book will keep you really motivated.The only downside of this journal is though, the spiral bind part is so bulky and not sturdy and so it annoys me a bit when I write down. Also this book is a bit heavy and thick to carry around in a purse (though I like the quality of the paper, it is very good to write with a ballpoint pen). Overall, I like this journal a lot and I highly recommend this as long as your goal is to focus on the weight loss by keeping a track and to know how much calories you are taking in on daily basis."},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time!

Diet Journal","review":"At first I was going to give this only 1 star but the journal does give good information and the lay-out to log in your daily food count is well set up. The problem I have with it is, first of all the cover screams \\"I Will LOSE WEIGHT THIS TIME DIET JOURAL\\" which makes it embarrassing (to me anyhow) to take anywhere with me. Also the spiral- binding is cheap and goes only half way around... which makes it impossible to fold over backwards for ease of writing. In other words, at the end of the day, when you sit in a comforatable chair or in bed and you want to fill in your information, the book has to stay open to both pages and it's difficult to write. I took the plastic spiral out and used garbage bag ties so I could fold the book backwards to write on. it's much easier. The Little \\"Away from Home\\" diet journal is very good because it is small fits well into any pocket book.I bought 2 copies and I will be returning the one that I didn't touch."},{"Title":"I Will Lose Weight This Time!

You have to create a caloric deficit and for me I think I was really underestimating how much I was really eating before when I was overweight because once I started writing it all down it really helped me to put things in perspective as far as how much I was eating and how much I should be. You can keep track of breakfast,lunch,dinner plus snacks and how much you exercised and what you did. Its also got great tips on every page and sections to keep track of your thoughts, progress and goals. I lost a total of 35 lbs in like 6 months using this religously and eating right and exercising. I would definately recommend to anyone who is trying to lose weight. Nothing helped me like this diet journal did."},{"Title":"Feud in the Icelandic Saga","review":"It has been nearly a quarter-century century since UCLA's Professor Jesse Byock completed this book (the copyright date is 1982; Amazon's date of 1993 for the paperback edition is for that format only). It marks an attempt to reverse a long-prevailing view of a whole body of literature, the Sagas of the Icelanders. It is not easy reading; but it repays the effort it takes. It has been well received; there is even a Japanese translation of the book, along with Byock's later \\"Medieval Iceland.\\"I had been reading sagas in translation since the late 1960s, and on reading this book I had the distinct feeling that I had never quite understood them properly. Almost as if, say, I hadn't grasped the function of a jury in stylized accounts of trials, like \\"Perry Mason.\\" Or, more exactly, like missing the functions of lawyers. Byock is credited with a major breakthrough in making clear the essential role of the \\"advocate\\" in feud and resolution narratives.\\"Sagas of the Icelanders\\" is a category which is not identical to the larger group of Icelandic Sagas. They were all written in Old Icelandic / Old Norse, in a similar style, but the latter designation includes a wide range of topics, including the Kings of Norway, and a variety of heroes from the Migration Age, like Sigurd the Volsung, and Hrolf Kraki and the Skjoldung Dynasty of Denmark. (The Siegfried of the \\"Nibelungenlied\\" and Hrothulf the Scylding in \\"Beowulf,\\" respectively; Byock has, in fact, translated \\"The Saga of the Volsungs,\\" for the University of California Press and Penguin Classics, and \\"The Saga of King Hrolf Kraki,\\" for Penguin Classics.)When I was taking Icelandic Literature (in translation) at UCLA a decade before this book appeared, the reigning orthodoxy was to take the medieval sagas written in Iceland *about* Icelanders as primarily literary creations. They were fictions about events centuries before they were composed, to be enjoyed, certainly, but to be treated as sophisticated fictions. These works, written in a remarkably lean prose studded with poems of great complexity, give an immediate impression of gritty realism; farmers worry about hay supplies for the winter, large landowners maneuver to acquire more property, and minute details of legal procedure form turning points in lives.There is nothing like them in the rest of medieval European literature; whereas the Legendary sagas, and various obviously foreign materials (the *Riddara,* or chivalric, Sagas), are built up of stories of kings and warriors, or even knights on horseback (not a natural part of the Icelandic imagination). But from short works like \\"Hrafnkels Saga,\\" to the massive \\"Brennu-Njals Saga\\" (\\"The Story of Burnt Njal\\"), the Sagas of the Icelanders were to be approached as books of fiction, albeit fiction set in real landscapes, and with some historical personages in the cast of characters.This was a marked reaction to the one-time view of them as something more like nave reportage of actual events; and it acknowledged their sophistication as narratives, and the highly artistic nature of their seemingly artless prose. But it tended to block their use as evidence of Icelandic life in the Middle Ages; and to forestall attempts to interpret the sagas as self-representations of Icelandic experiences, aimed at ordinary people, instead of the product of elite literary culture, and reflecting foreign influences, albeit in a subtle manner. Never mind evidence that the expensive medieval manuscripts were regarded as treasures to be read aloud to ordinary, isolated, farming households, to entertain guests, or during the long winters. (Actually, the idea of a serialized reading of \\"Njal's Saga,\\" as a kind of radio soap opera, suggests that the periodic scandals and adventures were a good part of its original appeal.)Jesse Byock has taken a leading position in the rehabilitation of the sagas as historical evidence; not that he regards them as literally true -- although he has produced evidence for a startling level of accuracy in some overlooked or misunderstood details in some of them. Instead, he has tried to take them seriously as reflections of the stresses and social patterns of life on the island between the time of settlement (after 870 to around 930) and the late Middle Ages (before, say, the mid-fourteenth century, when some non-saga historical texts may have been redacted.\\"Feud in the Icelandic Saga\\" is an enormously impressive analysis of the recurring patterns of dispute, arbitration, and resolution or non-resolution, in the saga-literature. He does not take individual sagas as true-to-life accounts of specific events. Instead, he shows that the recurring patterns correspond to the expected stresses of life in a subsistence economy, unable to support a fully-developed state, and that the \\"purely literary\\" patterns are the sort of thing that medieval Icelanders would have recognized as both probable and instructive.Byock has returned to these issues many times since, in articles and books. \\"Medieval Iceland: Society, Sagas, and Power\\" (1988), also from the University of California Press, was more recently joined by \\"Viking Age Iceland\\" (2001), from Penguin. The two books return to some of the saga narratives analyzed in \\"Feud,\\" this time from broader perspectives that include the degradation of the Icelandic ecosystem in the centuries following the Settlement. (Unlike \\"Feud,\\" either could probably serve as an introduction to the saga literature; but \\"Viking Age Iceland\\" is probably by far the more approachable, and deals with issues, like the role of women, for which much evidence is from outside the saga literature.)\\"Feud,\\" however, still remains an impressive accomplishment. To my mind, it makes a convincing case for treating the saga-literature as \\"true\\" representations of medieval Iceland, albeit in a sociological, rather than a naively historical 'just-as-it-happened,\\" sense. And even for those who may want to reject the argument, the analyses of specific sagas are exceptionally clear and compelling -- at least to those of us who have puzzled over some of the stories."},{"Title":"Feud in the Icelandic Saga","review":"Feud in the Icelandic Sagastates in the introduction \\"It is impossible to understand the old Icelandic sagas without comprehending the function of feud in medieval Iceland.\\" Byock, the author, takes this premise and concentrates on feud in the family sagas and in the Sturlunga saga compilation and proceeds to show us how invasive his premise is in the context of Iceland's social, governmental and judicial structures.If you enjoy the Icelandic sagas as literature, you will find this academic study fascinating in how the Sagas have impacted the country's social foundations. You'll see how taking violence and channeling it into the sagas created a social structure which allowed a balance of power between families, warring factions, and the society as a whole.This is a book of literary criticism, but don't let the academic tone of it turn you off. If you are a Saga reader, your appreciation of the tales will increase with the knowledge and the depth that Byock creates."},{"Title":"Feud in the Icelandic Saga","review":"I would like to rate the whole experience positively, because I was pretty satisfied with the order.

Yet admittedly, as he clarifies in his introduction, The Nature of God: An Inquiry into Divine Attributes is a reactionary work. Likewise, it should not be considered an exhaustive discussion or review of the topic; he aims to develop a solid response to contemporary and opposing philosophies, of which there is not shortage of supply. A Reformed reader will benefit to know the various facets of this discussion, the pitfalls of certain logical gateways, and the ramifications for an underdeveloped theology.He begins with the attribute of omnipotence, for which he immediately provides a discussion of its definition. Many who ponder the reality of God's omnipotence will suffice themselves to think that God may do anything. At some point or another they will be asked, \\"could God create for Himself a stone which He could not lift?\\" and they will be forced to admit the issue is deeper than appears on the surface. Wierenga explains that the attribute of omnipotence is not contingent on the breaking of the laws of logic. In other words, omnipotence should be seen as utmost ability. God has all the ability and all the strength required to cause any possible affair given the current state of affairs and state of the world.He devotes the second chapter to the issue of God's omniscience, which lies as a foundation for the next several chapters. Wierenga essentially argues an orthodox understanding of God's omniscience: that He knows all propositional facts, believes no falsehoods, did not learn these facts, and did not deduce these facts from previous knowledge. Contemporary philosophers such as W. V. Quine have argued that there are divisions of de dicto knowledge, de se and de re, but Wierenga demonstrates that both are reducible to de dicto knowledge and therefore affirms God's knowledge of all propositions.A great deal of the following three chapters are generated about the topics of free will and foreknowledge. He has laid a foundation for this discussion by now, that in chapter one it was established impossible for both God to force someone into making a decision, and for that person to make the decision freely; and that in chapter two it was established that God does not learn, and thus has knowledge of future propositions just as equally as present or past propositions. Rather than make a compatibilist argument for accidental necessity and free will, Wierenga aims to demonstrate by disproving several common contemporary positions that there is simply no acceptable argument for accidental necessity. In other words, if God's knowledge of all propositions are equally present to Him, there is no valid argument for \\"past knowledge\\" being accidentally necessary for present or future action. He further states that any alternative to this conclusion does not successfully reconcile divine foreknowledge and human free action.More than the idea that all propositions are equally present to God, Wierenga argues for what Francesco Suarez and Luis de Molina described as \\"Middle Knowledge\\"--that God knows not only actual propositions, but also possible ones. He takes on several more contemporary discussions of the topic and describes how the scenario plays itself out in hypothetical worlds, concluding that there must be at least some true counterfactuals to freedom in order to accommodate a world that has both free will and evil. This is true where, as Wierenga describes, propositions \\"(i) God is omnipotent, (ii) God is omniscient, (iii) God is wholly good, and (iv) there is evil\\" (p. 126) coexist and must be reconciled.This is followed with an intriguing inquiry into the timelessness of God. Naturally, the doctrine of timelessness carries philosophical and even logical dilemmas in tandem with the doctrines of immutability and omniscience. This is because the Biblical account of God seems to, at the very least anthropomorphically, reveal that He acts in time. The question then is whether or not this act represents a state of God at one time t that does not exist for Him at another time t1. By addressing key issues in a multitude of contemporary arguments, Wierenga ultimately concludes that the doctrines of immutability and omniscience do not necessarily conflict with the attribute of timelessness, but that a satisfactory argument for or against it has yet to be shown and deserves further scrutiny.Wierenga spends the final two chapters discussing how his theses thus far practically flesh themselves out in matters of morality. Essentially, he argues that God's goodness is a matter of moral perfection and that human morality exists directly by the divine command. In other words, adultery is wrong because God commands us not to commit adultery.It seems that Wierenga does not possess an affinity for labels, for he neglects throughout his many philosophical and logical discourses to strongly posit his position. At the very least, the reader would benefit from a disclaimer of the author's positions in the introduction, and perhaps even a clearer title that suggests an affirmation of Molinist theology. However, it is plausible that Wierenga's intentions were to reach an audience of Reformed or Arminian theologians, or a third audience of uneducated or unconvinced, for whom would be more likely to digest a seemingly multi-faceted and holistic discussion of contemporary philosophical debates. William Lane Craig, himself an advocate of Molinist thought, claims that many Arminians and Calvinists who were previously ignorant to the theology are favorably disposed to it upon discovery.[1]Determinist Calvinist theology forks in one of two directions: either the proponent must be satisfied with the mystery of compatibilism, or else suffer the quandaries of God's seemingly active causality of evil. 17th century Reformed theologian Francis Turretin put it this way:that God on the one hand by his providence not only decreed, but most certainly secures, the event of all things, whether free or contingent; on the other hand, however, man is always free in acting and many effects are contingent. Although I cannot understand how these can be mutually connected together, yet (on account of ignorance of the mode) the thing itself is (which is certain from another source, i.e., from the Word) not either to be called in question or wholly denied[2]Wierenga effectively provides an alternate solution to the determinist Calvinist, suggesting instead an additional step to God's creative process called Middle Knowledge, which relieves some of the mystery and some of compatibilism and provides at least a somewhat coherent answer to the problem of evil.Proponents of Arminianism will find that a Middle Knowledge theology provides ample room for human choice while granting a stronger view of God's sovereignty. Further, many Arminians may find that a Middle Knowledge theology is a natural philosophical progression from their current theological convictions given the admission that God chooses which world to actualize given the knowledge of what it's created agents would choose--either to reject or accept Christ--according to the yield of greatest good. Molinism also maintains God's sovereignty, purporting that God's choice is not contingent on man's free will due to His use of natural knowledge in contrast to foreknowledge.However, the position is not without it's own problems, and Wierenga admits these. His concluding position is essentially that, though there are no pat answers to the ultimate ends of logical analysis to the Molinist position, it is yet more conclusive than the many other positions that have been suggested throughout Christian thought thus far. This conclusion is appropriate given Wierenga's overall literary strategy of process of elimination, which addresses philosophical debates rather than biblical proofs. For a position that is neither entirely supported nor refutable from Scriptural account, it does rely heavily on logical analysis of philosophical concepts. The reader will benefit from his more-than-fly-by analysis of some of the strongest opposing positions. No matter one's traditional position, he will certainly be challenged to think through each of the logical ends of his position.As was mentioned at the onset, Wierenga by no means makes a full survey of the topics. This presents one major weakness: more than arguing for his own theological positions, he argues against his opposition. Likewise, there is plenty of room for further contribution on these subjects, and Wierenga himself invites such scrutiny and believes that each of the topics warrants further criticism. However, The Nature of God makes for a great introduction to the various positions that are available in today's philosophy and is a recommended resource for any interested theologian. The casual reader may prefer to acquire a less academically oriented work for a less technical overview of said topics.Reviewed by Darrin Koehler at TheologyNotebook (dot com)_____________________________________[1] Craig, William. \\"Reasonable Faith -- Molinism vs. Calvinism.\\" [...](accessed November 1, 2012).[2] Turretin, Francis.

The book is about an unforgettable character who is bigger than life. Red's life and adventures chronicle a time when young men could dream and become their dreams. While based on a real life person, the author has managed to give him a larger than life persona. The reader will be fascinated by the adventures of Captain Red and will be given an insight into the fledgling beginning of the helicopter era. The last time I had this much fun was when I read Huckleberry Finn!Bob Papaioanou"},{"Title":"Captain Red","review":"This is one of the few times when I, as the author of nine published novels, can say I wish I had written this one. So when I say I &quot;could not put it down,&quot; I say this literally. The author denied me sleep, one night until nearly dawn, the next night until I reached the last page -- which I reached with regret because I wanted more. I found it at once a story of humanity and man's insatiable desire to better himself. The story of the pioneering helicopter flights were especially gripping, but equally gratifying is the story of the protagonist himself, the unforgettable, irrepressible Captain Red. Read it, you will not be sorry!"},{"Title":"Nickel and Dime Your Way to Wealth \\"Second Edition","review":"This book got me to thinking - after sitting down and realizing - the simple how to of a financial plan I now own 134 stocks - this is a divide between 2 companies.

The majority of emeralds in the marketplace are reprehensible--the ones pictured here prove that emeralds done right are among the most transcendently lovely objects on earth.Ward clearly knows his emeralds (and other gemstones); he effectively and clearly transmits the basic information important to emerald novices. For example, he's correct to note that most people don't realize their emeralds have been oiled, and he puts to rest any criticisms of oiling--it makes the stone the best it can be be, after all.I can tell he started out as a journalist. He has a very investigative-journalist, breathless tone. I think it works for the most part, especially when he's rhapsodizing over discoveries of sunken treasure or fabulous royal jewels attached to epic legends and lore.But he is mildly biased against certain types of stones. He excessively disses the Egyptian mines. I'm glad he delves into the history of Cleopatra's mine, and I even appreciate his attempts to theorize as to the real chemical composition of the alleged \\"emeralds\\" from Egypt. However, he sprinkles in derogatory references to the Egyptian mines throughout the entire text, finding them vastly wanting. I think this is overkill. Colombians are the best--we get it.Also, he frequently disparages ancient South American (Incan, for e.g.) and Egyptian empires' facility with stonework and knowledge of stones. He writes things akin to, \\"while we would never find such simply drilled, untumbled stones attractive, the ancients knew no better..\\" Actually, I quite liked the simple, untumbled emeralds he showcased; some of the ancient jewelry was quite stunning, and while it's not to my tastes to wear, I know several schools of people who are into that whole \\"organic\\" look.By the way, this is a very slim volume. It's suitable either for complete novices or for collectors who want anything on their favorite stones."},{"Title":"Emeralds (The Fred Ward Gem Book)","review":"I read Fred Ward's book &quot;Emeralds&quot;, a part of his gem series, for an oral report I had to do for school. This book is packed with information on emeralds, from general info, to the cutting process; this book has it all! Not only is Fred Ward a talented author and researcher, but also he takes magnificent photographs. This book has lots of beautiful pictures of emeralds from all over the world. Fred Ward gives you a history of emeralds and their importance with the ancients. And shows and tells you about some of the beautiful jewelry that emeralds are in today, as well in the past. It even has a buying guide that shows what to look for when buying emeralds. I did tons of research for my report, and used a lot of books, but none of them even came close to &quot;Emeralds&quot;."},{"Title":"Emeralds (The Fred Ward Gem Book)","review":"This book is a fairly short book on Emeralds. Ward gives the reader a great introduction to the world of emeralds without losing the reader in a bunch of scientific jargon. Though the book is very short for its price,it is full of great color pictures and information. The photography in this book alone makes it a must have for emerald lovers. The only complaint that I have about the photograph is that many of the pictures are taken zoomed in so the reader has a tough time determining the actual size of the subjects. Ward touches on the ancient history of these beautiful gems and explores modern day sources of the world's emeralds. Ward also discusses treatments of emeralds before sale, care of emerald jewlery, and there is a particularly interesting section on the making of synthetic emeralds. I would recomend this book to anyone with an interest in emeralds, but I would not recomend it to those looking for a particularly scientific book or a buyer's guide. This little book is packed with information and photographs that won't let you down."},{"Title":"Emeralds (The Fred Ward Gem Book)","review":"This is a clear, concise, easy to read guide to emeralds. Very well photographed. A great primer for those unfamiliar with the complex emeralds world, and a good reference for those who are more knowledgeable. Excellent for jewelers, designers to use with customers and gem lovers. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emeralds (The Fred Ward Gem Book)","review":"This is a lovely, thorough, captivating look at the entire scope of emeralds. In true National Geographic form, Mr. Ward takes us through the history, the science, the lore of these amazingly varied gems. As a gemologist, he walks us through the mining and chemistry of beryl. Fred and Charlotte Ward are collectors and world-travelers obviously, because there are exquisite examples from every corner of the globe. From the priceless to the contemporary, he has photographed the major pieces to convey the range of color, clarity, and beauty. And with his obvious journalism background, the pace is detailed enough to challenge while enticing enough to feel drama. You feel the grit of discovery to the awe of true natural beauty.For many reasons you will reference these books in conversation, over dinner, with friends...I have read them cover to cover and they are the standard for understanding and appreciating the jewels we covet.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1887651152/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"},{"Title":"Emeralds (The Fred Ward Gem Book)","review":"I love this book.

Reilly, the protagonist in A Confederacy of Dunces, twenty years older, twenty years wiser (and more neurotic), and 150 pounds fatter. Now imagine that Reilly has escaped from a North Carolina lunatic asylum that's masquerading as a fat farm. He is on the loose in a stolen laundry truck, wearing nothing but a hospital gown. His brain is addled by the intensely powerful drugs that have been pumped into him by the asylum's Nazi-like director. Like the characters in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, our hero's on a road trip where reality is mutable and paranoia is a given.This wonderful novel is a fine read and it goes down quickly, easily and pleasurably. My only complaint is that the author deserved better editing; there are some plot inconsistencies and typos that a competent editor would have corrected immediately. Nevertheless, I give the book a strong recommendation."},{"Title":"Wagner, Descending: The Wrath of the Salmon Queen","review":"I really enjoyed &quot;Wagner, Descending: Wrath of the Salmon Queen&quot;, but I would caution it is not for all tastes.

For reasons diverse, he needs to escape the geographic confines of North Carolina. His mother (The &quot;Salmon Queen&quot;) has commited him to this fat farm, and Wagner wants o-u-t of North Carolina. So, this is a road novel. And during it, you meet the darndest assortment of weirdos, etc., and they are all very, very funny and highly original stuff. Has some &quot;cut&quot; to it, too, about today present society. Negative? Well, if there is one, it is the character himself. Foul-mouthed, unapologetic, not good with people.

Ashley W. is a &quot;spinster&quot;(red hair/green eyes) yankee. She needs a temporary husband to join a wagon train so she can find her twin brother. Tanner McTavish is a bitter reb who hates all yankees but takes this &quot;job&quot; to get out of jail. Despite their dislike for each other they have telling experiences as the story twists and turns. The love scenes are intense but the relationship can not progress because of Tanner's need to avenge civil war atrocities on his family. (They call each other reb and yank throughout the book which is really cute in the beginning but gets pretty old by the end.)Fiesty heroine (the indians call her &quot;flame&quot;), hunky hero, great secondary character in her brother Cole and bad guys you like to hate. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Flame (Leisure historical romance)","review":"Ashley Webster, a Yankee, needs a husband and she needs him right now. But not for the usual reasons such as love and companionship. No, she needs a husband in name only so she can join a wagon train headed west across the plains. Single women aren't allowed. And Ashley desperately needs to get to Fort Bridger, where her brother is held accused of murder. She is so desperate, in fact, that she makes a deal with Tanner MacTavish, a former confederate soldier currently in jail. She must be mad because the man HATES all Yankees (for very personal and painful reasons) and bluntly tells her so. But the money she is offering in exchange for a pretend marriage is so astounding Tanner accepts the offer. Looks like the crazy Yankee temporarily bought herself a Rebel husband.Ignore the cheesy cover. This is a really good book! If all of Mason's historical romance books are like this one then I can see why she has such a following. The characters are wonderful and rich. And the story is so captivating that I read it in one sitting. This book explores the many facets of middle 1800's settlers life. These include the wagon train with its constant threat of disease, natural disasters (i.e. flooding) and Indians. Also included is the homestead life in the burgeoning towns of the west. At the center is a beautiful hate-to-love romance that blossoms over the months. Ashley (Yank) is a independent woman who repels at the idea of a real marriage. And Tanner (Reb) is a emotionally wounded ex-soldier who can't let go of the horrors of war inflicted on his family. Somehow they heal each other amidst the rigors of their journey west.A truly enjoyable read full of romance, passion and action. Its worth picking up just to read the part concerning the Sioux Indians -fascinating. This is my first Mason book and not my last. I look forward to reading more of her books in the very near future.Recommended."},{"Title":"Flame (Leisure historical romance)","review":"I have to say I just finished this book and it was the best book I have read in a while.

So she pays Tanner money to be her husband. He agrees. He is a Reb and Ashley a Yankee, they don't get along well.

At the time it had no rivals. This book gives a thorough mathematical treatment of classical multivariate analysis. It is extremely well organized. Development of the multivariate normal distribution and its properties are given a thorough and rigorous treatment. The Wishart distribution is derived. Properties of the multivariate normal distribution are applied to problems of classification, principal components, canonical correlation and tests of hypotheses including the use of Hotelling's T square.As a graduate student at Stanford, I audited Ted Anderson's multivariate analysis course, that he taught out of the first edition of the book. It wasn't until 1984 that he revised the text incorporating some new materials including the bootstrap method.This is an advanced course for graduate students in statistics. It is the best source for a rigorous mathematical treatment of the important results from the theory of the multivariate normal distribution. However, it is not easy reading for someone who is interested in applications but does not have strong training in mathematics (particularly linear algebra). For applications and approaches when the normal theory doesn't apply, the book by Gnanadesikan is very good. There are now many good theoretical and applied texts on multivariate analysis including the text by Eaton, the one by Srivastava and Khatri, one by Rencher, one by Johnson and Wichern, and the one by Mardia, Kent and Bibby. Naik and Khattree have written a very nice applied multivariate book that demonstrates the applications using SAS software every step of the way.There are now many subspecialties including cluster analysis, principal components, correspondence analysis, factor analysis and classification that have complete texts devoted to them.Anderson has now published a third edition to this book and it incorporates bootstrap methods"},{"Title":"An introduction to multivariate statistical analysis (Wiley publications in statistics)","review":"A non-esoteric introduction into the discipline of multivariate statistical theory.

Two other writers completed the task: Marvin Tate for Psalms 51-100, Leslie Allen for 101-150.One of the reviewers referred to Craigie's work as \\"scholarly and evangelical.\\" Another called it an \\"inspiring, intelligent, and faithful survey.\\" I agree completely. When I saw that Craigie had done a commentary on the Psalms, I immediately purchased volume 19 in this series because I had previously used his commentary on Deuteronomy and found it invaluable in a two-year series of Bible studies we did on Deuteronomy.I figured the editors of the series must have tried to maintain consistency when Tate and Allen continued Craigie's work.I am not as happy with Tate's volume as I was with Craigie's. Of course, this volume is full of scholarly notes on the text and the language and the theological/literary/historical/liturgical contexts of the psalms. As was Craigie's volume. However, Tate, in his commendable effort to bring a great quantity of detailed information about each psalm's theological/literary/historical/liturgical context, often left me with the impression that there is no clear idea of what the psalm was meant to do. Psalm after psalm is analyzed in this way. While the application of the Scripture is not necessarily the main task of a commentary, I found Craigie's approach less abstract, more practical. Tate also seems rather fond of pointing out in his explanations how psalms relate to \\"old mythical ideas.\\" And the point of that is . . . ?If I read Calvin, Luther, Boice, or Craigie on the Psalms, I am informed and edified. I greatly appreciate the detailed knowledge that Tate provides, but often, after reading Tate, I had no feel for the effect that the psalms actually had not only on Israel but on Christians over the centuries.I bought volume 20 (Tate) in this series because of Craigie's volume 19. I have found the information in Tate helpful at times, and I know that whatever the Lord does is right and best, but I tend to wish that Craigie had been allowed to complete the commentary."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"I have read TONS of books, but \\"Each Little Bird That Sings\\" is one of my top three favorites.

When her aunt dies, her family comes to the funeral, and then when her cousin Peach comes everything goes wrong. Soon enough Peach and Comfort start to get along,but then something horrible happens. If you want to know what happens, you will have to read the book. Comfort and her friend Declaration are having trouble as friends, and soon Comfort is blaming everything on Declaration.I like this book, because it has things that would happen in real life, like someone dying.

I read the back and was attracted to the content. I decided I would start reading it to my kids--6, 8, and 10--before bed each night. The author has a very cute way of writing and created such great characters that amused my kids right from the beginning. They especially laughed out loud at everything Merry said.SPOILER WARNING:During a flash flood that nearly kills Comfort and Peach, Dismay--funeral dog extraordinaire--gets swept away by the rising water's current. I stopped there for the night and came down to find out what happens. After reading the other reviews and finding out that Dismay does die, I was so sad. I decided to tell the kids the next morning so that they'd be prepared when I read before bed that night. I didn't want to upset them before bed! They took it pretty well and wanted to go on reading that night.Parents, if you're going to read this book aloud to your children, I hope you can get through it better than I did. I actually had to have my husband take over at certain parts because I couldn't get the words through the lump in my throat nor see for the tears in my eyes! It was a little embarrassing and my daughter said, \\"Mom, you're weird.\\" LOLMy 8- and 10-year-old enjoyed this book more than my 6-year-old. He lost interest here and there and wasn't interested in hearing the end.All in all, this book was wonderfully written and was tender and sweet. Death is a part of life and it was nice to talk about the subject with my kids after our nightly sessions. I'm really glad I found this book and got to share it with my babies."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"This is an imaginative. fictional view of those immediate formal and private events related to death, provided as the bright child's observations. Added to this are her written items for the local newspaper. We (the adult females in my family) are reading it with amusement before giving it as a gift to a bright eight year old.We think it deals with some of the formalities that first seem to frighten children about death. It could be read and possibly discussed before a child has to experience the first visitation/wake, or funeral."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Have you ever-experienced death? Having to go to the viewing, the actual funeral, and then the graveside service. Well if you haven't than ask this little 10-year-old girl Comfort Snowberger who has experienced 248 deaths in her 10 years of living. Comfort is a little girl who has a best friend named Declaration Johnson. They met at Declaration's Moms funeral. Her mom died when she was 4. Ever since her moms death Declaration doesn't like to go to funerals. She only goes to peoples that are important to her. Deborah Wiles explains Comfort's life with death everywhere in her fiction book called Each Little Bird That Sings.In Each Little Bird That Sings, Great Aunt Florentine dies, but she dies what she loves doing, which was gardening. Great Aunt Florentine's death was a tragic experience for everyone because Great Aunt Florentine played an important role in everyone's life.An exciting incident that happened in Each Little Bird That Sings is that when Peach, Comfort and Dismay the dog were on their way to Great Aunt Florentine's graveside service. All the sudden rain started pouring down, which caused a flood in the lake near by. Comfort, Peach, and Dismay had to swim for their lives and I mean FOR THEIR LIVES!!! As Peach started to drown Comfort let go of dismay to save Peach. Dismay started floating away. He was trying to fight the current to get back to Peach and Comfort but the current was too strong.I think the theme of Each Little Bird That Sings would be that even if you do something good something bad could happen in a second. In the book Comfort saved Peach, which was, a good thing but let go of dismay, which was a bad thing.So if you like fiction books and want to know how Comfort lives through all this than read Each Little Bird That Sings it's a great book!!!!!\\"Its not about how you die its how you live that makes the important impression\\"-Each Little Bird That Sings"},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Comfort Snowberger knows far more about death than the average 10 year old. Her family owns and operates the lone funeral home in rural Snapfinger, Mississippi and she has attended nearly 250 funerals.The funeral home's motto is \\"We live to serve,\\" and it is a dictum that the Snowberger clan take to heart. As her father prepares the departed for burial, Comfort's mother handles floral arrangements and her elder brother tends the lawns. Even the family dog, Dismay, does his part by staying with the deceased in the preparation room and by standing stoically for visitations.The author writes in her introduction about the inspiration for the book. In the four years that followed the publication of her last book she lost several family members. It was a situation that left her \\"suffocating in grief,\\" but through it all she learned \\"the meaning of friendship and the power of love.\\"Wiles has written a tender, yet often funny book that deals with several coming-of-age issues. Death is an obvious theme, but the story also addresses the struggle of dealing with agitated family members in times of stress, as well as the strain on friendships as young people mature.Highly recommended for ages 8 to 12, this book will appeal to young people with its strong story line and folksy, small-town humor. Adults will want their children to read a well-written book that confronts some of the struggles their children will face as they approach their teenage years."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Each little bird that sings is wonderful story for any young person that has experienced a loss in their lives.

Comfort lives with death, she lives in a funeral home.Her great uncle Edisto, with his favorite uncle, Allagash, came to a town looking for work and saw a lot of old people sitting around outside. He thought this place needs a funeral home with all these old people around. Edisto and Allagash started out in a sawmill boarding house which worked out fine. The name of this fine funeral home was and still is Snowbergers. That was why Comfort lives in a funeral home.In this book there is more than just the funeral home and people dying. Comfort is trying to get her articles that she writes in the newspaper (her best friend's dad writes it). Comfort is also at edge with her best friend Declaration. Also her great uncle Edisto and his wife passed away just a short while ago, and she is still suffering from the loss. Can Comfort find a way to solve her problems?I would give this book 4.5 stars out of 5 stars. You will love this book the same way as I did. There is lots of suspense that will grab you into the book and push you to read more. The friendship problems are also one of the main problems that goes on in this book.About the AuthorDeborah Wiles was born in Alabama, spending her summers in Mississippi.

This book is markedly different in tone and story, BUT, Ms. Wiles has the imagination and ability to draw characters and place that takes the reader into the story rather than at arm's length.

Comfort Snowberger is a 10-year-old girl that lives in a funeral home and hosts many of the funerals Aurora County has to offer. She thinks she can deal with death, but when her great aunt Florentine drops dead, just like that, everything starts going wrong. Her whiney cousin Peach won't leave her alone, and her best friend Declaration, someone who she could always count on, has turned downright despicable. All this makes her want to go in her closet with her beloved dog, Dismay, and just hide. But then something happens that makes her realize just how strong she is all on her own.Three major things that happen in the book are forgiveness, mystery and courage. Comfort has a very hard time in forgiving Declaration for something that Comfort thinks is all her fault. Declaration was being mean to Comfort and she even told her secret to other popular people in the school. Now it's comfort's turn to make Declaration feel guilty for what she did. Comfort lost something that meant a very great deal to her, and now she has to find the courage inside herself to finally let that go and live her life. There is mystery about her special something, what happened to it? Will she find it again?I really liked this book a lot because Deborah Wiles really captures the moment and describes it down to the smallest detail. It really stands out when you think the book is starting to get boring. The book was very well written and I recommend this book to anyone who likes books about friendship and drama."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"The main character of this story is Comfort Snowberger, a ten year old whose family owns Snowberger Funeral Home in Snapfinger, Missississippi. Comfort experiences deaths in the family and goes through rough times with friends. As sad as the book was I was surprised that there were bits and pieces of comic relief. The book deals with death and gives the readers the understanding that death is a part of life and learning to appreciate life. Families and friends show their love by coming together and being there for family/friends at times like these. Growing up I've had deaths in the family but they were never close relationships. It wasn't till recently that I lost a close friend which made the book a little tougher for me to read. As morbid as the book was there was comic relief and I would recommend this book to someone who has lost a loved one. I think kids could relate to this book and could possibly help them if they are having a hard time coping after losing a loved one."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"I wasn't familiar with this book or Ms. Wiles when it was announced at our last book club meeting, but I came home and immediately started researching it. It has won numerous awards (far too many to mention in this post) including : 2005 National Book Award finalist, Booksense Top-Ten Pick, Borders Bookstores \\"Original Voice\\", Junior Library Guild selection, and Golden Kite Honor Book. Needless to say, I was very excited to read this book and possibly discover a new-to-me author!When I sat down to read this book, I started with the author's acknowledgments section. I was a little surprised by the first sentence, \\"...one death followed another in my family and I came to understand the meaning of friendship and the power of love.\\" I appreciated the author's honestly about how she came to write this novel; and I just had a feeling that EACH LITTLE BIRD THAT SINGS was going to be a very special read for me. Unlike the author, I haven't had much experience at all with the loss of loved ones. (I know you are all scratching your heads because I'm 40 years old!) I still have three of my four grandparents, and it's only been the past few years where I've really lost anyone special. When it comes to death, I probably have the emotional maturity of a middle grade child so this book did appeal to me. I found that this novel touched me deeply and resonated with me on so many levels -- it truly is a wonderful story.As many of you know, I love coming-of-age stories; and I don't think I will ever tire of good ones. EACH LITTLE BIRD THAT SINGS was a beautiful story of a young girl who does a lot of growing up in a very short time. Even though Comfort's family runs a funeral home and she has been to 247 funerals, she find that death is very different when it strikes one of your loved ones. Throughout the course of this book, Comfort faces many surprises as well as tragedies; and she discovers that she has what it takes inside of her to face them all. She learns so many valuable lessons in this book including how to handle loss, how to forgive others, and how to forgive herself. She also learns the very important lesson that different people handle grief in different ways.I absolutely adored Comfort and her family! EACH LITTLE BIRD THAT SINGS is told through the eyes of the 10 year old Comfort. She is a wonderful narrator for this story. Not only is she brutally honest (which is so refreshing,) but she is also very funny! I loved her newspaper articles where she wrote \\"Life Notices\\" not \\"Death Notices;\\" and I thought her writings on funeral etiquette were hilarious. I really appreciated how the author did incorporate a lot of humor into this story because it kept the book from being a downer. Ms. Wiles was able to keep it light at times, and she did a wonderful job of presenting difficult topics to young readers.This book definitely affected me deeply and I even found myself tearing up a few times as I read it. While parts of the book were very, very sad, I also cried at how absolutely beautiful some things were in this story. As Comfort began realizing things about herself and others, her self-less actions were so touching. I know how hard it can be to forgive and let go of anger. I also appreciated all of the little things about life that Comfort's Great-uncle spouted such as: \\"It's not how you die that makes the important impression, Comfort; it's how you live;\\" and \\"Think of disappoint as a happy little surprise, Comfort... There's always something good to come out of disappointment, Comfort. You'll see.\\" And I especially liked this one, \\"Open you arms to life! Let it strut into your hear in all its messy glory.\\" There were just so many examples of words and actions in this novel that showed the reader how truly special life is!I'm going to be honest and tell you that my daughter didn't want to read this book after I told her that it was about dying. She hasn't had to handle the death of a loved one (or even a pet) and she hasn't even attended a funeral yet. I think dying isn't something that she wants to think about yet (of course, who does?) I explained to her that she definitely needs to read EACH LITTLE BIRD SINGS because it's a very good book (for a lot of reasons.) This novel does deal with death and funerals, but it's really about life! I highly recommend it to middle grade readers (and adults too!)I am very anxious to hear what all of the young girls and their mothers think about this book. I admit that I am a little concerned about how my daughter and her friends will react to it. I have a feeling that some of the kids might not understand a lot of the positive messages that I took away from this novel. That's why I'm so looking forward to the discussion! I was so relieved to find that there is a discussion guide of sorts available for EACH LITTLE BIRD THAT SINGS because I think I'm going to need some assistance to talk about this book with kids!"},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Sweet, southern story of life and death and the way we learn to handle both. It's a favorite of my 5th and 6th grade reading classes. My adult book club laughed and cried their way through it, also."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"May contain spoilers.The other day I was speaking to a employee of the publishing house of Harcourt, Inc. We chatted about this and that but eventually I had to ask. What, in this employee's opinion, was Harcourt's best bet for the 2006 Newbery Award? I was told that word on the street was that people were all ah-buzz over author Deborah Wiles', \\"Each Little Bird That Sings\\". I had not heard of this book myself. Despite the fact that I am a children's librarian, and despite the fact that the book was sitting easy-peasy on my bookshelf, I hadn't thus far deigned to take it down and give it a look-see. In doing so I saw all sorts of things that could make it an award winner. Death, good writing, and a dog who shuffles off this mortal coil. But beyond the obvious depressing aspects, Wiles shocked me with the quality of the book. It's peppered with folksy wisdom and tidbits of advice about \\"life\\", but never in a way that feels like the author's laying it on too thick. \\"Each Little Bird That Sings\\" is a delicate balancing act between humor and pain and solid sensible advice for getting through an uneasy world.When you grow up in a funeral home like Comfort Snowberger has, you have a healthy understanding of death. And within a single year Comfort's Great-great-aunt Florentine and Great-uncle Edisto have joined the choir invisible. When Edisto died the funeral would have been beautiful had it not been for Comfort's scrawny, big-eyed, unable-to-quite-grasp-the-concept-of-dying, seven-year-old cousin Peach. Peach managed to faint into a punch bowl, throw up, scream, and generally (in Comfort's eyes) make a nuisance of himself. Now Florentine's funeral is coming up and Peach is in Comfort's life again. Even worse, her best friend Declaration Johnson has suddenly turned mean. Real mean. If it weren't for her dog Dismay, Comfort might never know how to get through the next few days. But it takes losing the most important thing in her world to get our heroine to realize what it is to forgive both yourself and others around you.The book begins with a matter-of-fact mention that Comfort's Great-great-aunt Florentine and Great-uncle Edisto are both dead. When you read this, you're inclined to laugh. A serious subject taken with this much upfront honesty often elicits a nervous chuckle from the kid reading the book. Wiles then immediately tells you exactly who has died and why they were important to the world. Every character is a distinct individual and their every action is completely understandable. To Comfort, growing up with death every day, Peach's violent reaction to it is immature and ridiculous. She's unable to see it his way, consequently making him have to come over to her way of thinking by the story's end. Now I'm about to spout an opinion that will give away a big ole plot point. SPOILER ALERT, if you will. If you would like to read this book through and not have this detail spoiled for you, stop reading right now and just know that I think this story is top notch. A pip. Swell. Nifty. You get the drift. Okay, here's my spoiler. In the book the dog, Dismay, dies. Which technically makes this a \\"dead dog book\\". The libraries of America overflow with this genre. In a recent meeting with librarians from Brooklyn and Queens this book's name came up and someone categorized it as yet another \\"dead dog book\\". I hadn't read it, so I couldn't defend it, but it really is more than that. Yes, the dog dies. Offscreen, I might add. But because of the arc of the story, the dog had to die. Peach has to learn exactly how to deal with the death of not just old people who are ready to go on to the next world but also the young who might have done so much had they lived. And yet the book isn't depressing. Remarkable, no?The book could easily have turned cutesy or, 190 degrees the other way, overly morbid. That it is neither of these is something just short of a miracle. About the time Peach has thrown himself into the coffin of Florentine and is refusing to let go of her neck... well that was the moment I was hooked. As an author, Wiles has guts. She knows just when to sustain a moment or bring it up short. And I challenge anyone to read the last sentence in the book (which is just a hair short of utterly brilliant) and NOT find yourself snuffling back a tear or two. Admittedly, I had a hard time understanding why Peach keeps getting taken to the funerals of the people he loves. In my family, children do not attend funerals. Period. But this is a different family with a different set of values and as such what they do is understandable. They think their kids should understand death.To be perfectly frank, this book does exactly what the lamentable, \\"Ida B\\" by Katherine Hannigan failed to. Where \\"Ida B\\" was all fawning treacle and too often felt like the author was trying too hard, \\"Each Little Bird That Sings\\" appears effortless. It's the kind of story that fellow author Joan Bauer tries to write for young teenagers but who also often falls into the overly saccharine trap of too-many-platitudes-too-little-prose. I was also amazed that author Katherine Hannigan can claim to be friends with such fellow big kiddie lit authors as Nancy Werlin, Deborah Hopkinson, and Norma Mazer. It is obvious that her contact with this talented helps her writing immensely.There are plenty of titles out there meant to help kids understand death. \\"Mick Harte Was Here\\" by Barbara Park is probably the best known, but there are always old classics like, \\"Bridge to Terebithia\\" by Katherine Patterson and hundreds of dead dog books as well. Even younger titles like the recent \\"Michael Rosen's Sad Book\\" can help children deal with loss of one kind or another. \\"Each Little Bird That Sings\\" doesn't deal with children dying. Just older relatives and a beloved family pet. And how Deborah Wiles managed to balance the sweet with the serious with the funny is beyond me. I just know that this is a remarkable little book. There are lots of tears and lots of laughs and some highly satisfying writing going on here. A wonderful title that deserves a lot more attention."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"I liked this book because it deals with the subject of \\"death\\" in such an unusual way ... with a lot of facts and even some humor.Little Comfort is the daughter of funeral home owners and is rather nonchalant about death, having seen it so often, but when it strikes close to home and she has to deal with it on a personal level she learns much more about life ... death ... and how the loved ones left behind must deal with it.Comfort is a lovable, charming, caring girl who comes up with some unique remedies to ease the pain.This is a heartfelt book ... one that teaches children about death in a sensitive way.

With a slicing candor that is at times hard to stomach yet crucial to the book's overall resonance, Deborah Wiles has penned a second novel that will hit readers through the heart.Ten-year-old Comfort Snowberger's family owns and runs the town funeral home in Snapfinger, Mississippi. In her short life, Comfort has attended 247 funerals and has taken part in everything from helping to bake the casseroles for the guests to writing her own version of the newspaper's obituary column, \\"Life Notices by Comfort Snowberger: Explorer, Recipe Tester, and Funeral Reporter.\\" Along with her brother Tidings, her parents, her best friend Declaration, Great-uncle Edisto, Great-great-aunt Florentine, and her dog Dismay, Comfort does her utmost to keep everyone's spirits up under what are oftentimes the dourest of circumstances.Life runs smoothly in the Snowberger household until the day when Great-uncle Edisto has a stroke and dies. A short while later, Great-great-aunt Florentine takes a tumble in the garden and dies as well, peacefully sprawled out amidst the lavender. With so much funeral preparation and mourning to do, the last thing Comfort expects is for Declaration to ignore her in order to befriend two \\"cooler\\" girls at school. To make matters worse, her eight-year-old cousin, Peach, is acting like a baby and receiving all the attention! At the end of it all, Comfort is left feeling confused, hurt, and worst of all, lonely.Then, on the day of Great-great-aunt Florentine's funeral, when a massive storm rages and floodwaters sweep Dismay under the current and threaten to take Comfort and Peach's lives as well, the Snowbergers' somewhat nonchalant and comfortable relationship with death is shaken to its core. But, through straightforward discussions, patience and plenty of hugs to go around, they manage to slowly rebuild their lives by reaffirming their love for one another, their community, and their lives.Deborah Wiles's second novel is a quiet yet immensely arresting read for young adults. From its honest and direct approach to death, to the author's cunning choice of characters' names (Comfort, Declaration, Tidings, Dismay), to the fact that the ending certainly made this grown reviewer cry, EACH LITTLE BIRD THAT SINGS is perfect for fostering parent-child conversations about what it means not only to deal with losing someone you love, but also to be thankful for what you have, while you have it --- \\"grief and fear and hope and love somehow woven together, somehow connected.

Her family runs a funeral home, and she's had a lot of incidents happen lately. Her Uncle Edisto dies, and most recently, her Great-great-aunt Florentine suddenly wares out. The only thing that comfort can rely on is her shaggy black dog Dismay. Comfort is feeling very lonely and feels like she doesn't know what to do. Then everything seems to go even more downhill from there.This realistic fiction book teaches the importance of love and friendship. It proves how close-knit a family can be.

The resolution of Comfort's sorrow and the forgiveness she finally allows herself to feel--these are just great themes for everyone--children and adults.

I think its more for teens then younger kids."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Within the first few pages of this book the reader can find the rest of the words of the song that is referenced in the title. I had learned the song in my junior high choir, but while we sang of the Lord God Loving them all (in public school, no less!), Wiles either knows a different version or chose to edit her book-version to keep things from getting to Jesus-y. Either way, what a relief. The last thing I want to see in the first few pages of a book is a pro-God message - that's a pretty good indication that the book is going to suck.Well, this book far from sucks. In fact, it's the best book I've read in quite a while. I may be saying this because it deals with death and dying, some subjects that have been far too thematic for me this past year, but consider this: I've also been reading a lot on death and dying lately, trying to deal with it all. Some highly recommended by friends, all of them meant for adults. This book, meant for children, is the first one to get it right. It's the first one that has made me cry, and I mean really cry, with a huge pile of kleenex growing at the foot of my couch and a pounding headache afterward.It's hard for me to say what makes Wiles's book so successful, as I think it succeeds on so many levels. Perhaps what I like the most is that she never once writes as if children are less smart versions of adults. Of course, any writer for children will tell you how they think the world of children and would never think of writing down to them, but the fact is quite a few of them do. Not Wiles. I had cringed at first at the cutesy-ness of some of her characters' names, but she turns Comfort Snowberger into a real person, with ego and insecurities, conflicting emotions . . . the whole \\"messy\\" package.Another lovely thing about Wiles book is her way with dialogue. I love dialogue, and will sometimes find myself skimming through the description and narrations of a book to get to some. This was unnecessary with Each Little Bird, as it is filled to the brim, but not over, with beautifully crafted conversations that both entertain and inform. Wiles is able to build her characters through what they say and how they say it, and trusts the reader to interpret on their own.This is one of the most wonderful things about Wiles work, and a mark of a truly good kid's book. Any book, in fact. An author, having figured something out about their character, is tempted to declare it on paper. If they can keep from doing so, the reader will draw their own conclusions from the facts at hand, thus drawing them into the story and making them a part of the events at hand. Wiles is a master at showing just enough, and never telling.Another wonderful thing about the dialogue is that while it is undeniably Southern, it is not overdone. The characters do say things like pic-a-nic, but you will never find them saying things like y'all, and thank goodness Wiles does not try to write their accent into the text, a horrible thing that far too many writers do. It is her careful balance of language and action along with a good sense of timing, which keep the story feeling real and alive.In the end, that is the best thing about Wiles's book - it just feels real. She has written honestly and plainly about a subject too often dressed up and disguised to make us feel better, or feel less. This is not to say Each Little Bird is a depressing read. Wiles is wise to take care of her main character, and has given her enough support so that in the end she may have suffered, but one gets the sense that not only will she be okay, she has grown and will be better off for it.I can't wait to read the rest of Wiles's stuff. If anyone I know is reading this, that's what I would like for Christmas."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Each Little Bird That Sings is written by Deborah Wiles and is a fictional book. It takes place at Snowbergers, the family owned funeral home. Comfort lives at Snowbergers and is dreading the upcoming funeral where her whiny cousin Peach will be. That's not the only thing that Comfort is having a hard time with. Her best friend, Declaration, is acting different then normal. The only thing she can rely on is her beloved dog, Dismay.I thought the part of the book where Declaration tells Comfort that it is not ladylike to climb Listening rock, their favorite place, it was unexpected and showed how quickly she had grown up after being with her grandma. Another part I liked was when Comforts aunt died and how the author described the scene it was kind of funny.I liked this book and would definitely recommend it for others. The ending could've been improved. But I would surely put it on my bookshelf of favorite books. I thought that the author was very descriptive and did a really good job of writing this story."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"even though it was really sad the writing was fabulous (a quote from my 7 year old son). we read this aloud and really loved it.

Comfort Snowberger writes her own obituaries and tries to have them published in the local paper. She also has a list of \\"Top Ten Tips for First-rate Funeral Behavior\\" that, while hilarious, contains sound advice.Death is a hard subject for adults and almost impossible for children to deal with. Comfort comes from a family that deals with it on a daily basis. The ten-year-old's family runs a funeral home, and she and her dog, Dismay, do their part to console the bereaved. But when death strikes the family, not once, but twice within a year, Comfort has to learn to deal with it on a personal level.First is great Uncle Edisto, who has taught Comfort much about life and how it relates to dying. When great-great Aunt Florentine passes, it is almost more than Comfort can process in her young mind. She tries to do what she has learned from her family: the job of the survivor is to go on living.This could be easier if her best friend, Declaration hadn't decided that now is the time to find other friends, friends who seem to exclude Comfort.Comfort loves her family, her friends and her dog. She tries so hard to do what is right. Knowing that forgiveness is the right thing to do doesn't make it come easily, though, even when she needs forgiving as well.

The whole family works in the business. Thus, Comfort has been to hundreds of funerals. This is not a normal thing for a ten year old girl. Comfort is a very unique and unusual girl.I was especially impressed with Comfort's voice. It is, like her, unique and unusual. Part of this, I'm sure, is the setting, Mississippi. There is a strong southern flavor which extends to people's names as well. Comfort's brother is Tidings, her dog is Dismay, her best friend is Declaration, and her whiny cousin is Peach.Comfort sits in the closet when she needs to think. She visits the cemetery frequently to talk to dead friends and relatives. She also plays normal kid's games and has friends who are normal kids as well. However, Comfort's friends understand her uniqueness. And, it seems, she does not have a wide circle of friends. Comfort is also a writer of cookbooks (how to make food dishes for funerals) and a writer of obituaries, which she reads regularly as well. The most important thing in her life is her dog, Dismay. Dismay is also not the usual dog. He is a funeral dog. He provides comfort to those who are grieving.Comfort is not like any ten year old girl I have known but I would really like to meet her someday. She has a way of looking at the world that is unlike most people I have known. It would be interesting to spend a day with her, but after reading the book, I feel that in some way I have met her.Each Little Bird That Sings is a unique story for children. I'm not so sure, however, that it is written at the level that most children understand. While Comfort certainly seems in many ways to be a ten year old, in some other ways she seems far beyond her years. The book had a great deal of humor, but again, I'm not sure that children got a lot of it. Certainly, much of it is at an adult level. I truly enjoyed this book because it took a unique setting with a unique character to go along with it. Growing up in a funeral home is not a common theme in children's literature. I think the author did an outstanding job with such an unusual theme, but did not always target the age of her audience."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"My 4th grader loved this story!

But, the author was not content with making Comfort deal with one or even two deaths. Comfort must deal with three deaths and she feels responsible for one of them. Oh, and on top of that, she must also deal with the pain of having her best friend choosing new friends who believe that Comfort is odd. Not only is Declaration acting mean toward Comfort, her cousin and her dog; she also has a nasty role to play in one of the deaths. And, can we just talk about the names! Comfort's Mom is Joy, her older brother is called Tidings (I get it: \\"Tidings of Comfort and Joy\\"), her dog's name is Dismay, her male cousin is Peach, her former best friend is Declaration! How did baby sister get the plain name of Mary? There was some humor in this book, if you can believe it! Comfort writes amusing obituaries, and there are a couple of cute recipes. But, nothing can counteract the fact that the author has chosen to pile on disaster after disaster in the life of this young girl who, in the words of her family, \\"has learned how to serve.\\" If you give this to your child, prepare to deal with lots of real grief with no relief!"},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"I have yet to receive this product bought over a month ago and i doubt that I ever will.

She has a best friend named Declaration their always together. She has a dog-named Dismay she really likes that dog.

I was a little unsure about the book for him based on the subject matter, but after having read this book, I'd certainly recommend it for his age and up. Even as an adult, I found myself compelled by Deborah Wiles story telling and its ability to transport me back to some tough times that I had in my childhood.Comfort Snowberger, the main character, lives in a funeral home, her family's business and is around death quite a lot. However, things do start to unravel for her when first her Uncle Edisto and then her great, great Aunt Florentine die within the space of a year. And if that wasn't enough, her best friend Declaration is acting weird to her and hanging out with a bunch of other girls. And this isn't the end of the problems for Comfort as she faces more problems with her most dependable companion Dismay, her dog.Of course, the outlines of the plot are common, but once again what really makes this book so good is Wiles' ability to do three things exceptionally well: (1) she creates a wonderful sense of person and place. We really feel like we know small-town Snapfinger, Mississippi and the characters -- while they may not be Peach, Declaration or Uncle Edisto, they do reflect individuals from our youth, (2) Wiles' enables both youth and adults to be empathetic to Comfort becasue we all can relate to what she is going through from our own personal experiences, (3) in spite of the problems Comfort is going through, there is a great sense of irony through out this book. It may be more noticeable for an adult, but that certainly helps making it an enjoyable read for someone like me.Overall, I'd highly recommend this book to young adults and even adults to share reading with them."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Let me start out with this- Each little bird that sings is a great book. It's about a girl who lives in a funeral home, amidst a beauty-queen mom, brat-of-a-cousin, and a comforting dog named Dismay. The girl's name is Comfort, Comfort Snowberger, an 11-year-old who lives in the small town of Snapfinger. Comfort's life was thrown like a rag doll when her great-uncle Edisto died. They had gone on \\"pic-a-nics\\", played games, and had great times with each other. Just after recovering from Edisto's death, Comfort's great-great-aunt Florentine dies in her garden. Comfort is devastated. In the days leading up to Aunt Florentine's funeral, Comfort's cousin, Peach, comes. Comfort's best friend hates Peach, and starts to avoid Comfort. Finally, Declaration, Comfort's BFF, agrees to come to Aunt Florentine's funeral, but she's REALLY mean to Comfort. The rest of the book consists of a flash-flood, lost dog, and a friendship that might never be regained. If you want a good, true-to-life book to read this summer, this is for you! I love the way that what Comfort says is so REAL that you can almost picture that she exists! I also like how there's little bits and pieces of recipes, newspaper articles, and journal entries in this book. Wiles does a great job discribing life and the world of Snapfinger from an 11-year-old's eyes. So go ahead, buy this book, and rejoice in the truth of one author's words."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"This book is a great book for anyone of any age to read.

The story takes place in Snapfinger, Mississippi in present times. The main character, Comfort Snowberger, is a ten year old girl who lives at a funeral home right near the cemetery. Her best friend is Dismay, her wonderful, \\"feel-good dog\\". Wiles writes about Comfort's challenges with death, fear, anger, and her ever-so-annoying cousin, Peach. Meanwhile, Comfort's old best friend, Declaration, seems to be getting meaner by the second. So when worst comes to worst, friends are lost, yet the future still holds promise.I liked most of this book, but I'll have to say this part was one of my favorites. In one scene about 1/5 of the way into the book, Comfort is making her way up to Listening Rock and describes everything. After just one paragraph you get a crystal clear picture in your head. \\"A thick stand of rose of Sharon bushes guarded the path with strong woody branches full of wide pink blooms.\\" is one of the descriptive sentences from the novel. This section made me feel as though I was actually there. I felt calm but excited to see what would happen next.This is my evaluation of the book. Overall I thought Each Little Bird That Sings is a pretty good book. I think there are two morals to this book: 1) don't judge people immediately and 2) to forgive. This book was little bit easy for my reading level, but I still enjoyed it. A lot of this book was sad or scary so I will probably remember it well. I would have to think about whether this book should be on my favorite bookshelf, but in the end I would probably add it to my favorites."},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"Each Little Bird that Sings By:Deborah Wies is a good book but sad at the same time.There are at the most 9 main characters Comfort,her Mom,her Dad,Declaration,Peach,Tidings,Aunt Goldie,Aunt Flurentine,and Uncle Edisto.The book is about a family that has suffered many losses like they're Aunt,An Uncle,And they're family pet Dismay who was swept away in a flood.I think everyone should read this book because it's a good book and it teaches you that life isn't always easy,and it teaches you how to solve every day problems.So please try to read this book I know you will like it!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Each Little Bird That Sings (Golden Kite Honors)","review":"This book is wonderful.

Most of the authors are faculty members of that system. The book tries to flesh out what gender studies in and of the Caribbean would look like. It divides into four sections: cultural theory, education, history, and literature.I had some concerns that this would just be a repeat of Rafael Ramirez's text \\"Caribbean Masculinities.\\" Though Dr. Ramirez provides a prologue, only one chapter exists in both books. Still, other chapter are included or part of book length works (Parry's and Crichlow's chapters, for example). The contributors are both male and female. With the exception of one person, all of them either work in or come from the Caribbean.Though Jamaica does receive the most attention, the contributors try to be diverse in their coverage of the Caribbean landscape. A chapter on Dominicans illustrates lingual diversity. However, there is no chapter about Haitians, Caribbean Francophones are not mentioned in this book. There is a chapter on an ethnic group in Belize. I suppose the editors think of the Caribbean as any nation that touches about the Mexican Gulf.I thought the section on education and history were the strongest. The theory section in the beginning would be informative for readers who know little about gender studies. However, it may bore those who know a lot on the topic. By far, the worst section is the literature section. Perhaps that is why it is placed last. It is uneven: the penultimate chapter is 80 pages while the ultimate chapter, not a conclusion I might add, was only 17. It was the real yawner section of the book.This book tries hard not to equate the Caribbean solely with people of African descent. Still, its discussion of East Indians in the region is scant. What is amazing is how so many topics that concern African Americans seems to concern Caribbean nations. Preparation for the changing economy, the superior educational performance of girls and women compared to boys and men, the effect of \\"gansta\\" personas on musicians and their male audiences, and much more must be controversies both within and outside of American borders. One thing that annoyed me is that one writer quotes bell hooks as not having a \\"z\\" in the word \\"socializing.\\" Hello, bell hooks is American and writes in American English. The two writing styles are not so different that one should edit out the specifics. Worse, they do not even admit that they are doing it. It's practically like a misquote and misrepresentation. Both Black Americanists and pan-Africanists should find this text useful.On the cover and at the beginning of each chapter, there is a drawing of a skeleton in a man's suit. I think he's a skeleton and not a living man in order to erase racial specificity. However, the skeleton brings up issues of voodoo. Thus, readers will still code him as black. Further, this voodoo/zombie image is somewhat a stereotypical image of Caribbean men. I am not sure why they use it. I doubt that it's helpful to their project."},{"Title":"Confronting Power Theorizing Gender: Interdisciplinary Perspectives in the Caribbean","review":"This fascinating and provocative gendered analysis of Caribbean politics and society is a welcome addition to the literature.

Originally a luxury hotel, it has fallen on hard times and is being used to host a murder mystery hotel. However, someone is taking the &quot;murder&quot; aspect of the game far too seriously...Waiting in the wings are the Selachians, an alien race with a serious axe to grind after years of persecution, who are after something in the hotel which will help them revenge their mistreatment. They are quite complex, rather than being simple killing machines that many alien races are depicted as in Doctor Who.The novel features good portrayals of Ben and Polly, who show stronger feelings for each other than have otherwise been portrayed. This doesn't surprise me, as they more-or-less flirted with each other at various points.While the story is not as complex as many Doctor Who novels, however this suits the period of the show in which this story is set. It doesn't require familiarity with the show to be enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Murder Game (Doctor Who (BBC Paperback))","review":"This was a great cross-over book, mystery to science fiction. Doctor Who, Ben and Polly, receive a distress call and materialize on a mostly abandoned hotel ship, where a mystery weekend is being sponsored with a handful of guests. The presence of the Doctor and his companions make just enough people on the ship for the participants to play the game. Until real dead bodies begin to turn up! The only part about this book I didn't like were the baddies, the Selachians; shark-like aliens who stomp around the hotel ship in their own version of astronaut suits which provide the Selachians with the watery atmosphere they need to survive. I thought this was a bit _too_ wierd, but they did their job as bad guys well enough!"},{"Title":"The Murder Game (Doctor Who (BBC Paperback))","review":"Typically Troughton is probably the hardest Doctor to write in the original novels because his portrayal was often based on his pretending to be the fool, when in reality he was often the only one who did know what was going on, but didn't want to let on that he knew. As a lot of his episodes were erased, most people haven't really seen his stories and thus tend to think of him as the silly Charlie Chaplin slapstick Doctor from the more widely distributed color stories, plus a lot of his serials only survive in audio form, which gives you part of the story but not the whole deal. Strangely, his charactization is one of the aspects this book gets right, when a number of other things just don't work as well. The TARDIS crew (Ben and Polly here) land in a modified \\"base under siege\\" (a common story type in Troughton serials) scenario, winding up at a space hotel that is playing host to a murder mystery game. The crew is actually there because they got a distress signal, but quickly they insinuate themselves into the game, just as the game becomes real and people start actually dying. The basic premise is sound but the author doesn't actually pull it off with any real flair, just sort of going through the motions. The mystery of who the killer is gets dealt with early on without any real tension, especially as none of the characters are really that compelling to begin with, so once people start getting bumped off, you find that you don't really care all that much. It then devolves into people running from one end of the hotel to the other in different groups, either getting attacked or trying to figure out who's doing the attacking, while the plot sort of churns away in the background, not doing much of anything. It doesn't really twist or startle and when the shark aliens finally show up, way earlier than you'd expect, it seems more like they just got tired of the murder plot and wanted to do something else. The aliens aren't especially scary either, their menace comes from the fact that they want to kill everyone but for the most part they stand around insulting humans and shooting people every so often. They're an interesting concept but I think they were handled better in other novels. So you're left with a plot that basically chugs along until you run out of pages, it's not bad but it's not especially memorable either. The story does a little bit with the \\"Do Ben and Polly fancy each other?\\" subplot, but really doesn't go anywhere with it, although it is funny to see Ben attempting to flirt. So it evokes the era, but maybe not in the best way, as I said, Troughton's a hard one to capture properly, but with a few more twists or turns, this could have been a lot more exciting than it actually was."},{"Title":"The Murder Game (Doctor Who (BBC Paperback))","review":"The Murder Game (Dr. Who Series) by Steve Lyons is yet another great Doctor adventure. The Doctor follows a distress call to the year 2146 and the run down Hotel Galaxian. Here he finds a role-playing murder mystery game about to get underway. Soon however the game becomes all too real. There are twist and turns in the story in true Doctor fashion and the introduction of the Selachians an alien aquatic warrior race.The second Doctor travels with two companions in this novel, Ben and Polly. I have never seen an episode with this Doctor but it simply doesn't matter. Even without being able to picture the second Doctor in my head, just knowing the Doctor and his personality was enough to quickly get me into this story."},{"Title":"Potluck at Midnight Farm: Celebrating food, family, and friends on Martha's Vineyard","review":"This book was given to me as a hostess gift during our first cocktail party (Ina Garten and Barefoot Contessa inspired) from a friend who knows that I love all things New England, especially Cape Cod and the Islands.The photographs are delicious in and of themselves, even inspiring a few unusual bouquets of flowers and eclectic ideas for table settings. There are a few recipes that seem unappealing to me, but that is true of any book. An author simply cannot please everyone! For the most part I have found these recipes to have different and creative twists on many favorite flavors.I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the &quot;magical&quot; element of the Vineyard as well as its' celebrity life. This is certainly not a book for those who want to throw hot dogs on the grill behind a split -evel home - not that there is anything wrong with that!

I first made the Lighthouse Lasagne and everyone raved, then onto the corn spoon pudding at another occasion, did I mention the Roasted Herb and Garlic Chicken, Tooo Good! This is a great cookbook for ANYONE that gets invited (To be so Lucky )a potluck with their children. How wonderful it is to spend an evening with friends and you're children and have great family food and fellowship. This is not a celebrity cookbook as some have mentioned, but rather a wAY TO get together book."},{"Title":"Potluck at Midnight Farm: Celebrating food, family, and friends on Martha's Vineyard","review":"Ignore the parochial carping and celebrity baiting found in the previous reviews. This is actually a handsome and useful book. Not all of recipes are keepers, but that's true of any cookbook. The good ones, though, are quite good (the fried chicken is sensational), and the entertaining tips are savvy and valuable. Well worth the [money]."},{"Title":"Potluck at Midnight Farm: Celebrating food, family, and friends on Martha's Vineyard","review":"Sure it's fun looking. Great pictures. But some of the recipes I tried were far from good and I AM a cook. In addition, once you look through it, you get a little tired of seeing all of these gorgeous faces in glamourous settings and long for something a bit more &quot;real&quot;. I am not sure why I bought this- and I will get a little fun out of it, but I will be passing it on as it is not a keeper. Makes a decent GIFT, but for the serious cook- or even the not so serious cook- this will be like an afternoon with People Magazine. Not a lot worth remembering."},{"Title":"Potluck at Midnight Farm: Celebrating food, family, and friends on Martha's Vineyard","review":"i bought the book because i have spent 25 years going to martha's vineyard--the book is inspiring because it makes you want to have a potluck party at your own home--but dont buy it simply for the recipes--they are fine--buy it because its a fun addition to your collection and inspires you to celebrate family and friends-- and martha's vineyard--the author's friends (whom she touts as a very eclectic group) happen to include all of the island's celebs---which does make it fun to look at the pics and read their recipes--"},{"Title":"Potluck at Midnight Farm: Celebrating food, family, and friends on Martha's Vineyard","review":"This beautifully photographed book is more than a cookbook. Each guest who brought a dish contributed a paragraph explaining the value their recipe holds to them personally. It is nice to see a warm sense of friendship and community so fashionably displayed and organized. The fear factor is taken out of shying away from trying the recipes as these are favorites and specialties of the recipe contributors. You will find something new everytime you open the book, just as if you were to visit Midnight Farm itself."},{"Title":"Potluck at Midnight Farm: Celebrating food, family, and friends on Martha's Vineyard","review":"I love this book!

There are a few recipes that seem unappealing to me, but that is true of any book. An author simply cannot please everyone! For the most part I have found these recipes to have different and creative twists on many favorite flavors.I recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in the &quot;magical&quot; element of the Vineyard as well as its' celebrity life. This is certainly not a book for those who want to throw hot dogs on the grill behind a split -evel home - not that there is anything wrong with that! It is for those who want to add an element of style to their backyard picnic behind that same split-level home.

Besides thoroughness, he insisted in the importance of etymology as inclusive of a good dictionary, a feature that is here detailed with precision, and something that is often left out of impressive volumes like the &quot;Oxford Illustrated&quot;, published by DK Publishing.This is a huge volume (about 3&quot; thick), beautifully presented in library style binding and wafer thin, high quality paper. It includes illustrations, anecdotes, stories on word origins and usage; and even synonyms of particularly interesting words. These references are spread throughout the pages in different blocks of color for easy recognition. The illustrations are very realistic, using colors that approach the ones given by Mother Nature. Before starting to use it, I reccommend paying close attention to the &quot;Explanatory Notes&quot;. Here is everything needed to know in order to milk this dictionary to its fullest. Every reason is given as to why items appear listed in the way they do, what were the basis used for etymology of the words, etc. The &quot;Guide to Pronounciation&quot; is both interesting and exciting, enabling us to produce a myriad of sounds we probably never knew existed. I am the kind of reader who looks up every unknown word in her dictionary and, so far, there is not a single one I haven't found; not even if belonging to a dialect or if it is a word with foreign roots.Two appendixes complete this magnanimous volume: a biographical one and a geographical guide. Although brief, these two listings will quickly clear up any doubts on identity or place. There are also listings for symbols, such as weather, chemistry, mathematics, even stamp collecting. A supplementary &quot;Handbook of Style&quot; to refer to when writing a paper or in need of punctuation advise completes the dictionary and makes also an invaluable tool for writers of any kind.This is THE dictionary that should be in every household as a more general, complete reference. Even if there are other, smaller or more specific references around; you would want this volume as your backbone."},{"Title":"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary & Thesaurus, Electronic Edition","review":"I admit to being a dictionary freak, but never in my fondest fantasies did I think an English dictionary would appear containing precise, concise, euphonic, professional pronunciations of the vernacular as it is spoken (or supposed to be spoken) in this country. And then it showed up! Ah, such joy. English is my second language, but just barely (I learned it when I was about 4 from my Nanny, Miss Smith). Half my family spoke vedy vedy Oxford English, and the other half no English at all, so I was brought up in an absurd greenhouse full of strange verbal emissions; from there I was released into this country to learn my first swearwords and how to pronounce things entirely differently. The result is that I have many pronunciation lacunas: either because I had never heard a word before and so I had to boldly figure it out on my own, or because I just didn't have the phonemes to correctly enunciate words like \\"nurse\\" or \\"bird.\\" As a result I have often engaged in awful arguments about how certain words should be said: my version of \\"scone,\\" for example, did not rhyme with stone, and was therefore universally derided by some of my American friends as peculiar and wrong. Attempts to settle on the correct pronunciation of words by means the horrific and arcane symbols used in dictionaries was futile.As soon as I installed this program I entered the word \\"scone;\\" and on the right side of the screen the word appeared in blue (meaning that the program would pronounce it); and when I clicked on it, the wonderful sound of a properly pronounced \\"scone\\" issued from the speakers.Next on my list of peeves came \\"nuclear;\\" the dictionary advised me to unpeeve myself off this one, because (according to M-W) our president's \\"nukelar\\" is an accepted pronunciation \\"which has found widespread use among educated speakers, including scientists, layers, professors, congressmen, U.S. cabinet members, and at least one U.S. president....\\" Oh, my!Words taken from French (as is usual with English speakers) are correctly pronounced: such as \\"hors d'oeuvre;\\" while those borrowed from the Spanish, (as is usual with English speakers) are generally mispronounced (including the two attempts at \\"rodeo\\"). Some words are not pronounced at all, at least in my copy of the book, (such as \\"umlaut\\"), and I suspect that there are a few bugs in the program that underlies the book. But for now it is honeymoon time and I am spending an inordinate amount of hours loving this CD-ROM and not wanting to perceive that there is anything wrong with it. In a few months I may have to amend this review.The speakers of the words are professional actors, one male, one female, and their diction is a true joy.

Also, the coverage is surprisingly broad. I've often found words in the Merriam-Webster's that are missing in other dictionaries.Beyond that, Merriam-Webster's breathes life into those words with an engaging history of the English language and a date each word is first noted in print.

The number of synonyms it offers for many words is pitifully small--just a few in many cases.

That's great. The problem is that the software is difficult to install and annoying to use. There is an install optinon to install the sound data on your hard drive. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. There is a 29 page PDF manual which tells you how to install the sound manually, but that doesn't work either. There is a large readme file which gives completely different instructions for this task, and it is also incorrect, but it will get you close enough that you can figure out the rest if you are good with computers. When you launch the program, you get a splash screen that says \\"Authority & Inovation.\\" While you are trying to figure out what that means and waiting for the program to launch, you have the feeling that you could have walked over to your bookshelf and looked up the word in the hardcover edition and saved time. MS Word, previously the slowest program I use, is up and running in half the time. There is a lot that doesn't work like you would expect. If you click on \\"Spelling Help\\" and type \\"annoying\\" into the dialog box and click OK, it says \\"No entries found!\\" Somewhere in the manual it probably tells you what you have to do to make it work.

I thought to buy the Unabridged CD Edition but it doesn't have the audio pronounciation :(, why they just create a version with a 2 or more disc set that can contain all the audio files or just create a DVD version? This is certainly a disapointment to me but not for this Edition though.Another nice part I like is the illustrations to the words. Nicer, in some of the pictures, there are also descriptions, such as for horse, it also points out every part of the horse itself....The macros installed into the MS Word are also a very good feature.

I suppose that's really a minor quibble, but it bugs me greatly because there's no reason beyond lazy programming that it couldn't have offered a tray icon option.The two exceptions to that are if you're writing in MS Word or Corel's WordPerfect, where macros can be installed as buttons, allowing you to highlight a word and pop it up in the dictionary/thesaurus by clicking that button.But that's a sadly limited use of a major program's pop-up capability, which with a little extra programming could have been expanded to include virtually any selected word on the screen, as is possible with some other electronic dictionaries.That notwithstanding, the program offers the same robust selection of definitions and synonyms you'll find in the printed Merriam-Webster Collegiate, but with a number of easily clickable search options for finding them. They're also presented in basically the same excellent format Merriam-Webster uses in its printed versions.If you can't find a suitable word in the 225,000 definitions and 340,000 synonyms and related words available in this program, you're probably looking for something that'll drive whoever's reading what you're writing to a dictionary.Selecting the dictionary or thesaurus is as quick and easy as clicking on either from a drop-down menu prominently at the top of the program -- and you can set either as the default on startup.Other configuration preferences are sparsely limited to changing text size/color and background color, and setting a default for any of the 19 search \\"types.\\"To look up a word, you can select from three tabbed options:Basic Searches (Entry word is...): You'd likely use this most. As soon as you enter the first letter a list pops up in a lower window with everything beginning with that letter. As you type additional letters, you increasingly drill down to words nearer what you're looking for, ending with your word highlighted when you type the final letter. This is basically exactly the same routine as when you use the \\"Find\\" feature of any Windows help program -- and sure beats flipping through pages of a book.Advanced Searches: This is a Boolean thing using AND, OR, NOT and some possible parenthetical expressions. I found it to be mostly an advanced piece of uselessness.Browse: This is basically like thumbing through a printed dictionary starting at some letter and functions exactly the same as drilling down through the letters of a word using the Basic search feature. But -- and that's a big BUT -- its two options of searching for either the beginning or ending of a word can be a lifesaver when you have no idea how to begin spelling that word. For example: Try looking up \\"ptarmigan\\" under \\"T\\" or \\"mnemonic\\" under \\"N.\\" You'll get nowhere fast on either. But search for the fairly obvious endings and sooner than later you'll find those words.One other quibble I have with this program is that it refuses to recognize my USB mouse wheel for scrolling through the word lists. But I've learned to be content with the side slider.Its few shortcomings aside, at Amazon's price this program's a world-class bargain, functions flawlessly for what it's intended and hands down beats wrestling with a book."},{"Title":"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary & Thesaurus, Electronic Edition","review":"Bought it.

Astrid Proll's short 1998 narrative and musings on her experiences makes somewhat interesting reading, but this is not a history or work of analysis, and readers who are seeking such will be disappointed. _Pictures on the Run_ serves as a unique and invaluable accompaniment to Stefan Aust's volume, and should be seen as such. If the reader isn't already familiar with the photo subjects, s/he will only be perplexed by the single line captions. If like me, however, you are intrigued by the RAF and the Deutsche Herbst, you will keep this book beside you as you read Aust, Becker, Vague, and Baumann. You will return to the pictures again and again, and some of the faces will haunt you."},{"Title":"Baader Meinhof: Pictures on the Run 67-77","review":"VERY INTERESTING! - A must for anyone interested in BAADER MEINHOF!

Astrid Proll was a minor activist who served a jail sentence and then fled to England, she is not representative of this movement and some of her comments are wrong, but the photographs of these fallen young revolutionary's are intriguing."},{"Title":"Baader Meinhof: Pictures on the Run 67-77","review":"While some of the accounts are informative, this book is simply a blatant project to make money. The crimes committed by the group were hideous and, how better to squeeze a little more out of the publicity by justifying them?The photographs in this book are bad, taken by an amateur and tell no story. They're of minimal interest and do nothing to help explain anything of what really went on behind these scenes. I do not understand how the reviewer from the New York times can describe the pictures as &quot;daunting&quot; ad &quot;carefully selected&quot;. They're a haphazardly thrown together group of nothing. If these were the best of the bunch, the bad ones must have been terrible.I think I might be a little less hostile if this book were a lot cheaper, but I was expecting a lot more substance and pictures of more than marginal interest. My advice would be to try and check this book in the local library first to make sure it is what you thought it was."},{"Title":"Spoken Greek","review":"The book is a good introduction for the people who want to learn the Greek language beyond the greek basics.

James Martin. According to the introduction, the revised edition renews the printer's type, restyles the books, corrects some errors in the text and removes some references which have become outdated. In addition, Biblical quotations in the commentaries use the Revised Standard Version instead of the King James Version (however Barclay's own translation is retained at the beginning of each daily section).The reality of the revised edition is quite different. What the introduction fails to mention is that the 17 volumes of the revised edition of the New Testament have 12.6% fewer pages than the now out-of-print 2nd edition. Only the 2nd edition contains all of Barclay's commentary on the New Testament. For example, in the 2 volumes on the Gospel of John, the revised edition contains 547 pages; however the 2nd edition contained 634 pages. Thus, the revised edition has 13.7% fewer pages than the 2nd edition. In the 2 volumes on Revelation, the reduction is over 20%.I first noticed the selective deletion of portions of Barclay's original commentary in the commentary for John 13:33-35, in which Jesus speaks of loving one another as he loved us. In the 2nd edition, Barclay so beautifully states the following: &quot;He [Jesus] knew all their [his disciples] weaknesses and yet He still loved them. Those who really love us are the people who know us at our worst and who still love us.&quot; However, these two sentences do not appear in Martin's revised edition. Repeatedly, key sentences and phrases are deleted from the revised edition. The revised edition is in fact a condensed and inferior version of the commentaries actually written by William Barclay. I do believe that William Barclay's commentaries are the most insightful and meaningful commentaries that I have ever read on the New Testament, and I cannot recommend them highly enough. They have truly changed my life. However, if you want to read all of what Barclay actually said instead of what Martin thought was important enough to leave in, then check with a used book store or do a used book search on the internet to get the 2nd editions of the Gospel of John or other volumes in the Daily Study Bible."},{"Title":"The Gospel of John, Volume 1 (The Daily Study Bible Series, Revised Edition)","review":"Barclay's writings speak to me like none other. William Barclay passed on in the early 1980's, but thankfully, he left behind so much of his useful and practical knowledge.Of these DSB series, John is my favorite.Barclay's book on John says that this disciple was portrayed as &quot;The Eagle&quot; because he saw things from a higher, more spiritual view and his writings had more metaphysical meat to them.Barclay's exegesis on John really brings that out.And the thing I love most about this book is the practicality of his teachings. It's not a dry or dusty interpretation, but a here and now explanation. He makes the writings of these men come alive and then shows how the teachings of Jesus are practical and applicable to all the needs of mankind - for now and forever.As someone else once said of this remarkable man, William Barclay, &quot;he saved the Bible from the experts.&quot;John was the first of this series that I read.

At points a whirlwind tour through some of the major trends in intellectual history since Plato, The Eclipse of Reason can be as dense as it is potent. It will reward only a close and careful reading.\\"Progress threatens to nullify the very goal it is supposed to realize - the idea of man\\" (v). This sentence, contained in the Preface, concisely states the main concern that animates the entire book. The Enlightenment comes in for heavy critique throughout these pages, for in separating reason from religion it \\"retained God, but not grace\\" (11) and effectively killed metaphysics. Having cut itself off from any notion of a grounding worldview, it finds its ultimate expression in the development of the American worldview, as best expressed in the only philosophical movement to have ever grown up out of America's own soil: Pragmatism, which Horkheimer writes \\"reflects a society that has no time to remember and meditate\\" (30).The lack of time and transcendence - the lack of any fundamental notion of Truth, which is fundamental to American liberalism - helps undermine any and all notions of beauty as a revealing of Truth. The reduction of everything to mere practicality robs humanity of something fundamental to it, which is contained in the work of art: seeing something beyond ourselves, outside of ourselves. Practicality reduces everything to a mere tool: and this is the essence of totalitarian violence.Digging deeper, Horkheimer reaches back to the very origin of modern thought on the individual: Socrates. This individualism grows with the Reformation, and then the Enlightenment; against this rise in individualism is itself the huge shifts in Christianity that began in earnest with the Reformation: a Christianity that, like Hamlet, has lost its Christian faith but not its Christian soul (93). The collapse of the medieval worldview and the loss of the Church as the central authority meant that the Christian conception of self - and individual made in the image of God, thus invested with infinite worth and given the opportunity of moral choice - would continue without the Christian concept of authority. This individual would, however, even lose its cosmic worth as technology progressed; the individual would eventually become nothing more than an economic unit.In the end, all of this leads to the death of philosophy, meaning that \\"irrationality still molds the fate of men\\" (106). Thus, Horkheimer's conclusion is worth quoting in full: \\"If by enlightenment and intellectual progress we mean the freeing of man from superstitious belief in evil forces, in demons and fairies, in blind fate - in short, emancipation of fear - then denunciation of what is currently called reason is the greatest service reason can render\\" (126)."},{"Title":"Eclipse of Reason","review":"Horkheimer's book, Eclipse of Reason deals with the concept of &quot;reason&quot; within the history of Western philosophy. Horkheimer defines true reason as rationality. He details the difference between objective and subjective reason and states that we have moved from objective to subjective. Objective reason deals with universal truths that dictate that an action is either right or wrong. Subjective reason takes into account the situation and social norms. Actions that produce the best situation for the individual are &quot;reasonable&quot; according to subjective reason. The movement from one type of reason to the other occurred when thought could no longer accommodate these objective truths or when it judged them to be delusions. Under subjective reason, concepts lose their meaning. All concepts must be strictly functional to be reasonable. Because subjective reason rules, the ideals of a society, for example democratic ideals, become dependent on the &quot;interests&quot; of the people instead of being dependent on objective truths.Horkheimer is writing in 1946 and is influenced by Nazi power in Germany. He is outlining how the Nazis were able to make their agenda appear &quot;reasonable&quot;. He is also issuing a warning against this happening again. Horkheimer believes that the ills of modern society are caused by the misuse and misunderstanding of reason. If people use true reason to critique their societies, they will be able to identify and solve their problems."},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"I'm sure I'm in the majority; those of us who enjoy smoking a pipe, but could never imagine spending $1000 on one (or more than a few hundred for me). This book mainly discusses those extremely expensive pieces, but in the authors defense, he claims to smoke them, so whatever floats his boat. There is also really good political commentary, discussion on pipe mechanics, and the book is nicely written and easy to read. If you want something nice to read about how the rich people enjoy their pipe tobacco, this is your book. If you resent the uber wealthy contingent of pipe smokers, this book might cause fits of rage for you. I'm a tolerant guy, I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"Great reading. A pipe adventure book where the author details his expeditions throughout Europe with the pipemakers themselves. A little too much emphasis on how the author's pipe must be modified to enjoy, but we each must enjoy our pipes however we feel. Too bad the pictures aren't in color to see the detail of these high end pipes."},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"This is a great book for anyone who smokes a pipe. Rick Newcombe has some very definite ideas about pipes and he shares them with us in 24 great chapters. I find myself going back to the book and reading some chapters over and over again. Then there is the introduction and epilogue by Albert Mendez, both of which are outstanding. Don't miss this book - it is a Pipe Classic."},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"While I found this book interesting overall it is probably not the best book for the novice or casual pipe smoker.

There is little mention of the pleasure of smoking a simple though adequate pipe."},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

There are more informative books for those new to the pipe. The biographies provide the most infotainment. Newcombes write in an easy style and the book reads like a pipe travels diary rather than a reference source (which it isn't). The one really annoying factor in the book is how often the author mentions his belief that pipes should be opened up more. He tends to drone on and on about the subject far to often, to the point of distraction from the rest of the material."},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"I guess I just don't make enough money to relate to the author and his tone throughout the book.Although he makes many statements that he is not a pipe snob or elitist this book comes acroos a written by a wealthy man FOR wealthy men (or wealthy pipe collectors). Those of us who smoke pipes that cost less than a years salary are left to feel somewhat.........well. like we are not quite up to the authors level of society and certainly could not understand how amazing it is to smoke or own an S Bang etc.It just left me feeling I had paid money to be told by a snob that I am not good enough for his club."},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"I enjoyed this book on my Kindle. While I was hoping for a broader scope directed toward the average pipe smoker (like myself) , I instead found this book to be very much focused upon the collector of top shelf pipes which are far beyond the financial reach of almost all brothers of the briar. That being said, it was still very interesting to see 'how the other half lives'; those who can afford pipe collections in the hundreds if not thousands of 'pieces' often costing several thousands of dollars per pipe! There is not a thing in the world wrong with that, by the way. However, for me personally, I was hoping for something more on pipe smoking, perhaps a bit of history and such directed toward the more average pipe afficianado wishing to grow in understanding of this delightful pastime.The description of the book was not clear to me about it's focus. In a way, this was fortunate, because I would not have downloaded the book, yet because I did I've gained insight into a world far beyond my world of refurbishing old briar to enjoy a small rotation of good pipes. It was like taking a Bedouin - accustomed to an entire life in a desert - to the local 'Water World' type amusement park and giving him ice in every drink between water slides and such!Well done! Fine writing , good humor and frankly the introduction and closing comments are so well written that they alone are worth the price along with the very practical and balanced insights into the resurgence of anti-tobacco hysteria, where much of the actual science which has been surpressed relating to pipe smokers and their enhanced lives is shown to have been (knowingly) surpressed in order to facilitate more governmental control of our lives.A Good Read while in quiet contemplation with pipe in hand ->Ray"},{"Title":"In Search of Pipe Dreams","review":"This is for me definitely one of the best books on pipes ever written.

The most appropriate audience includes IT and switch engineering professionals in the wireless, LEC and CLEC industries, although those working for ISPs, manager service providers and ASPs will find the material closely aligned to their environments as well.For the primary audience this book shows how to look beyond managing service levels and QoS at the infrastructure level. It looks at the much larger business picture with a focus on external customers. It does cover infrastructure, using TMN as the model, but the thrust is coordination of all customer-facing or service providing groups to provide a unified service delivery strategy.I like the way the book starts by defining SLAs and showing how they are the foundation of service delivery. The models provided in Part I of the book were especially valuable. Part II ties together the preceding material to present an integrated model, which addresses both workflow and organizational factors. More importantly, this part of the book covers performance metrics (service level objectives), reporting and notification.The approach and material in this book can be readily adapted to traditional IT service level management, and in particular the way the authors lead you through writing the SLAs and managing to them. What is missing in the book is a bigger view of how SLAs fit within a problem management framework, but this isn't an oversight given the scope of the book. For anyone who is interested in filling in this critical piece I recommend reading IT Problem Management by Gary S. Walker. Although that book is focused on IT, the approach will fit within the OSS environment, and the service level related information in that book is consistent with this one."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"Lacey Smithsonian, fashion writer for the Washington newspaper The Eye Street Observer has an interview with Amanda Manville, a reality TV make over personality, who has become a supermodel.Unfortunately, the make over not only made her beautiful, but it made over her personality from a sweet girl into a diva from hell.So Lacey is surprised when this prima donna asks her to find out who is trying to kill her.Lacey thought Amanda was just being paranoid, and was extremely upset when at a photo shoot for her new line of clothing, she is shot dead.Deciding to honor Amanda's request to find her killer, Lacey puts on her reporters cap, and vintage 1940's outfits to find out who hated the woman enough to put an end to her life. There seems to be a lot of suspects.Her sister Zoe, who had been the pretty one until the TV show and was now had become overweight and unattractive. Was she angry enough that as the actual clothes designer behind Amanda's new line of clothing she wasn't getting enough publicity?Yvette Powers - an old friend and owner of \\"Snazzy Jane\\" the boutique where the clothes line was being premiered. She was a little upset that her husband and Amanda had gotten a little too close.Greg Spaulding - the doctor who had performed the surgery and had briefly been engaged to Amanda afterwards.Or did it have something to do with the disappearance of Caleb Collingwood, Amanda's old boyfriend, whom she had dropped, as soon as, she became beautiful and had mysteriously disappeared years ago, leading to the rumors that Amanda had killed him.With the list of suspects a mile long, it would take all of Lacey's skill to find the killer and to do it without letting her mother and sister who were visiting from Colorado finding out what she was doing.Highlights:Lacey is smart and her investigations would actually lead to a solution as opposed to the killer just suddenly telling her that they're the killer.Her friends, Brooke - who's a lawyer but dates Damon, who has an internet site devoted to conspiracies and the two of them believe in every conspiracy theory that comes along.Her fellow employee's at the \\"Eye\\". Mac, Cassandra, Peter & especially Felicity. This feels like a real work place.Tony Trujillo fellow reporter, who is only too happy to help her solve any crime that comes along.Great story. Very funny especially the ending, Lacey always has the wildest capture of the killer.Lowlights:Vic Donovan - her sort of \\"boyfriend\\". Lacey had a huge crush on him years ago when he was a sheriff in Steamboat Springs and she was a reporter. Although nothing ever came of that, this is their second chance.Unfortunately, I think this relationship is a bust. In the last book, Vic was away for months and never bothered to call or write her. This book his ex-wife shows up and he seems more interested in entertaining her than in Lacey, except to tell her not to get involved in solving the murder. There is just no spark there.He'd probably be ok if it wasn't for the fact that Tony Trujillo is the perfect guy for her.I don't know if this is intentional or if Vic is just a badly written character and he's supposed to be a much better character than he reads to me.This entire series, so far is funny, wonderfully written and a definite must read."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"I'm not sure why I picked up the book in the first place and I wasn't surprised that I didn't enjoy it.

Lacey Smithonian decides to interview Amanda, but she is looking for a different interviewing angle, so she is interested in finding out what happened to Amanda's pre-makeover fiance, Caleb Collingwood, who disappeared from view after Amanda's makeover. She is also reviewing Amanda's move into the world of fashion designer. Amanda, having read of Lacey's earlier success at finding killers, tells her that a crazed pyscho killer is stalking her and she asks Lacey to solve her murder if she is killed.Soon Lacey finds herself under a Jinx. Amanda is killed in a drive by shooting, and the car used for the murder was Lacey's beloved Z which was stolen from the garage at work.

Unfortunately they arrive in town on the same weekend she and boyfriend Vic are supposed to consumate their relationship. To make matters worse, Vic also has a guest, his ex-wife Montana, who has come back to rekindle their marriage.Lacey tries to work on the murder, all the while worrying about Montana and Vic, and trying to prevent her mom and sister from re-decorating her apartment and helping her with her search for the killer. Lacey's usual friends, Stella, Brooke, Damon, Tony, and Turtle Dove, who was Amanda's bodyguard, all help her to solve the mystery. The killer is captured with some special help from her sister, Cherise \\"Lethal Feet\\", and her mom.This book's introduction of Lacy's family rounded out her character and added more comic relief and interest to the story. As always, the vintage clothing in the trunk and the description of Lacy's outfits, are fun to read as are Lacy's \\"columns\\" in the paper. There were a couple of problems with the story which kept me from giving it 5 stars. Vic's character is annoying with his macho attitude and his inablility to fend off his ex wife. The local neighborhood psychic Marie, was mostly missing in this story, since her appearances were limited to phone calls. Since she is a character who adds color and interest to the books, I hope the author brings Marie back in a more prominent role in upcoming books. All in all this was an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"After dodging death from a falling \\"Hot Donuts Now\\" Krispy Kreme sign, Lacey finds herself under a Jinx. Thus starts the third book, \\"Hostile Makeover\\" in the Crime of Fashion series.Sent to interview Amanda Manville, who went from Ugly Duckling with a Heart of Gold to a gorgeous, Supermodel with Screaming Diva Tempertantrums after appearing on the Chrysaslis Factor reality make-over show, Lacey is just as interested in finding out what happened to Amanda's pre-makeover fiance, Caleb Collingwood, as she is in reviewing Amanda's move into the world of fashion designer. Amanda has other plans for Lacey, claiming a crazed pyscho killer is stalking her. Having read of Lacey's earlier success at finding killers, Amanda asks Lacey to solve her murder if she is killed.The jinx results in Lacey's beloved Z being stolen from the garage at work. The news of this auto-theft, brings Lacey's mom, Rose, and former Cheerleader sister, Cherise \\"Lethal Feet\\", out from Colorado for a visit. Her family is arriving the weekend she and Vic are supposed to spend out of town consumamting their tenuous relationship. To make matters worse, Vic has an out of town guest too, Montana, his ex-wife. Montana is back to reclaim her man.Supermodel Amanda is killed in a drive by shooting, and the car used was Lacey's Z. Lacey finds herself trying to cautiously hunt for the killer, more out of anger over the treatment of her Z, than for the deceased supermodel. The list of suspects include: Amanda's sister, Zoe, who designed the fashion line, power couple the Powers who helped back the line, Dr. Spaulding who transformed Amanda into a beauty, and John Tyler Hunter best-friend of Amanda's missing fiance Caleb.Lacey tries to work on the murder, while fending off her mom and sisters attempts to re-decorate her apartment and assist her with her search for the killer. Their disapproval of her past crime solving quickly changes to interest when they realize she was asked by Amanda the Supermodel to find the killer.Lacey is surrounded by her usual sidekicks: Stella, Brooke, Damon, Tony, and Turtle Dove-who was Amanda's bodyguard. Turtle Dove has the potential for being another love interest for Lacey, if Vic cannot decide between his ex-wife and her. When Lacey finally figures out who the killer is, he has a very special ending in mind with her in a starring role. The killer is captured with some special help from her sister, Cherise \\"Lethal Feet\\" and her mom.The introduction of her mother and sister added more depth to Lacey's character, and they provided some good comic relief, especially with their obsession with all things marked \\"Smithsonian\\". Photographer Hansen's character played a larger role in this book, but local neighborhood psychic Marie's appearances were limited to phone calls. Marie's character was more prominent in the first book, and now she seems to have been put on the back burner. I hope the author brings Marie out more in upcoming books. The final confrontation with the killer was funny. Also Brook and Damon's conspiracy theory about bionic babes with GPS trackers in their breast implants was an amusing touch. All in all another good read."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"This series didn't start out great, but now it's gotten just terrible.The author seems to be trying to go for \\"snappy\\" and \\"witty\\" with her dialogue and she's falling far short. It comes across as awkward, juvenile and cliched. And the italicized asides are very annoying -- if there wasn't so much drivel, the asides could be worked into the actual conversations, rather than distracting the reader by appearing after Lacey speaks.Rose and Cherise were like a couple of cartoon characters. There was nothing believable or enjoyable about them at all. And it made no sense that an independent adult like Lacey would drag them around with her and put them in danger, catering to their idea that crime solving is fun, rather than putting her foot down that she had to work and they couldn't come tag along with her.On top of all this, the ending was very predictable. You could figure out the murderer almost as soon as he appeared in the story.I gave this series enough chances. I'm done with it."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"If you need something to read before bed, that isn't fast paced or mind bending, this is book is for you. It's also a great read if you suffer from insomnia. I think the Lifetime movie was better and that's saying a lot since it was pretty awful in its own right. The dialogue is clipped, unfunny, and the lead character is annoying. I couldn't relate or sympathize with her character."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"So they're calling Byerrum's series \\"chick lit mysteries.\\" Well, I'm a guy and I like chicks, I like lit, and I love this series. Okay? Deal with it. (I even like Washington, DC, believe it or not, and I'm a New Yorker.) Byerrum really gets this place and the whole weird Washington atmosphere of government conspiracies that sound real but turn out to be fantasy, and the stuff that sounds like stand-up comedy but turns out to be real. And she makes it funny and sarcastic and suspenseful too. She writes great funny women characters, at least to me, but then I'm a guy, I only date funny women, what do I know? (Who wouldn't want to date Lacey Smithsonian, she's smart, witty, looks great in a devastating suit, and knows how to use a weapon. What's not to like?) Any guy who's sat through an episode of \\"Extreme Makeover\\" will wonder what would happen if the latest made-over reality TV diva turned out to be a killer witch on wheels, and that's where this one takes off. \\"Killer Hair\\" was a knockout, \\"Designer Knockoff\\" was even better, and \\"Hostile Makeover\\" hits it out of the park. This one gets two thumbs up from me. Guys, read the funny parts (there's plenty of 'em) to your girlfriends, this chick-lit mystery will make you a chick magnet."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"This is the third book in the \`Crimes of Fashion' series and, in comparison to the first two - Killer Hair and Designer Knockout - was the weakest in terms of storyline and characters. Hostile Makeover puts fashion journalist Lacey Smithsonian on the trail of a killer when a supermodel, Amanda, is shot in her presence and Lacey's car is used in the getaway. This book felt more contrived and less mysterious than the other two in the series. True, these are simple mysteries to begin with, but Lacey Smithsonian was definitely dull in this story, especially in the beginning chapters. The storyline took several chapters to actually begin and, when it did, it seemed completely implausible. Lacey interviews Amanda for a fashion article and, 10 minutes into the interview, Amanda recruits Lacey to find her killer. At this point, Amanda isn't even dead and her attitude is off-putting and insincere. The other problem with this book is with the \`romance' between Lacey and her sorta-boyfriend Vic Donovan. Vic has finally relocated to DC from Colorado, but is longer a cop. His job (as a cop) could actually add dimension to the mysteries Lacey encounters but for some reason the author puts Vic in the sidelines and a different career. Plus, the couple is still not \`together' which is pretty unusual and ridiculous to read through. This book isn't the best in the series but is still readable."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"Lacey Smithsonian is interviewing Amanda Manville, reality TV makeover success story turned model. Apparently all the makeover surgeries turned her sweet personality into that of a diva gone bad. All Amanda wants to talk about is the death threats she's received. She requests Lacey's help in stopping the stalker. Lacy doesn't take much stock in the existence of a stalker. That is until Amanda is killed.She and her boyfriend Vic Donovan are planning a getaway weekend until Lacey's mother and sister descend upon her. How can she investigate Amanda's murder, survive her relative's visit, and keep Vic from meeting then?With Amanda's unpopular personality, the list of suspects is quite long. How can Lacey weed out the real killer without putting herself in danger or her family since they keep tagging along?I really like Lacey. She's so down to earth and fun. I like her vintage clothing, too. Her quirky family and relationship with Vic spice things up as well.I live not far from DC, and Ms. Byerrum has the fashion tone of Washington down to a T. The tidbits always add to the story.Lacey's friends and co-workers are great additions to the story as well.I highly recommend this book and the whole series.Check out: [...]"},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"Ellen Byerrum pulls another superlative Crime of Fashion out of her vintage cloche, simultaneously sticking a hatpin in America's spinning-out-of-control passion for makeovers.Now, Byerrum spins a mystery out of (very luxurious) whole cloth with the best of them, featuring characters we come to know and love a little bit more each time (Lacey Smithsonian, her boss Mac, sometime paramour Vic, best friend Brooke) and even some we've come to know and not love (evildoer-with-sugar-and-chocolate, food editor Felicity). But her talent for creating memorable one-off and secondary characters is positively Dickensian.This time, we meet devil's spawn dress designer Amanda Manville, who won a makeover contest that turned her as ugly on the inside as she became beautiful on the outside; Tate Penfield, Amanda's secretive ex-fiance; jinxman Harlan Wiedermyer (read the first couple of paragraphs of the book and laugh out loud); my favorite new characters, Lacey's mom Rose and her former cheerleader sister Cherise; and on down to a waitress in a donut shop spotting her potential 15 minutes of fame.All these wonderful characters combine with Byerrum's gift for clever plotting and snappy dialogue to fashion a perfectly entertaining, keep-em-guessing-til-the-end whodunit.I look forward to each installment in Ellen Byerrum's Crimes of Fashion series. Be sure to read the first two Lacey Smithsonian novels, DESIGNER KNOCKOFF and KILLER HAIR, if HOSTILE MAKEOVER is your first.Just by coincidence, Bob Woodward's book on Deep Throat happened to be the book I read right before this new book of Ellen's. This DC expatriate will take Lacey Smithsonian's wacky Washington world any day of the week over the real Washington, DC, of Watergate and other, more recent, evildoings."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"I have many of Ellen Byerrrum paperback books... I didn't like this one as much as others... Chapter 31 the ending seemed rather silly to me...it didnt have the punch of a solving of a murder mystery. The story line was good up until that point. I think the ending could have been better..."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"I enjoyed \\"Hostile Makeover\\". Maybe not quite as much as the two previous books in the series, but well enough. I found myself agreeing a lot with the books' theme that the popular media glut of \\"extreme makeover\\" reality programming is more about pandering to the lowest common denominator and not really about helping people. Of course, our heroine Lacey is attractive and popular so it is a bit of a mixed message LOL. Byerrum does hit a clinker in the parts of the book about Lacey's mother and sister coming for a visit. Lacey seems quite hateful to them at the beginning. I have a feeling that isn't what the author was aiming for and that she was trying more for the indulgent amusement of Meg Lanslow in the series by Donna Andrews, but Byerrum has Lacey come across as rather nasty early on, which wasn't appealing to read (for me). Some repeated story devices are wearing thin. Lacey and Vic. Either make it a real relationship or quit dancing, the \\"suspense\\" is only annoying now. And at work, Lacey has obviously shown where her ability is, you'd think her boss would be glad of the improved circulation her scoops bring and embrace it instead of the patronizing \\"stay out of trouble, turn it over to the crime beat\\" schtick."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"With the third installment of Lacy Smithsonian and her crimes of fashion series Ellen Byerrum carries on in style! Why can't Law and Order be as inventive and original? Lacey is a reluctant detective and relentless columnist. A fearlessly stylish woman in the testosterone power center of the world. Ellen Byerrum has created a refreshingly original and thoroughly enjoyable read.In this installment Lacey meets reality or at least the leftovers from reality television, and it isn't pretty. With her 1940's fashion flair she is off to cover the story and upstages her journalist peers, the style mullahs and the police. Even CSI would miss these fashion clues.What I like the most are the Crimes of Fashion and Fashion Bites columns. I wish they were syndicated in my local paper. Looking forward to the next one... and in the meantime maybe Hollywood could get a clue and instead of stiletto superheros and sidekicks with cleavage, they could put Lacey on the fashion detective beat."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"This book is well written. It takes me directly into the area because Ellen has done her research well. There's no argument about any DC or Alexandria falsehoods here. And her attitudes of the characters are abound in the real world of the nation's capital. I see people here and wonder if they are the background for one of the characters.Lacey may appear to be a little overzealous with her sleuthing, but many of us in her shoes would do the same thing. At least I would.Her family is a thorn in her side and she wants to be a grownup without hovering. She doesn't know how to get rid of them, so she drags them along, hoping they will run away. When you're doing something that's not technically your job, how can you tell you mom you're working, so leave me alone? You go girl!The characters are a lot of fun, and Ellen does a good job at making sure each character somehow appears in each subsequent book.Some people may believe the dialogue is too \\"cute\\" or \\"childish\\", but if that's the personality of the character, what is a writer to do? I think the dialogue makes for an easy read, because I don't have to look up a lot of fancy words, or go back a couple of paragraphs to re-read something to understand what's happening at the moment. That's what a cozy (especially a chick-lit) is all about.Personally, I hope there's an interest in Tony in the future. I'd fall in love with him. It's really the only part of the books I don't like. I see the sparks flying, but can't understand Lacey's pentagon jammers not letting it through.The clues are well placed and in there, but they don't jump out saying \\"Hey, I'm a clue! Come find me before you get to the last page!\\" Some books I've read you know who the killer is as soon as they appear and put in your head why they did it, or you know who it is and never why, but Ellen's always surprise me, if not the who, definitely the why.I love the little quips she puts in, the news articles, the tips, etc. I've actaully laughed out loud, and said \\"This is my husband's idea of dressing up! Boy, now I know I'm not the only one who sees strange outfits and thinks they are strange.I can't wait for the next installment, wondering what the crime will be this time. A shopping mall? A Kennedy Center gala? Maybe some funky costume party?If you like books that don't need oil to make the wheels in your brain spin, I highly recommend chick-lit mysteries and cozies, such as the Bubbles series, The Blackbird Sisters, Goldie Bear Schultz, and Murder She Wrote."},{"Title":"Hostile Makeover: A Crime of Fashion Mystery","review":"I really enjoy this series.

This is the first point that Pichaske makes in his book. The book is geared toward a student that is starting a composition course and using it as text. He encourages the student to become a talented writer, which would then put him ahead of many people in the job market. Writing is a valuable skill that will always be necessary and can always be learned. The book explains the rules of writing and then defends why these rules exist. It gives models of good writing, a glossary, and chapters to help with general writing problems. Each part of the chapter gives the correction shorthand for the problem it addresses, offering another useful tool. It discusses organization, style, grammar, and revision. It offers a sample research paper for those who have never written one. A writing and revising case study is included to illustrate the writing process.

McGuire and published as a short novel (LONE STAR PLANET) in 1958.This work is a clear and obvious tribute to H.L. Mencken's classic essay \\"The Malevolent Jobholder\\" (from THE AMERICAN MERCURY, June 1924), in which Mencken proposed:\\"...that it shall be no longer malum in se for a citizen to pummel, cowhide, kick, gouge, cut, wound, bruise, maim, burn, club, bastinado, flay, or even lynch a [government] jobholder, and that it shall be malum prohibitum only to the extent that the punishment exceeds the jobholder's deserts. The amount of this excess, if any, may be determined very conveniently by a petit jury, as other questions of guilt are now determined.\\"In 1999, the novel won the Prometheus Award, Hall of Fame Award for Best Classic Libertarian SF Novel. This tongue-in-cheek tale features a planet of Texans whose dinosaur-sized cattle have to be herded with tanks and helicopers, and whose system of government derives its character from Mencken's essay.The protagonist is an insubordinate Terran junior diplomat who is appointed as ambassador to this cantankerously independent planet in the hope that he will be assassinated (as the previous ambassador had been), thereby justifying the forcible invasion and conquest of the Texans. The crux of the story is the trial of the previous ambassador's assassins - actually paid killers hired by an alien empire also planning invasion - under a legal system that considers the killing of a practicing politician to be justifiable homicide.Anyone but a blank and drooling idiot would have recognized the tribute paid by Piper and McGuire in originating this story, and the saliva-spattered initial reviewer is invited to read the inspiration in Mencken's essay, which was compiled in THE MENCKEN CHRESTOMATHY (1949) and is prsently available freely online.Withal, an interesting premise, carried out with typical '50s-style space opera ingenuity and light-hearted disrespect for government authority.--"},{"Title":"A planet for Texans ([Vintage Ace double novel books)","review":"A Planet For Texans (1958) (AKA: Lone Star Planet) is a short standalone SF novel. It is set on Capella IV, a planet settled by virtually the entire population of the State of Texas circa 2100. The inhabitants have a culture based on the legends of the nineteenth century rancheros, although they herd fifteen tons beasts with the best flavor in the known universe. Each major ranch has a force of about five hundred cowboys who herd the supercows with medium tanks and supersonic aircraft.In this novel, Stephen Silk writes an interesting article on the future course of the Solar League and is quickly called to the office of the Secretary of State to discuss his future in the Department. Silk is a member of the Consular Service, but the new job requires a transfer to the Diplomatic Service with the title of Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary.Silk is assigned to fill a vacancy on New Texas caused by the murder of the previous ambassador. He is hustled out of the Solar System to his new job without much of a briefing. The paperwork to be opened only after the first jump says little about the planet except the last messages of the previous four ambassadors.One of the surprises of his new job is the secretary assigned to him. Hoddy Ringo knows little about being a secretary, but a lot about guns. He is obviously a bodyguard and guide.Other surprises include a trunk full of local clothes -- colorful shirts and four pairs of levis of different dark shades -- as well as a pair of automatic pistols and a trick gunbelt. He is ordered to wear the clothes and carry the guns at all times when he is outside the embassy. He is also ordered to destroy the documents, although the need to do so is rather obscure.Silk takes the precaution of searching Hoddy's room while the bodyguard is busy with an Alderbaran widow. He finds a letter addressed to the Department of Aggression attache on New Texas, but hasn't the equipment to open it surreptitiously. He reckons that it is only a letter of credence with the real message passed verbally.In this story, Silk figures that he is being setup to provoke a takeover of the Capellan System. Still, he is charged with discovering the reasons for -- and perpetrators of -- the murder of his predecessor. He also wants to learn the name of the blonde who joined his boisterous party with Hoddy prior to arrival in the Capellan System.Landing at the New Texas spaceport, Silk is greeted with overwhelming passion by a party from the embassy and never gets to talk to the blonde, whom he now remembers is named Gail. He is hustled away from the spaceport -- even half carried -- by his staff and flown out in the back of an embassy aircar. Soon they find themselves being followed by two aircars of identical make and successfully evade the pursuers.After sliding into the open gates of the embassy shortly thereafter, Silk is greeted by more of his staff and taken inside. The staff insist that he has to immediately complete the paperwork to take over his new position. After firmly refusing to sign anything without an inventory, Silk issues orders for a public statement about his arrival.Then a New Texas Rangers captain arrives and is surprised to find him alive and well in the proper building. It seems that the Rangers had received a report of a kidnapping and had lost the fleeing vehicle in the pursuit. Apologizing for the confusion, Silk has a quick drink with the officer -- ain't extraterritoriality wonderful -- and then leaves for the welcoming barbecue (which had started hours before when his ship had just arrived in the system).This tale is a farce based on the popular stereotype of Texas. Being a Texan myself, I can state with full solemnity that barbecues of that style and size are not frequent among the common population of the state. However, politicians -- such as LBJ -- do have them rather more often.The universal carrying of weapons in New Texas is also an exaggerated conception of common practice in the state. More people own and use personal weapons in Texas than in Eastern states, but the practice of carrying such weapons is nowhere near universal. Even less common is personal ownership of armed tanks and aircraft; in fact, the armed state of New Texas hasn't been seen in Texas since the days of the cattle barons.Despite this Hollywoodish depiction of Texans, the story is a rather good tale of police work and appropriate application of justice. Although this is the only story about New Texas, the authors have written similar SF action novels:Crisis In 2140andEmpire. The senior author has also written other SF tales in a similar vein:The Cosmic ComputerandUller Uprising. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Piper & McGuire fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of fast adventure, political intrigue, and a touch of romance.-Arthur W.

I have to wonder if Lee Harvey Oswald got his inspiration from reading APFT before he assassinated President Kennedy in the terrestrial Texas in 1963.

We can see in your book how his days and nights in the cottage helped Lincoln to hold on to and expand what he had until victory in the 1864 election was assured.The other is the loving relationship of the President with his wife, Mary Lincoln. We often hear of her oddities and running up of debts. What we do not hear of, and what admirably is stressed in your book, is what you describe as \\"the mutual affection and mutual dependence\\" that always linked them despite their great differences in character. Respect for Mary Lincoln, and her contributions to the greatness of Abraham Lincoln, is something we could use more of in writing American history.I will not go on expect to say that I think I have already indicated the greatness of your book, and my hope that librarians and readers everywhere will have an opportunity to benefit from its revelations and the new light it brings on the life of one of our very greatest Presidents."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Other White House: The Untold Story of the Man and His Presidency","review":"I especially enjoyed the fresh approach to Lincoln and to his wife Mary Todd, who comes across in this new book as an elegant, urbane, and gracious \`Republican Queen.' The account of the Lincolns' marriage and their home life at the White House and the Soldiers' Home, from observers such as the Union Army soldiers who guarded him for three years, is fascinating. The book is based on extensive research and is enriched by fresh anecdotes about Lincoln, by Whitman's and abolitionist Longfellow's poetry, and letters and memoirs of the diverse personalities with whom Lincoln interacted, particularly his generals and cabinet members."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Other White House: The Untold Story of the Man and His Presidency","review":"It must be difficult-given the plethora of books on Lincoln-to shed new light on an old subject. However, Elizabeth Brownstein does. Through careful and thorough research, Ms. Brownstein addresses issues hitherto unexplored. Lincoln's summer home...provides a suitable setting to describe Lincoln's activities outside the White House. One learns, for instance, that the first draft of the Emancipation Proclamation was completed here. One also learns that, far from being a retreat from the hustle and bustle of Pennsylvania Avenue, the home facilitated Lincoln's open-mindedness about receiving virtual strangers at virtually any hour of the day or night and resulted in serious sleep deprivation.However, it was in the other topics addressed in the book that Lincoln's character is at its most illuminating. His fascination with weaponry, his patience in his dealings with his wife, and his ability to establish collegial relationship with people of vastly differing temperaments are all thoughtfully explored...The characters highlighted are dispassionately analyzed in such a way as to enable the reader to be part of the scene at all times. For instance, Lincoln's wife, so often pilloried...is given a fair hearing and is properly depicted as a courageous soul confronted by agonizing choices and exaggerated expectations of the First Lady's performance as a suitable consort of the most admired President in American History...Mrs. Brownstein provides a valuable service for readers interested in the less dramatic, but no less insightful, clues about Lincoln the President, confronted, as he was, by the unprecedented challenges associated with his era."},{"Title":"Lincoln's Other White House: The Untold Story of the Man and His Presidency","review":"The author has done a wonderful job showing what a real human being that Lincoln was.

Having just observed the 200th birthday on February 12, 2009 of our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln, we think we know a lot about him. After all over 16,000 books have been written about his life and times.However, my friend, a noted author of numerous historical subjects, Elizabeth Brownstein, led a small group of us on an adventure recently to an improbable place, now called the Armed Forces Retirement Home, located near the first US National Cemetery, which was filled by 1864 with so many Civil War dead it has closed and its successor cemetery at Arlington opened.It was this first cemetery that for 13 months of his Presidency, Lincoln could view from his residence. No, not the White House, but his other White House. During his residency there, which he thought might be a respite from the actual White House, he could observe from his front window an average of 40 Union soldiers a day being buried there.\\"Betty\\" Browstein, as she is known to friends, who arranged this tour of this historic house, has ably chronicled in her well received book, \\"Lincoln's Other White House: The Untold Story of the Man and His Presidency\\" a truly unique look at Lincoln and his family. To me the Civil War represents the greatest challenge ever to our Republic's survival (until now with our current immigration invasion crisis) and when she and our estimable guide described the life and times the Lincoln's led here, I often was close to tears.It was in June of 1962 that the Lincoln family moved from the low lying, disease ridden area of their official White House in which Lincoln was daily beset with a train of supplicants, to this hill tip site, an elevation of some 300 feet above the other home, 3 miles away. Lincoln commuted on horseback, often alone, daily to the real White House, experiencing at one point a rifle shot from an assassin right through his stove pipe hat.This 1850 Gothic revival cottage (hardly small with over 20 rooms) was located next to the first Soldiers' Home, the nation's initial refuge for its old and disabled veterans.Today between 1100 and 1200 men and women reside on these grounds, now known as the Armed Forces Retirement Home, on spacious acreage which today includes a 9 hole golf course on which I regularly play.The Lincoln's youngest son, Willie, had just died and thus respite was hoped for, but it hardly came, as described above, since, as her book relates, \\"Lincoln's difficult generals, his contentious cabinet members, touchy diplomats, politicians of all persuasions, old friends and even curious strangers found their way there at all hours of the day and night.\\"The house was also sometimes close enough to the front lines that cannon fire could be heard. However, it was here that Lincoln chose to spend a quarter (25%) of his Presidency. Deeply affected by the deaths he saw daily, he was known to wander on occasion among the graves in the nearby cemetery reciting poetry and Shakespeare as a way of dealing with his depression.While earlier books have seemingly covered every facet of Lincoln's life, it was not until several years ago when the National Trust for Historic Preservation began restoration of this important, but largely unknown Presidential site that Brownstein began her research to capture so much in the way of new Lincoln history, things that allow this American icon to become even more human and engaging.Yet Lincoln has always remained such a poignant individual, whose remarkable climb from modest beginnings to President remained an intense matter of personal pride. He felt strongly that anyone who worked hard should be able to make it in America and he felt that applied equally to those in slavery. But he well understood that his main objective, keeping the Union together, could only be accomplished by winning enough public opinion to his positions. In so doing, Lincoln displayed incredible political adroitness, not well understood by many at the time, until after his tragic end.In this house Lincoln put the finishing touches on what he felt would be best remembered of his life, the Emancipation Proclamation. In this splendid new book, Brownstein truly fills a critical gap in his biography with diaries, letters, and eyewitness accounts of life in the Soldiers Home. For example, in revealing more of his relationship with members of his wartime inner circle or how he was viewed by the soldiers who guarded him, as well as insights not previously covered about his marriage, Brownstein has created a distinctive, special portrait of our most revered President.Not to be missed, should one be in DC, is a trip to the Armed Forces Retirement Home Visitors Center which adjoins the Lincoln Cottage. In the Center, which you can visit without a guide, you will see wonderful Lincoln memorabilia, including life masks, models of the statues which grace the Lincoln Memorial and other famous sites along with stirring historical facts about that seminal time in our nation's history. Also here you can join small expertly guided tours, which is the only way one can see the Cottage.

I have been a major JCO fan for a long time. I find her writing intelligent and her insights astonishing. Frankly, I am not a Marilyn Monroe fan. First, I was too young to remember her when she was alive, and I have never seen any of her movies. So why read a long book about her? Because Joyce Carol Oates wrote it. Because Ms. Oates has taken liberties with fact (she does, after all, refer to this as a novel)it really wasn't necessary to know anything about Marilyn/Norma Jeane. The fact that her life was so fascinating, troubled, and dramatic makes for great fiction. Some readers objected to Oate's writing style. But for those of us who have enjoyed her previous writings, this was a gourmet feast! If you are a Marilyn Monroe fan you will probably enjoy this book, and if you're not, you will still enjoy it, because it covers so much of what fascinates us - madness, sex, drugs, drama and pathos. 700+ pages went surprisingly quickly."},{"Title":"Blonde","review":"My wife ordered this without noticing that it was a Spanish translation.

The characters are flat and there is no plot!! I only finished it because I hoped that it would get better and Ms. Heyer's wit would shine through. No luck- I didn't even like the character of the King. please, don't spend time on this when you could be reading the Alastair Trilogy (These Old Shades, Devil's Cub, etc.) or \\"The Masqueraders\\", all of which are absolutely marvelous."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"If you are unfamiliar with Georgette Heyer, you should know that she wrote at least four types of books: historical romances, mostly Regency-era; detective/mystery novels; contemporary romances (of her time); and historical novels. If you like history, this is a fun read. How anyone could expect to pick up any book about Charles II and find a romantic relationship with a happy ending is a mystery to me.Charles II was more of a degenerate than a rascal, but he did provide some beneficial governance when reigned in by Parliament. For those who were shocked by this portrayal of the Puritans, yes, they were the ancestors of the people who founded our country. However, they were far from all good. Their actions during the English civil war included banning music and destroying many great works of art. As their movement escalated, it devolved into a brutal dictatorship. When Charles returned to power, he was welcomed back by most--that's why it's called the Restoration. Some of the Puritans who couldn't take it did indeed set out for America. On the one hand, they were protesters who wanted religious freedom; on the other, they were misfits who had to leave because they could no longer impose their religious beliefs on everyone else. So they sailed off to do good, although they mostly did well. Trading land for beads was mighty profitable, slaves were good for the bottom line, and accusing someone of witchcraft so you could take their property was another way to get ahead. I think Heyer was trying to tell us that there were no purely good guys in this conflict. For those with such unrealistic expectations, I recommend more history books along with the romance novels."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"In just the few of Georgette Heyer's many books that I've read so far, I've noticed a distinctive characteristic; her style and skill markedly changes from her earlier books to her later ones. Royal Escape, written in the early-middle of Heyer's career, falls somewhere in the middle; it is definitely better than her earliest books, but definitely not as good as her later books.Royal Escape recounts a six-week period of the life of King Charles II of England, from the time when he was defeated by Cromwell until he escaped to exile in France. As with all of Heyer's books, the detail is meticulous and reflects her prodigious research and dedication to fact; her bibliography is impressive. Most, if not all, of the characters in Royal Escape were actual historical people, and Heyer depicts their personalities and characters with a great deal of detail. In particular, we are given a close-up view of Charles, his personality, his looks, his charisma and his charm. Heyer reminds us numerous times that, not only was Charles uncommonly tall, but he was uncommonly ugly. In fact, it was stated so much that I felt like I was being beat over the head with it.The problem with Royal Escape is that it drags on and on. Charles narrowly escapes Cromwell's forces, finds shelter with a family sympathetic to the Royalist cause, is in danger of discovery and therefore forced to move on (in disguise) and find shelter somewhere else. This basic plot is repeated over and over (I lost count of how many times) until it is monotonous. I thought he was NEVER going to get to the coast and escape to France. But finally, after 440 pages, he did.Although Charles experiences many narrow escapes, there is nevertheless a lack of spine-tingling or hair-raising (regardless of what the blurb on the back cover says). However, I was ok with that; I don't expect those qualities from a Heyer book. What I was not ok with was the lack of climax, or conflict or resolution which are essential to the structure of a novel. Although I am sure Heyer's account is true to history, I would have enjoyed it much more if she had used more of her novelist's skills rather than just recount history in a rambling, never-ending narrative."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"If you love Heyer's light-hearted romances, or her mysteries, this may not be for you. It is more history than romance, and as the former reviewer stated, it's a little hard sometimes to distinquish the \\"good guys.\\" Nevertheless, it is reasonably true to the period and the events. There were then, as now, Puritans and Puritans. Not all were exactly blameless - the \\"Roundhead\\" forces were guilty of as many atrocities as the other side. Incidents such as the one the former reviewer finds so objectionable did happen. To the Puritans, these people were Satan's tools as well as traitors. Many of the Catholics felt the same way about the Puritans, and Heyer does favor that side.As for the Stuart immorality - none of the royal houses of Europe of that period (or any?) were known for their blameless lives where the opposite sex was involved."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"Those who pick up this book because of the author's name and the romance-novel cover will probably give up on it after the first few chapters. There's no romance, though a couple of the young women involved in helping the embattled king to get from hiding place to hiding place have strong affection for him, and he'll flirt with any woman who gives him a smile. The history, I'm sure, is authentic, and quite interesting, for someone like me who knows little about the period apart from the fact that Charles II does eventually take the throne. As for a previous reviewer's comment about the king's Catholicism, I didn't see that at all; he was willing to listen thoughtfully to Catholics and was embittered--with good reason--by Puritan attitudes, but unlike so many of his predecessors, he wasn't into taking passionate sides and persecution of the Others.It's not your usual Heyer, but it's worth a read if you're interested in English history."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"Heyer's historical novels are typically not my favorites, but this one--possibly because it's so accurate and well-paced--was fascinating and fun. Even had I no knowledge of the events, it would be a great read. But Heyer's able to flesh out the facts of the well-known story. Since, as her husband boasted, her research is thorough and flawless, I never had to wonder (as one must with so many authors of this ilk), \\"Did it really happen like that?\\" That's one of the things that makes Heyer such a comfortable author: she's trust-worthy."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"I have been a Heyer fan for many years and read all her Regency books over and over...sort of like the books equivilent of \\"comfort food\\"!But she also wrote several books which were set in other time periods. Some are set in the late 1700's, others: her mysteries, are set in what was to her, \\"modern times\\", from about 1920 or so onward....these are not my favorites.She also wrote a few books set in the Middle Ages, or in times far earlier than the other books. \\"Royal Escape\\" set in the 1700's, and based on a famous true story, is actually a pretty good book. Its not like the Regency books in that it has more to do with young King Charles II (age about 20 or so) trying to escape from England after his army was defeated by the Puritan dictator Cromwell. If he'd been caught, he'd likely have been beheaded as his father, King Charles I, was, and several of his friends and supporters who were caught after the battle was lost...Therefore most of the book follows history and the many adventures young Charles had in getting away from the troops pursuing him and the high price on his head which would have encouraged many people to turn him in.As mentioned, its based on the true story and well told by Heyer. I don't want to give away all the story for those who have not read it, but I found it interesting and enjoyable though not up to the level of the better Regency books.Another excellent book on young Charles II, isThe Child from the Seaby Elizabeth Goudge. This is based on a true story: the love affair of young Prince Charles, before he became king, with an island girl who gave birth to his son. It is a very good, very moving story that will stay with you. The events in it occur PRIOR to \\"Royal Escape\\"...."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"Georgette Heyer is a writer unparralled today in her descriptions of England and the social practices of the day.

They are a delight."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"I love this book. Charles II is one of my favourite real people in history and this book creates him as a real breathing person. The events of this book were true and most of the story is the one that Charles himself told on the boat as he returned to England as king, 9 years after the event of the book and Samuel Pepys recorded. Because the tale is Charles own story the detail that Georgette Heyer puts in the book are often the king's own memories and the lightheartedness of the character relects his own descriptions of his actions.Charles certainly was an unusual man for his time and the story of his escape may be one of the explanations of why he was a man who wore his kingship very lightly yet valued it above all. It was hard won.True there is no suspense, anyone who reads history knows Charles did escape but if it were not a true tale it would be one which was described as an historical romp.The book does lack the romance of other books but the fact that Georgette Heyer found enough drama in the tale without rewriting recorded history adds to the bookHe was also the protype for the lovable rakes and rogues that Georgette Heyer often made her heros."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"Charles II, a king with a price on his head must flee England so as not to lose his head as was the fate of his father in Georgette Heyer's THE ROYAL ESCAPE.

When everyone knows the story it does not have the spice of fiction and yet this is a beloved story of a young man who would later regain his thrown.Not the best of Heyer's works, but it is worth a read to explore other aspects of her writings.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and HAINTS."},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"Readers of this book may be interested to know that the Royal Escape is commemorated each year by a huge offshore yacht race that retraces the route Charles took when fleeing for his life.

See [...]"},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"I have just discovered Georgette Heyer and find most of her offerings to be absolutely wonderful! I bought this one because of the author, having enjoyed quite a few of her other titles. To be fair, she researched this one out very well, as the bibliography attests (though it is a fictional work), and the main characters, King Charles and his consorts, are probably depicted true to how they themselves saw the situation (??). Given the very real roguishness of the real King Charles historically, perhaps this is the best can be done with the subject material.The storyline and characterizations I think most Heyer fans would find objectionable. The setting is England and the main character is King Charles who is trying to regain his throne after being removed from it by the Puritans (the same kind of persons who came to America because of religious persecution). King Charles is owned to be a rogue, womanizer, and bawdy, though with gentlemanly manners and a nice sense of humor. He is portrayed as a strong Catholic, and after his bitter defeat at the hands of Oliver Cromwell, he flees through the countryside trying to make for France. His advisers attempt to gain him places to hide and safe passage, drawing upon the favor of various Royalist Catholics loyal to the crown to hide the ex-King from his enemies.The Puritans are portrayed as immoral, \\"Bible-mad\\" (this term is used extensively in the book) and enemies of the King. The one-sided way the Catholics are portrayed as good and the Puritans as evil is calculated to make you to hate all Puritans. But you wonder if the portrayal isn't wrong. The characterizations of this enemy are neither believable, balanced or logical, and the \\"good\\" side isn't good. For instance, in searching for the King, the \\"Bible-mad\\" \\"Pious\\" Puritans come to a goodman's home and search it. Not finding the King, they accuse his most lovely daughter of being the King in disguise. The King is known for being a huge man, much taller than most men, hulking and dark, with an ugly, repugnant face and they take this lovely, young and small statured damsel and insist on her being stripped naked in front of the troops to prove she is not the King. When the King and his people hear of it, they are much amused by it, but nothing is said of the poor girl who was stripped and what she endured, nor of the inconsistency of people who claim to be piously Bible-oriented and at the same time filled with lust (after all, they are the enemies in the novel). This appears to be calculated to prove that all Puritans are wicked people, but I found her characterizations of the King and his company and their amusement at the tale even more so.The novel is tedious, and I almost put it down for good several times. Other than asking, 'Will he get away?' the only other side interest she develops is King Charles' penchant for bedding females, one case being developed quite strongly when a willing female presents herself to him. He owns he has fathered several bastards quite cheerfully and encourages others in his company to take females to bed, saying in one instance he would not pass up the opportunity to bed one willing woman were he in their place. The fact the woman he is speaking of is the wife of one who is hiding them doesn't seem to phase the King and we may presume that adultery was not a moral problem to the King. Noting the character of Charles as objectionable, his own morals as low, the lengths to which Heyer goes to characterize the other side as being morally evil may have been seen as necessary to make the King's side look \\"good\\". But it falls flat, with neither side being seen as genteel or worthy of approbation (admiration). Unlike her other characters in her other novels, where the main characters are very worthy gentlemen of gallantry, chivalry and worthy morals and manners, who show a sense of class, this man is not someone you would want to emulate or admire, or even associate with. Though born a King, you feel you have associated with a person of low degree bordering on the morals of a brothel by the end, not a man of dignity and grace. I found it difficult to wish he would regain his throne, since that position of power obviously afforded him many opportunities to indulge his lascivious appetites.(...)"},{"Title":"Royal Escape","review":"I love Georgette Heyer's books, particularly her later ones.

I wasn't disappointed, and the only reason I haven't given this engaging book 5 stars is because Koscuisko makes only the briefest appearance in it...Garol Vogel (the powerful Bench Intelligence Specialist first encountered in 'Hour of Judgement') has arranged for the Langsariks, an outlaw race, to come into the Bench fold. However, outside forces are working against the Langsariks, attempting to frame them for unspeakable crimes against Jurisdiction. Vogel has to track down the guilty parties before the Bench turns its considerable might against the Langsarik settlement.This is an intelligent, sometimes gripping read and, because this is the Bench we're talking about, you can't be sure until the very end whether or not there'll be a happy ending. Admittedly, there's less emotional depth than in the three previous books, but there's perhaps more story; it's likely to appeal to people who were put off by the violence of the Koscuisko books."},{"Title":"Angel of Destruction","review":"The Langsarik fleet was powerful, trustworthy, and cemented in their loyalty to one another, making it very difficult for the Judiciary to hunt them down. The Langsarik were pirates whose own home planet refused to recognize them so eventually their leader, Walton Agnes negotiated with Garol Vogel to seek decent terms of surrender.The five thousands members of the Langsarik fleet were put on probation and forced to live on land in Port Charid, a space port dominated by the Dolgrukij Combine. After a certain amount of years they would be allowed into space once again as law abiding citizens of the Judiciary. However there is an element on Port Charid who hate the Langsarik and is willing to stage bloody raids on other ports to get the Langsark's probation revoked. It is up to Vogel, who has put together a last ditch desperate plan, to see that justice is carried out.ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION is space opera of the first caliber. The tale is fast paced, with plenty of action and adventure and the various sub-plots add depth to a very complex story line. The characters are three-dimensional so that the readers can truly understand them and their motivations even if they don't approve all their actions. Susan R. Matthews is a fine storyteller who is not afraid to meet social issues heads on.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Angel of Destruction","review":"I had been looking forward to this book since I first heard that Susan Matthews was going to do a novel that centered around Bench specialist Garel Vogel. Not only did I find him to be an interesting character during his appearance in HOUR OF JUDGMENT, but I was also looking forward to finding out more about the Judiciary universe, and from a viewpoint other than Andrej's.ANGEL OF DESTRUCTION didn't disappoint, and in fact I think it is some of the author's best work. The plot is complex and very well laid out, and Ms. Matthews avoids the easy shortcuts that some writers occasionally resort to in order to keep their stories moving forward. In addition, the book features several engaging and well-written characters, my favorites being Vogel and the newly introduced Cousin Stanoczk (who I hope we'll be seeing more of in the future). I enjoyed ANGEL immensely, and anxiously await the arrival of Susan's next novel."},{"Title":"Angel of Destruction","review":"\\"Angel of Destruction\\" is the fourth in Susan R. Matthews' \\"judiciary\\" series (\\"Prisoner of Conscience,\\" \\"An Exchange of Hostages,\\" \\"Hour of Judgment\\"), described by the publisher as \\"a stand-alone novel\\" in the series (which seems fair: a sequel would be fun but hardly necessary). This time out Inquisitor Andrej Koscuisko is confined to a cameo role, as the action focuses around Bench intelligence Garol Vogel (he himself had a cameo in \\"Judgment\\") who, having offered the rogue Langsariks a home of their own (while banning them from space), now has to prove they're the victims of a frameup: a group is staging bloody raids and blaming it on the Langsariks. Who are they? How are they accomplishing this? Vogel quickly forms some ideas, but proving it is another matter altogether.The tale is told in a multi-POV noirish police procedural style manner (for that matter with some alterations it could have been set in the John Ford-John Wayne west, so readers looking for Catherine Asaro-style science lessons may be disappointed). The real perps are revealed early on and the plot centers on how they will be captured, and whether the capture will come in time to save the Langsariks. In addition to Vogel himself the action focuses on the Langsarik leader Walton Agenis, her nephew Hilton Shires, her beautiful niece Modice, rogue pilot Kazmer Daigule, Cousin Stanoczk the Malcontent, and the wounded foreman Fisner Feraltz. Ms. Matthews skillfully interweaves what the characters are saying with what they are thinking, and these characters are intelligent.Ms. Matthews shows a great sense of place here. Although the novel jumps around quite a bit you'll always know where you are. Her descriptions of dwellings, gardens, warehouse facilities, and the like will give you a great feel for the locations. In one sequence, when Hilton, on warehouse duty, hears two apparent drunks talking nearby, you'll almost be able to smell the dust as he moves along the aisles trying to locate them among the stacks of merchandise.By the way: The author is perhaps paying subtle tribute to Jack Vance here (he would have loved the name Fisner Feraltz, and the Langarsarik colors are \\"rose gold,\\" described as a yellow-pink), although her cleancut prose style is far less ornate than The Master's. Anyhow, it's fast-paced, entertaining, and as always with Ms. Matthews very very dark."},{"Title":"Angel of Destruction","review":"This book provides another view of the Judiciary world the author has created. It is no less intense and interesting. I enjoy reading the story and the moral choices that the main character has to make.

I hope that all of these plot lines are going to join togather in the near future.

Sierra has done her best to rule over the two lands, but everyone blames her for her missing spouse. Governor Clark arranges for the best scout High Wolf to escort her Highness, but when he sees Sierra, he refuses as he feels she betrayed their vows of love. Sierra continues her quest without him, but he follows her for safety purposes.This is an exciting historical romance that brings to life early Americana through the insightful look at the Indian tribes and the use of Governor Clark (Lewis and Clark fame). Each of the prime trio is unique with fully developed personalities. Though the mysticism is interesting it also enables too easy of a resolution than a decade of increasing discontent should allow. Still fans of early nineteenth century romances will appreciate this astute glimpse of a bygone era.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Princess and the Wolf","review":"I have just finished another of Karen Kay's spectacular romance novels, The Princess and the Wolf. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I think Amazon should do something about that other author writing a review on a book she'd never read. I only wish there were a Karen Kay fan club. If there was, I would surely join it.This book takes place not only in America, but in Europe, also. And yes, it is a Native American romance.I intend to read all of Karen Kay books."},{"Title":"Princess and the Wolf","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Once started, I had to read and read and read until I finished it. Wow! I felt like I was there. The story of long lost love and a series of misunderstanding make the book come alive.Captures the spirit of Native America."},{"Title":"Princess and the Wolf","review":"Married by proxy to a European prince she doesn't love, the princess Sierra will not believe her husband who she hasn't seen since before the marriage 10 years ago has died in America. She journeys off to America and contracts the man she thought she was to marry High Wolf, the proud Cheyenne brave to lead her to her husband.Years earlier High Wolf learned much as guest in a European court until he is sent away (or so he thinks) by the woman he loves. Now here she is in his territory of the American West and has asked for his help in finding her husband, and honor of a long ago promise makes him. But, as they spend more time together and determine the tricks that were played on them 10 years ago how will they be able to take the love they have and move forward?Not a bad story but, I would not recommend reading this book as one of the first Karen Kay's that you read. There are a lot better ones out there (Try the Blackfoot Warrior series for starters). Though, you will as usual learn about the Cheyenne culture as you read this book."},{"Title":"A Planter of Malta","review":"I ordered the book because I believed it to take place on the island of Malta.

Few stretches of the Missouri remain as Lewis &amp; Clark observed them. The river, as Botkin observes, is &quot;nature's landscape painter&quot;. The canvas is continually changing in response to the forces of a river draining one-sixth of the U.S.Botkin presents us with the story of the first navigation of the river by Lewis and Clarke, through the river's channalization by the Army Corp of Engineers, to present efforts to restore and interpret the river.But, this book is more than an inventory of facts and issues. It contains vivid illustrations of nature's interrelationships and wry observations on the irony of man &quot;improving&quot; nature.This is a very practical, pragmatic, yet poetic book."},{"Title":"Passage of Discovery","review":"This book is not meant as a precise historical account of the journeys of Lewis & Clark, but a study of the Missouri River and its surrounding areas as the explorers saw them, vs. how these areas have changed since then. Also, the portion of the Lewis & Clark journey west of the Rockies is not included, as the book sticks to the Missouri River. The most blatant changes in these ecosystems are the straightening and channelization of the river itself, which has led to massive environmental (and economic) damage for a pathetically small amount of barge traffic; plus the conversion of vast prairies to farmland which has led to serious losses of native flora and fauna. The book becomes a messy mixture of travelogue, as Botkin describes how to reach key areas of the river, and musings on the environmental health of these areas. While Botkin has had well-deserved success in environmentalist circles, his attempts to draw up naturalist ethics and morality significantly weaken this book. A lack of focus and the squishy writing of a college freshman are also damaging. Botkin is prone to god-awful metaphors, starting the main narrative awkwardly with \\"Rocks are nature's books; minerals are its words\\" and populating the rest of the book with more groaners like \\"Rocks Tell Stories and Soils are Nature's Braille\\" (subtitle of chapter 25). His attempts to wax philosophical on mankind's modern lack of connection with nature, while correct in spirit, are also unsuccessful in the writing department. See the awkward comparison of a pelican's spiraling flight path to society's shifting concerns for the environment in chapter 6, or the predictable comparison of prairie dog towns with an ideal human society in chapter 32. This book had the potential to be a real winner as both a travelogue with a historical twist and as a treatise on environmental philosophy. Unfortunately it merely flirts with those two strengths without really nailing them, and is sunk overall by weak writing."},{"Title":"Passage of Discovery","review":"This is a fantastic book for anyone visiting the Missouri river.Book has handy maps, illustrations and reference points for the person making a modern day trip.

A film version, retitled &quot;A Soldier's Story,&quot; was directed by Norman Jewison. This play takes place in 1944 (during World War II) at Fort Neal, Louisiana. Fuller takes us into an all-Black unit, commanded by a white officer, in the segregated army.The play begins with the murder of one of its principal characters: Tech/Sergeant Vernon Waters, by an unknown killer. Waters' story is recreated in flashbacks; the play is essentially the story behind the investigation into the crime. The situation on the base, which is already hot with racial tension, intensifies when an African-American officer is assigned to the case.Fuller has taken an explosive combination of elements and from them fashioned a truly gripping piece of dramatic art. Suspense, vivid dialogue, memorable characters, and penetrating insights all combine to make this a truly remarkable play. This is also one of those excellent plays which also succeeds as a text for readers.This is a compelling look at the tensions and controversies surrounding the segregated army. Fuller is particularly effective at demonstrating the corrosive effects of racism on both Blacks and whites. Waters is one of the most powerfully tragic figures in all of American drama. I highly recommend &quot;A Soldier's Play&quot;; it is one of the great literary works about military life."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Play (Dramabook)","review":"A Great murder mystery for those who are intrigued by mysteries and other themes such as suspense, betrayal, and loyalty.

Tech Sergeant Vernon C Waters was a shot with a .45 caliber gun the person or persons involved in his murder are unknown. Waters enlisted men think that the Ku Klux Klan killed him. Then the book leads into the investigation of Captain Richard Davenport and how he uncovers the mystery. Even though this book is short it includes a lot of details that you need to pay a close mind to. I enjoyed reading this book was a page turner. It kept you guessing until the end. I would recommend it anybody that enjoys reading a good book.This book also reminds of another book I am currently reading The Color Purple by Alice Walker.

But the real significance of Davis's approach to \`responsiveness' is revealed only when one applies this to understanding the nature of the IT services firms. I have always been puzzled by the apparent contradiction between most of the received wisdom in management literature on such firms and my experiences of working with such firms throughout my professional career. But, put on Davis's lenses and all contradictions simply disappear!! Out comes consistent explanations for capability/ capacity/ core competency, best-practice guidelines, multi-skilling, centers of excellences, network of delivery firms specializing in different areas, the essential tension between the scope versus specialization, or, assignment/ control of projects versus project deliveries, percentage of resource utilization, yield management and so on, and, above all the phenomenon of outsourcing!I recommend this book to anyone interested in customer-centricity -- which is almost everyone! Read this book for its declared purpose of \`customer responsive management', but if you are one of the thousands of IT professionals trudging along the information highway, this book is a must - this maybe your only handbook to make sense of this crazy industry.Destined to become a CLASSIC of the 90's; for this reviewier its a prized possession."},{"Title":"Customer Responsive Management: The Flexible Advantage (Total Quality Management)","review":"The concepts in this book will change the way you do business.

The character development is not quite as deep, but not really necessary if you are a loyal follower of the show.

Last year she took our children and left me becuase she thought that she was going to lose her mind. She always thought that if she could do better then I would be OK. It didn't work and I blamed her for everything.When she left, I promised her that I would get counseling. I did and was diagnosed with PTSD. I've had it for twenty years and never knew. After three months, she returned home and began to study this book. She totally understands now and we are healing together. We are both amazed at how accurately this book portrays our own life.She is now my BEST FRIEND and only support system (nobody else understands).

The author is the wife of the author of Chicken Hawk; I don't think she is as good of a writer as he is but the knowledge she shares more than makes up for any deficiencies. She describes the negatives arising from PTSD and then more importantly, describes her experiences in searching for a solution. The most important message I took from it, similar to the airplane rule of putting on your own oxygen mask first, then helping others, is that you must first help yourself. Don't just be a suffering victim. I highly recommend this book to anyone dealing with someone who has PTSD."},{"Title":"Surrender on Cebu: A POW's Diary--WWII","review":"My interest in this book was prompted by many of the characters that Lt. Col. Miner mentions, many of whom I know or have known. I was born and raised in Cebu and am related to or have known of many of the characters he mentions and discusses. It was a great (and pleasing) surprise to me to read the author describing and encounter in 1941 with my mother while on leave in the island of Cebu \`a beautiful Spanish girl named Romana (Ramona) Corominas. Seniorita Corominas' family was part owner of the boat and the steamship line'. I have not met or did not know of Lt. Col. Miner until I came across this book. He was one of the tens of thousands of American servicemen who made great sacrifices in the Philippines during the war against Japan. It is an intriguing co-incidence that he should have met my mother in the period just before the war began, at a historical conjuncture that was marked by great violence, destruction and change.There are many memoirs and histories of the war in the Philippines that are available, some of which I have read. The great value in these reminiscences is that the author has a good capacity for self reflection on the events that eventually were to engulf his life. He provides a very good portrait of the rather tranquil, and in some senses idyllic time (in the Visayan region of the Philippines). He was assigned to train soldiers in the province of Bohol, which is a short boat ride from the island of Cebu (where I was born and grew up).Bohol is still a fairly undeveloped province of the Philippines, but that is part of its great charm. It also has some of the most stunning beaches, the best diving, cool mountain breeze evenings, a generally friendly ambiance, and some of the most interesting geography (e.g. the \`Chocolate Hills'- google that and be amazed. My sister also has a theory about early visits from ancient civilisations- we have this weird, pyramid like hill next to a coconut grove we own just outside of Tagbilaran- but that is another story).Life in prewar Bohol (where my father grew up) is a bit of a mystery. To have this picture of life and lives drawn up for us by an educated and reflective American officer from Indiana is invaluable. The book also gives an \`on the ground' feel for life in pre-war Cebu.Sometimes the language and sentence construction in this book is a bit rough. Memoirs, unless you are a master of the English language, usually need a great deal of assistance from copy editors. Smaller publishing ventures often don't have copy editors available to them. But once you get into this book you do get a certain feeling for the authors experience. Most military experiences are less about fighting than they are about routines, preparation and chaos. There is also the experience of the soldier in a strange, faraway land, separated from his (or her) loved ones, confronting cultures that are vastly different yet strangely similar, facing adversity and the loss of comrades. This story has all of those elements."},{"Title":"Surrender on Cebu: A POW's Diary--WWII","review":"I did enjoy this book other than some chapters which were dedicated to each and every (usually) officer he served with in the Philippines before and during WWII. Over all it gives a picture of Manila before the war began and how truly diversified its culture was at that time. And the life of an army infantry officer before hostilities started. Also the complete disorder once the Japanese began their bombing campaign even though the command was warned well in advance.

By page 158, which I believe was almost two thirds of the book, the war has just begun but he is still not a POW. I bought a book to read what it was like to be a POW under the Japanese. I actually gave up on it at page 158.The book was written in such a way that I was unable to sympathize with him in the least. I don't really understand what it was about this person that I disliked.

I'd seen the movie, which was not bad, but not particularly memorable either. This novelization is similar, leaning a little more toward the 'bad' end of the spectrum. I've never read the comic, so I have no preconceived visualizations to conflict with my reading.There were 2 big problems with this book for me. Firstly, Moore does NOT know how to write with a female voice or from a female perspective. This isn't an aspersion against male writers - I've read plenty of books by men with utterly believable and compelling female protagonists. This was not one of them. I alternated between eye-rolling and irritation at Evey's \\"inner thoughts\\" - not a good combo.Secondly, and I'm not a professional literary critic so forgive me for failing to describe this more specifically, but the book just isn't engaging. It relies too much on its built-in audience of lovers of the film and comic and doesn't seem to make too much of an effort to reel in readers on its own merits. As much as I tried to stay focused, my eyes kept involuntarily skimming down the page or wandering off to study the crown molding on my bedroom ceiling. This should NOT be a problem with a thriller. I should have been flipping pages into the wee hours of the morning. Wasn't happening.Conclusion: save your money and your time. I found $2 and two afternoons to be too much to spend on this novel."},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"This book is actually very good.

I DID see the movie. Now I would like to make mention that the MOVIE is BASED on the Graphic Novel. Now why does this have to be mentioned? Simple...It is not word for word, scene for scene, ink to ink of what the GN was, it was an up to date modernization of the original GN that was printed in 1988 (Or 87 depending where you look). The Movie rocks and opens many paths to what the world can lead to if the government takes control. Now personally I would love to read the GN and the Novelization of the movie because the movie KICKED ASS!! Now seriously, fighting over which is better is silly and you should just as well fight over what is better a russet or an idaho potato. They are two different mediums. 2 different visions. 2 different styles. The movie is good, don't try to compare it to the GN. The GN was good and don't try to compare it to the movie. The Novelization will probably be good (Unless they make a severe right turn to what the movie was about).As it was said several times in the movie...You can kill a man but you can't kill an idea.

After all, one would expect that the original work upon which the movie was based would suffice. My suspicions of this novelization were heightened by the cover which proclaims \\"an uncompromising vision of the future from the creators of The Matrix trilogy\\" and \\"a novelization by Steve Moore based on the screenplay written by the Wachowski brothers\\". Admittedly Alan Moore doesn't want his name associated in any way with the movie but these two statements create the impression that \\"V For Vendetta\\" is entirely the creation of the Wachowski brothers.Once you get into the book...well let's just say its done nothing to change my opinion of novelizations of movies based on novels. If you want to read \\"V For Vendetta\\" do yourself a big favor and get Alan Moore's graphic novel instead of this novelization."},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"...Until the DVD comes out.I was pleasantly suprised to find that the author of this novelization is fond of the original graphic novel enough to incorporate elements that were absent in the film. He tones down V's emotional side and enhances the sequences such as the Larkhill flashback and Evey's incarceration with lots of background information that got left out.I love the movie but I was disapointed with some of the changes made. This novel is a great combination of the two and is very evocatively written besides.The only thing that loses a star is that it follows the script of the movie nearly to a word. Usually novelizations are based on earlier versions of the script and so they contain extra scenes and such, but this one doesn't. If you're really attached to the script this is a good thing, but I was sort of hoping for a new spin on things.I'd still highly recommend it, though."},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"I know some you out there are purists and it is understandable that you do not like the changes made from the original graphic novel and that is alright, but my approach to this situation is to invite everyone to experience all three (gn, novel and movie) and take a moment to view each as a separate entity. I enjoyed all of them actually for what they were and not trying to impose upon each my impression of the other. It is our ability to take different perspective and view thing through as many frames as possible that allow us to better understand. Preconcieved notions are often our downfall. Don't miss out on what could be a great experience. Try it and see what you get. You might be surprised."},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"I have not read the graphic novel so will not get into a debate of format. I can only say that I thought the film was brilliant; a 1984ish parable updated for the ominous times in which we live today. I think people need to be reminded that the fight and sacrifice for freedom is not something that a previous generation did for us, but something we have to do for ourselves day by day. The abdication of that fight, in reality and in the fictional England of \\"V for Vendetta\\", will always lead to deprivation and despair; chaos and violence.Now about the book......Novelizations based upon films are justifiably viewed with skepticism; however, Steve Moore did right by the film and wrote an engrossing novel as well. Fans of the film will be relieved to know that the dialog in the novel is verbatim the same dialog as in the film, with all of those excellent Shakespeare soliloquies coming through intact. It was worth reading the novel just to have those passages near to hand. As some art forms can only be properly portrayed in film, so too, depths of character and backstory can only be properly portrayed in print. The novel provides just a little more exposition than was possible in the film; a little more insight into V and Evey and Finch, et al. Steve Moore's novelization can stand alone as an excellent work of political fiction."},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"I am a big fan of film novelizations, especially ones that are based on comic books such as this. The book is about a masked man named V who befriends a troubled and afraid girl named Evey and invites her on a quest to overthrow their evil government and it's leader Adam Sutler. v is a mysterious character who is dying for revenge (I can't ell why you have to read it!) against the people within the government who hurt him. The book is pretty violent but you should expect it to be because the film has recently been rated R for strong violence and some language. It's a great book filled with action and mystery and when there is a part where something doesn't make sense (and there will be if you're a slightly younger reader like me) just keep reading and soon you'll see that the story elements are connected in some really cool ways. Great writing. Can't wait for the movie but read the book first because you may not understand the movie!

It gave some details that movies can't provide. I think it was very well written."},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"Well, call me uninitiated, but I see quite a discussion in these reviews where fans of the graphic novel were less than enamoured with the novelization. I can understand the resentment, but as someone unaware of the history, I grabbed this from the audio shelf at the library and was captivated from the start. V is the best kind of anti-hero. He is haunted by a torturous past that is believable and wrenching. Because of this, his motivations can be understood if not necessarily justified. Evie is a bumbling, compliant milquetoast when we first see her. The transformation of her mind into a resilient free thinker yields fruit to V's labor. The dystopian, police-controlled state of future England is murky and drab, gray and hopeless. V is the star directing wayward souls to true north. If I may invoke the ghost of Orwell, it feels very 1984, but in a good way. As an independent voice of objective evaluation, I really enjoyed this book on its own merits. My curiosity is now peaked, and I may see if I can find the graphic novel and take in the movie as well, but don't discount the legitimacy of this work. It is very good."},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"V for Vendetta (9.5 hours, eight CDs, Unabridged, Blackstone Audio) is the spoken word version of the novelization of the movie script based upon the DC comics graphic novel (DON\\"T ASK ME TO REPEAT THAT SENTENCE AGAIN!).

Vance mesh characters so complete that you would think the studio was filled with people instead of the party of one. The fantasy story is part Count of Monte Cristo, which is eluded to many times the piece and part 1984. It was an interesting movie and an equally marvelous audiobook.Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD"},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"First off, the graphic novel is and will be better than a movie, novelization, play, interpretative dance, or whatever other form you want to put it in. Why? Because graphic novels/comics are a medium which cannot duplicated. As a reader you are much more actively involved in the story than passively watching a movie. With the page in your hand you may stare at it as long as you like, flip it upside down, flip back to a page previous, or any other number of things us crazy folks do who read these wonderful masterpieces of our time.To correct the person who, incorrectly, pointed to the artist of this work (Mr. David Lloyd) as disapproving of the film, it was not the artist who protested it's creation, it was the author, Mr. Alan Moore. Just as he has with the other hideously molested adaptations of his work (From Hell, Leauge of Extraordinary Gentleman) he did not want to have anything to with this million dollar money trap. He has several reasons which you may find out by simply searching for any number of interviews with him, but basically he does not approve of this and all other big budget, no substance movies that are produced solely for the purpose of extorting money from parents through their children, while offering no real meaning or substance other than an orgy of explosions and bastardizations of once meaningful tales. He gives his portion of the proceeds to the artists involved.Also in the correction department, this series began in 1982 and was published until 1985 in the UK's Warrior magazine, alongside other great works such as Marvelman (originally being in black and white). Upon the success of Moore in the mid to late eighties, with such work as Watchmen and his revitalization of the Swamp Thing series, DC decided to 'resurrect' V and thus Moore and Lloyd continued the series to its conclusion.If you want to experience V for Vendetta the way it was meant to be, go to your local comic shop and pick up a copy of the trade, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a mindless idiot who eats up whatever bs movie comes down the pike for whatever mindless reason, in that case there's no hope anyway, how'd you even get to this webpage??).\\"Hello the Voice of Fate and V for Vendetta.\\""},{"Title":"V for Vendetta","review":"Well I'm just writing a review because Amazon was unusually puntual on the book i ordered.

They were collected together and edited by his son-in-law, Joseph Light Wyatt, who was also an SPG missionary in South India - at that time at Trichinopoly. The book was published in Madras three years after Caldwell's death. It was quickly followed by the personal memoir of a colleague, and two laudatory sketches - describing him as \\"a mission hero\\" and his work with the poor as \\"unsurpassed in the history of the Church of Christ in any age\\"! The only full biographies of him that appeared were two in Tamil (1936 and 1980). Thus, \`Reminiscences' has remained the main English biographical source on the life and work of this remarkable priest and Tamil scholar until the publication by ISPCK in 2007 of a full biography written by an Indian historian (see References below).\`Reminiscences' describes the main events of Caldwell's early years in Scotland and Ireland, with only a cursory mention of his family background. Detailed extracts from his journal, written during his first voyage out to India, reveal his attitude to life, religion and the variety of people that he met. In the remaining 130 pages of the book are condensed the events of his 53 year-long mission in India, the problems he faced and how he solved them, first in Madras and then among the \`poorest of the poor' in Tinnevelly. The long list of his published works, including his two monumental books on Dravidian languages and South Indian history, point up his diligence and the prodigious power of his pen. In appendices, Wyatt has added accounts of his retirement and, seven months later, of his death and burial beneath the chancel of the church he built at Idaiyangudi.This autobiographical book remains an essential component of any future study of Caldwell's work and his influence on subsequent events in South India. It is said that he helped lay the foundations not only for the revival of Tamil prospects but also for the wider anti-Brahman cultural and political movements that were to follow in the 20th century.References:Y.

Most of it we dont realize but is already in place."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"Anyone who follows digerati publications such as Wired magazine and reads novels by Neal Stephenson already knows all about cryptography- that protective suit of armor that is supposed to keep all our private data safe from the thugs that would exploit it, whether they be the government, the megacorps, or the mob. In a future of ultra-surveillance, heavy crypto is the only way to hide.David Brin throws this notion in the trash.In \\"The Transparent Society\\", David Brin suggests that to embrace heavy crypto is to embark in an \\"arms race\\" of secrecy that lowly private citizens can't possibly win. The age of ultra-surveillance, universal wiretapping, and data regulation is upon us, and there's only one true way to avoid a scenario that seems straight out of Orwell- universal transparency and accountability. In Brin's view, the technologies of data retrieval and surveillance should be made available to anyone who would make use of them- neighborhood watches could monitor their streets, parents could keep track of their children, and, while governments and agencies would have the ability to spy upon citizens, citizens and watchdog groups would have the power to spy back- and thus hold the powers that be accountable. While we'd lose the anonymity provided by modern society, we would gain safety, not only from crime, but from abuse of authority. We'd be able to form new community bonds that utilize distributed computing to keep tabs on each other. And, most importantly, we'd gain peace of mind.In theory, anyway.While Brin's thesis is unique, formidable and provacative, it does seem to fall short in places. For instance, there would still be a huge division between technological haves and have-nots- between the people who know how to utilize this technology and those who lack the skill, the patience, the time, the resources, or the simple will to use it. Brin is more than a bit of a technophile (not insulting technophiles, I'm one too), and seems to assume that everyone in the neo-West is on the same page as him. Also, despite his numerous appeals to pragmatism, the book is extremely idealistic, and runs counter to the trends we're seeing today, in both the increased scope of government surveillance powers, the increased intrusion of companies into our lives, and the ever-escalating privacy arms race being fought on the internet and in the courts. The world is going the way of Orwell, and not the way of Brin.Yet, in the end, would there be any difference? In addition to public apathy, the sheer amount of data created by a surveillance infrastructure would be daunting to an individual attempting to make use of it. We're already facing a massive \\"information glut\\" today, both in terms of the internet, and in terms of government agencies who, despite their increased powers in the wake of 9-11, lack the ability to sort through all the data they're recieving. Between these problems and the haves-have nots gap, Brin's vision seems to fall short.Also annoying was Brin's obsession with Plato-bashing, which seems to be a popular hobby among political philosophers ever since Karl Popper tackled \\"The Republic\\" in his book \\"The Open Society and It's Enemies\\". Last year, however, my government advisor gave me a different view of the Republic- that the book is actually a satire, meant to show how and why totalitarianism never could work. This flies in the face of these Popperians, who seem caught up in the idea that Plato was a proto-Nazi.However, weaknesses aside, The Transparent Society is an excellent read. I'd suggest that, for an alternative (fictional) view, anyone with an interest in this title also pick up a copy of Neal Stephenson's \\"Cryptonomicon\\"."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"It is helpful to return to this book, from 1998, and to a follow on book, \\"the digital person\\" published in 2004, as context for the recent bru-ha-ha over NSA wiretapping without a warrant, and the loss to theft of tens of thousands of social security number and other personal information of veterans. Oh yes, somewhere in there, the FBI was hacked and companies like First Data are making fortunes compiling actionable profiles of individuals from disparate sources that were never approved for sharing.This book focuses on the value of transparency and considers the key issue to be the war between secrecy versus accountability. The author directly confronts the issue of \\"who controls\\" information about YOU.The author draws a useful comparison between the Internet, which sacrificed security for robust sharing, and the intelligence community, which chose security over sharing as its primordal principal.The author observes that the Internet is having one undesireable effect, that of fragmenting communities that become less amenable to compromise and consensus. He points out that reality and locationally based discussion can lead to more effective consensus and compromise.There is a useful discussion of \\"tagging\\" and how citizen truth squads and public commentary can serve as a useful antidote to corporate messages. The idea of \\"culture jamming\\" is picked up and treated at length by another excellent book, \\"NO LOGO.\\"Overall this book remains a standard in providing a detailed revoew of the issues and the capabilities surrounding digitial information about individuals. It is the author's view that WHO controls information, rather than WHO is elected, will determine the future of democracy.In passing the author makes two points that I find important:1) A liberal education, rather than the current trends toward immediate specialization, is essential if the public is to be able to think critically.2) Law enforcement under the current government model, does not work. The author gives the example of 100 felonies, of which only 33 are reported. Of the 33, 6 are caught, 3 are convicted, and 1 goes to prison.The author ends with a reference to genius savant John Perry Barlow, one of America's more notable commentators, and suggests that we are entering an era of individual collective intelligence against organized government intelligence (and secrecy).I recommend this book be read together with \\"the digital person\\" because the latter book focuses on the degree to which government and corporate mistakes--\\"careless unconcerned bureaucratic processes\\" can undermine privacy and good order."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"Note: I reviewed the book in draft form.Based primarily on rampant, uncontrolled growth in visual surveillance, Brin argues that the technological imperative is irresistible; and that privacy protections are futile. He believes that privacy can only be sustained by focussing instead on freedom of information for everyone: to achieve privacy, rely on freedom, not secrecy.Brin's argument can be most succinctly expressed as a question-answer pair: Q: Who will keep a watch on the watchers? A: The watched. His antidote is ubiquitous openness, with the powerful just as subject to visual and data surveillance as everyone else. Policemen will be judged by the viewers who, on the Internet, watch them watching others.Brin's argument is based on the premise that the watchers will not exercise political power in order to preclude others from watching them. The history of societies suggests that there have always been uneven distributions of power, and that the powerful have had incentives, and in most cases the ability, to exercise their power, and to resist diminution of their power. It would appear that Brin's transparent society can only be achieved if the patterns repeated across millenia of human experience are able to be overturned in short order.So his argument is undermined by the implicit presumptions that the less powerful are more powerful than the more powerful, that no-one will succeed in establishing enclaves of privilege, and that the actions of all will really be able to be monitored by all. Brin's counter-argument (private communication, 30 June 1998) is that the powerful will be only as successful in avoiding observation as they already are in resisting privacy laws that offend their own interests."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"Suppose that the cost of surveillance technology continues to fall. What are our options?(a) try to ban certain types of surveillance technologies altogether(b) try to restrict surveillance technologies so that &quot;we&quot; have it but &quot;they&quot; don't(c) try to escape surveillance technology by using encryption(d) try to encourage broad access to surveillance technologyDavid Brin argues persuasively that (d) is the least problematic solution. The other strategies are both more difficult to execute and less likely to produce a desirable outcome. For example, with (c) you have the problem that encryption may not be perfectly reliable. Moreover, even if you can encrypt your bits, you cannot encrypt your atoms. So you still may be subject to surveillance by a network of cameras, by centralized databases, etc.The greatest strength of the book is the way that Brin analyzes the situation from the perspective of different opponents to his position. The greatest weakness is that he rarely delves into details about how to implement his overall recommendation. What incentives need to be created? How do laws need to be changed, etc.? He offers hints, and occasional examples, but leaves a lot out.The relevance of this book has increased dramatically as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11. For example, on p. 320 there is this passage:&quot;Terrorists operate under cloaks of anonymity and secrecy...This is especially true of their concealed finances...the real impulse to force them open may only come after some band of terrorists manages to kill thousands...&quot;What Brin advocates is not a stronger police state but a more open system that allows any citizen to trace how money flows. Thus, although he would agree with the national security establishment that secret bank accounts are a problem, he would part ways with the establishment in that he would not give the police special privileges to examine bank transactions. Instead, he would expose such transactions to anyone.This is just one of many interesting ideas in this provocative book."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"David Brin has a lot to say and says it discursively, but he's done his homework--dipping into an impressive range of social science, philosophical, crytographic, and technical literature--thought carefully, marshalled compelling arguments seasoned with humor and bright metaphors, and, as a result, is worth listening to, arguing with, or simply pondering. The Transparent Society works out, with much supporting detail, ideas about secrecy and privacy first raised in Brin's magisterial novel, Earth, and does so in a civilizational context. I risk doing Brin and his book grave injustice by oversimplifying, but let me say Brin views &quot;accountability&quot; and &quot;criticism&quot; as central to the progress of neo-Western civilization (fight the power!) and further posits that criticism works very like T-cells in an immune system, providing (to a greater and greater extent as the collective grows in knowledge) autonomous and impersonal correctives against all manner of &quot;error.&quot; Brin argues for greater informational transparency--almost total disclosure--observing that, if universal surveillance cameras and other snoop technologies are inevitable (and they almost certainly are), then a generalized oversight capability, or a mutual surveillance capacity (in other words, my ability to watch the government with the same technologies that the government can watch me) is the answer to the classic question, quis custodiet ipsos custodes (who shall guard the guardians?)? In short, we all will. Brin's ingenious argumentation may strike some readers as cavalier or reductionist. It's not. It's serious and is, moreover, and a serious response to flamewar proponents of &quot;encryption as the answer&quot; to the privacy dilemmas of the wired age."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"David Brin explains why the traditional privacy argumets, equating privacy with liberty, and lack-of-privacy with tyrrany, are insufficient when dealing with the coming world of ubiquitous surveillance. What's more important, making sure nobody sees what you do, or making sure everyone can see what those who have power do? Secrecy always favors the powerful, DB argues, and since the technology is inevitable it makes more sense to give it to everybody than to try to ban it altogether.The book addresses many other aspects of the debate, such as the utopian ideal of perfect internet anonymity, and why the modern ideal of privacy is more a side effect of industrialization than a primordial human expectation.One thing I wish the book did better is to address why the rich and powerful won't be able to have a surveillance and shielding advantage over everyone else sufficiently great to counter the popular surveillance movement he anticipates. But this is a small flaw in an otherwise terrific book that will jar you out of any complacent assumptions you may have made on the subject of privacy. To see Brin address these issues in fiction, read Earth and Kiln People too -- both are terrific books."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"The entire book is basically one giant argument: That in order to be safe and maintain some form of privacy, we have to in fact give it up and become an open society.If we try to preserve our privacy through laws and such, he says, then we fall into the trap of who watches the watchers, because to some degree law enforcement and businesses will need access to private information.His ideal society, that he puts forth, is one where all information is available, with this caveat - that none of it open to just any priviledged group. So, though the police may be able to see that you're standing on the corner, you can see them sitting at their desk. While someone might know you read some newsgroup, you'll know which ones they read.He sees personal accountability, through openness, to be a great regulator of behaviour.Before I read this book, if someone suggested this to me, I'd call them crazy. But after reading his arguments, and considering the reasons why I'm an open-source software proponent, I find myself considering that Brin may be right to a degree."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"David Brin is a storyteller whose stories have a meaning. This time he has written a non-fiction book but the text is so fluent to read that you almost forget, how important issues Brin is addressing. As a science fiction author he has the vision to take present information society trends into their probable outcomes. And the choices involved are not always easy ones. And it is us that have to make them."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"Brin's book challenges several reflexive views held by cyberthinkers -- most significantly that strong encryption is the key to liberty. (He's clearly right about that. Encryption always fails. Look at ULTRA, MAGIC, cellphone encryption, DES, etc.) His occasional efforts to prove to readers that he really is a good liberal (anti-gun, anti-Limbaugh, etc.) and not some sort of nasty cyberlibertarian are a bit annoying and out of place, but aside from that I find little to criticize. As he freely admits, Brin may be wrong about many of his assertions, but he's clearly right that there needs to be far more discussion and far less groupthink than there has been on the subject of privacy and surveillance."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"Brin has taken some of the concepts explored in his science fiction, fleshed them out and provided a compelling rationale and background for them. He gives a fair and balanced analysis of all sides of the multitude of debates regarding privacy, censorship, freedom, access to information and the future of our society. And then he steps back and has the courage to do what so few people seem to do in modern debate--argue that the answers lie not in the extremes, but in a pragmatic center. Perhaps &quot;center&quot; isn't the right word, instead he seems to have moved the entire argument from two dimensions into three.If you have any interest at all in privacy (computer or otherwise), censorship, government power, encryption, or what our world may be like in ten or twenty years; you definitely need to read this book. You may not agree with it, but it's going to shape the coming debates."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"I really enjoy David Brin's novels and I am very interested in modern society and the technological changes we're experiencing, which is why this book appeals to me.I think Brin does an excellent job of presenting both sides of the argument, even conceding points to the &quot;opposing&quot; side of his thesis. This lends a lot of credibility to his arguements. He provides many many examples and illustrations which I find very interesting. He includes both historical and current examples which present a range of practical and philosophical perspectives. It's clear he spent a lot of time doing research to find these examples.That said, my only complaint is that the style of writing is a bit cumbersome. It's not Brin's extensive vocabulary (which is refreshing and challenging), but rather his tendency to continually refer to other chapters as support for the current arguement. The organization of the book is good and speaks for itself. The author should not be compelled to direct the reader to other sections. Specifically, the hypertext-like references are disruptive to the flow of the argument. If such asides are helpful for some readers, perhaps footnotes would have served the same purpose without creating so many parenthetical interruptions.All in all this is a topic I like to think about, and the substance of Brin's arguments are quite valuable."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"For perhaps two centuries people living in today's advanced industrial societies have had a modicum of privacy. Before two centuries ago, privacy was nearly unheard-of: you lived in a village where everyone knew everyone else and everyone else's business. Between two centuries ago and the present, people moved out of the village and out to a--relatively isolated--farm, or into a city where the sheer number of people made relative anonymity--and thus privacy--possible.But, at least according to David Brin, the future will be different. In the future privacy as we know it today will be nearly impossible to attain.In the future privacy will be next to nonexistent because of the explosion of audiovisual, communications, andcomputer technologies. Cheap hard disks will allow people to collect massive information about transactions: who did what. Cheap cameras will allow people to collect massive amounts of information about locations: who was where. Cheap computer power will allow the sorting and searching of massive amounts of information in search of those nuggets of data relevant to any one particular person. And cheap computers will allow anyone--or anyone with access codes--to access what will essentially become the stored life history of anyone.From David Brin's perspective, this change is coming. The only question is who will have access to the information that will be contained in the great surveillance databases. Will the information be &quot;secret&quot; and &quot;private&quot;--in which case only governments which may turn thuggish will have access? Or will the information be &quot;open&quot; and &quot;public&quot;--in which case we will once again be back in the village, where nearly everything is done in public and everybody knows everybody else's business: truly a global village.Brin makes a good case that the technology will bring us to one of these two outcomes. And he argues that the first outcome--in which we try to preserve our &quot;privacy&quot; by restricting access to the great surveillance databases--is a very dangerous outcome. It is a dangerous outcome because secret knowledge is power, and if the twentieth century has proven anything it is that governments cannot be trusted with secret knowledge. The great tyrannies of the twentieth century flourished because their surveillance gave them control and their secrecy kept enough citizens from realizing what they were up to fast enough. The advent of modern audiovisual, communications, and computing technologies greatly amplifies the power of surveillance, and greatly multiplies the danger if it is not countered by a greatly amplified power of the people to survey the government. And popular surveillance over the government carries as a side effect a potential loss of privacy. Anything that restricts popular access to information about other citizens restricts popular access to information about the government as well.I believe that Brin's book is not necessarily an accurate forecast. The futures that he envisions will probably never come to pass. And the choice that he foresees may well never be posed in the stark form in which he poses it. Yet the book is useful: the future Brin envisions is clearly one of the possible futures that might come to pass, and the consequences of what he sees as the wrong choice in that possible future could turn the twenty-first century into an abattoir that would make the twentieth century look like a Sunday picnic.If enough people read Brin's book, or are brushed by the currents of thought in represents, then it may turn into a self-negating prophecy: a warning of dystopia that by virtue of the horror it paints helps avoid that horror. That was the function of George Orwell's 1984.That is an honorable role for anyone's book."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"I'm half way thorugh this book and am finding it refreshing.The premise: ubiquitously available information makes for accountability - accountability minimizes bad acts.After I started this book, I felt my tight privacy boundaries easing - even though I notice others still clenching."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"I have not seen this issue tackled in a comprehensive way before, especially one that actually looked at the reasons behind our rhetoric and why do we care about privacy, and why do we sometimes not care."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"The author reports that the \\"central thesis of this book [is] that transparency is beneficial to all levels of society.\\" The particular focus of the book is on the limits and constraints of privacy and its relationship to freedom, which has taken center stage as a social, political, and moral problem in the information age. As the role of technology in information dissemination and storage has increased, both the speed and availability of information has brought a sharper focus on questions of privacy and freedom. Brin presents a wide-ranging discussion of issues that impact an educated discussion of freedom and privacy. His primary assertion is that both freedom and privacy are best protected by the transparent flow of information. Brin believes that this assertion is counterintuitive for many people who seek to \\"protect privacy by erecting barriers to information flow.\\" Much of the book is aimed at illustrating, through numerous historical and contemporary examples, how attempts to stop the flow of information (in the name of protecting privacy) inevitably lead to decreased liberty or less privacy, or both.An important aspect of privacy, the author points out, is accountability. Accountability, he writes, \\"is the one fundamental ingredient on which liberty thrives.\\" But, he points out, whenever a conflict arises between privacy and accountability, people demand privacy for themselves and accountability for everybody else. This is illustrated clearly by governments that seek to avoid accountability by reducing the flow of information about their activities. In response, corporations and citizens attempt to hide their activities and identities from the government, thereby seeking to enhance their privacy and reduce their accountability as well.In his discussion, Brin--a physicist--cites numerous authorities from various disciplines to support his arguments. He points out, for example, that \\"if transparency is the requisite condition in science, democracy, and free markets, it should come as no surprise that many economists now lean toward attributing most kinds of injustice, bureaucracy, and societal inefficiency to asymmetric information flows--where one person or group knows something that others don't.\\"Brin identifies several sources of disagreement about the connections between privacy and freedom. For one thing, he points out, \\"we cannot count on jurists to define privacy for us, or legislators to supply realistic protections for it.\\" As a result, he says, \\"those tasks will largely be our responsibility during the decades and generations to come.\\" Another source of disagreement is the form of reasoning used by partisans (who he refers to as the \\"strong privacy movement\\") who employ chains of tautologies to defend their position or to attack their opposition (the same tool used by many politicians and political radio talk show hosts). As those who have studied logic will know, however, the formal validity of deductive reasoning does not guarantee the truth of its conclusions.The only misgivings I have for the book are its length--his points could have been made more succinctly--and the fact that although he quotes numerous sources in the book, he does not provide adequate references for most of the quotes."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"David Brin walks through the future of privacy and surveillance, and where things could lead us. 13 years on, and I've not seen anything to say he was wrong.I keep seeing people saying things that show a disturbing ignorance of this book, people who say things that Brin clearly showed not to be the case.People need to get their heads out of the sand, and push towards workable futures, rather than pretending that we can put this genie back in the bottle, all we can do is make it the exclusive tool of governments, criminals, and large corporations. I don't think we want to live in that future."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and attended one of the lectures David gave as part of the associated book tour. I have continued over the past several years to feel strongly that the ideas expressed here, the questions raised, the assumptions questioned are IMPORTANT, even if essentially unanswerable. This is one of the very rare books that I continue to recommend to others, repeatedly, over and over for years, and will continue to recommend throughout my life. As much as I enjoy David's fiction work, I hope that this will be the work for which he is remembered.That said, why do I think this is so important? Well, firstly, I am a librarian, an American, and an academic researcher. Those factors color my perception of the issues discussed. I have worked with people from countries where censorship is accepted and commonplace, as well as those who self-censor, who tightly restrict their own information diets. I have observed patterns of decision making and reasoning associated with blind trust of a very few restricted information sources, and the decisions tend to be as heathy and strong as bodies built from a diet impoverished of core nutrients. I could spend a lot of time giving specific examples, but then I'd be trying to write a companion book to David's.As someone working in healthcare, I struggle with the balance between privacy and transparency, I truly believe that these questions MUST be asked and answered by all of us. Basically, there are very serious risks associated with extremism in either side of this issue, but it is pretty hard to achieve a strong stable balance point in the center. The question becomes, if we as a culture, as a global people, as a species, must accept imbalance in this teeter-totter between transparency and security, will overbalancing to one side or the other foster growth or stagnation, comfort or survival?We should be deeply grateful that David has written this book to provoke our own personal explorations in this area, irregardless of whether we ultimately decide we agree with him or not.READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"How disquieting would it be if you lived in a society where every item you bought, every television show you watched, every vacation you took, in short, every activity you engaged in, was known by everyone else? Even without doing any opinion sampling, one might be confident that everyone would be uneasy about the prospects of such a society. After all, privacy has been thought of as something that cushions us against criminal acts and unwarranted intrusion by \\"moral\\" busybodies who want to tell us how to think and act, even attempting to control what we do on our mattresses. But this notion of privacy assumes that these busybodies have information on us but we do not possess any on them. What if we also possessed the same information on them? Would this make the privacy situation any more palatable for us?The author of this book addresses these types of questions and more in this highly interesting book that should definitely be read by anyone who has an interest in the deep ethical considerations that are arriving with a vengeance as the rate of technological advancement goes into hyperdrive in the twenty-first century. The author does a good job of anticipating for the reader how technology might be dramatically influencing privacy without performing a mere extrapolation of the past.Indeed, the author's words are sometimes very compelling, and entice the reader into asking questions about the role of government and personal reputation. It is intriguing to contemplate what it would be like to not only have your credit checked when applying for a job, but also have access to the credit files of those who want to hire you. It is intriguing to contemplate what it would be like if the government, when required under the guise of \\"homeland security\\" to access information about you, is also required to provide a great deal of information about itself. What happens when those who spy are also spied upon, when the information some obtain about us is also obtained about them?The author refers to this equal opportunity of privacy invasion as \\"reciprocal transparency\\" in the book, and he offers an interesting discussion on its ramifications and its weaknesses. In light of the current situation in the financial markets, the ramifications of requiring senior executives to disclose all information are awesome, especially since the bureaucratic entity that is insuring this disclosure will also be required to disclose information about itself. Regulatory agencies will be required to disclose, as well as those information-robbing institutions called credit bureaus.Having a transparent society as the author describes might run some companies out of business. Firms for example who collect financial data with the goal of developing software or mathematical models to predict spending patterns or detect fraudulent information will find themselves having to build even more powerful models, since the data they possess is not proprietary anymore. Firms that specialize in genetic information will also have to answer to insurance companies, and vice versa, since both will have information on the other's business (and personal) activities.Information warfare takes on a new light in a transparent society. With everyone being vulnerable to everyone, the game will become one where one player will need to interpret and analyze the information in a manner that is more powerful than another. Citizens will need to have tools that not only access the information from the government, but also extract interesting patterns from it (as governments currently do their citizens). Data mining will become a 24/7 affair, where both the gathering of information and its interpretation will require the assistance of even more powerful technology, instigating a never-ending information arms race. A disturbing prospect to some, but a source of exhilaration to others."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"This is a \\"Must Read\\" for anyone who treasures an open society.

But, if we have our freedom, we will be in a position to demand some privacy.His solution is to have complete transparency i.e. shine the light in both the directions...from the govt. towards the people and vice versa. He explains how this will work wonders and solve various problems and he analyzes each problem in detail. Although he has suggestions on how to do it, he does NOT have any concrete method to make the govt or other power houses to be accountable. Thats where accountability and transparency fail.But, in principle, his ideas are great and need attention. Hopefully, some people in power think on these lines or atleast put these thoughts on the table, along with the others, before taking decisions.The book is very very positive, but perhaps more positive than how reality deals with the man on the road. Simple egs like the &quot;McCarthy era Communist witch-hunt&quot; which is supposed to have implicated many innocent people, the horror stories of the IRS published in TIME, and endless other egs go on to prove how bad it can get for the man on the street.He brings a great debate of pro-encryption vs anti-encryption to light and talks abt all the ways it can be harmful for the man on the street. He also discusses usage of encryption for business on the net.The book has a lot of &quot;if x happens, then y could happen&quot;.For example, he mentions the 92 incidents at the WTC and goes on to say that if something similar happens again, the govt will only get another chance to slap down more laws and restrictions with hidden forces getting their way and the normal layman losing some more of his freedom.In summary, a very nice book to read with a completely fresh set of ideas. Very refreshing. But would be just as effective with a 100 pages less. If you are a believer of privacy by keeping everything in the dark, this book could convert you. With reason.Another great book to read is &quot;Free to choose&quot;. It talks about freedom from the economic point of view but is not completely orthogonal to the theme of this book. Plus it written by Friedman. And no one tells him what not to write."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"I read Brin's book while working on my doctoral thesis, which contains a reference to the Nuremberg Files debate and the attendant controversies. My questions for the author are these. One, gay people and women value our specific rights to privacy very highly indeed,but you haven't dealt with the implications of surrendering that right. Two, the Nuremberg Files outcome was that successive ISPs closed down the offending website, despite sporadic mirrorsite resurrections. I contend that example demonstrates that Brin's call for cyberspace as a public sphere that promotes accountability is a noble objective, but the reality is that commercial and military interests already affect the scope of online speech. That may mean accountability is already impaired, but it also means that privacy may be salvageable.However, this is a meticulously researched piece of scholarship, and the author has made a noteworthy contribution to debates on the political and social uses of cyberspace. If there were awards for such constructive contributions,I contend this book would be at the top of the list."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"I think this is a very important contribution to the debate over privacy, encryption, and information technology. Brin makes some very interesting points that seem obvious once you think about them but get lost in the mainstream debates. For example, if strong cryptography were the norm, who would benefit more: the private citizen who doesn't want Big Brother looking into his bedroom, or the large corporation that doesn't want the public to find out about dangerous practices they're engaged in? Also, no matter how strong cryptography is, it can't protect against hi-tech spy devices looking over your shoulder as you type, and consider who can afford to use these things? Not the average citizen who wants to spy on tobacco companies...I hope that any time a debate arises between the government, privacy advocates, and any other interested parties, the issue of accountability and the other points that Brin brings up will now be on the table."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"The cameras are coming. The question is what we are going to do about it.I bought this book because I had read some of Brin's science fiction and I was intrigued by the idea of a science fiction author taking a serious look at how our society might deal with the threat to privacy posed by coming technology. Brin demonstrates his knowledge of technological issues (videocameras, cryptography, copyright, etc.), but it was his sensitivity to social issues that impressed me.This book really stimulated my interest in the relationship between privacy and freedom. Before reading \\"The Transparent Society\\" I had a simplistic sense that privacy was something we needed to preserve as much as possible in the face of whatever technology may come. Like many people, I've grown uncomfortable with the prevalence of surveillance as we go about our lives. I wouldn't say this book has led me to welcome the sacrifices we need to make regarding privacy--it just made me realize that we may not be able to go back to some mythical time when everybody was left alone. To use Isaiah Berlin's distinction, we may need to think more in terms of positive liberty (things we have the power to do) rather than simply negative liberty (restrictions on our actions). We need to be smart about how we navigate these waters. Brin adopts an intelligent position I have not seen put forth by anyone else. Instead of arguing that we need to shut down the flow of information gained through surveillance, Brin says we need to open up the flow of information to make it available to more people.Brin asks which of the following two societies you would rather live in: A world where video camera surveillance is ubiquitous and all of the information is overseen by a secret elite who have the power to monitor the actions of anybody they choose. Or a \\"participatory panopticon\\" (not Brin's phrase) where everybody can watch everybody else, including regular people being able to watch the watchers? For Brin these are the two options. After all, the cameras are coming. When everybody can easily record every second of their lives, and surveillance cameras are ubiquitous (to say nothing of gnat-sized cameras), we will need to rethink what levels of privacy we are willing to accept. Right now, it seems we may be, to use Charlie Stross's phrase, \\"sleepwalking into a police state\\". It could be that what we need is not less surveillance but more \\"sousveillance\\" (watching the powerful from below).Brin says we must answer the following questions:\\"Can we stand living exposed to scrutiny, our secrets laid open if in return we get flashlights of our own that we can shine on anyone who might do us harm--even the arrogant and the strong?\\"\\"Or is an illusion of privacy worth any price, even the cost of surrendering our own right to pierce the schemes of the powerful?\\"For what it's worth, though, I can't help but think that Brin is too sanguine about opening up so much personal information from our daily lives. It is scary to think of the way things could go. Jeffrey Rosen inThe Naked Crowd: Reclaiming Security and Freedom in an Anxious Agehas a critique of Brin along these lines. Rosen also disputes Brin's claim that crime dropped precipitously in areas where surveillance cameras were installed.Whatever happens, it is clear that sousveillance is something that should be pursued; we need to know more about how information about us is being used by the government, and, more importantly, by corporations. This is a position Brin advocates, and it is one in which I am agreement."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"This book does a good job spelling out a counter argument to the Big Brother mythology. Brin suggests all of the information is, on average, better for society because the malicious folks are usually punished. Yes, he admits, the information in the databases will be misused from time to time, but it will save more butts than it fries.The book is a bit too long, but it's fun to read all of the different nuances of the argument. I started skimming toward the end, but that wasn't because I didn't enjoy it. I just groked the argument and didn't need anymore help with it."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"This is the most thought provoking book I've ever read regarding solving many of the problems present in our American society. Brin not only plays Devil's Advocate with himself, he does so in a scientific fashion, backing up each side with facts and quotes from sources both old and new. He has in one book restated all the things that were intended to make our society a great one, and given us a means to achieve them still, even with all the troubles both seen and unforseen. Brin is a true genius, to be put in the shelf next to such authors as Karl Popper and Benjamin Franklin."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"Brin begins with a compelling comparison: should we allow technology to rule us -- or rather, should we concede the right of rulers to control technology -- or should we as citizens take seriously the egalitarian implications of technology. Brin defends the latter option with great conviction, but he's no congratulatory futurist. He concedes that we may be forced to reconceptualize how we think about privacy, but at the same time he offers compelling reasons to believe that technology may open an emancipatory door to more genuine freedom. Beware the cameras, for they are coming, is Brin's mantra. Far better that we collectively decide where they should be pointing."},{"Title":"The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom?","review":"I bought the book after reading about it in _New Scientist_ (British science journal). Brin's ideas are fascinating but the book could use some serious editing.

It is the best book I've found on the topic.However, this year I started teaching from this book. And when you teach you really discover the shortcomings of a text. It is frustrating when the author uses acronyms without explaination. I've also been running into minor math errors or oversights in formulas (e.g. defining a function f(x) and using 't' in the equation as the independent variable).I think the attempt to cover all of the material resulted in a brief overview of these areas and took away from the quality of coverage.

When her brother turns out to be one of the murderers of Rasputin . . . If this were an adventure novel, it would be improbable. As a memoir, and a view of a court system at the end of its existence, it is fascinating.

Those who do know of him know of his importance. This biography is not new but it is thorough. Akiba's thought and belief shine through it, as they do through the Talmud to which he contributed so much. As progeny of Akiba's School of Hillel, the Christian confessions also owe much to Akiba. But a great virtue of this book is its coherent social and economic analysis of the times and the society in which Akiba lived -- and died -- dying with a prayer on his lips, the prayer that goes to the heart of Judaism. We can ignore the ancient world, but we cannot take its hands off our shoulders. Better to come to grips with it.##"},{"Title":"Akiba,: Scholar, Saint and Martyr","review":"The provincial peasant of Akiba's day still- carried about bones of the deceased as charms- poured out drops of his wine to satisfy the greed and envy of the evil spirits- ate enormous meals on the ninth of Tishri in commemoration of forgotten Canaanite rites.This was especially true in the province of Galilee which being farthest from Jerusalem, had been least affected by it. Whatever light had pierced the darkness of the peasant mentality of this district had come from the Pharisaic teachers, the scribes of Jerusalem. *Their* disciples had brought the conceptions of the resurrection and immortality... But even when *the Galilean* accepted these teachings, he transformed them into ideals more in keeping with his own simplicity and naivete.The doctrine of the resurrection ceased to be the robust prop of the downtrodden, enabling them to face transient sufferings with equanimity. The doctrine of the resurrection became a romantic call to deny the world and to live only for a future life.The paradoxical combination of worldliness and otherworldliness, of idealism and practical common sense, which is basic to Pharisaism, was too complicated for the husbandman.Accepting the doctrines of Jerusalem, he [the Galilean]followed them to their logical conclusions.- If God is the Healer, why call on a physician? [If God can heal through faith healing, magic, and miracles, how can secular doctors make a living?]- If the soul is immortal, why shun death?Thus the faith which had enabled the plebeian of Jerusalem to live moved the Galilean peasant to die. [Furthermore,] the provincial Pharisees became either zealots burning with desire to usher in the Divine Kingdom [the Kingdom of the Son of Man] through force of arms, or Christians holding that only faith was needed to put an end to the Roman dominion. Both [of these] peasant groups agreed that the Kingdom of God was at hand and that everyone out to act [against Rome] on that premise. The zealot became a soldier, ready to die on the battlefield; the Christian gave his all to the poor, and prepared for martyrdom [rather than be subjects of the Kingdom of Rome especially after Rome no longer granted local kingships in Jerusalem--some semblance that there was a native god and king of the Jewish people].= = =The above is text from Chapter Two of Akiba by Louis Finkelstein and some of my responses to it.Jesus as a historical person, Jesus as a first through fourth century Egyptian and Greek construct and Jesus as a post-Temple Roman construct are not simple and naive.

I WOULD BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN."},{"Title":"Jules and Jim (Equinox Books)","review":"This is the book from which Franois Truffaut made his iconic film. It's the story of two friends, Jules and Jim, who both love Kate, who marries Jules, divorces him to marry Jim, but doesn't, and goes back to Jules, but continues her affair with Jim, not to mention other men. She's basically a selfish, self-centered woman, and it's hard to see why they love her. One can understand, perhaps the initial attraction, but these relationships span the period from 1907 until well into the '30s, when they're old enough to know better!So it's a curious book, and I liked the laconic style - short sentences, short chapters. Yet one never feels one knows or understands the protagonists, and Kate is positively unlikable.(I read it in translation, which, for the most part, seemed good. But there's one extended section involving a Nordic woman named Odile in which, to show that she did not speak French well, the translator has her speaking in a rather annoying pidgin (the author?translator?'s word). \\"Many them at caf&eacute; want teach me. Me no want.\\" Now, I have no idea whether that's a decent translation of how a Scandinavian who didn't speak much French would torture the syntax, but it was irksome.)"},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"As someone who has worked in the COMINT field, I can attest to the accuracy of Kahn's statement that \\"this kind of work is perhaps the most excruciating, exasperating, agonizing mental process known. . .\\" I can also attest to the incompleteness of his book, but to describe what went on in the Cold War and Bletchley Park would require another book. The first chapter, \\"One Day of Magic\\" is among the most riveting, a vivid, suspenseful description of U.S. cryptanalytic operations in late 1941. In some respects, nothing has changed. The Japanese military strategy in the days leading up to Pearl Harbor - total radio silence on the part of Yamamoto's strike force - was brilliant enough. It is forever impossible to extract intelligence from silence. Kahn also gives the reader step-by-step accounts of the thought processes of brilliant cryptanalysts such as the Frenchman Georges Painvin as he single-handedly solves the diabolical German ADFGX system in the First World War.His efforts arguably shortened the war on the Western Front as by the same token the Russian Army lost the crucial Battle of Tannenberg in the East through poor communications security.

When I got the book, I was blown away... while cryptography purists might rate the book lower for its lack of mathematics, it contained a (relatively) complete overview of the history of codemaking and codebreaking in one package.Later, in my professional years, I worked with folks from \\"No Such Agency\\" who either 1) knew the book and highly recommended it or 2) never heard of it, so I recommended it to them.

It's not a how-to book. It is, as its subtitle suggests, a history of the subject.And it's a very engaging history. The research is breathtaking. Much of the narrative reads like a novel; a good example is the introductory chapter on Pearl Harbor. If secret writing fascinates you, if you've always wondered how ciphers were constructed, solved, and even hidden from view, you'll enjoy this book.

It came out just when books on some previously hidden areas of WWII intelligence such as the Double Cross counterintelligence effort and the MAGIC Sigint system were starting to appear in print. Given that SIGINT/COMINT/ELINT were/are among the closest held areas of intelligence, what the author managed to do at that time is nothing short of breathtaking. From outlining what codes and cyphers are and what makes them difficult to read, to a chapter and verse depiction of the practical results of wartime codebreaking, the author covers the waterfront.

It gives the history of cryptography from ancient times up to recent events. Clearly the most recent info is obviously still kept under wraps by the NSA, CIA, KGB, mossad, et al.What the book covers is done with an interesting style and enough detail to be educational. Combined with the techniques are the usages and stories behind the usage of crypto.This is the only history book that I ever found to be worth reading. Kahn is accurate, complete, and interesting. He tells all but omits the usual history book tedium and boring factoids strung together with a verb (usually is or was), a noun, and the word &quot;the&quot;. This is more like a novel than a textbook.David is an authority in the subject area. I met him at an ACA convention and again at the NSA museum where he was doing research.He has some supplemental books that bring this one more up to date with newer info that has become available but this one is still the classic and should be the start for anyone interested in either the techniques, usage, or the historical implications of crypto.This book is most highly recommended. Buy it, read it, enjoy it, re-read it again because it is so interesting you will rush through it to see what is next and not pick up on many details the first time through.This is the definitive book and is a classic.

Any aspiring tech guru, hacker, cryptologist, security agent (FBI, NSA, etc.), and the list goes on will love this book and it is definately a must read."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"Definitely one of those books that will lead to a month or two of *excellent* reading. Kahn covers a mountainload of material, all at a light-to-medium depth, enough to wet your appetite, and with some of the systems and attacks described, enough that you need to spend a couple hours on a whiteboard to understand them, but not so much that it takes away from the historical aspect of the book. I definitely recommend this book for anyone wanting some very enjoyable medium-to-heavy reading.The last chapter, though, was a huge disappointment -- the publisher made a huge mistake in coercing Kahn into releasing a new edition of this book when he was in the middle of another project. The added chapter is a short 15 pages that gives only a cursory overview of the last 30 years... it really would have served better as an addendum or as part of the preface, and can hardly justify a new edition. Its content was very weak compared to the rest of the book, and hinted at some misleading assertions without qualifying them. I was very disappointed reading it as the last chapter of such an excellent book.As Kahn is definitely considered an insider during the last several decades, its understandable that he would choose not to write as in-depth on matters with which he may or may not have been exposed to in his professional dealings with the agencies and companies that have heavily influenced the cryptography community in the last 30 years.But it seems that there is a ton of additional information has been made publicly available since the first edition was published, much of it in the last decade, regarding the time periods already covered in this book, that could have greatly improved existing chapters or led to new chapters.Hopefully some day Kahn will have the time and inclination to return and do a new edition of this book, but until then, the first edition is just as good as this one and probably available at your local university library."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"Kahn's inspired account of codebreaking and cryptanalysis from ancient to modern is a must read for anybody who wishes to understand history, technology, warfare -- nearly every facet of life which depends on encrypted communications and their vulnerability.

The book is a fineachievement.Despite the fact that it attempts to cover the entire history of the subject,the center of mass of the chronology probably lies somewhere around 1925 -that is, a large portion of the book is devoted to WWI and WWII. This is quiteappropriate, as these were the periods when cryptography blossomed incomplexity and interest, and equally importantly it is the period of greatest*historical* interest to contemporary readers. But even so, Kahn casts his netinto some rarely explored corners: he does not neglect to discuss medievalcryptography (lovers of medieval polyphony will not be surprised to learn thata passion for intricate puzzles also animated the art of secret writing), hedevotes some pages to cryptography in non-Western societies, and he gives anin-depth discussion of the U.S. intelligence services' activities on the dayof the Pearl Harbour attacks.For me, the two best chapters of the book came after he had completed his mainnarrative arc. One chapter, called &quot;The Pathology of Cryptology&quot;, studies thepseudo-science wing of cryptology: all those efforts to discover 'secretmeanings' in apparently non-secretive texts. The story of attempts to extractfrom the text of Shakespeare's plays the latent confession that they had in factbeen written by Francis Bacon is hilarious and pitiful at once. And not onlyShakespeare: the Bible (Michael Drosnin's 'The Bible Code' is evidently onlythe latest in a string of ill-considered efforts to turn the Holy Scriptureinto a crystal ball), Dante, Homer, even Jonathan Swift have all, at one timeor another, been made marionette by would-be decoders who - let's be generous -did not quite understand what they were doing.Second, Kahn writes a chapter on the decipherment of ancient scripts, such asEgyptian hieroglypics and the famous Greek script Linear B. This is afascinating subject, well told (though I think that Simon Singh's 'The CodeBook', which treats the same topic, is even better).Anyone, however, who wishes to read this book should understand that it isincomplete as to the modern history of the subject. This is no fault of thebook, for it was written in 1967. The most significant topics missed are,first, the cracking of the Enigma cipher during WWII, which was notdeclassified until after Kahn wrote, and, second, the very significantdevelopments in cryptography in the age of the computer and internet,especially the new paradigm of public-key cryptography. (In fact this newedition of the book does include a short new chapter on both of these topics,but the treatment is cursory. Simon Singh, in his aforementioned book, does amuch more thorough and clearer job on these topics.)In summary, then, this is *the* book on cryptographic history, so long asyou're content to finish up in the mid-20th century."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"Big book. Great, as expected. The very first part of the book seems quite separated from the rest. It appears as a long introduction, probably too much detailed. The rest of the book is written in clean english understandable also for non mother tongue readers."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"The Codebreakers provides an excellent thorough history of cryptography. (Keeping in mind that it was written in the 1960's.)I tried to read this book straight through. In retrospect that wasn't the best idea. The writing is very dry. I got through it by stopping to work out the cryptographic systems described with pencil and paper. I guess I understand cryptography better but it took lots of paper and time (well that's cryptography for you;). Well actually I started skimming after a month of that so I didn't quite get through it. What I am trying to illustrate is that the writing is very dry. I'm interested in the subject and I had trouble slugging straight through. Be forewarned.So what to say what to say? If it happened in cryptography before the 60's then its in here, or at least I don't know the subject well enough to notice omissions. If you are into cryptographic history then get your hot little hands on this book.I recommend this book highly for university libraries (you need it) and maybe for some public libraries (just so someone can get to it with interlibrary loan). The Codebreakers is great as reference material. Anybody writing a paper on cryptography is going to want it if they are doing a good job with writing that paper. If you are the type of person who would benefit from owning such a reference then you already know who you are and you might just own this book already too."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"I purchased the hardcover version of David Kahn's \\"The Codebreakers\\" several years ago and thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

Without a doubt, you will get the whole knowable history of cryptology in Kahn's book. But don't make the mistake that some other readers obviously did. . .Kahn's book does NOT give a technical explanation of cryptanalysis, nor does he make such a claim. This is a history book pure and simple. If you want a more technical treatment, look up the books in his bibliography.Kahn's book can be tough in some areas, such as the telegraph codes and similar systems, where he seems to keep explaining each individual business codebook or system, but the true cryptography sections are a delight to read. You may want to try Singh's &quot;The Code Book&quot;, as it is a much easier (and cheaper) read, to see if it piques your interest. Then, do like I did, and devour every crypto book you can find, reading this one second! It truly is an epic work."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"Beware of the paperback 1973 edition.

I routinely return to it as a reference. Good stuff."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"You should DEFINITELY READ Kahn's book IF you want to know who the leading cryptographers and cryptanalysts in history were, where and when they were born, how many siblings they had, what their yearly salary was, what impact they had on history, how long they lived, what they died of etc. (I know there are many people out there who LOVE to read about such things.)As for myself, I have no idea how much a French livre was worth in 1570, and even if I did, I couldn't care less whether a cryptanalyst's annuity then was 100 or 10000 livres. I am sorry that all these great people died, but I think whether it was because of lung cancer or pneumonia is of little relevance. High school history was bad enough, I do not need any more useless historical data, thank you very much.What I expected from the book was that it would tell me a lot about the development of the METHODS of cryptography and cryptanalysis, describing what people tried, what worked, what didn't and why. (Including not only the algorithmic but also organizational and management issues such as key management.) If you have a similar interest, FORGET ABOUT Kahn's book. Kahn gives a decent description of the encrypting/coding methods, but this is so scattered among the irrelevant pieces of information that it is hardly worth the \\"mining\\" effort. There is HARDLY ANYTHING about the methods used to breaking the codes.Mr. Kahn made an honest effort in researching the field (except for the chapter about the modern developments - DES and the like - that is just glued to the end of the book to make it sell better). Still, he shouldn't have poured everything he ever read into his book. Less would have been more.The Codebreakers is reputed to be the best book on the history of cryptography.

I know of no other book which attempts or even reaches for the scope of this one. The content is quite fascinating, but I find the writing style to be slightly distastefull.If this book were written today, the writer would be roasted for his lack of racial sensitivity in the first chapter. As an American living in Japan, I was repulsed by the tone with which the author treated Japan as a nation and as a people. Since that seemed to be the standard in 1967, perhaps I cannot fault him, yet by my standards, I found the tone revolting. Was this material not revised in the second edition to preserve the style of the original edition or just to display the author's prejudice?Other than this, the author's stories and anecdotes often help the reader navigate what might otherwise be very dry material."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"My previous review, &quot;terrible prose,&quot; refers to the 1996 SCRIBNER edition. How can you assume, and incorrectly inform readers, that it refers to some other edition? The book has some excellent sections, but most of it reads more like a rough draft than a second edition.

I expected to learn that the first encryption techniques were simple dictionary ciphers. I expected to learn about Da Vinci's reverse writing. I expected to learn about rotating keys and the Enigma machine.But that's not what I found in this book. This book exemplifies why I hated history in school. This is a book for the type of pseudo-intellectual who prefers to learn about people who know something special, rather than learning something special, themselves.

It is a history of codebreaking and contains no instructional material on cryptography. Hello, Mr. Kahn, most people are interested in how to cipher and decipher!"},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"This book is not intended to teach the reader how to design or cryptanalyze codes and ciphers; it is a history book, and a really great one. However, the reader should be aware of a couple of things that may not be apparent.First, the 1996 &quot;revised edition&quot; differs from the 1967 first edition only in the addition of a final chapter to cover what Kahn didn't know (or didn't choose to include) in the 1967 edition. The first 26 of 27 chapters, and the references and bibliography associated with them, are essentially identical to those of the 1967 edition. This means that a number of statements and passages in the first 26 chapters, although correct in 1967, are misleading if one assumes they were written in 1996. I recommend that the reader skim Chapter 27 quickly before reading the rest of the book, so as not to misunderstand any of what's in earlier chapters.Second, keep in mind that in 1967 Kahn was essentially an outsider so far as the intelligence community was concerned, but by 1996 he was definitely regarded as an insider. Hence, the new final chapter is written with complete respect for the sensitivities of the intelligence community, which the original book was not. I was surprised to see one particular statement in the last chapter until I realized that NSA wants to correct a misapprehension widely held outside the community. Much more important, Kahn now knows a great deal that he has chosen to omit from the last chapter, including much that's unclassified but still regarded by somebody as sensitive for one reason or another. He even omits certain material that he made publicly available some years ago in his written testimony to a Congressional subcommittee. So the reader should understand that this book says less than it might about various aspects of the history of cryptology and its impact dating back as far as World War II. Whether this is good or bad depends on where one sits; if one is concerned about the sensitivities of various governments, it's good; if one wants to know as much as one can about the history of cryptology since 1940 that's not still clasified, it's bad."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"I first came across &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; in the original edition, published in the 1960s. It was a massive read, and one which I never finished in one sitting; however, a love of history, the romance of espionage and the fascination of working with mysterious information kept me going. It is a pleasure to see the book has been reissued.Kahn does not create a textbook for the serious cryptologist; such a work would be more mathematical in approach. What he does is give, from a layman's view, a good mid-level history of the art/science of cryptology. The first chapter, covering the cryptanalytic events of Pearl Harbor, brings you in; then he goes over the history of secret writing from the days of Egyptian hieroglyphics to roughly the present day. Interesting areas include the discussion of the European &quot;black chambers&quot; of the 1600s and 1700s, a good talk about how rumrunners in the Prohibition days used complex code/cipher combinations to thwart the Noble Experiment, and a highly entertaining chapter on the &quot;ciphers&quot; that proved Francis Bacon wrote Shakespeare's works.The updated edition falls short in its attempt at updating, which is why I don't give another star to the book. The discussion of cryptography in the world of the Internet is far too thin to satisfy. This, of course, could be a function of the beast; the Internet and electronic cryptology changes faster than any book could keep up with. In addition, information on the Enigma and other areas of World War II cryptology, declassified since the previous edition, could have been added to increase understanding of this critical time. However, the remaining &quot;classic&quot; text is still excellent, and has served as the layman's reference on cryptologic history for thirty years."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"I highly recommend this book. It is an incredibly thorough and complete description of cryptology history. I disagree with some previous criticisms about writing style and racism. I do not find the style difficult in itself, there are maybe too much details given on every historical bits... but this may as well be appraised! I cannot find any racism in Chapter 1, describing the US deciphering efforts of the japanese exchanges just before Pearl Harbor. There are hints of the US (allied actually) superiority in cryptography, but this is a plain historical fact. There is a criticism of 1940's Japan, but I cannot find this objectionnable... (the same is true about Nazi Germany). I could find nothing in the book against Japanese people or today's Japan..."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"I am in the midst of Kahn's 1000-plus page history of code at the moment, and so cannot provide a complete review here, but I'd like to offer an opinion that balances those of other contributors. Kahn's book is a compelling read, and clearly the product of exhaustive research. He initially captures one's curiosity with a gripping behind-closed-doors account of the days leading up to the attack at Pearl Harbor--an 80-page segment that moves quickly and confidently through a factual narrative rivalling the best war fiction. The next chapter retreats to a history of code and cipher, and this is where the trouble begins. While Kahn's research is superb, he gets bogged down in esoterica, and the book slows. The next several hundred pages are filled with great information, but there is little compelling narrative to drive the story along. Kahn opts instead to indulge in a detailed explanation of cipher--arguably essential to the later chapters--but serves up little of the immediacy and pace of the first chapter. In addition, he's not at all judicious with his use of superlatives; the writing is peppered with far too many statements like '...the most somberly prophetic in the whole history of cryptology'. Kahn hits his stride when he has a strong historical tale to structure his presentation. The descriptions of the execution of Mary, Queen of Scotts, and WW I, for example, are outstanding. If the book were pared down to this type of episode alone, it would be a 'cover-to-cover' experience. As it is, its extensiveness limits its audience to only those already enthusiastic about this arcane field. I came to the book intrigued by the secret goings-on conducted in secret writing, and am tempted to abandon it, or at least skim a generous portion."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"The original version of Codebreakers is a wonderful, detailedhistory of cryptography and spies.

The great photographs of thefirst edition have been considerably degraded in qualityto boot. I guess that it meets the standard of a new editionbut the list priceof $65 for a bare outline of 30 years isunreasonable.

If you REALLY want to how ciphers, codes, and systems are broken, Kahn is the author who tells you. Any person knowledgable in the field of Cryptology or Intelligence will tell you that Kahn' book has never been equalled. It is known as &quot;The Bible of Cryptology&quot; within the field.From early Sparta and Rome to the present day, the strengths and weaknesses of systems and devices are presented in clear, concise terms -- occassionally with a bit of levity, where appropriate. Novices in the field will find much useful -- and highly interesting -- information. Professionals always find reminders of the fallability of &quot;unbreakable&quot; systems.Kahn's writing style is clear, concise, and analytical. It is never boring.I was employed by a maker of Cryptographic equipment, and was authorized to discuss key generator and cipher system issues with the heads of national governments. A copy of &quot;Codebreakers&quot; was our most requested -- and welcomed gift. That speaks more eloquently than any words I might craft."},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"This massive, exhaustively-researched book by David Kahn examines the HISTORY of cryptography from the dawn of civilization to the darkness of the Cold War. He starts an introductory bow to capture readers' attention with the Magic story (American decryption of Japanese WWII codes). Then, Kahn traces the cryptologic developments from the early most rudimentary monalphabetic substitution systems to polyalphabetics, codes, transposition ciphers, enciphering devices (e.g. checkerboards, grille ciphers, one-time pads, one-time tapes, ciphering cylinders, voice modulators, etc.), deciphering systems, and all the governmental organizations devoted to enciphering and deciphering activities.His investigations cover Babylonian cuneiform, Roman cipher systems (e.g. the famed Caesar cipher), an entire host of Renaissance cryptographers and systems, Englightenment-era black chambers, British amateur contributions (e.g. Playfair cipher), American Civil War transposition systems, telegraphic codes, French military ciphers, and the communication cipher used during the Dreyfus affair.The book then devotes about 2/3 of the book to modern cryptographic systems used from 1914 to 1965 (the book was published in 1967). Some of the WWI-era subjects treated in this section are Britain's WWI Room 40, the unusual ADFGVX German cipher, WWI battlefield cipher and code systems. Between the wars, Kahn describes the American Black Chamber, the advent of rotor machines (e.g. Engima, Hagelin, Hebern), the rise of mathematical/statistical analysis, the US Magic decryption program, the extraordinarily successful Soviet cipher systems, and quite a thorough examination of all WWII-era cryptographic activities.The last few chapters of the book are devoted to describing the NSA, the chimeric search for Shakespearean hidden messages, pigpen ciphers, Prohibition-era rumrunners, numbers runners, visual telegraphy, the decryption of Linear B/hieroglyphics, potential SETI coding systems, and a very short brief on DES.Bar none, this is the one book to own on cryptographic history up to 1965. (This is not a cryptology textbook, however.) Kahn's writing style and subjects are always engaging and packed full with comprehensive information. Kahn reveals that almost every cipher system ever invented (with the significant exception of one-time pads/tapes) has been broken - most surprisingly quickly. This is a lesson that any organization using radio (including mobil phones) and public facilities (e.g. internet, PSTN) to communicate definitely ought to realize. This is a must read for anyone interested in cryptologic history. Outstanding!"},{"Title":"The Codebreakers: the Comprehensive History of Secret Communication From Ancient Times To the Internet","review":"This is the essential history of cryptography at least through WW II. But of course, at the time it was published none of the ULTRA and Enigma decrypts had been released. And since the original hard book edition had become a rare book... it needed to be reprinted: the paperback had been excised of much of the material in the notes. All that said, when I first heard that this second edition was to come out, I eagerly sought it out. But I returned it the next day. The only new material is a short superficial chapter added at the end. None of the former text has been changed and the new material is simply not worth it since I have the first hardback. If you want more on ULTRA and the others there are a number of excellent books on both cryptography and SIGINT operations published since.

I read the Earlier edition at least three times.Yes, I found that, at times, the text gets bogged down in minutae that may not appeal to a particular reader, but in a volume of this magnitude, with this scope, and this ambition, that is virtually a lock.What many of the reviewers don't seem to realize that the book was written in the context of the 1960s and that not only the writing, but also events described must be put into context. David Kahn does an excellent job of doing just that. To illustrate, I might simply point out his portrait of Herbert O. Yardley. One only has to read Yardley's &quot;Education of a Poker Player&quot; to understand just how accurate Kahn was in describing Yardley and his role.Like all history books of a more specialized nature, there is a serious advantage to having enough background information to understand where events, people, and technology fit into the puzzle.If you are seriously interested in what went on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; in much of the historical events of the 19th and 20th centuries, this book provides information that is an essential part of the puzzle."},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide Thesaurus (Barron's Pocket Guides)","review":"How can this book have been compiled by a Ph.D?

No witnesses despite the crowd, and the tide has washed away any evidence, so it's days before Bognor Inspector \\"Hen\\" Mallin, a compact, cigar-smoking dynamo, identifies the woman as Emma Tysoe, a psychologist professor and serial-killer profiler. She was on leave from her college in order to help the police with something she described only as \\"Huge, if it's true.\\"His curiosity whetted, Diamond teams up with Mallin and both ignore the Home Office national command to keep clear of Emma's last hush-hush case - a crossbow killer targeting a named list of celebrities and dropping clues from \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\" Brushing up on his Coleridge, Diamond and his new pal, the unintimidated Hen, also track a rebuffed suitor and a reluctant beach witness, while delving into Emma's coded computer files and her active private life.Winner of the Diamond Dagger for Lifetime Achievement, Lovesey crafts an intricate mystery with neat surprises around several unexpected twists. Hen Mallin is a fine addition to the series; gruff enough to hold her own even with Diamond, she's comfortable enough to be friendly, even vulnerable, and has a ready sense of humor. Diamond, still melancholy a year after his wife's murder, has recovered his edge although he's not nearly as insensitive as he used to be. Various points of view juggle the action and fine secondary characters give the story further depth. As well written as ever, Lovesey's latest will please old fans and new."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"Lovesey's latest Peter Diamond mystery is, not surprisingly, good. Diamond, still recovering from his wife's death is brought in to investigate the murder of a Bath woman. As the woman was involved in the investigation of a serial killing, Diamond is gradually roped into that as well, bringing both cases to conclusion.What I liked a lot about the novel and the series is the ongoing character development we see from book to book. Ingeborg, the journalist turned policewoman we met in a previous novel is a fresh new addition, together with Hen--Diamon's counterpart from the beach town where one of the murders occured. I will strongly recommend this book to fans of police procedural series."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"This book is an excellent addition to the strong Peter Diamond series. For those who like to read British procedurals written by a master of plotting and characterization, I really recommend the Peter Diamond series. He's probably the most likeable and believable detective out there in this genre, and Lovesey displays a craftsmanship in his characterizations that is unequaled. His main character keeps on getting better and better, but in this book we are also introduced to a new one and she is a winner. Her name is Hen (short for Henrietta), and she's a detective from a neighbouring town who Peter collaborates with on a murder case. She's a smart, no-nonsense, cigar-smoking woman who will brook no interference from anyone on any of her cases. The murder occurred in her patch on a beach at a seaside resort, but the victim was a Bath citizen, so Peter is brought in to assist. Somehow the two detectives find a working relationship that is effective and they develop a mutual respect for each other. All the while through this book, Lovesey maintains a tight plotline, but he also has a knack for bringing in very unique puzzles that aren't that easy to figure out. In this book the murder victim found on the beach is a woman who works as a psychological profiler for Special Branch, and Diamond and Hen can't help thinking that her murder is connected somehow to the case she has been called in to consult on. Lovesey keeps the pace going, and the intricate plot is one that certainly kept my interest. We also see a more laid-back and less curmudgeonly Peter Diamond. He has somehow mellowed as he's still been trying to get over the sudden death of his wife, and it's made him even more believable and more likeable."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"Peter Diamond, still recovering from his wife's murder the year before, is brought into investigate the death of a young woman found dead on the beach after it was established the young woman was from Diamond's district of Bath.

In an intertwining mystery, a crossbow wielding serial killer known as \\" The Mariner\\" (due to leaving clues from \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\") is targeting a known list of celebrities.This is the eight in the Peter Diamond series. I love how with each subsequent book, Diamond's character has developed. Bringing in Hen Mallin is a new catalyst to Diamond's personality.

Do yourself a favor and crack this book for a Good Read."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"The House Sitter is the first novel I've read by Peter Lovesey, and I now look forward to reading more of his work.There's no need to go into the plot (it's summed up already at the top of the page), but I should tell you that the writing is engaging enough to be a real page-turner &amp; literary enough to escape the boring realm of genre mystery.My guesses as to whom the killer might be were totally off, which is exactly what I want from a mystery; the character's(even bit players) had enough charm or creepiness to be more than one-dimensional, and there was just the right amount of humor- allowing the narrative to escape being bogged down by too much death.Recommended!"},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"In the middle of a crowded beach in Sussex, a woman is murdered without a single witness to the crime. In addition, her bag is missing and therefore anything that could identify her. When the Sussex police finally identify her, she is found to be a Bath resident and Peter Diamond is called in to be part of the joint investigation with Inspector Hen Mallin of the Sussex police.The woman is identified as a professor at a University and also a consultant profiler for the police. The last case she was working on before she was murdered adds a complexity to the investigation into her own murder because she was profiling what appeared to be a serial killer. Could this serial killer have killed her too?Identifying and finding the serial killer who seems to know where police safe houses are and codes to security systems, before the other 2 names on his list are murdered is a race against time without any obvious clues for Peter's and Hen's teams to work with.The twists in this novel make it a page turner and the ending was a surprise."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"\\"The House Sitter\\" is a very good mystery with memorable plot and characters. The humorous personalities of the lead characters are especially fun. I enjoyed reading this book and will probably buy more Peater Diamond mysteries in the future."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"From the start this book had me hooked. Found it hard to put down. Liked the introduction of Hen Malin."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"An intricate police procedural murder mystery with great characters and dialogue plus, a plot with many unexpected twists. This is the eighth book in the Peter Diamond series and author Peter Lovesey again demonstrates why he was awarded the British Crime Writers Association Lifetime Achievement award. Lovesey is a master of intricate plotting and interesting characters.This book introduces Henrietta \\"Hen\\" Mallin, a short, cigar-smoking police inspector from the coastal town of Bognor, England. Peter Diamond, the gruff and weary Detective Superintendent from Bath, England teams with her because a young, female university professor is strangled on a crowded beach in Bognor, during a Sunday afternoon. Although the victim was surrounded by people, there are not any witnesses and by the time the police arrive, the tide has erased all evidence.Meanwhile, a methodical serial killer is murdering celebrities and leaving clues in the form of quotes from \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\" by Coleridge. And, to make matters worse, one of the victims was murdered while being guarded by the Special Branch from Scotland Yard. This leads to a bureacratic battle when Peter Diamond learns that the murder victim in Bognor was a psychologist and crime profiler secretly working on the serial killer case for the Special Branch. And, that is just the beginning of Diamond's problems as his investigation is undermined by an internal mole. I will not reveal more because I do not want to destroy your reading pleasure.Lovesey is a great writer because he combines realistic police investigation with realistic, flawed characters plus he injects all the hallmarks of classic British mystery. Lovesey is not as literate as P.D. James but that does not diminish his writing. This is an intricate and suspenseful murder mystery. I would give this 4.5 stars if I could and the only reason I do not give it five stars is because I think there are several other books in the series that are slightly better. But, I am being very critical and in no way mean to imply that this is second-rate."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"Peter Lovesey is one of the most respected and beloved practitioners of traditional mystery in England. Unfortunately, his following in the USA is not as big as it should be.He is a grandmaster of the rare skill these days, the skill of the puzzle. His plots are convoluted and complicated, but what makes it exceptional is that his solutions and twists are unexpected, but logical.His detective Peter Diamond is a real gem too. Big as life figure, but believable with human traits and faults.\\"The House Sitter\\" is another marvelous book by Peter Lovesey."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"GOOD BOOK, VERY WITTY,GOOD MYSTERY AND A REAL PAGE TURNER. FAST SEND OUT. VERY HAPPY WITH THE SMOOTH TRANSACTION."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"This is one of the more interesting of Lovesey's mysteries in that there are 3 senior detectives in 3 locales who, through circumstances, have to coordinate their investigations. Two of them, Peter Diamond & Hen Mallin (The Circle), star in other Lovesey novels (mostly Diamond--e.g.The Vault). They are both strong characters though Diamond has been deeply affected by the loss of his wife (in the priorDiamond Dust). Part of the charm of this work lies in the interplay between these two talented detectives. It also includes several supporting characters from other works such as Sergeant Stella Gregson on Mallin's staff & Ingeborg Smith (former newshound) & Keith Hallowell on Diamond's staff. I find it both interesting and enjoyable that Lovesey includes capable women detectives in this novel as well as some others. Indeed, Diamond himself is far less irascible (and IMHO more likable) in this novel than in most of his other ones. Like his very warm performance inDIAMOND SOLITAIRE, Diamond again displays his sensitivity to children.The novel includes two main but related crimes which provide considerable interest and diversity to the book--in addition to the thoughtful characterizations of all of the detectives. The crimes are both simple and complex in different ways, and the solutions match this paradoxical situation as well. Overall the book is IMHO clever and enjoyable--one of Lovesey's best of the 16 I've read so far."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"I've long fondled Lovesey's books at the library, but this eighth in his Peter Diamond series is the first I've actually read. It starts with a family on an outing to the beach near Sussex. The all-too-typical day on the beach suddenly becomes creepy when the couple's young daughter goes missing. At the end of a frantic search, a more troubling discovery is made&oacute;the body of a dead woman. It's a nice little trick to draw the reader in, using one situation as the warm up to the main course.The dead woman is soon determined to have been strangled while lying on the beach in plain view. This is a sort of reversal of the traditional locked-room mystery, with the added complications of the tide having washed away all forensic evidence, and no clue as to the victim's identity. Tough, cigarillo-smoking D.I. Hen Mallin is assigned to the case, and the difficulties just keep on multiplying even once the victim is identified as a psychologist from Bath who consulted with the police as a criminal profiler. The Bath connection brings with it the involvement of the acerbic Peter Diamond, and the two strong personalities must figure out a way to work with each other.When they discover that the woman had been working on a hush-hush serial killer case, Diamond subtlety hijacks that case as well. This strand of the book gets a little baroque, as the serial killer invokes \\"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" in a quest to kill Britain's leading film director, a professional golf phenom, and a libidinous ex-pop star turned industrialist. Whether this fantastical case is related to the profiler's death is a key question, and one that isn't answered until the climax.The investigation is fairly interesting, as encrypted files on the psychologist's computer are decoded, two key witnesses to the beach affair go missing, and all manner of complications are strewn in Diamond and Hen's path. And while this procedural stuff is good, the larger matter of the serial killer left me rather cold. The serial killer is an overused character in fiction, and I tend to find plots revolving around them rather boring. The twisted madness to their methods always come across as over-the-top, and motivations always seem disproportionately thin. This book is no exception, which is too bad, because otherwise, it's quite a good read and the characters draw one in. I will definitely seek out others in the series."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond is nominally the star of this murder yarn, but it's the clever plot and the crisscrossing story lines that keep the reader engrossed. Briefly, we have an attractive psychologist, who happens to be a police profiler, strangled while at a heavily populated public beach. It turns out she was profiling a murderer, dubbed the \\"Mariner,\\" who taunts authorities by announcing his victims in advance and leaving about passages from Coleridge's &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner.&quot; So Diamond and his colleagues are involved in unraveling two murders simultaneously. The novel moves right along to an exciting conclusion and should keep the reader guessing until the last few pages. The writing is literate and unobtrusive."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"This mystery features excellent characters. The victims are well-developed before they are killed and, as always, Diamond is plenty of fun. The author also draws interesting portraits of the other detectives, Jimmy Barneston and Hen. The ending is impossible to guess and is almost certain to surprise the reader. You really can't beat this mystery for writing quality, plotting, character development and humor."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"Another really enjoyable outing with the redoubtable Peter Diamond.Keep them coming!"},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"This is my first Peter Diamond mystery and I will certainly go for the remainder. Mr. Lovesy is a very good police procedure mystery writer. There is a nice dry with that adds to the telling of the story.This is a double plus mystery. It starts with the murder of an identified woman on a beach. The tide takes out all the evidence and the investigation is headed by an interesting female CID. Once the body is identified, Inspector Diamond gets involved because the victim is from his turf. A serial killer then emerges and the investigations go hand-in-hand - sometimes.Inspector Diamond is an obviously evolved character. \\"Hen\\" as she is called is new to the series and a very good character with depth and personality. The supporting characters are also believable and have their own characters. It is a compliment to Mr. Lovesy that all the characters have depth and uniqueness.The solving of the mysteries is interesting and fun. My only criticism is that they get wrapped up so very fast. I looked and so there were only ten pages to go and the serial killer still had to be identifed and caught. It was disappointing, especially compared to the terrific build-up to that point.A good mystery and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The House Sitter","review":"A standard UK-sited police detective story.

It would be nigh on to impossible to select my favorite from the many children's books she has illustrated. I think of the irreplaceable \\"Wizard of Oz\\" with a perky little Dorothy in her apron and red hat or the wonderful \\"Hansel and Gretel\\" with the rosy cheeked girl pushing the dreadful witch into an oven. One could go on and on. Each time I come across another book illustrated by Zwerger I think it's even better than what has come before.This Vienna born artist has a vision, I think, and she brings this to each of her works. She has been quoted as saying that her favorite authors are the Grimm Brothers, Charles Dickens, and Hans Christian Andersen. Yet, when she paints, she does not see these stories as they've been presented in the past but with a completely fresh approach. That's certainly true with her paintings for \\"The Little Mermaid.\\"Begin with the end papers, shiny reflections of water's depths and then our first view of the sea king's castle with its coral walls and shell roof - dwarfed by the immensity of the sea. Each full page painting is framed in white, adding to the pristine quality of the images. Sea shells and fish decorate margins. Zwerger brings both wit and understanding to her work; it's unlike any other and totally captivating.Surely, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the translation from the Danish by Anthea Bell. Here is no Disney mermaid, but the fully realized story as written by Andersen, full of wonder and hope.Yes, \\"The Little Mermaid\\" would make a wonderful gift, but you'd best buy two - one to keep and enjoy.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"Growing up, Disney's version of this story was probably my favorite movie. Id really never known that there was a book until I came across it in the library(which is silly, because this is something of a classic.)Reading this book rather enraged me. The ending is quite different from the Disney ending and I dont understand why they felt the need to change it. This is a lovely tale of unrequited love as well as failure and disapointment. Every story need not have a happy ending and unfortunately most children's tales do. Maybe Im a pessimist, but it seems that stories where everything works out in the end might be sending children the message of a perfect world where disapointment is out of the norm.I just wish there were more stories of this sort to give kids a more realistic view of their future, because they have to learn sooner or later."},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"I really loved this version of The Little Mermaid. It was very beautiful and sad at the same time. I loved the part where it was talking about each of the mermaid's 15th Birthday that they would go up to the serface and see what it was like. The book was sad in a way. It was when the little mermaid was talking to her grandmother and found out that they don't have a soul after they die. The part about the sea witch was kind of scary... but not. Though I didn't like how she had to cut the mermaid's tounge off. The mermaid does give up everything and her life... because the one whom she loved fell in love with another girl. You have to read this book for yourself. I really loved this book! I hope you will too!"},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"This is the true story of The Little Mermaid. Unlike the Disney version where she gets the prince, the mermaid dies of a broken heart when the Prince whose life she saved marries another. The tragedy of the ending is what made the original version so touching. A beautiful mermaid gives up her voice, her family, her life in the sea in order to be with the one she loves. The promise is the love and the soul of sacrifice. It was a love dependant on another, being the Prince, and the risks she took were considerable. When the Prince falls for the woman he thought rescued him at sea it is the end of the Little Mermaid's quest for eternity. But since she doesn't kill him and his new bride she gets what she wanted all along ... a soul ... and no longer needs the Prince to live as a spiritual being in eternity. Not only is the little mermaid free from the curse of the Sea Witch but she earns her soul on her own volition. The Prince was merely a conduit to her wish. It is more poignant this way since the little mermaid no longer needs to earn love from anyone except herself.[...]\\"Among the daughters of the air,\\" answered one of them. \\"A mermaid has not an immortal soul, nor can she obtain one unless she wins the love of a human being. On the power of another hangs her eternal destiny. But the daughters of the air, although they do not possess an immortal soul, can, by their good deeds, procure one for themselves. We fly to warm countries, and cool the sultry air that destroys mankind with the pestilence. We carry the perfume of the flowers to spread health and restoration. After we have striven for three hundred years to all the good in our power, we receive an immortal soul and take part in the happiness of mankind. You, poor little mermaid, have tried with your whole heart to do as we are doing; you have suffered and endured and raised yourself to the spirit-world by your good deeds; and now, by striving for three hundred years in the same way, you may obtain an immortal soul.\\"The little mermaid lifted her glorified eyes towards the sun, and felt them, for the first time, filling with tears. On the ship, in which she had left the prince, there were life and noise; she saw him and his beautiful bride searching for her; sorrowfully they gazed at the pearly foam, as if they knew she had thrown herself into the waves. Unseen she kissed the forehead of her bride, and fanned the prince, and then mounted with the other children of the air to a rosy cloud that floated through the aether.\\"After three hundred years, thus shall we float into the kingdom of heaven,\\" said she. \\"And we may even get there sooner,\\" whispered one of her companions. \\"Unseen we can enter the houses of men, where there are children, and for every day on which we find a good child, who is the joy of his parents and deserves their love, our time of probation is shortened. The child does not know, when we fly through the room, that we smile with joy at his good conduct, for we can count one year less of our three hundred years. But when we see a naughty or a wicked child, we shed tears of sorrow, and for every tear a day is added to our time of trial!\\""},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"Long before Disney created Ariel, Hans Christian Anderson created the real Little Mermaid.

I love it!!"},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"If you're expecting anything like the Disney movie, you will find *very* little here. This story isn't even for little kids, since some parts are rather painful. In Disney's movie, Ariel had only to give up her voice. Here, the mermaid not only has to deal with that, but the witch also tells her that with every step she takes it will feel like knives stabbing into her feet, and even in some tellings of this story, bleed.The ending is a bit preachy, what with the fact that the little mermaid lacked a soul and could only earn one through good deeds and/or the happiness of children. I like this story, but it's also very bittersweet."},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"This is a very nice book. A very delightful story that is written in a style both classical and modern at once. This is basically the same Little Mermaid that most are familiar with (The old Disney movie). But this book does have its differences that are essentially evident. The pictures' realistic colors and proportions fit this story well. This was a well-put together story.I'll admit that it is my personal preference for books where this book loses a star.

The fact that this book is a love-story with fantasy tie-ins doesn't help my attitude."},{"Title":"The little mermaid","review":"One shouldn't expect the cliche' in this book's artistic approach.

I immediately bought this book and devoured it. She not only offered me a beautiful, godly perspective about raising a child with Down Syndrome - she helped me see what a privilege and joy it is to raise children - period! She inspired me to be the kind of Mom that I always dreamed about being before I actually became a Mom and lost my vision. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"I ordered Barbara Curtis' book, Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms, with the anticipation that it would offer a light-hearted, humorous, scriptural view of one Christian mother's daily grind. With a title like that, how could it be anything less, right? In fact, it is much, much more. As a busy mom of 3, I looked forward to gleaning some words of wisdom and wit from this mom of 12! TWELVE! As Curtis states in her Introduction, she does not promise answers to the questions of motherhood, but that her book is about \\"sorting through the things that get in the way of finding joy in motherhood ... about seizing each day, squeezing every bit of joy from every peanut-butter-and-jelly-smeared moment, finding God in the hum of a washing machine or an unexpected bargain.\\"Curtis begins her book by backing up and weaves the learning moments of her past throughout the text. She gives a synopsis of her personal history, and the reader comes to understand why it was so very important that the \\"Angry-but-Real Frightened Little Girl\\" find her \\"Chapel of the Wash and Dry.\\" In these chapters Curtis writes of the insecurities of becoming a Christian in her adult years, describing her first Ladies Bible Study, where she arrived late and smelling of spit-up: \\"I kept my hands folded to hide my scruffy, half-bitten fingernails, but there was nothing I could do about the rose tattoo on my right hand ...\\", to the concept of having a quiet time when she was \\"too pooped to pop.\\" - \\"It loomed over my life with the gravitas of a Goodyear blimp, a constant reminder of yet another something I needed to do.\\" As well, Curtis writes of the trials of her childhood, a shotgun wedding \\"based on two miracles,\\" the blessing of her 8th child, and the healing power and love of a Heavenly Father in the absence of a physical father.In her journey Curtis found Jesus, but even before her salvation she writes of the discovery that is the backdrop of this book: \\"While I wasn't yet a new creation in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17), God must not have wanted to wait four more years for me to become a better mother ... that there were no limits or boundaries to my motherhood, that I could become any kind of mother I wanted to be.\\"Curtis' exposes much more than her heart, she reveals the limitations of her past and present weaknesses and acknowledges that when she \\"instinctively reached for the Giver of Life\\" she found His mercy and love in His still small voice. In her active embrace of surrendering to Christ she found that \\"life is lived in between, in the little things. And most of these things you can't change.\\" Her joy as a woman, wife, and mother comes in that surrender.As one of the \\"less-than-perfect\\" mothers that will read this book, I found myself openly laughing, while also deeply relating to Curtis and her application of Matthew 11:28-30 to motherhood. \\"Let's face it, as mothers we're reminded several times a day at least that we will never be perfect. But our stress level can stay under control as long as we're conscious of that easy yoke and our perfect Partner.\\""},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"This is a delightful book. It's the perfect length for busy moms, and oh-so-full of wonderful words of refreshment. The author finds deep, spiritual joy in the GREAT ADVENTURE of motherhood. She loves her family; she loves her life. And after reading it, you'll understand why - and you'll want what she has for yourself.Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room is Barbara Curtis' life story - her long, drawn-out answer to the question she probably hears several times a day: \\"So, how do you DO it?\\" Barbara is the mother of 12 kids - 9 of her own and 3 adopted. What's more, she and her husband purposefully adopted three children with Down's Syndrome since one of their sons has this \\"little extra\\" chromosome. Need I say more about her qualifications to write a book?In the first chapter, Barbara describes how her laundry room became the one place in her home where she could have a \\"Quiet Time,\\" where she could pour out her heart to God as well as listen to the \\"still small Voice\\" of the Lord. She says:\\"And so my laundry room became my prayer closet. For years it's been the place I meet the Lord each morning before my children awake, and at intervals throughout the day as I transfer clothes from baskets to washer, from washer to dryer, from dryer to baskets again ... I never have trouble finding God in my laundry room. He is always ready to receive my praise, my thanks, my prayers for family and friends, my joys and heartaches too.\\"Barbara's journey to motherhood has taken plenty of twists and turns - she didn't have a good role model growing up, as she was transferred between divorced parents and even in foster care at one time. She moved to California and went through a period of embracing the ideals of radical feminism. Then she discovered Christianity for the very first time while listening to James Dobson's gentle voice on her car radio, then through attending a Focus on the Family marriage retreat. From that point on, her life changed forever, and she's never looked back.If you have a child who is a \\"challenge\\" or has special needs, this book is definitely for you. Barbara calls this \\"a little extra.\\" She describes what it was like to be surprised on her delivery day when she found out her newborn son had Down's. While the nurses and doctors feared her reaction, instead she described the \\"joy and exhilaration\\" she felt at being chosen by God to raise such a special child who would always need her care. She shares how this \\"little extra\\" in some of our children motivates us to depend on God more.She writes, \\"What a privilege to be so dependent, so connected to Him. And no doubt about it, it's the connectedness to God that's key in realizing that being a mommy is a completely worthy - and unique - calling.\\"--Heather Ivester, Mind & Media"},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"When I finished the introduction and first chapter of Lord, Meet Me in the Laundry Room, I cried.

Still, Barbara Curtis' book resonated with me as no other mothering manuscript before.The language wasn't flowery; her thoughts were not new. Perhaps it is because she is a mother of twelve, and I could tell that every feeling and thought I'd ever nursed, she had already nursed before. Perhaps it was that I enjoyed reading more from a woman I had grown to know only online. Perhaps it was when she said this:\\"This book is about spending some time together sorting through the things that get in the way of finding joy in motherhood. It's about getting real about the past and mistakes we've made, the limitations of our lifestyle as mothers, the competitive spirit that robs us of intimacy with other mothers, and the lack of affirmation that sometimes makes us want to cry.\\"This is a book about seizing each day, squeezing every bit of joy from every peanut-butter-and-jelly-smeared moment, finding God in the hum of a washing machine or an unexpected bargain.\\" (page 9)From the title, you might infer that the book is a \\"how-to\\" meet God in your everyday life as a mom. But it's much more than that. Barbara (it seems more right to call her \\"Barbara\\" than the more formal \\"Curtis\\" when writing) begins her book by connecting with the reader. She doesn't do this by saying, \\"Hey, I've got all these kids. Whatever story you've got, I can top.\\" Instead, Barbara weaves a story of her own misjudgments and creative mishaps with the old story of God's faithfulness.\\"Then from the backseat I heard Zachary clear his throat and in his deadpan four-year-old Eeyore voice ask, \\"Mom, when are you going to get a job?\\"\\"This is my job,\\" I said, maybe just a little edgy.But homeward bound, as the kids fell asleep one by one and I was left alone with my thoughts, I began to see the beauty of Zach's question: somehow-even though it could be hard work and even though I had my testy moments-my kids didn't think of motherhood as a job.And I decided that was a good thing-because it's not really a job at all, but a calling...\\" (page 98)Today's mothers are tired, due to nurturing the distractions that compete for our attention and affections. Reading this book was like a cup of cocoa on a cold day: Barbara's warm candor and not-so-perfect stories were a treat to me, a mother in the trenches. Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room is a story of deliverance, Barbara's own, as well as the one waiting for us younger mothers who have the willingness to learn some wisdom from those who've gone before."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"I finally read Barbara's Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room, which she sent me as a thank you for some help I gave her with her blog.

Instead of a list of must-dos or a formula for the perfect Christian life, Barbara encourages us to simply talk to God, anytime, anywhere, about anything. This book is also a great read just for the interesting insight into her life and family. I'm always curious about the lives of non-fiction writers whose books I enjoy, and Barbara is so open and transparent, both in her books and articles and on her blog, that she always feels like an old friend. Not just that, but an old friend with lots of experience and good advice. I absolutely recommend that you read any book of hers you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"Looking at the wonderful,lengthy reviews already given on Barbara's book, I don't think I have anything new to add, but just have to chime in with my agreement. You'll find nitty-gritty realism that still reaches for God's best, and gracious encouragement and inspiration in the adventure of motherhood. Most importantly,as said by others, this book leaves out the GUILT TRIP!Thank you, Barbara."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"Barbara Curtis has enough kids (grown, and not yet grown) that she understands that for a mom to be able to read a book, she needs to be able to put it down at a moment's notice, and pick it right back up without being lost. She also understands how badly some of us need to know that we are not in this alone. This book is easy to read encouragement, and not one bit of judging or preaching!"},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"The subtitle for this book is \\"Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms.\\" Let me start by saying that if you are a harried mom looking for some respite from your tasks, pick up this book. Barbara Curtis writes for real women, and takes you on a spiritual journey, teaching you about God and His grace along the way.Without sounding preachy or overly sentimental, Curtis uses touches of humor to lighten the load, and soon you realize that you can meet God in the garden, the minivan, and yes - even in the laundry room. \\"...God is bigger than any place I set aside to meet Him and as near as I invite Him to be.\\"I highly recommend Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"I think the subtitle says exactly what this book is about...\\"Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms\\". I have been so blessed and helped by this book. Barbara is so down-to-earth in her writing, and that is exactly the kind of help I was looking for. In this age when motherhood is looked down upon, Barbara reminds us what a high calling motherhood truly is. I so needed to hear that God doesn't care when or where I call out to Him, He just wants me to do it! And it can be while I'm folding laundry or putting dishes in the dishwasher or changing my toddler's diaper. Thank you, Barbara, for reminding me that God does have plans for me, that He is here to lift me and sustain me. Thank you for reminding me that this is an incredible adventure and that I can find the joy in it when I let go and let God. Thank you for this encouraging book. Thank you for sharing with us that we don't have to be perfect, because God accepts our imperfection. I highly recommend this book for any mom, it has been a big help to me."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"I loved this book, and enjoyed every page of it. It was written in a very easy to read style, perfect for busy moms who sometimes have to read a page at a time. The common sense tips and intimate style made me feel almost like she and I were just having a conversation...woman to woman...mother to mother. Her words were full of wisdom, and I am just thankful that I came across this book. I recommend it to all mothers. Five stars!"},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"How refreshing to find a book about mothering that actually casts fresh vision for moms without creating guilt! You'll find no lists of the 25 things you need to be doing to be a great mom. Oh no! This book isn't about doing, but about being- being the woman, the wife and the mommy God made you to be. Barbara has a warm, open and \\"come alongside you\\" style that magically mentors moms through the pages of this volume. She shows you how to live life with God in the nitty gritty of life by sharing her triumphs and tragedies and by pointing you to the One who created mommies in the first place. It is He who has the answers, not the author and she makes that abundantly clear. This is a book that will be loved, cherished and dog-earred to boot, ready to be picked up when you are in need of a pick-me-up. Buy one for yourself and one to loan to others whether they are moms or not! This book offers hope and encouragement for anyone trying to live out their life with Christ in a real and relevant way. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"Barbara did a wonderful job in this book. She shares with us her early life as a non-believer and how it has been transformed since accepting Jesus into her life some 16 years ago. She is a remarkable woman with a heart for children. God put her right where she belongs - right in the middle of a busy home with her 12 children and 8 grandchildren. And let's not forget her loving husband, Tripp. Can you imagine Sunday dinner at her house?I have learned a lot of things from this book, mainly being &quot;Don't sweat the small stuff&quot;."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"What a treat to read a Mom book without feeling guilty! So often mommy books lure us with HOW TO'S, then point out our inadequacies. In contrast, Curtis' book lets us breathe, relax and laugh! She never claims to know all as a parent, but reveals that being a mom is a role filled with growth as we let the Lord lead.Barbara tells her story, a background full of negatives which God uses to shape her into a positive Mom. Her understanding tone makes Barbara the mom friend we'd invite over even if our house was a mess. She speaks frankly, but with love, forgiveness and hope. She reminds us that our Father's love is unconditional, no matter our background He can use it, God accepts us even when we can't accept ourselves, and there are no limits to the kind of mother we can be so take the hand of God and let Him lead!To Barbara, motherhood is not a burden but a blessing --- so much so that Barbara and Tripp have nine biological children and three adopted with Downs. Her experience speaks for itself and her stories keep the reader nodding in shared amusement.Although each chapter is a short, easy read, Barbara's humor and storytelling kept me dipping into the next chapter...and the next..."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"Barbara's book spoke to me. She doesn't offer fancy suggestions or ideas. She tells how to &quot;simply get real&quot; with God, family and self. I laughed and cryed as I read her book. If I didn't know better, I would think that she was writing about my struggles to manage it all. I would highly recommend this book to every mommy, no matter the age of the children. My children are teenagers and it sure applies to me."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"I have to confess this was the first book by Barbara Curtis that I have ever read. I bought it in hopes of inspiring me to greater success in my ongoing Laundry Wars. By page sixteen this book had touched my heart. That's when the author said \\"somehow He made me understand that a mother of toddlers just isn't like anyone else. Most of the time, my life was not under my control at all, but more like a series of random events. It was the way I responded to events that my spiritual life could be measured.\\" Much of the book is filled with autobiographical narrative addressing how the author grew to know God and become fulfilled in a traditional role of wife and mother. It's an uplifting autobiography, short on the sad parts and long on the story of redemption and renewal.Barbara Curtis has written other books but this one is \\"about more than teaching children to be self-reliant, orderly, and helpful. Because even if her children are the most self-reliant, orderly, and helpful children in the world, a mother who's not finding joy in her daily life with them needs to know she can.\\" I suspect if you are familiar with her other works, this one may be a bit different.It was a short read for me (finished in one sitting) but well worth the time. I came away refreshed and renewed. With so much emphasis on the importance of finding quality quiet time first thing in the morning, it was nice to hear a different point of view. Each and every menial task we complete throughout the day is a small opportunity for prayer.This is a great book to give to a mom with young children. It's filled with humor and honest and encouragement."},{"Title":"Lord, Please Meet Me in the Laundry Room: Heavenly Help for Earthly Moms","review":"I laughed and cried my way through this book.

Thank you."},{"Title":"Saviors of God Spiritual Exercises 1ST Edition","review":"The name Nikos Kazantzakis is anathema to so many; countless Americans probably only know him as the man who authored the book &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; on which the controversial (and widely demonized) movie was based. There was much more to this man than met the eye, however. Such Americans don't know the reader of Nietzsche and Bergson, the man who idolized both Christ and Lenin as saviors of humanity, the brooding genius whose incisive glacial intellect was perpetually at war with the hot blood of his idealism and passion. A fascinating and fragmented character who ascended the peaks and explored the dark valleys of human experience more than most, Kazantzakis commits pen to paper here with a spirituality that will haunt the reader; it is more alive and explosive than any camp-meeting revival. Writing with a distinctly modernist tone of world-smashing and revolution akin to Marx and with a racy, frenetic, hot-blooded pace which D.H. Lawrence would've admired, Kazantzakis introduces us to HIS idea of God: not the friendly father figure of Christian lore, but the turbulent, primordial drive for life and change within the universe, striving (successfully, through sometimes violent fits and starts) to ascend, to create, to thrive, to &quot;transubstantiate matter into spirit&quot;. More akin to Bergson's idea of &quot;elan vital&quot;, this is a series of spell-binding meditations that most mainline believers of any stripe probably wouldn't like; precisely because it scares the living daylights out of you with its frightening possibilities and its sirens' call of seemingly chaotic life-affirming zest. The late Kazantzakis beckons to us across the void, urging us to take the plunge and gaze into that vortex without fear, even though we will lose all we are in the process."},{"Title":"Saviors of God Spiritual Exercises 1ST Edition","review":"In this bewildering time of new-age quasi-sophistication or reactionary conservative histrionics regarding spiritual matters, Nikos Kazantzakis's &quot;The Saviors of God&quot; sparkles as a diamond amidst an overwhelming sea of trash. Ours is an age of excess, spiritually and materially (and all too often this line is blurred by televangelists and the like), and we, as a people, properly crave a spiritual instruction that lifts us gratefully above the banality surrounding us: a recent bumper-sticker shows the Christian fish symbol (the Greek letter alpha) &quot;eating&quot; a Darwin-fish (a fish with legs), and Bob Dylan once wrote of &quot;flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark.&quot; Kazantzakis's &quot;The Saviors of God&quot; is a truly illuminating underground masterpiece (comparable to the American poet H.D.'s startling &quot;Notes on Thought and Vision&quot;), employing Kazantzakis's usual muscular language and profoundly penetrating insight into what being human really means. Although written as prose, it reads as poetry; and spirituality is not, for this Greek giant, sickly (goofily) sweet or insultingly strident, but, rather, careful, intense, intelligent, and passionate. It is this &quot;passion&quot; that drives every word Kazantzakis wrote, and in &quot;Saviors&quot; his passion is carefully distilled into a short and readable text that will, quite simply, never be forgotten by any who has licked its honey. For this is the &quot;mad honey&quot; consumed by the priestesses of Delphi, and when Kazantzakis writes of thought being a &quot;bird of flame&quot; hopping from branch to branch, one knows that one's own head is equally ablaze. So, lay aside your Bibles, your Korans, your Torahs...and prepare yourself to tremble, for &quot;The Saviors of God&quot; is a spiritual earthquake composed not of stern admonitions (yawn) or threats, but of humility before the gift of divinely-composed flesh. Lust, herein, is not a sin, but is instead the holy of holies."},{"Title":"Saviors of God Spiritual Exercises 1ST Edition","review":"&quot;Nonsense&quot; is a very draft and cruel word to characterize an attempt to describe the CHAOS. For that's what this book is. How can one describe the Chaos, the human agony for the purpose of life? Every time you visualize yourself as a tiny dot (equals to nothing compared to the universe) and you ask the all-time-big-questions, you fill the fear. If you want to ease your heart, read the bible, or whatever the holy book of your religion (we all do in times of despair). You will be reassured for the absolute truth for all your questions and fears. But if you want to keep your eyes open and dare to look at the chaos this book will be a good companion. It is not perfect, but is the best attempt I know.

Although I've come to disagree with some aspects of it, I also disagree with those who discount it as not reflecting Kazantzakis' personal philosophy and passion. At its essence I can liken this volume only to Sri Aurobindo's \\"Savitri\\" in its message and grandeur. It is we who have imprisoned God, we who have projected our subconscious shadow side onto the Essence of the Universe and parodied it into a Cosmic Parent Figure -- And that Essence, which is also the Essence of us, screams within us for liberation and expression. Kazantzakis was excommunicated from the Greek Church for his views and writings, and finished his life in self-imposed exile on Naxos; the world of spiritual readers and seekers owes him a debt of gratitude, for sure.

My overall verdict is 'it is & it isn't'. There are some useful & interesting desert recipes in here, and a few vegetable ones as well. I found the rice, main dish & fish recipes rather disappointing - rather of the meat & 2 veg. style of British cooking I guess.I think if you're a beginner, interested in simple dishes that are easy to make & with no hard-to-find ingredients, this could be an interesting the book for you. It reminds me very much of the Turkish working-people's cafe-style food which is simple & no-nonsense. The book is certainly authentic; there are lots of typo's & the photography is a little lacking. The writer explains things simply & in an easy to follow way. I have made many of the dishes before & the recipes have very little capacity for things to go wrong! However, they are a little bland for my taste - most recipes use only salt & pepper as seasonings & I prefer at least a few herbs here & there.If you're looking for a book which is beautiful as well as functional, I'd go for Ozan Ozcan's 'Sultan's Kitchen'. If you want a basic 'how-to' book of authentic dishes to get started, Inci Kut's book might be a good option. However, I'd actually recommend the best cookbook of any style of cooking I have ever bought, one from which I have made almost everything and which I've used almost every week for years; 'Turkish Cooking' by Gulseren Sancakli & Margaret Oliphant. This is a small, cheap book, maybe a little hard to find now, but every recipe in it (apart from the Wedding & Yoghourt soups) are absolutely infallible.

Here is a naked, contemporary man with his back to us, walking on the bottom of the ocean (pool? lake?) gripping his clothes with both hands which drag along the floor, being watched over (protected?) by an ancient Greek bust, the head of which is approximately half the size of the man. Another image shows us two men from another century dueling in full fencing costume, while two contemporary men, under water, fight (embrace?) between the fencers. A third shows a contemporary, slender man, again under water, fully dressed in jacket, shirt, tie, etc. walking on the bottom of the ocean, using his hands and arms to cover himself, to hide himself, to protect himself, while the ancient, heavily muscled statue near him revels in its nudity and vulnerability. But it is obvious that the photographs must be seen to be enjoyed and no description of mine can do them justice.These are extraordinarily sensual, if not sexual, photographs which demand viewing by anyone interested in cutting edge art. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"this is the first john saul book i read. yeah i know everyone in the review said it but its true, although i dont know why.anyway, i found it gripping, creative and somewhat simple. unlike those other huge novels, this one had limited characters, maybe due to the fact this is based on a secluded town. i wouldnt say this is really much of a horror book, but i could say its a soft-sided b rated movie type of thing. it has great description about the swamp setting and it has an interesting twist about the dark man. which i wont say.speaking of the dark man, he is an interesting person, if not a weird one. the story i think is basically about how the influence of the dark man takes toll on the town, and the price a person would pay for eternal life."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"Although the underlying premise of this novel is rather ridiculous when you think about it, Saul manages to make the story work. It's not terribly thrilling or suspenseful, however. There is no surprise to be found in the conclusion because the clues to what mysteries this tale contains are glaringly obvious early on. Darkness is Saul's take on the old eternal life theme. While the Dark Man is rather creepy and mysterious early on, his true identity, purposes, and methods are revealed halfway through the book, leaving the reader with a long sprint toward a finish line of foregone conclusions. The medical and scientific aspects here are rather laughable, really, and a little inconsistent (not to mention somewhat disgusting) in the end.The setting of the novel both helps and hurts it. Most of the action takes place in the Florida swamps, a setting I myself find quite unappealing (although Saul has tourists lining up to explore the dangerous, disgusting swamps, small children and babies in tow). It's certainly creepy, what with all the strange sounds and movements taking place in the dark shadows, not to mention alligators, crocodiles, water moccasins, and other deadly beasts roiling and slithering their way through all of the actions. I got a little tired of one individual after another getting lost and trying to find his/her way home in this ruthless environment, though. As soon as one person turned up, another ran out and got lost, starting the whole swamp search ordeal over again.I can't voice my criticisms of the story without giving too much away. I will just say that this novel is much less believable than most of Saul's fiction. For that reason it didn't strike too strong of a chord in me personally; the fact that the main plot twists and ultimate conclusion were so obvious also left the novel incapable of truly grasping my complete attention and fascination. In less talented hands, this story could easily fail miserably because of its flimsy relationship with reality, but, as I said, John Saul makes it work. I was in no great hurry to reach the conclusion, but I also never felt compelled to toss the book aside without finishing it. If you've never read Saul before, I wouldn't recommend letting Darkness be your introduction to his work-it is not quite up to his normally high standards."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"Darkness was the first Saul book I ever read and ever since I've been hooked.

I understand that good fiction often requires a little suspension of reality. But Darkness goes well beyond &quot;a little&quot; suspension of reality. This book is unbelievable almost to the point of being funny. I never really got sucked into the story. In part, because although I was able to picture the faces and places, the almost cartoonish story line meant it never seemed real, even in my imagination.That being said, this book isn't horrible. It's average and that's about it. I'd like to give it 2.5 stars, but can't. There's a few twists. Most are pretty easy to see coming, but I don't think Saul was really intending to blindside you with them anyway. The end was a little disappointing, although I read worse."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"In the deepest part of the Florida swamps there is a crazy man who is stealing youth from &quot;the dark children&quot; and giving it to the men of the swamp to live forever. The babies are being kidnapped and given up to this crazy man as an offering of the purest evil. The son of the dark man and this punk girl who got away are the only ones who give the swamps a chance to overcome this evil. Upon this punk girls return, everything starts to get scary. She's tried to commit suicide because she keeps seeing this man in her dreams and in the mirrors behind her, but she dosen't understand any of it. When she returns to the Florida swamps she eerily knows her way around then and is not frightened by all the dangers within, though they could kill her or anyone else at any time. She has problems, her adoptive parents dont realize that she's been temporarily possessed, and she dosen't want to admit that she really does need help. Michael dosen't realize that he's in deeper than everyone else, that he's the only one who can start the cycle of rebirth to give the swamp children their youth back. The swamp holds evils, and evils that contain good. The women of the swamp hold the keys that everyone is looking for, but who will find them? Judd Duval and the old woman may not hold all the answers, in fact i assure you, there is much more to it than that.This book is filled with a lot of questions and suspense. You want to know what's going to happen long before you get to find out. John Saul is a matermind of horror, an incredible writer, and a genius in creating the fictional human mind.

Her parents think it might be better, for kelly, to move to a little village, villejeune. Unfortunetly kelly doesn't get less problems, Villejeune is where the trouble begins.Darkness is one of the best books i ever read. After opening the book and beginning at the first page, John Saul leaves you in an exciting adventure. You don't want to stop reading anymore, because the book holds your attention till the end. Even if you're not a horror/thriller fan you will be thrilled by this. After all it's a wonderfull book and I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"This story surprised me somewhat. Is there any place that John Saul can't take you in a gripping story about the dark places. This story immediately gets you involved in the scary place. The horror grabs you in the first 30 pages. Saul has the ability to create the picture without drowning you in pages of discriptions."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"Darkness by John SaulReviewed byShaun Michael O'BrienWhen I first stumbled upon this book the title made me interested in it. When I picked it up and read the back cover it intrigued me even more. When I saw that People magazine said \\"Saul has the instincts of a natural storyteller\\" it made me comfortable enough to buy it.When I got through the prologue I was somewhat interested in the main character all though I haven't read to many captivating books based on a what seems to be an illiterate backwoods pregnant country bumpkin but I was somewhat engrossed.But when I started to read the first chapter I was introduced to a new character named Kelly, a 16 year old girl. I didn't mind that much because I have read several books that interlink two protagonists, so I kept reading.A couple pages in I was introduced to two more characters, Marry and Ted, and was reading from their point of view. So now there are Three characters that may or may not be the main character and to top it off there is a Kelly Anderson and a Marry Anderson (maybe not confusing to you but it became confusing to me. Why not Kelly and Debra?). Usually this would be enough to loose my interest but I kept reading, mainly because I didn't have another book to read at that moment.So as I kept reading I was introduced to several other character and was reading from their point of view, kind of like watching a movie but without being able to put a face to the characters, and at this point I still haven't really found out who the true protagonist was.The only character that I liked so far was the grandfather even though I think the writer was pushing to make Kelly the true lead.I'm up to chapter 4 and I have been thrown into the lives of a handful of people one by one without enough time to learn there names let alone connect with them; but still I read.On some occasions when the story jumps back to one of the many characters that you are following something has happened to them and it makes u wonder if u missed a page; but you haven't.At times I found myself wondering if this was this authors first novel; but I still continue to read.As the chapters went by and despite the fact that more characters where introduced, one that inevitably shares the lead of the story, at about chapter 11 or so everything started to calm down.The writer has the knack of keeping the story moving but just enough for you to turn to the next page. There are some instances that you find yourself reading on just to find out how the writer is going to explain to you what the hell just happened and what it has to do with anything else.There are some parts of this story that are not truly answered to the fullest extent the reader would have hoped for but was answered in some form or fashion.This tale is far fetched and believably unbelievably (yes I meant what I said) but non the less is a good enough read to pass the time."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"This is an earlier work by Saul and I only came across it recently. My favorite of Saul's works is The Blackstone Chronicles which I thought was well-plotted and riveting. Some of his other noteworthy works are Guardian, Midnight Voices and Black Creek Crossing. Darkness is a mixture of themes - the story revolves around a small town in Florida that is close to the swamps and where there is a mystique built around the Dark Man, an entity that strikes fear into the swamp residents and around which a cult is built - with child 'sacrifices' and all sorts of disturbing activities. When two teens meet, a boy and a girl who have always thought themselves different from others, they find a strong mental connection to not only each other but also an aging swamp resident who has mysterious links to the Dark Man. It is up to the teens to figure out what exactly is going on in the small town of Villejeune whilst battling a sinister force that seems to be supernatural yet may also just be a figment of their imaginations.The story is promising - it has an interesting premise and though there is the usual supernatural element, it is also a sort of medical thriller centring around experimentation on children and exploitation of children, in this case, for the purposes of prolonging life and defying the ageing process. However, the way the plot develops seems highly implausible and is predictable. An astute reader would be able to deduce who the Dark Man is quarter way through the book, and also tie things up quickly to the effect that the story itself no longer seems very thrilling. That being said, Darkness is quite interesting and though the characters are one-dimensional, the story itself makes for an interesting departure from the usual plots by Saul."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"I really enjoyed the book. It was a good piece of fantasy that kept you thinking. A lot of reviewers didn't like the fact that it was somewhat unbelievable. Hey, it's fantasy. Overall the book flowed well and had a good story line. IMO you wont make a mistake reading this one."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"The small town of Villajeune, Florida is privy to a deep, dark secret. Babies die, children disappear and those that don't are haunted by nightmares of The Dark Man, who invades their thoughts, controls their minds and steals their souls.So begins \\"Darkness\\" from John Saul. While not necessarily a typical horror story, or typical John Saul, I find the story to be engrossing and very quickly got hooked. I found that the first half of the book was much better than the second, when too much was revealed too soon. Once the \\"truth\\" about The Dark Man and the town's \\"secret\\" came out, some of the mystery disappeared as well. While perhaps the story itself was highly unrealistic and the descriptions of the swamp and rundown shacks got a bit repetitive, I found the story good, entertaining fun. A solid read."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"Although Saul is not a great author, his books can often be suspenseful and entertaining. This book, however, is neither suspenseful or entertaining."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"Riveting, exciting, terrifying, these words don't really describe this novel's complex and chilling events. The events which take place in John Saul's Darkness, is recognizably haunting. The fear you feel while reading about the characters, holds you from beginning to end.

It simply made the story difficult to read in many instances, and while third person omiscient is not exactly outside the norm, it is rather rare. Handled properly it can make for a very enlightening read. However, in the case of &quot;Darkness,&quot; I couldn't help but feel jolted by the writing style, almost as though I were watching a tennis match. . .the book seemed to &quot;clunk&quot; from character to character, and sometimes often repeated each of their thoughts in adjoining paragraphs, making some passages seem almost trifled and monotonous. Nonetheless, the premise was good, the plot excellent. And, for the most part, the book still was able to be chalked up as a pleasant read--despite it's jerkiness."},{"Title":"Darkness","review":"This was the first Saul Book I read and it was one of the best books I've ever read.

I decided to thank the author and encourage him. He grabbed my attention with excitement in the first chapter. He then gave enough time to develop his main characters so little by little you came to enjoy and appreciate them. With that well accomplished, he resumes the plot and direction, moving it along skillfully.The author clearly has a grasp of the culture, customs, and people of the Middle East with emphasis on the history and politics of Turkey. I found his grasp of the Turkish language engaging. I also found the plot very believable for that time period and equally applicable to the many dangerous possibilities we are faced with in the region today.Being knowledgeable in the field of espionage and the intelligence community, I felt a comradeship with his field agents. They are authentic and like many I have known. There was a definite closeness only developed thru respect for each other's competence. This ultimately allowed them to resolve a complicated and dangerous mission in a real life style.The author, thru these characters of B.K., Nate, Dan and Bull, illustrates the training, dedication, and service provided by many field agents in the intelligence Community.A GOOD READ AND I RATE IT FIVE STAR AND HOPE HE CONTINUES WITH SEQUELS.J.

Set in the late 1930's, he takes us back to a time both magical and surreal, yet as firmly rooted to the earth as Frost's poetry. The landscape of Swift Water Valley is to be soon flooded by a giant reservior, swallowing towns, farms, and innocence. Without giving the story away, let me conclude that the name of Jameison will one day be as familiar as Scout."},{"Title":"Stillwater","review":"I liked this book very much. It is actually the first book in a year or so that I have been interrested enough to finish. It is a very quick read for those who don't have much time. It has corruption, mystery and the outdoors. It is also a sad tale about the end of a leagacy for a young man and how the flooding of the river valley affects him and the other people from the 3 small towns. Anyway, give it a try. It will surprise you. Also, what got me interrested in this was seeing the author on NBC morning show. If you go to look at the segment on CNBC... it might just interrest you too."},{"Title":"Stillwater","review":"This is a short, lovely novel about the drowning of the Swift River Valley in Massachusetts in 1938 to create the Quabbin Reservoir. Seen through the eyes of the narrator, Jamieson, a 15-year-old boy, Weld describes the people and places of the valley during the idyllic last summer before the flooding. The book is not exciting, packed with thrills, or a potboiler mystery. It is a quiet, beautiful accounting of a slower time when people could make a living off their farms. However, local corruption among self-serving politicians and false ministers is an undercurrent that darkens the over-all glow of the story.Read this book and enjoy living in the Valley in 1938.I also recommend \\"Letting Swift River Go\\" by Jane Yolen, which describes the same event in a lovely children's book."},{"Title":"Stillwater","review":"The strain of Weld's prose was uncomfortable after a while- the effort of ambition, not artistry, is evident in this novel. The love scenes were gruesome in particular- the dialogue that is used to express a young man's sexual desire, one of the most natural scenes to encounter in art and life, is here made irrevocably awkward and discomforting. My sense of the author was of a man who thought that writing simple thoughts down simply, and in relatively short sentences, was enough to make him the new Hemingway (he miscalculated). I also puzzled at the author's photo that accompanied his bio on the back cover- is the anxious look upon this man's face spotted with snowflakes supposed to remind me of the politically conscientious Redford? It looks more likely that he lost a cow in the snow off-camera."},{"Title":"Stillwater","review":"The story seemed forced and came out unnaturally.

This book is revealing, beguiling, and pleasantly bewildering for the multitude of voices, roles, and masks that he presents. Emigh writes as an actor, anthropologist, director, dramaturge, and Asian theatre scholar and while each one of these roles illuminates a realm of masking and playing, at the same time, they obscure some other realm. The result does not produce a grand universal scheme of masking in performance (&agrave; la Gordon Craig) rather a richly complex yet accessible smorgasbord of ideas that are intended to inspire a sense of wonder about the human occupation with masking and performing. The book is a joy to read because it is not beholden to any single genre of academic writing but is part scholarly record, part personal memoir, part philosophical treatise. By departing from a purely descriptive analysis Emigh attempts to probe the function and purpose of masking in performance. The fundamental premise that he explores is that masking represents on many levels an encounter between the self (the performer) and the other (the character). What comes of this encounter is a performance that lingers somewhere between the ontological idea of me and not-me. Unlike most modern dramatic performances based on a script, a masked performance often implies the relationship between the mask and the performer is unstable and may even lead to a loss of self. In a candid and refreshing way Emigh does not assume that masking is in and of itself a valid subject for research, but rather, he actually attempts to explore questions concerning the necessity for masks in performance: what value do masks have for our own society that is so enthralled by realism and escapism? By revealing what brought himself to this exploration is as much an aesthetic interest as an academic one, Emigh opens up the subject of masking to problems with artistic responses in multi-cultural performance. For those who are already familiar with Emigh's previous articles on the Orisa Prahlada Nataka, Balinese topeng pajegan and the Rajasthani Hajari Bhand, this material has been greatly expanded and revised according to his larger theme of masking in performance. All in all the arguments are stronger, developed in greater detail, and accompanied with fine illustrations and photographs. There has also been included a useful appendix of basic questions concerning performance that I was grateful to have with me when I was doing my fieldwork a few years ago. Theatre students will find this book a good introduction to Asian performance practices, but also Asian theatre scholars will find this is good introduction to post-modern theory, and anthropologists will find this is a good introduction to how dramatic theory might apply to cultural performance. It has been a long time since a book on Asian theatre has had aspirations to conduct an analysis beyond an encyclopedic description of performance detail. Such a search for aesthetic meaning tends to enter a subjective territory, which lies very near the end of our own ability to formulate coherent scientific principles. As Emigh reveals in this book, masking also lies in such a region between the known and unknown and does not have a wholly rational meaning. Masking is a mode of experience and feeling that approaches the boundaries of our capacity to know ourselves and our consciousness."},{"Title":"Appalachian Paradise","review":"Suzanne Bowers is an upper-management executive used to living a high-pressure life; a woman who has decided love is only a fabrication.

Wes Avery is an easygoing man full of Southern charm who agrees, as a favor to Suzanne's uncle and unbeknownst to Suzanne, to accompany her on her trek through the mountains.

As editor of OfSpirit.com, I have read shelves of books on both writing and publishing, but never has an author so brilliantly matched these two separate processes to authorship with a style and order that is practical, honest and useable.I constantly hear the frustrations of OfSpirit.com's network of spiritual writers who are trying to pierce the publishing industry's requirements and protocol. Creative people sometimes lack the business know-how to translate their valuable messages into the proper format necessary to prove the marketability of their manuscripts. Like any business, publishers are as much concerned about how well their books will sell as they are about how well they are written, maybe more.

Much of what the book contains I had learned the hard way...through personal experience. But it felt good to have my personal writing experiences validated by an external voice that speaks with wisdom and knowledge.Another area where the book would have been more useful a few years ago was the section on publishing - so many rapid and recent changes in the publishing industry made this section appear a bit dated.In addition, the focus of the book was more on non-fiction spiritual writing, and my interest lies in spiritual fiction writing.

Published in Fargo, North Dakota, in 1993 under a limited official license from Universal Press Syndicate, it is a children's school textbook written around Calvin and Hobbes comic strips. The strips contained in the book comprise famous Calvin and Hobbes story arcs, and the lessons and questions about the characters' personalities, dialogue, and adventures are marvelous. &quot;What do you think the principal meant when he said they had 'quite a file' on Calvin?&quot; -p. 108. A beautiful quality of the book is the feeling you get reading it, knowing that it was developed primarily for children with learning disabilities. You feel that a unique and noble potential of the unforgettable Calvin and Hobbes was realized through this book. Unfortunately, according to the publisher, only a very few copies of this wonderful book were authorized to be printed in a once-only print run in 1993."},{"Title":"Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes","review":"My daughter is a little younger than the age this book is intended for, but she is very much a Calvin and Hobbes fan so I thought I'd give it a try anyway. Her school psychologist told me that Calvin and Hobbes could be used to teach several things which led to a google search and then an Amazon search, where I found this book.Now, this book had a shocking price tag and not in my budget so like any mom with a plan, I got it from the library (there are not that many libraries that have it, but a few do- I've been frightened the entire time I've had it that I would damage it and end up with a 1k library bill). However, I've had so much fun playing around with it in the month and a half I've had it!Now, enough of my rambling and on to the book. The book is intended for grades 4-8 in the regular classroom or lower elementary for gifted programs. The book is fairly short, and comes in at under 200 pages, but the entire book is packed with no filler. The book has five units with six sections each. Each unit starts with a Calvin and Hobbes strip.The first section of each unit after the strip is presented is Vocabulary. Some vocabulary sections contain colloquial terms and figurative language, while others deal with more traditional vocabulary words. There are 3-4 activities in this section.The second section of each unit is Comprehension. The comprehension section is pretty traditional and asks questions relating to the strip. This also has a few sections.The third section of each unit is Behavior. Starting with the third section of each unit, the text starts to diverge from traditional texts. As anyone who has read a Calvin and Hobbes strip knows, Calvin isn't exactly the model of perfect behavior. The author tries to get students to think about why Calvin approaches situations the way he does and foster discussion over choice.The fourth section of each unit is Humor. These sections deal with themes such as language, sarcasm, slap-stick, stand-up, and teasing. These activities relate extremely well with the Behavior section and I can see why this follows it.The fifth section is Suggested Activities. These are varied and have a ton of items to work with. They are extensions of the topic that unit's strip talks about. For example, one strip's unit is about bug collections and one of the suggested activities has to do with finding out more information about insects. The great thing about this section is that there are two or three main suggested activities in each section that are spelled out for you. However, the author also gives a list of other activities. These activities range from small to large. In the bug collection unit, she gives suggestions as small as surveying and graphing everyone's favorite and least favorite insects to suggestions as large as making your own insect collection or reading James and the Giant Peach. Each unit is similarly full of suggestions.The sixth and final section of each unit is Creative Writing. Since I talked so much about the bug collection unit in the last section, I will just give examples from that same unit for the type of Creative Writing assignments the book has. In the bug collection unit, the students get to write poetry. They write a cinquain and a haiku. Next they write about a time they forgot to complete and assignment or chore and the feelings they had. They also write a journal about Bug Collection day from the viewpoint of one of the people in the story. Last, they summarize the strip. The writing assignments in each unit are different, but there are several in each unit and they are similarly varied. Like in the Suggested Activities section, the author gives more creative writing suggestions in a list.It's a fun book and if you are able to get your hands on it, it's got a ton of teaching suggestions."},{"Title":"Teaching with Calvin and Hobbes","review":"Watterson didn't license ANYTHING except this book.

Shame on me!There are many things I like about Boreham's writing but what I like most is how he takes everyday situations and expressions and re-casts them in a new and fresh light. He extracts deep spiritual meaning from the simple things of life and is able to create in the reader's mind a world that is alive with messages from our heavenly Father. Part One chapter one,The Luggage of Life, had me hooked and there was no stopping after that.For me it really set the tone for everything that followed.

Promoting the local businesses is certainly commendable, but don't commit yourself to their recommendations there unless you feel you have to make advanced reservations.I spent 8 weeks on the road and all I had was this book and a map of the country to guide me.

I can't vouch for all the definitions in the text, but many I have studied in this book have been a cut above the definitions I have gotten elsewhere. The defintions tend to be sparse and carefully worded -- as if the writer expected you to go out and build something with it. The text is now 15 years old, and even still the definitions I have needed were relevant and applicable. There will be a lot of words or senses you won't find here, so understand that this text is not comprehensive, but for definitions of terms that have been around a while, the text is excellent."},{"Title":"IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology/IEEE Std 610.12-1990","review":"Software projects need a glossary of terms to avoid confusion.

Do not buy this \\"Penguin Classics\\" edition!!!!!!!!!It is horrible! All the good parts have been \\"abridged\\" out of it.This is one of the silliest ideas I ever heard-but Penguin apparently tried to \\"clean up\\" Casanova. They have removed most of his stories about seduction from his auto-biography! Since Casanova was the world's greatest lover, I don't know why they think anyone would want the book except to read about seductions but those are exactly the parts they took out!Only Penguin could make Casanova boring.Buy a different edition of the book!"},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Casanova has been hailed as the greatest lover of the 18th century and has become the first person we think of in the ways of seduction. He is the quintessential ladies man for some, and for others, a manipulative scoundrel, an expert at self-promotion, and at worse, a spinner of colourful tails. In fact he is all these things and much more. On top of his many amorous affairs with not only servants and chambermaids but also ladies of nobility, he is a compelling storyteller, a gentleman of taste, a violinist, theologian, philosopher and a gifted courtier. There has been so much written about the man, that I felt compelled to read about his life from his own words. Casanova is the most notorious seducer of women in history, and if you read The Story of My Life, you will understand an aspect of this man that is all too often over looked, and that is, he more often than not loved the women he seduced, and in some cases, remained in love with them for the rest of his relatively long life. In other words, he cared about women, respected them, idolized them and ensured that the pleasures they gained from these liaisons, exceeded his. He used women but he also loved them.The book is written in a flowing style, descriptive to the point where the reader gains almost a visceral impression of 18th century Europe. Casanova's escape from the Venetian prison, for example, has all the suspense and realism of our modern thrillers. I could almost hear his finger nails scraping against the prison walls as he descended, sliding down in the dead of night during his escape. In his meeting with Voltaire, the gnome-like genius came to life, as they discussed the state of literature and the greatest poets of the ages. And, of course, the many beautiful women, his conquests and those that seduced him, fill every chapter - tasteful eroticism without the slightest hint of vulgarity. Casanova was an adventurer in love and life and he ensured he did not waste a minute of it.Casanova wanted to be remembered as a man of letters, in the 18th century sense of this term. And with The Story of My Life, he certainly achieved this aim, as scholars from around the world have acknowledged. He also wanted to be remembered as a man who loved women, and to this end, there is no question. Those that love intrigue, eroticism, a little pomp and circumstance, and swashbuckling adventure, read this incredible memoir - a pleasure in every sense."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Casanova. The word conjures love, lust, seduction, and romantic brilliance. The man and the name have become icons for the past two and a half centuries as the epitome in the art of love.Giacomo Geronimo Casanova was born in 1725 at Venice to parents who were actors. At a young age he was brought to a boarding school near Padua where the child developed a precociousness which impressed his elders. At 17, he obtained a doctorate in law from the University of Padua and began a career in the clergy. He travelled to southern Italy and Rome and became a secretary to the cardinal. His career with the church was cut short by scandal, an occurence which would become a fixture all throughout his life. Shortly after he joined the army as an officer of low-rank for the Republic of Venice and was stationed at Corfu, but gave up military life to become a violinist back at Venice. At the age of 21, he saved the life of a Venetian nobleman who became a patron of long-standing to the young man and who elevated him to the status of a wealthy gentleman. This gave him the privilege to travel across the breadth of Europe, meeting famous people of the day and pursuing amorous encounters where his lasting reputation rests. A talented conversationalist, he was frequently invited to the social circles of diverse European society, rubbing shoulders equally with cobblers and royalty. His fickle and temperamental personality got him into frequent scrapes with the law: he duped gullible socialites, started lotteries; became a spy, diplomat, and writer. The Inquisition of Venice accused him of witchcraft and was sentenced to imprisonment in \\"The Leads\\" prison, one of the most secure penal infrastructures of the time, where he made a sensational escape. He became an exile from his homeland and resumed his travels across Europe. In 1785 he became librarian to the Count of Waldstein in the castle of Dux, Bohemia, where he spent his last years recalling his brilliant and turbulent life and writing his memoirs.And it is in this memoirs where his life and legacy are contained. Written in a flowing, stainless elegance, Casanova's \\"Memoirs\\" is one of the best and most representative artifacts from the Age of Enlightenment. The sights and sounds of 18th-Century European life are recreated through the eyes and senses of one intelligent and opinionated observer. Witness the humor of Casanova being duped by his first love and the theater women of Paris. Revel in the taboo of peeking into the loverboy's seduction of a nun as he goes to great lengths to provide the right place and mood for their nocturnal trysts. Read in barely contained excitement and tension as he makes his remarkable escape from the dreaded \\"Leads\\" prison. Be thrilled and sympathize with the proud but foolish fop as he duels with a Polish noble and almost get's hanged in the process. Watch in fascination as he meets and matches intellect with the leading notables of his day, all now prominent figures of world history: Catherine the Great, Voltaire, Frederick the Great, etc. Experience the sensations of our hero as he attempts to seduce a French noblewoman (dissapointingly), and an attractive Spanish girl (more successfully), both incidents decades apart. The man is given justice by the able translation of Stephen Sartarelli and Sophie Hawkes.My only criticism of this edition is the scarcity of material offered. Although this 500+ page abridgement serves as perhaps the best introduction in the English language, for a work that totals nearly 4,000 pages, the editor could at least have made the book double in size to cover more aspects of the man's colorful life story. The man's meeting with Mozart is not included, and one can imagine many more incidents worthy of reading which were omitted.After reading his reminiscences, one can admire Casanova for the vastness of his intellect and personal and social skills. But one can't help but feel that the man wasted his talent and life by focusing too much on the petty and lowly preoccupations of human existence. With the man's intelligence and talents, one feels that he could have done more for society and his fellow man. The use of wisdom gained through such a life should have been elevated to a more worthy and longer-lasting goal. One is left with the impression that Casanova was a mere Hugh Hefner or Larry Flynt with culture. That's all.This is the memoir of the greatest icon of Western romance. Any person with the slightest interest towards love and sex should read this book in his/her lifetime. After satiating one's appetite with this mere appetizer, one should immediately dive into the complete oeuvre of the man's autobiography. This has been quite an experience already."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Just like most people looking at this book, I grabbed it because I didn't think there would be any difference between this version and the unabridged version. I was dead wrong. This version is abridged, and is almost completely censored. So if you're looking for racy tales about Casanova's exploits with the fairer sex, you will be very, very disapointed. In fact, if you're looking for any evidence of Casanova's cleverness, his wit, his great writing style, or awesome storytelling ability, you will not find it here at all! However, the book \\"History of My Life\\", which is the completely uncensored translation of the book by William Trask is a gem. Not only does it have all of the exploits that make Casanova,well, Casanova, but it also lets us see him for who he truly was: a Renaissance man (arguably a genius) who had one hell of a libido."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I found the book delightful. Not so much all of Casanova's exploits, they became a bit boring in time, but the descriptions of life around him, the rentals of houses, rooms, parlors, the modes of transportation, the meetings with others, the management of money, they were told splendidly and believably. The now so popular movie can't do justice to the story told in the book. Even the advertisements are bad. No one ever called Casanova a \\"pig.\\"For anyone who likes to explore living situations of any class of people in the past, this is a great book."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Giacomo Casanova (his name has become synonymous with that of a fiery amatory male!) was born in 1725. Somehow he managed to live until 1798 in a life which would make many people tired by just reading about his countless adventures!Among his many avocations was that of priest; soldier; courtier; gambler; violinist; spy;translator and famed author. Casanova managed to cram several lifetimes into his 73 wild years. If you want to follow this ultimate rake across the world be prepared to visit Italy, Germany,England,France, Spain, Switzerland, the Ottoman Empire of Turkey and Russia. Along the roue's route he met such luminaries as Voltaire, Frederick the Great and Catherine the Great.Casanova a serial lover of the fair and innocent maidens he seduce dwith wit, charm and seductive skills. He was imprisoned at times always managing a daring escape or the ability to have friends in high place save his love machine hide. He was no dunce being able to write and converse in many languages. His autobiography was written in French being widely published in his lifetime and ever since.The Penguin edition is an abridgement of his monumental work which in its entirety would swell to over 3,000 pages. The translators add material which connects the episodes. The book is filled with colorful characters; excellent descriptions of what Europe was like among the elite and filled with enough sex scenes to keep the reader searching for more.Casanova was not someone you would want your daughter to bring home to meet her family. He would make an excellent guest on the TV chat shows!Enjoy a few hours of pure escapism with this famous work!"},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Reading this book was a real chore.

The pages are durable and strong, the spine doesn't bend or break like some books tend to do, so you end up with that funny \\"bump\\", you know what I mean? The text is legible and large enough, the font is a good choice. The front photo is cute to look at, and it doesn't fade. Over all, an excellent copy of this often reprinted story."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"This book is interesting in the stories of what went on from 1725 to about 179?. Casanova's adventures were many and varied. The love adventures were a little much I would say maybe some wishful thinking. But overall an interesting life.I really enjoyed this book and others by Casanova.I hope you will like it also."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I gave this book four stars only because Casanova is such a well-known figure whose name has actually entered the English language. The book is a supposed autobiography and Casanova's sexual escapades and has much more in common with Baron von Munchhausen's fanciful tales than they do with reality. Casanova, who regarded himself as an artistic man of letters, tells literally unbelievable stories on himself. I especially like the tale in which a town's physician tells him to return \\"anytime\\" because he's infected half the women in the city with venereal diseases!The whole thing is one long dirty joke and, if you believe this thing, the joke is on you and Casanova gets the last laugh.Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"I really liked this book because it is well written and gives a good understanding of the life and times of Casanova. This is a must read for those interested in 18th century classics."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"Casanova himself is not nearly as interesting as I was hoping he would be. In this book he looks back on his life through rose colored glasses. He makes light of his womanizing and he finds it humorous that he infects large populations with std's. He definitely has a giant ego and he really comes across as a looser. I can't imagine why any woman would have ever fallen for him.Despite that I did not really care for the person of Casanova, I must say that I found the book entertaining. There are lots of interesting tidbits and descriptions of places and people from the late 1700's that are really fascinating. Even though there were still sleazy men around, the late 1700's were definitely a very different world than what we know now.One of my big complaints about this edition of his memoirs is that there seemed to have been a lot of really juicy parts cut out. At the end of each chapter there is a brief italicized section that summarizes the bits that were left out. I would have preferred to have an unabridged version so that I could have skipped over the parts I did not want to read and not have someone else make that choice for me. I am not sure if there is a better, more complete version out there in English, but if you are really interested in Casanova you may want to look for a different version or if you speak French, you may want to see if you can find a copy of the original."},{"Title":"The Story of My Life","review":"well this essentially an exceprt from the much larger story of my life. it is essentially the autobiography of a self-absorbed ladies man. womanizing, debauchery and what seems to me to be pure boasting fills the book. i found it to be ok but definately felt i could have been doing something better than reading this."},{"Title":"Financial Engineering and Computation: Principles, Mathematics, Algorithms","review":"The term financial engineering is appearing increasingly in the title of various works. What it actually means remains nebulous, for even natural sciences and engineering remain irresolvable at their respective cores. This is evidently addressing another boon of the digital age, where equations and approximations can be done both automatically, and with extreme rapidity. It is only natural for the advantages of this to trickle into research of finance and economics, only now it is becoming a steady stream, and, with the inclusion of this work, a most sound one at that.It is inferred that the author views this phrase, &quot;financial engineering,&quot; as the level of control over precision of computation, and then the resulting accuracy of projected results (with an occasional forecast of unanticipated outcome). His credentials validate this as well.The tools utilized include the complete discipline of algorithmics, and numerous branches of mathematics, along with tools assisting with and automating graphics and formatting, such as Latex and Mathematica, all channelled into this most profitable and competitive field of finance.The approach for most sections begins with a brief discussion of motivation, typically condensed to one or a few paragraphs, followed by an equation representing an historical approach to the problem. This is followed by one or more expanded sections building algorithms, expressed in mathematics and pseudocode, as well as plots of typical results. The section then concludes with a broader discussion of how computation and finance become intertwined through this particular application. The author is extremely well versed in both. There are numerous exercises as well.The book has the look and feel of an adept computer scientist, applying his honed skills to the financial realm. The typesetting is extremely well done, and even for sections initially unfamiliar, the reader feels confident and motivated to become fluent in time. Many of the exercises have solutions provided in an appendix.At the time of its original publish date the book was unique in the field due to its approach and concise depth of mathematics, all available from a single resource. The author clearly exerted an extraordinary amount of time and energy to producing this work, and each section attests to this meticulous attention detail.This work is highly-recommended as a reference, for a plethora of well-constructed algorithms in pseudocode are provided; Java examples are also provided via a website. Some considerable level of sophistication in topics typically relegated to computer science and mathematics are required, for which the intrepid reader can find additional resources. When time and motivation are sufficient, there is a wealth of mathematically sound information, providing depth of understanding and a mature foundation to build upon just what financial engineering means."},{"Title":"Financial Engineering and Computation: Principles, Mathematics, Algorithms","review":"The text covers quite a broad range of topics. It assumes that the reader has a fairly good grasp of statistics and mathematics (senior undergraduate level). Introductory financial material reads ok. The algorithmic approach is useful and so are the answers to select problems. However, some could find the material too tightly packed."},{"Title":"Financial Engineering and Computation: Principles, Mathematics, Algorithms","review":"As a practitioner in the industry, I have to commend the author, Dr Lyuu, on this book: this is a wonderfully thorough yet compact treatment of the full subject area. Rather than searching through a (large) shelf of other work, _Financial Engineering and Computation_ has become my go-to choice for most purposes.For someone new to the industry, the organization of the book and the writing style will make the material highly accessible; complex concepts are built up by way of a logical progression from foundational elements. Refreshingly, the author is not out to impress with his advanced knowledge of esoteric subjects, but rather seems intent on producing a concise yet in-depth presentation of the full subject area.Of course, given the subject matter, this is not light bedtime reading! There simply is no substitute for hard work on the part of the reader. But to that end, if you dilligently work through the text, you will find that the exercise problems are well posed to reinforce your learning and comprehension of the material: the exercises in this book serve more to deepen your thought, rather than pose impressive \\"grand challenge\\" problems.Thoroughly recommended!"},{"Title":"Brief Counseling That Works: A Solution-Focused Approach for School Counselors (Practical Skills for Counselors)","review":"There are many books about using a solution-focused approach for school counselors. Kottler used many practical examples to demonstrate how to focus on solutions, setting different types of goals when working with students. For examples, when using the miracle question, Kottler classified three types of miracle questions and gave clear examples how such miracle questions could be used.I like this book because it is easy to understand and easy to read. It helps me a lot when working with adolescents and students by remembering Kottler's some examples."},{"Title":"Gold Fish and Silver Kisses: How to Talk to Children About God","review":"A must for every Christian, or simply moral, home. The sermons are written for the average child to understand but more importantly to internalize. They are spiritual, moral lessons based on scripture (with specific Bible verses and prayers) designed for meaningful family times, Sunday school classes, Christian schools, children's sermons at a church of any Christian denomination. I have personally seen groups of children (and their parents!) mesmerized by the author's presentations. The suggested tokens add an extra dimension to the lessons and act as memory enhancers that really work! Excellent for newborn gifts, grandparent gifts, gifts for yourself! This is a book that will be around for generations to proudly pass down and enjoy sharing together for decades."},{"Title":"Gold Fish and Silver Kisses: How to Talk to Children About God","review":"Linda Masters has created a clear-minded, exuberant body of work obstensably for children; this is a work that might equally be called \\"Spritual Parables for Adults\\" as well as \\"Gold Fish and Silver Kisses.\\" More than art, her work is a gift to all who read it. It encapsulates, without airless theological retoric, the lessons, trials, and ultimate rewards of the strivings for a truly meaningful and moral life. Learing to have life more abundantly is the real Christian message, a message Ms. Masters sends to all children and adults willing to see their world anew."},{"Title":"Gold Fish and Silver Kisses: How to Talk to Children About God","review":"Gold Fish and Silver Kisses, How to Talk to Children about God, is a beautifully written, doctrinally sound book that puts important Biblical concepts into easily understandable language.

It's not acelebration of love between women, or of the glamour of Paris, or ofmodernism's traditionally spare aesthetic. It is, however, a wonderful book, which will probably try your patience but will repay your efforts with the pleasure of reading some of the most wonderful writing to have been produced this century. Djuna Barnes, born in the US, spent some twenty years in Europe, during which she wrote innovative journalism, a novel (Ryder), short stories, poetry and plays, and, slowly, the autobiographical fictional narrative that was finally published as Nightwood in 1936. The novel was hard to place, and finally published by no less of a modernist luminary than T.S. Eliot, then working at Faber and Faber.Barnes' novel chronicles a love affair between two women: Nora Flood, the sometime &quot;puritan,&quot; and Robin Vote, a cipher-like &quot;somnambule&quot; -- sleepwalker -- who roams the streets of Paris looking for -- well, it's not quite clear, but it's a fruitless quest she's on. Nora finds herself roaming the streets too, looking for Robin, but, like most of the characters of the novel, she bumps up against Dr Matthew O'Connor instead. O'Connor, an unlicensed doctor from the Barbary Coast, dominates much of the novel with his astounding barrage of anecdote, offering a stream of stories that all point, ultimately, to the sublime misery of romantic obsession. The love story (if it can even be called that) is framed by the history of Felix Volkbein, a self-styled Baron who marries Robin early on, and whose family tree provides the structure on which the rest of this dawdling narrative hangs.But nothing I say here can give you a sense of Barnes' dense, lyrical prose, and quite amazingly complex and beautiful writing: you simply have to puzzle over the book yourself to experience perhaps the most idiosyncratic novel produced by an American writer between the wars. It's a dark, melancholy story, with much detailed description of the decaying expatriate lifestyle Barnes herself (sometimes) enjoyed. The final chapter of the book has been regarded as controversial, opaque, and/or vaguely pornographic: Eliot wanted to exclude it when the novel was first published. It might certainly surprise you, and perhaps dismay you if you want to see all threads neatly tied together at the end. But I've read this book several times, and have never regretted it for a moment."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"*Nightwood* is a novel composed in poetic prose, as T.S. Eliot asserts in his preface, the kind of writing that \\"demands something of the reader that the ordinary novel-reader is not prepared to give.\\" Most novels are not composed at such white-hot intensity, at a level of personal emergency such as Djuna Barnes has conveyed in *Nightwood.* This is a book that doesn't let you rest for a moment, the rare sort of novel that is all conflict and climax. It's a work that you don't doubt was torn living from the author's very being, less a \\"novel\\" per se, than an organic and all-but-impossible to dissect whole that loses more the more you attempt to analyze it.What Barnes records in *Nightwood* is the experiential agony, as opposed to merely the \\"story,\\" of a love-lost. Robin Vote is a Sapphic femme fatal, an androgynous, alcoholic, nymphomaniac enigma who is beloved, successively, by three different characters, who she subsequently leaves an emotional wreck. Nora Flood, who stands in for the author, is the narrative center of *Nightwood* and the woman around whom the others orbit, with Robin, like a doomsday asteroid, orbiting them all. It is Nora who struggles and suffers and indeed understands Robin better than anyone, even if that only means understanding better the tragedy inherent in knowing her at all. Her utter despair at losing Robin is stunningly captured by Barnes who, it is said, based *Nightwood* closely on a real-life love catastrophe from which she never recovered. One can believe it reading *Nightwood.* A good deal of the novel's intensity comes from its unquestionable authenticity. In Robin Vote, Barnes has created the personification of the unsolvable mystery of every beloved who, as if by destiny, eludes, indeed must elude, our grasp.Much is made--and rightly so--of *Nightwood's* most famous character, Dr. Matthew O'Connor, an impoverished, drunken, charlatan with dubious medical credentials and a penchant for cross-dressing. A good deal of the novel is devoted to O'Connor's rambling monologues which vibrate between madness, comedy, and transcendent wisdom...sometimes all three together. But the transgendered O'Connor is only the most flamboyantly unconventional of *Nightwood's* inhabitants. All of Barnes's characters are misfits and outsiders, sexually and/or socially; interestingly it is the very displacement they feel within their own time and place that most enables the contemporary reader to sympathize with them. The sense of being out-of-step is, perhaps, timeless. But it's more than mere sexual and social deviance that connect the contemporary reader to these characters--it's a sense of the secret life of us all, the inherent \\"deviance\\" of our private lives from the \\"normal\\" daylight existence of moderated emotions, rational desires, and objective viewpoints we all pretend to share. \\"Nightwood\\" is the country we inhabit when the sun goes down, \\"society\\" dissolves, and the inexplicable, uncontrollable, and irrational in us emerges.I found the first chapter of *Nightwood* dull and dated and almost considered putting the book down. Don't do it. Hang in there until the second chapter...if Barnes doesn't catch your attention at that point, chances are she won't. This is a challenging text, elusively and elliptically written, ejaculatory, jumping from peak to peak, a shout from the soul of despair, a cry from the dark night. The characters don't so much interact with each other, but, as in real life, they are merely declaiming to themselves, using the declamations of others as cues to their own speeches. They affect, deflect, and \\"aggravate\\" each other in a sort of vacuum, forcing them to even greater degrees of solitude and despair. And yet, through all these characters, we hear one voice, one lament...the author's, ours, every lover's. As uniquely particular and personal *Nightwood* may be, as idiosyncratically composed, and as inimitable, it is nonetheless an emotional document as common and identifiably human as any kidney or pancreas.A rare thing, a \\"novel\\" that is also a work of art -*Nightwood* is a gnomic utterance of the apocalypse of love."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"There are few books that can be safely called classics--and out of those, fewer are as deserving of the term as Djuna Barnes' 'Nightwood'. Elegant and mesmerizing, difficult and beautiful, it is a measured and balanced work of art.Another reviewer said this wasn't a 'celebration of lesbian love'--this much is true. What makes this book truly remarkable is that it *doesn't* set any boundaries--hearts are fickle, hearts are cruel, and every character in the novel is inflicted with his/her own brand of emotional anxiety. Barnes makes no distinction between 'lesbian' love and any other--it is as normal, and as abnormal, as any other human affection. That alone makes this book a classic (but of course, the writing too is intoxicating). In fact, what is truly surprising (to me, at least!) is that despite her exquisite elegance, Djuna Barnes manages to take such a no-nonsense approach to human emotions. She never seeks to simplify anything--and makes her work difficult for the reader in the most rewarding of ways. (I mean that she doesn't let us get away with pre-conceptions or romantic illusions. She manages to make the imperfect reality as arresting as the myth of perfection.) Most of us, in our lives, don't *really* know what we're doing, or what we feel. Barnes makes her characters real by putting them through the same confusing maelstrom of experiences--where one emotion often morphs into another--love into indifference, respect into insecurity, and so on. There are no answers--there is only endurance--endurance of others, endurance of ourselves.I don't want to be more specific and give out details of the plot. This book has to be experienced to be believed..."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"Nightwood is a Masterpiece. So much can be written about masterpieces that it's better to let the master's speak. I was never horrified by this book, but then I have no doubt that Nora and Robin loved like prisoners of one another's souls, and hearts, and as if their lives were on fire.Perhaps they were &quot;As Rome burns against a nightime sky&quot; (Dr O Connor the philosophizing heavy drinking Transvestite Irishman surmises) &quot;Rome could only have burnt at night.&quot;Unlike the woman who says to skip a few chapters I will tell you every drop of this book is indispensible but that while light and well rehearsed as a good play, the language can be daunting. Buy a dictionary or get an encyclopedia if it's too much but I think the general effect of Barne's alchemy will take hold anyway. I first read her when I was twenty years old. I was in utter astonishment.I am a writer, and this book permanently altered my ideas of what made a book or a novel because I was ready to receive the genius of this fresh. I have gone back and reread the dense, tightly packed metaphysical drama of the heart and soul and NEVER come away disappointed.Wizardry.A must must must read!"},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"OK. OK. We all know that nobody can write a review of this book without eliciting strong emotions and offending some group or the other, no matter what one says. But I think the book is unique, worth a review, and let the flaming coals fall where they may. First off: I think T.S. Eliot was a useless poseur and snob when it came to criticism (though I do like some of his poetry, particularly The Four Quartets.) I read his intro anyway and the only thing I agreed with him on was &quot;...that it is so good a novel that only sensibilities trained on poetry can wholly appreciate it.&quot; This is ominously true. So true, that those who read it because it is a &quot;lesbian&quot; or &quot;gay&quot; novel without a deep appreciation of poetry are bound to be dumbfounded...By the way, Barnes herself stated that she wasn't a &quot;lesbian,&quot; per se. She just happened to fall in love with a woman. These artists, they just don't want to fall into our pigeonholes. Do they?...All this having been said, I humbly admit that I don't know exactly what the book is about and I'm not too sure Barnes did either, much less Eliot.-One of my favorite anecdotes about Barnes is her meeting with the equally poetic novelist Malcolm Lowry. Lowry remarked later to his wife that he couldn't decide if Nightwood was a work of genius, the results a disorder of some kind, or both (The same could be said of Lowry's work, by the way.) Anyway, I think this is about as honest as criticism of Nightwood gets. My apologies to Ph.D candidates! Eliot's initial assessment is correct: The &quot;Watchman, What of the Night?&quot; chapter is the most beautiful, most poetic and most unique in the book. Unfortunately, the retentive Eliot found a need to make rational sense of it all, and so retracted what his not so retentive heart told him initially. It is passages like the following that make the work unique in a darkly wondrous way: &quot;Have you thought of the night, now, in other times, in other countries,-in Paris?...not to mention the palaces of Nymphenburg echoing back to Vienna with the night trip of late kings letting water into plush cans and fine woodwork! No,&quot; he said, looking at her sharply, &quot;I can see you have not! You should, for the night has been going on for a long time.&quot; and &quot;those who turn the day into night, the young, the drug addict, the profligate, and that most miserable, the lover...These can never again live the life of the day. The light does not become them any longer....&quot; What am I suppose to say about these passages? They are as dark and beautiful and lovely as anything in literature. If you get it, you get it. If you don't, well, there's a hole in my head concerning mechanical manuals. Not everybody's cut out for poetic prose. There are plenty of more pedestrian works out there about gays, lesbians, feminism etc. No doubt I'm missing the whole point of this novel according to informed reviewers. No doubt the convoluted plot can be made sense of and parsed and diagrammed out for me in several different ways. But please spare me. Barnes was a disturbed individual (as most artists are) and unhappy (as most passionate lovers are). Not everything she wrote made much sense. But much of what she wrote created a unique beauty. It is for lovers of beauty to whom I recommend this book....Those who insist on reading it with an axe to grind or with a vested interest to confirm will find themselves in uncharted waters: Dark waters with a beauty beyond them."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"In Nightwood there is a purposeful distortion of biographical facts. The past is based on self-deception and self-forgetfulness. The characters speak about their identity as if it were something they are trying to lose by constantly forgetting and reformulating who they are. Felix begins the novel with a past that is admitted to be one based upon deceit. Instead of trying to clarify it, he is compelled to associate with men and women of the theatre who have assumed titles that are equally false. By absorbing himself in this community of carnival freaks, he is able to relieve himself of the need to technically defend the presentation of his identity and he is able to more fully believe in the illusion himself. It is apparent that his assumed identity is no less true than the one that has been given to him through inheritance. An implied assertion is made through his actions that an understanding of identity cannot be achieved by either historical or self-evaluative means. The reaction, then, is to cast the notion of one's own identity out away from oneself as something to be created externally. This effect is illuminated upon in Dr. O'Connor's speech about the continual process of the night: \\"Let a man lay himself down in the Great Bed and his \` identity' is no longer his own, his \`trust' is not with him, and his \`willingness' is turned over and is of another permission. His distress is wild and anonymous. He sleeps in a Town of Darkness, member of a secret brotherhood. He neither knows himself nor his outriders; he berserks a fearful dimension and dismounts, miraculously, in bed!\\" By giving oneself over to the \\"Night\\", you dispel with the responsibility for your own identity. It is a space of anonymity that can be used to escape from identity because it becomes something completely outside of the self. The suggestion is that this is a process that people are a continual participant in. It is a necessary ritual performed in order to not only to escape what identity is understood to be, but to escape false layers of identity as well. To \\"berserk a fearful dimension\\" is to be rid of the aspects of identity that are used as props to cover what is really unknown about identity. Consequently, the greatest fear of anyone in Nightwood would be the discovery of any certain facts about themselves and, more importantly, their own remembrance of their actual identities. Yet, this is unlikely to happen to any of the characters because they have subjected themselves to enough \\"Nights\\" to never remember themselves again. The result is that you are left in a labyrinth of each character's creation where they may open any one door to find another display, but no certainty because the true identity of the character has been irretrievably lost.Barnes's elliptical descriptions of her characters create a sense that she knows as little about the characters in their narration as the reader knows reading of them. This is not a failure to properly think out the characters, but a condition intentionally created to blur the character's past and relinquish control of the character's enactment of their identity. The authorial descriptions of the characters are largely metaphorical, but as the identities of the characters become more layered the descriptions become more actual than metaphorical. An example is the description of the Duchess of Broadback (Frau Mann): \\"She seemed to have a skin that was the pattern of her costume: a bodice of lozenges, red and yellow, low in the back and ruffled over and under the arms, faded with the reek of her three-a-day control, red tights, laced boots-one somehow felt they ran through her as the design runs through hard holiday candies, and the bulge in the groin where she took the bar, one foot caught in the flex of the calf, was as solid, specialized and as polished as oak. The stuff of the tights was no longer a covering, it was herself; the span of the tightly stitched crotch was so much her own flesh that she was as unsexed as a doll.\\" The metaphor becomes more than an artistic way to relate the characters to reality. The characters absorb them and they transform into the thing described. This creates a space where the distinction between stage and reality is also blurred and the character can thus create a reality built on their own terms. Reality and performance become inextricable linked to each other. The absorbed descriptions of the characters create a distance between the author and character so that the characters create their own identities to perform. In this way the characters are given as much creative freedom as the author. Just as the author's imagination in the creation of the story is limitless, so is the character's scope of their identity. Thus they are able to perform as they like while giving and withholding bits of their own identity.The purpose for performing identity originates in the character's belief that there is something essential about their identity that does not work within the social mode they inhabit. In Nightwood characters are revealed to be Jewish, homosexual and transgendered. They have all found ways to express facets of these parts of their identity in ways that are safe within the community they inhabit. Because the character's past is obscured, there is no concrete sense of the identities they abandoned or the circumstances under which it did not fit into a set of social norms. Doctor O'Connor's physical identity does not coincide with his belief of what his essential identity is and so he must create a sense of being through words and by dwelling in places that are uninhibited by social norms. This novel gives a complex view on the way we view ourselves and choose to present this self perception."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"Djuna Barnes' short modernist novel 'Nightwood' (1936) is one of the genuine odd ducks of 20th century literature. Written in an uneven, semi-comic, and baroque style, the book is more likely to impress young readers rather than older and more experienced individuals who have lost their appetite for decadent romantic entanglements.'Nightwood' is certainly an original work, and Barnes' vision of the factors shaping human destiny--especially time, heritage, and evolution--are uniquely expressed. But despite its fluidity of language, many of Barnes' seemingly brilliant observations concerning life, consciousness, and human suffering are more specious than acute, which is important, since Barnes' emotionally marooned cast is badly in need of answers, wisdom, and salvation.Hiding under the text's antique lathering is a sparse, skeletal plot, one top heavy with philosophical speculations but reflecting little grasp of basic psychological truths about human nature.Nora Flood meets and falls destructively in love with passive-aggressive Robin Vote, a strange, corpse-eyed, and inexplicably charismatic woman who, despite marriage and motherhood, is spiritually, psychologically, and emotionally adrift in the world. When their affair evolves into a love triangle, Nora turns increasingly for advice to charlatan doctor and Greek chorus Matthew O'Connor, a poverty-stricken alcoholic who is pleasurably inclined towards homosexuality, transvestitism, and self-demoralization (\\"I'm a lady in no need of insults,\\" \\"I was born as ugly as God dare premeditate\\"). Significantly, all of the book's characters are in some way stunted, crippled, or pathologically predisposed.Barnes excels at dramatizing the failure of romantic love, especially the kind that displays active neurotic factors, elements of codependence, and spontaneous psychological transference. Those pages which detail Nora's isolation and sad obsession with her abandoning lover are deeply felt, haunting, and moving indeed.In \\"The Squatter,\\" Barnes spends an entire chapter fulfilling a personal vendetta by brilliantly depicting widow Jenny Petherbridge's status as a rapacious black hole and non-entity. Jenny is ugly (\\"she had a beaked head and the body, small, feeble, and ferocious, that somehow made one associate her with Judy,\\" \\"only severed could any part of her been called \\"right\\"), stupid (\\"when anyone was witty about a contemporary event, she would look perplexed and a little dismayed\\"), incapable of establishing her own values (\\"Someone else's wedding ring was on her finger...the books in her library were other people's selections...her walls, her cupboards, her bureaux, were teeming with second-hand dealings with life...the words that fell from her mouth seemed to have been lent to her\\"), spiritually empty but power hungry (\\"she wanted to be the reason for everything and so was the cause of nothing\\"), and lacks poise, maturity, and dignity (\\"being one of those panicky little women, who, no matter what they put on, look like a child under penance,\\" or, as O'Connor calls her, \\"a decaying comedy jester, the face on a fool's- stick, and with the smell about her of mouse-nests\\"). Barnes makes an excellent case for the argument that it is not the powerful that are to be feared, but the weak, frustrated, and incapable.Robin the \\"somnambulist\\" is also lengthily described, largely via the use of symbols and metaphors: throughout the text, the boyish, bird-named Robin is described in animal, vegetable, and mineral terms. When first encountered, Robin, who is later recognized as a kindred spirit by a wild circus animal and a ferocious dog, is found lying unconscious in a small apartment crowded with a superabundance of plant life. Barnes describes Robin's abode as \\"a jungle trapped in a drawing room\\" and Robin as the \\"ration of the carnivorous flowers.\\"The flamboyant, limp-wristed (\\"his hands...he always carried like a dog who is walking on his hind legs\\"), dirty-kneed, rhetoric-spewing Dr. Matthew O'Connor, the book's most famous character, is a figure of high camp whom today's readers are more likely to find mildly distasteful rather than shocking.O'Connor is given an entire long chapter in which to pontificate (\\"Watchman, What Of The Night?\\"), though the chapter reflects badly on the wounded Nora, whose continuous exclamations of \\"but what am I to do?,\\" \\"what will become of her?\\" and \\"wow will I stand it?\\" reduce her from the genuinely tormented human being of earlier chapters to a one-dimensional cartoon damsel in distress.Intelligent, perceptive readers are likely to find one passage in every five that sounds profound and poetically illuminating like the others, but means absolutely nothing on careful examination (for example: \\"Your body is coming to it, your are forty and the body has a politic too, and a life of its own that you like to think is yours. I heard a spirit new once, but I knew it was a mystery eternally moving outward and on, and not my own.\\")Despite Barnes' often incredible use of language, the ultimate effect of 'Nightwood' is one of shallowness, slickness, and almost hysterical distance from its own primary sources.When compared to other literary books written by women also primarily focused on women, such as the five novels of Jean Rhys or Muriel Spark's 'The Driver's Seat,' 'Nightwood' seems sketchy, brittle, and, as one critic said about Isak Dinesen's 'Seven Gothic Tales,' seemingly more concerned with mystification than with genuine mystery.Though bold and intrepid as a beautiful young big city journalist, and later as an expatriate modernist writer living among the Parisian glitterati, Barnes closed the door on the rest of the world in very early middle age, and became a notorious New York City recluse known primarily for bitterness and explosive outbursts of anger.Readers of 'Nightwood,' with its essential focus on theoretical, airy philosophy rather than psychological home truths, may find clues as to how Barnes's life went sorrowfully wrong."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"... is T. S. Eliot's description of Djuana Barnes novel. It is that, and much more. I first read this novel almost 40 years ago; felt I understood very little of it. In the intervening time I have walked past, and patronized the Caf&eacute; de la Mairie, a backdrop for much of the action, on the north side of the square in front of St. Sulpice numerous times. Unquestionable a radically different caf&eacute; in the \`30's, certainly not surrounded by the very chic shops of today. The Caf&eacute; \\"nagged\\" me into giving it a second try.I am truly grateful that it was not a school assignment. I imagined a Professor expecting effusive praise, and that my report on the book would have to be filled with ramblings on \\"transgender identification,\\" \\"anomie,\\" \\"angst,\\" \\"symbolism,\\" \\"codependence,\\" \\"transcendent wisdom\\" and of course, \\"stream of consciousness.\\" And with a bit of luck, I might get a B -.But when your main motivation is a pleasant caf&eacute;, and a \\"does-your-perspective-improve-with-age\\" attitude, then what? No question the prose is rich and dense, with wonderful insights, coupled with sheer and utter nonsense. Consider some of the wonderful passages: \\"Love is the first lie; wisdom the last.\\" or \\"We give death to a child when we give it a doll--it's the effigy and the shroud; when a woman gives it to a woman, it is the life they cannot have, it is their child, sacred and profane:...\\" There is a wonderful analogy for love in the ducks in Golden Gate park so heavy on overfeeding that they cannot fly. But regrettably these oscillate with the utter nonsense of: \\"He had a turban cocked over his eye and a moaning in his left ventricle which was meant to be the whine of Tophet, and a loin-cloth as big as a tent and protecting about as much.\\" And that is why so many readers, including myself, find the book such a difficult read. Brilliance, alternating with the drug-induced ramblings worthy of William Burroughs, NOT, James Joyce.\\"Baron\\" Felix seems the best drawn, and most understandable of the characters. His child, Guido, likewise, for a minor character. The four central characters: Robin Vote, Nora Flood, Jenny Petherbridge and Dr. Matthew O'Connor all seemed far too opaque, motivation is clearly lacking for so many of their actions. True, a central theme is lesbian love, and its betrayals, with bit parts for transvestitism. All of which I am constitutional incapable of having deep insights into... but still, if reading is too illuminate, there was only a small candle glowing on these issues.I was struck by the quality of the other reviews on this book, the best, by far, of any other book on Amazon. Many of their insights do not need to be duplicated in this one - one commenter in fact said there was no need to write one after reading Eric Anderson's. Yes, it is an excellent review.Overall I settled on a 3-star rating. It is a provocative, radical book, particularly for the \`30's, with some wonderful insights into the human condition. But it is so hard to stay focused when these are combined with the William Burroughs nonsense. (Sorry, \\"Professor.\\") It was with a sense of profound relief that I finished the book, realizing in the unlikely event I have another 40 years to go, there will not be a third try."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"There is no question that Djuna Barnes' book is engaging. To begin to read it is to fall into a mania; descending word after word into the pathetic world of the four main characters - especially Dr. O'Conner, whose errant monologues expose the other characters while covering his own descent.Is it well-written? No doubt; the descriptions are moving, the scenes (when there are scenes) are gripping, and the characters are alive. But it's easy to fall into the question: does all of the book matter? During some of Dr. O'Conner rambling tangents, for example, I could've flipped through another book or made myself some tea, coming back (as after a commercial break) to engage with the truly consequential passages. Of course it's difficult to know what matters in one reading, which makes \\"Nightwood,\\" in its way, a bit of a trick.It's short enough, at 180 pages, to speed through and see in hindsight almost before it's finished. This saves the book; the rush one feels reading it is both modern, and a signature of a paradoxical writer, reckless, but in complete control of the reader's attention - having O'Conner become interesting right before he closes the book.Aside from my reading experience, \\"Nightwood\\" is a classic of lesbian literature, a modern marvel, and recommended by T.S. Eliot (so?).So, decision time. Buy it? Check it out from the library? That depends. For the lover of conservative styles and plots, probably not. But for the edgy reader, into a little risk - \\"Nightwood\\" is it."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"I enjoyed the review by Eric Karl Anderson. But I'd like to add a few things about Anderson's identity interpretation on the five characters that thread 'Nightwood' and its meanings. In the introduction of the book T.S Eliot wrote a preface which prepared the readers from possible misunderstandings for Djuna Barnes brilliant story written in prose was a work of 'creative imagination' and not 'philosophical treatise'. I read it twice, the second time believing it to be a different book. From the beginning Barnes persuades the reader to dislike Robin for her strangeness; living but not present, a turmoil in the cold that disrupted the farse of other characters reality when she touched their lives. Robin and Doctor. Matthew are antagonists. They represent opposite dimensions of the self. The Doctor, although a brilliant mind, accurate in understanding the misery of Man is never the less a failure, in bondage with humility and the truth. In the end he curses Robin for existing; having transformed also him, Nora, Felix and Jenny into doomed creatures in a mysterious and horrific sense of how small their lifes became. In the chapter Go Down, Matthew, the Doctor and Nora could not hold a conversation. They spoke to the readers, not listening to each other. Their lives like a ring closing in their personal pain, existing only in the past, like dummies tragically possessed by death. Robin killed what they proclaimed as birthright, symbolically how she killed son Guido, who prayed to the Virgin by calling the statue Mamma. Loved the last chapter. I, that despised Robins personal distinction of morality was able to finally understand her. Her nature made her different; nor human nor a beast. A creature like the night that drifted 'sonambule' through life. No other human soul could be so free, so they love her but it's not Robin they want, but who she is. The misery in understanding it was not in reach. Djuna Barnes also tells a parallel tale of obsession for an image of love. Robin is that woman like an iman, possessed with a childs memory, but that causes a certain attraction to fear. In 'Bow Down' the writer evoked that it was easier to love a lion for its tamer. The story, and finally Robin were irresistable to my imagination. There is a tempting invitation from the writer to participate for the lonely souls (they become) speak to us, and Robin unaltered by their existance leaves us (readers) out. The book is brilliant. Like many readers have stated, it is a very hard book to fully comprehend in its various contexts. I advice those to wait for an appropriate moment in their lives to read this book. It answers many questions if we search, and dig between words and the quality of a genuine thinker, such as Djuna Barnes."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"This book is so embarassingly, jaw-droppingly, crosseyed-inducingly bad, I wonder what T.S. Possum was ever smoking when he agreed to write the preface for it (which is also badly written, go figure!).My only explanation for how this book/writer ever became published/famous, is, most feminist readers simply do not read very much other than feminist writers, and so, alas, become woefully deluded as to even basic literary values (vide, gibbering eulogist reviews re Barnes romanci&egrave;re).Perhaps the only justification a sane grown-up human being has in reading this turbid swill, is it is really, really (I mean, you-can't-make-this-stuff-up!) funny, to make fun of. If, in fact, you are like me -- somebody what feels like they have \\"read everything\\" and are moving on with jaded appetite to 4th and 5th tier litterati -- I actually heartily recommend \\"NightBoner\\" as a bracing cordial of pure giddy hilariousness. The blunders come so bewilderingly turgid and apace (literally every line would, if found singly, make you wince) that altogether they constitute a sort of big fun symphonic Blooper, like a gushing \\"Tour de Force, majeure\\" that not only absolves the reader of that once sacred trust -- in the basic daring, decency, and humanity of the writer -- but invites, even taunts, us to rubberneck along in a dazed and stupefying trance while this weird pretense-puffed creature self-implodes... leaving behind the lonely and incomprehensible void whence she came.Perhaps people just shouldn't named their kid \\"Djuna\\" to begin with. Maybe it isn't an auspicious start for the orotund-prone.I wonder if she was even aware that while she was indulging her florid, flailing, 10th-grade best on paper, writers like C&eacute;line or Isak Denison or other 1930's leviathans were laboring, humbly and maturely and painstakingly, at the real Thing?I am indeed somehow reminded of the local ping-ping champion who, in all his pride and innocence, had never heard of the chinese olympic team. But I suppose, at a certain point, it is just awkward to juxtapose, when it's not already obvious, nicht wahr?(oh yeah, attaching itty unneccesary bits of foreign lingua franca to mortar her crumbling Queen's English is one of Barne's favorite literary resorts. This troubles the real multi-linguist; she also likes words like juxtapose.)Anyway, a person who actually is literate will perhaps find a similar fascination in another obscenely overrated, ex-pat, paname writer's romp: James Baldwin's \\"Giovanni's Room\\". It too is a They're-So-Bad-They're-Good, 5th-tier-book-club monstrosity.I am serious though this type of fake writing is so depressing and pathetic and transparent, in its tinseled pomp and grotesque bungling and simpering aesthete foppery, that I am truly dumbfounded it has a following -- however PHD-thesis evolved and sustained she be."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"Maybe I'm not &quot;literary&quot; enough, but I read this book and did not get it. I thought it was just the worst book I have ever read. I would rather read a college textbook! What was the point of it all? I thought the characters never developed into anything. I would only recommend this book to people who had trouble sleeping at night. It will put you to sleep in a minute."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"The early 20th century Modernists produced a number of remarkable books, but Djuna Barnes' NIGHTWOOD (1936) is one of the very strangest. The plot at its heart is simple, a lesbian love triangle where the passionate Nora Flood loves a young and enigmatic woman named Robin Vote, only to lose her to the conniving widow Jenny Petherbridge. This all unfolds among American and European expatriates in Paris in the 1920s, as royalty is dying out, the scars of World War I have still not healed, and belief in traditional religion is waning.What makes NIGHTWOOD so odd is Barnes manner of describing this drama. Her writing is baroque, full of original metaphors and florid turns of phrase that may seem either revelatory or pretentious. Its most important character turns out not to be Nora Flood, though her tragic fall is the book's theme, but rather the dandy doctor Matthew O'Connor who consoles her. A good half of the book consists of Matthew's long ramblings, full of free associations and bizarre insights. At first, Matthew is less a flesh and blood character and more a personalization of a cosmic principle, like the Judge in Cormac McCarthy's BLOOD MERIDIAN. Only later does he seem to come down to earth and we get some idea of the very personal struggles he has faced.NIGHTWOOD is currently being marketed to general readers because its plot of a doomed love affair and its fallout seems universal. However, Barnes' way of telling the story is not for everyone. I found many parts enjoyable, but the book in the main was tedious, and I'm a reader who usually enjoys the Modernists. That it is available in inexpensive paperback editions means that the reader can at least try to see if he likes it."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"I have tried to read this book several times over the past twenty years and never made it past page 25. I found the book to be stupefyingly dull. I find this vey puzzling because the list of Barnes admirers are legion. Everyone from T.S. Eliot to Samuel R. Delany to Herbert Read have proclaimed the book's greatness.Moreover, I have read and admired many abstrct and abstruse books. I don't get it. It must be some fault of mine that prevents me from appreciating this novel.Maybe someone can leave me a comment that will put it together for me."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"For whatever reason, it seems that \\"Nightwood\\" has one of the more precarious reputations in twentieth-century literature. The name of its author, Djuna Barnes, is still synonymous with the life of the modern, and Modernist, American expatriate living in Paris; however, like Lawrence Durrell, another author I have been thinking quite a bit about, she seems to have fallen into disfavor - and this is quite a loss.And like Durrell's \\"Alexandria Quartet,\\" this coheres as fiction in a completely different way from most other fiction. While Durrell's prose is florid and sometimes downright meretricious, Barnes uses her characters, especially the eccentric Dr. O'Connor, to stretch the limits of language and meaning. O'Connor, a fay dandy and philosopher-mystagogue, is so preposterous and unbelievable it's a miracle that he even works as a character. He serves as a perennial touching conversational touching stone for all the other characters, endlessly and giddily upending their assumptions and, especially in the case of Nora, emotional commitments.The other characters, each histrionic in their own way, are all fairly normal in comparison; the plot is barebones and simple. The \\"Baron,\\" a self-stylized aristocrat manqu&eacute;, marries Robin Vote, who seems lost and discontented whoever she surrounds herself with and wherever she goes, often being driven to roam the streets of the city at night, a listless flaneur. The chapter \\"Watchmen, What of the Night?\\" is one of the most beautiful meditations on night that I have ever read in literature.Soon after having a child with the Baron, she leaves him and moves in with Nora, with whom she is just spiritually out of place. Robin then finally leaves Nora for Jenny, at which point Nora turns to Dr. O'Connor for solace. His brand of consolation is some peculiar poesy to say the least. At the height of Nora's despair, her heart rent in two by a woman she truly loved, O'Connor offers these words: \\"For the thickness of the sleep that is on the sleeper we \`forgive,' as we \`forgive' the dead for the account of the earth that lies upon them. What we do not see, we are told, we do not mourn; yet night and sleep trouble us, suspicion being the strongest dream and dead the throng. The heart of the jealous knows the best and the most satisfying love, that of the other's bed, where the rival perfects the lover's imperfections. Fancy gallops to take part in that duel, unconstrained by any certain articulation of the laws of that unseen game.\\"T. S. Eliot's beautiful introduction does two things introductions rarely do: holds back any plot spoilers (not that there is really anything to \\"give away,\\" per se) and actually sheds light on the text. It can safely be read, as I read it, before finishing the book. And I second Eliot's take on the novel, especially his observation that in \\"Nightwood\\" you will find \\"great achievement of a style, the beauty of phrasing, the brilliance of wit and characterization, and a quality of horror and doom very nearly related to that of Elizabethan tragedy.\\" The brilliance of wit and characterization is something I can only second and treble. This is bold, high Modernism at its most audacious, and the sum of its effects is simply stunning."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"Read this book, at least for the crazed monologues of Dr. Matthew O'Connor. They are mad, they are sometimes nonsensical, but most importantly they are some of the most fantastic things you can read. The rest of the novel, though still fantastic in certain aspects and certain sections (especially the Jenny sections, for real), doesn't live up to the doctor's parts, and part of me wishes the novel were more focused on him, or even spoken by him. Oh well."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"This book's three main characters (\\"the doctor\\", Nora and Robin) did not hold my interest. This is the most bizarre thing I've read despite its vivid imagery and the doctor's often insightful observations. The story is one big whine about being captive to one's sexual/emotional nature and needs. Here are 2 lesbians and a transvestite fortunate enough to live in Paris, the capital of free thinking in the 1920's and a genial place that accepted people with these sensibilities. Yet, Nora and the doctor never feel comfortable with themselves. The character who did touch me is a secondary one, Felix (Baron Volkbein) who, despite fabricating an aristocratic lineage to raise others' regard for him, is capable of responding with compassion to someone who needs him just for who he is.This novel has been used in academic studies of gender matters. But it could also serve as an aid in tracking the practice of perceiving oneself as a victim when one's personal choice creates a problem. In \\"Nightwood\\", the characters are very aware that their choices are their own and they accept responsibility for them. That is decades before people began blaming the consequences of their decisions on others, before the politicization and institutionalized endorsement of victimhood as a method of transferring responsibility for one's actions onto others.My dissatisfaction with this book stems from its slack attention to time and place. At each page, I had to remind myself that the story is set in the 1920's and not the latter half of the 1800's as I instinctively felt. Archaic phrases rich with signs of an earlier period combined with an absence of any 20th century flavour has produced characters who float in from the past and seem therefore devoid of physical mass. Similarly, Paris, the story's primary location, is reduced to an icon of itself like a backdrop assembled in haste for a play. Mentions of \\"rue du Cherche-Midi\\" and \\"Hotel Recamier\\" sound promising but lead only to the next bout of the doctor's enrapturing but ultimately meaningless rants. The best I can think about this neglect is that the author may have been demonstrating how self-obsession robs its holder of the capacity to interact with his environment beyond the narrow confines of its demands. No one seems affected by where they are. In the end, this is about people who experience love as torture and a direct route to hell."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"At the March 2008 meeting of the NYC LGBT Center Book Discussion group, we discussed \\"Nightwood\\" by Djuna Barnes.We had a very small group that was surprised at the difficultly and rewards and incomprehensibility and pleasure of the novel. One reader brought his notes about Barnes' biography, which were very helpful. By discussing several aspects of the novel, we learned more about what was going on and made sense of much of it, including the \\"what just happened?!\\" ending.We all agreed that it is much more understandable on its second reading. This may be a great novel (#11 on The Publishing Triangle's list of 100 Best Lesbian and Gay Novels), but it seems very odd and difficult to approach without knowing Barnes' life and having some additional tools to handle the text.Why did I give this four stars? This is a three-star review for the book itself and a FIVE-STAR REVIEW for book groups considering reading it."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"Barnes' Magnum opus, \\"Nightwood\\" (1936), was her second novel and one of those books that probably 'must' be read, the same as \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" (Sherwood Anderson), or \\"The Great Gatsby\\", (F. Scott Fitzgerald). Poet Donald J. Greiner once wrote, \\"[It]...stands out among post-World War I American novels as one of the first notable experiments with a type of comedy that makes the reader want to lean forward and laugh with terror.\\"What is the book \\"about\\"? To grossly oversimplify this complex tale, it's about one woman's mental, emotional, and sexual domination and manipulation, over time, of another young woman. There is also a significant sub-plot about a physician who has his own unique problems, especially concerning alcohol abuse and homosexuality.This is truly a dark and atmospheric story, partially about homosexuality, which probably accounts for its limited readership in a Puritanistic America when it was first published, and possibly even since. Barnes was an American, home-schooled and raised among incredibly artistic people such as Jack London and Franz Liszt, both of whom visited her father's farm. She lived from 1892 to 1982 and spent 20 years of her life in Paris, passing time in the company of other avant garde personalities such as Mina Loy, Janet Flanner, Dolly Wilde, and Gertrude Stein.This book was an incredibly tough read for me but people who understand poetry, (and I don't very well), will probably get it just fine. Barnes doesn't use words wastefully and her prose-style of writing takes on a sort of incongruous, syncopated rhythm. A review of the Cliff's Notes prior to reading the book would probably help out a lot.But I will say outright that this is one of the most compelling novels I've ever read. Having now read Barnes' greatest work, I'm eager to note that she was probably at least a borderline genius.Don't expect your typical novel here -- you won't come away from this one with a warm, fuzzy feeling. In fact, as you relate to each of the principals, especially \\"the doctor\\", you'll likely experience some emotional discomfort. Perhaps that is the genius of the work."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"awesome book and a great edition from the publisher. This is by far the best one yet!! This book is revolutionary for its time and did leave a lot to the imagination!"},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"The story itself is oddball and at times a blend of the wild and carnivalesque. What you will read this for is not the story itself as much as the unusual narrative style, describing a character that never really speaks for herself, creating a character out of testimonials and feelings of others rather than the central character herself. Worth a read for that reason alone."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"Barnes makes beautiful sentences, paragraphs and, of course, novels as few others can. In reply to those who found the story convoluted and the poetic prose pretentious, or who pigeonholed the writing as stream-of-consciousness (which it is not): it's amazing how some people are proud to parade their weaknesses as readers. The puritanical cult of simplicity that was stuffed into our heads in high school tells us we mustn't enjoy style. Come off it, pick up a dictionary and join the English language in all its glory. Barnes' work is an adventure in reading."},{"Title":"Nightwood","review":"Djuna Barne's incredible incite and richness of language make this a must read. What power. A Freudian novel, Ego as day, Id as Night, wherein Robin and Nora take the ego is taken into the night and all the mysteries unfold, thus Matthew O'Conner talks about French and American nights. Also one of the great novels about addiction and the language of addiction.

I was much more &quot;with it&quot; in the beginning when identity and religion were being discussed, but I found myself having a much more difficult time following the rest.

What can I say? I don't like stream of consciousness writing, I don't like novels that don't have a strong story, and I don't like poetry, therefore I hated, hated, hated this book. Certainly there is some evocative language, but I couldn't really enjoy it as it was buried in paragraph-long sentences. As for the notion that it's some masterpiece of depicting obsession or addiction--give me a break. It's far too inaccessible and difficult to serve that function, I can think of half a dozen books that do a better job and aren't a trial to read. Fortunately, I can report that my feelings were generally shared by the rest of my book group, including those who love poetry and stream of consciousness writing.

But I find myself squeezing information into the margins and writing over columns.The information about diet and health changes is very basic, hence the suggestion to use this book as a supplement.

No longer rural and a part of Los Angeles County, Orange County has emerged in its own right, with a population and economy outpacing most states, that defies the concept of Orange County as just another suburb. However its decentralized urban structure, with many focal cities, contrasts the traditional concepts of an obvious centerpoint.That is what the book is supposedly about. The book is actually a collection of research papers from multiple authors that are somewhat supporting of the overarching theme. Some chapters are brilliant, backed by hard data, while a few of the more qualitative arguments are noticeably lacking. After reading an LA Times article stating that families in Orange County are more traditional (husband, wife, two kids, no divorce) than the rest of California, I was hoping for more. Also disappointing is the hinted division of older North Orange County versus newer South Orange County. Moreover for an area that has changed so much since the end of WWII, I would have expected more dedicated to the transformation of farm land. The lack of a single author, providing one clear overarching depiction of Orange County then and now, is a considerable weakness.The least you should know though is the copyright date (1991). This book is over 20 years old which will not encompass the two great political events in Orange County of the 1990's; the decommissioning of El Toro and the 1994 bankruptcy.

The premise is that a girl wakes up and finds that things are strange in the world. There are lots of things in each picture to discover - shoes on the ceiling, missing legs, and especially strange prams and babys being pushed around.There is definitely excitement in discovery. Some things are American and will be difficult for non-American children to know - Pictures labelled Washington which are other people for instance. But for the most part everything is easy to discover. Good early learning stuff, spelling etc - but mostly it is visual and there are excellent visual jokes which is why my children love it (candy cane legs, a worm chasing a bird etc)I don't really enjoy the book greatly, I just don't like the illustrations a great deal. I find them a bit too child like, however it is nice sitting with the kids while they figure out what is wrong with the picture. There are other great books which do this too and maybe even do it better, however, clearly not from my child's point of view! She enjoys it."},{"Title":"Wacky Wednesday,","review":"As a parent, I do not like this book. I have two boys and they both love it. They would read it every night If they could.

I have tried to donate this book to charity several times, but my boys will not part with it. I just don't have the heart to get rid of it without their consent. Your kids will love it, As a parent I don not recomment it."},{"Title":"Wacky Wednesday,","review":"This book deserves more than five stars and is one of the best beginning readers ever created!Wacky Wednesday combines the interesting repetition of a beginning reader with a fun set of picture puzzles. The two features are wonderful together for encouraging careful observation (useful in life, as well as in word recognition).As a result of this brilliant book concept, Theodore Geisel (a k a Theo. Le Sieg -- Geisel backwards, and Dr. Seuss) have teamed up with New Yorker cartoonist, George Booth, to create a fun classic that will be enjoyed by parents and children for many generations to come.Imagine a day that begins when you look up in bed over your head, and see something funny:&quot;It all began with that shoe on the wall.A shoe on the wall . . . ?Shouldn't be there at all!&quot;A child wakes up one morning to finds increasing numbers of unusual objects in rather odd places. Pretty soon, the objects even begin start to split apart. &quot;And I said, 'Oh, MAN!' And that's how Wacky Wednesday began.&quot;The child looks out the window and sees a bunch of bananas growing in a normal tree and water running through a garden hose with a long section missing in it. Out in the hall, a candy cane holds up a part of a hall table, one door has two knobs, and a picture is upside down. In the bathroom, the child wears one sock while showering, there's a palm tree in the toilet, one faucet is upside down, and a fish is swimming happily in the shampoo bottle.In the bedroom while dressing, four things are wrong (including more misplaced shoes). In the kitchen, this grows to five. On the way to school, there are six. Later, down the street, there are seven. Outside the school are eight. In the classroom, there are nine.That's when cognitive dissonance sets in. The teacher says, &quot;Nothing is wacky here in my class! Get out! You're the wacky one! OUT!&quot;Outside the school now, there are ten new wacky things. Down the street, eleven more . . . then another twelve.&quot;I ran and knocked over Patrolman McGann.&quot;&quot;'Don't be sorry,' he smiled. 'It's that kind of day. But be glad! Wacky Wednesday will soon go away!&quot;&quot;Only twenty things more will be wacky.&quot;&quot;Just find them and then you can go back to bed.&quot;And with that, &quot;Wacky Wednesday was gone . . . and I even got rid of that shoe on the wall.&quot;The pictures present lots of opportunities to help your child notice how things work. Water needs to go through something to come out the other end. You need a door at the end of steps to get into a house. Windows cannot stand by themselves in the middle of a lawn. People don't drive sitting in the back seat of a car. The beauty of this kind of picture juxtaposition is in the opportunity to have many conversations with your child to open up the beauty of how things fit together, and don't work so well when they don't fit.As for the beginning reader aspect, the book has many one syllable words that rhyme. This provides the maximum ease for decoding the letters and turning them into words. I put in the examples of the rhymes here to make that point for you.I thought that the ways the details in the pictures were jumbled were quite imaginative. The wacky elements are well distributed on a page, and seldom repeat the jokes. This makes it continually interesting to search for them.Ultimately, the book is rewarding too for the idea the teacher expresses -- that the child is having a wacky day rather than that anything is really wrong. We all have days like that. Then, suddenly they are over. That is good psychological reassurance for your child. You should encourage that thought, as well.After you finish enjoying the book, I suggest that you each try your hand at creating a two page layout with pictures and a simple rhyme. That will make you both appreciate the book more, and give you a fun experience together.Enjoy finding what needs to be unwhacked!"},{"Title":"Wacky Wednesday,","review":"Wacky WednesdayTheo LeSiegReading Level 1.2Wacky Wednesday is a great book for younger children!

LeSieg for those where he only did the story and let somebody else do the art. In the case of \\"Wacky Wednesday\\" that would be George Booth. My working hypothesis is that when the story is essentially grounded in the real world and does not go spinning off into the wild imaginative realm of Dr. Seuss, then somebody else gets the honors. This makes sense because even when Dr. Seuss draws regular kids they do not look like regular kids any more than the Cat in the Hat looks like a regular cat.\\"Wacky Wednesday\\" is actually a counting book, but it takes you a while to notice that because when it begins with a shoe on the wall that should not be there is is clear that young readers are supposed to spot all the wacky things in each picture. But then we notice that whereas there were only three or four wacky things to be found in each picture now there are five, six and eventually twenty wacky things to discover before Wacky Wednesday is over and done with (although I think there are more than twenty in that final picture, depending on how many times you count the suns).But counting is just the added educational benefit, because primarily \\"Wacky Wednesday\\" is for kids who love to play \\"What's wrong with this picture?\\" The funny mistakes are fairly simple, but kids will enjoy finding them in these pictures where as more and more wacky things show up nobody seems to notice.

On the following page, a second shoe is attached to his ceiling. In each additional page, there is one more out-of-place item, bringing great consternation to the young protagonist, until on the final page there are twenty items for the reader to find.Much of the enjoyment comes from the visual gags incorporated into the illustrations -- a shoe on someone's head, a tiger in a baby carriage, a teacher elevated on roller skates.

My mother had the book on her bookshelves, an older edition with a painting of a turn of the century couple courting on the front. It looked vaguely impressionist, and left me to conclude that the stories inside would probably be a bunch of sentimentalist claptrap. How wrong I was!The book inside is more akin to a Hopper painting than a Degas. Anderson manages an amazing level of character development within the short stories. The stories themselves work independently, but also work together to tell the story of an American Midwestern town. And the feeling one is left with is that everything you have read is essentially and authentically American.To comment on the Kindle version specifically, it seems well formatted to this reader. I've noticed a typo here and there, but nothing glaring, and nothing that distracts from the experience of reading the book."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"First published in 1919, Winesburg, Ohio is a collection of 22 interrelated stories set in a fictional small town in the American Midwest. Though each story can stand alone as an individual work, they are so closely interwoven that some consider the book to be a novel. The protagonist of each story often makes a supporting appearance in the tale of his or her neighbor, relative, friend, or lover, while dozens of other characters are encountered only in brief cameos. George Willard, a young reporter for the local newspaper, appears in almost all the stories and unifies the various tales into a cohesive book. Everyone in town seems to consider him a kindred spirit, and they seek him out, asking him to serve as their confessor, chronicler, and/or psychiatrist.In deceptively simple prose, Anderson vividly captures the everyday life of this small Ohio town during its period of transition from agrarianism to modern industrialization. The denizens of Winesburg struggle to find their place in this microcosm of modern society. Their sensitive souls are tormented by loneliness, isolation, guilt-ridden pasts, frustrated dreams, and a stifling ability to communicate their feelings and aspirations. Sinclair Lewis's novel Main Street, published about the same time and also focusing on a Midwestern town, features an ambitious dreamer, Carrie Meeber, who envisions herself a prisoner within a conservative small town full of narrow minded bumpkins. In Winesburg, Ohio, everyone is Carrie Meeber. Everyone is a prisoner to something, and everyone wants out. For many of the characters, the big city represents salvation, as if their problems would just go away if they could escape to Cleveland, Cincinnati, or Chicago. More often than not, that salvation proves false and they return to Winesburg defeated. Having grown up in a small Midwestern town myself, I can say that much of Anderson's portrayal of small town life rings true. It's unclear, however, whether he's proposing that the emotional turmoil and alienation felt by Winesburg's residents is peculiar to the experience of small town life or merely indicative of the world at large.Winesburg, Ohio is one of America's earliest examples of modernist literature. Its influence on later modernist writers is readily apparent, most notably in the works of William Faulkner. While Anderson possesses a brilliant insight into human thought and emotion and expresses his vision in a beautiful narrative voice, most of the stories end all too abruptly and thus feel incomplete. It's a conceit of modernism to think that it's enough for the author to merely offer sketches of the way things are, without providing the reader with a satisfying beginning-middle-end plot structure. In most of these stories we're deprived of an end, and one finishes each tale with the disappointment of having just read two-thirds of a novel, only to find the succeeding pages missing. The characters all finish their stories as if frozen in some tableau vivant. Reading Winesburg, Ohio is much like wandering through a gallery of Edward Hopper paintings. You've got a pretty good idea where these people have been, but you don't have a clue where they're going."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"Sherwood Anderson's one great book contains the moving stories of the odd characters of one small American Midwest tone.

The book attempts to provide insight by presenting \\"grotesques\\" or caricatures of people and their lives. The major themes are loneliness and failure, and so one can imagine that the tales are not very uplifting.

And I am certain that all of them found deeper meaning than my superficial understanding - at least until the first twenty, or so pages.It is then that you realize that these stories are much more than random quilt patches temporarily stitched together awaiting a more coordinated, cohesive, and coherent arrangement. It is, of course, possible that such may be the case, but your mind won't wait for that. You want to do more than listen and observe. You want to guess where it all will go. What will he do when...? What is she trying to accomplish? You might even make a few good guesses, but that will never be enough.

Anderson's usage of characters filled with melancholy, often from loneliness or regret, definitely can weigh on emotions, but it is well worth it. One can empathize with the characters' emotions - his insight into their minds is perhaps a look into all of our lives at times (hopefully for most of us not quite as dysfunctional as many of the characters of the novel). I also felt that Anderson's collection of stories was a primer on the experiences we all go through both in growing up and after we have \\"grown up\\" - the ups and downs of life."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"The book I read was a Signet classic and the work was listed as a novel. I would never consider it as such since it seemed to lack a forceful central character and to have a plot. In fact finding a central character is hard unless the reader is able to use frequency of appearance as importance in the book. If so, George Willard fills the bill, he is in almost every chapter, forcing order to be a novel, i. e. named divisions and separated works are pulled together by the inclusion of a single character despite the presence of other names who fill minor spots in the telling. Once recognizing Willard as the protagonist the chapters are collected and show the titled character as a poor, miserable individual who is ground into hopelessness by his past, essentially an inconsequential life which never even rises to notice. The titles of each chapter are given to show what aspect of life in a small town that character is most related to, whether a part of his or her character or a function he or she performs in the town and how little it matters. That is the book, now it must be graded on its effect. It was published nearly one hundred years ago, it was different from the type forming the major publishing efforts of its contemporaries and it influenced most of the better writers who followed it. It was a great accomplishment for the author, the best effort of his life and never equaled. Still Sherwood Anderson became a great author due to this book alone. Surprisingly I find it still worth reading despite being unable to empathise with any of the characters whse lives are exposed."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"After reading Sherwood Anderson's book about Winesburg, Ohio I came away knowing the characters as though they were my nieghbors.

Inside each ice cube is a liquid center. Floating in each liquid center is a desperate character beating on the wall of ice that surrounds him, crying inarticulately at his isolation, trying but failing to reach the other characters locked or hiding in their own ice cubes. The observer can see the characters struggling, but the ice is thick and translucent at best, so he catches glimpses of parts of a surface, rather than a clear look at the whole. This is the position in which author Sherwood Anderson places the reader of \\"Winesburg, Ohio,\\" a collection of VERY loosely connected portraits of inhabitants of a small Ohio town around the first decade of the 20th century.Actually, saying that the book, misleadingly characterized by the Modern Library as a novel, contains portraits of inhabitants of a small Ohio town is putting it too generously. It's more that the author picks off his characters' psychic scabs to show us what lies beneath. Rather than whole people, we see only bits of pain, longing, disillusionment, or regret.To be fair, the writing is meticulously careful and touches the border of poetry from time to time. The author does manage to create some compassion for his \\"grotesques,\\" as he calls them. But if you have the audacity to prefer actual novels, with multidimensional characters and at least a thread of plot, if you enjoy books where you wonder what happens next, you probably have better things to do in the time that remains of your reading life than linger in the dreary writing-exercise world of \\"Winesburg, Ohio.\\""},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"A modern reader might have some difficulties in putting up with Sherwood Anderson's \\"Winesburg Ohio\\". First, it consists of 22 short stories, which have to be taken up one after the other and which not very coherently form a picture of that little town in rural America around 1900. Next, the style may have been modern enough to inspire important modern writers to regard Anderson as their model, yet today it can strike one as being sometimes pretty old-fashioned. Why?The author is omniscient, which means that he explains a lot of what is going on in his protagonists instead of leaving it to the reader. And, in the tone of an old-fashioned chronicler, he mostly gives an introduction into the persons' families, their backgrounds first. So, all in all, his subject and his style struck me as a little heavy-going.And yet, if one reads on, the various parts begin to form an authentic picture and atmosphere. Anderson's strongest point, to my mind, is that he creates unforgettable characters. Very often these are erratic, wild, bizarre creatures who are prisoners not only of their primitive surroundings, but also of their lonely and strange personalities. Mostly their conflicts erupt in a dramatic situation, which breaks off abruptly leaving many questions open and giving food for thought. The extraordinary thing is that though these characters may appear as the more or less crippled products of their time and place, they strike one as being representative of the human situation in general. I could not help being strongly appealed to by their mostly unhappy lives, feeling that they reveal more about our human lot than the promise of constant happiness in our time.The person that seems to be relatively untouched by unhappiness is the central figure, George Willard, the young reporter of the town's newspaper. Obviously Anderson saw himself in that figure and in another artist, namely in the story \\"Loneliness\\", a painter with the telling name Enoch Robinson. Some facts of Anderson's life seem to correspond with the outline of this story, showing that he also had his share of unhappiness. The overall feeling that to me sums up the atmosphere of this book best can be found in the thoughts of George Willard as he is on the point of leaving Winesburg: \\"One shudders at the thought of the meaninglessness of life (...) while at the same instant one loves life so intensely that tears come into the eyes.\\""},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"Wonderful theater of the grotesque.

Back then it made a profound impression on me as being about the same yearnings, confusions, fears, and \\"growing pangs\\" that I was having--though it was about people who lived nearly 60 years before I came to it. Now that those same people have receded again--over 100 years into that dim past--I find it has lost none of its power to move me with its simple stories of hope, of dreams unfulfilled, of death, sophistication, drink, love, and departure.As others have said, George Willard, the young reporter of the town, appears in almost all the stories as a friend, aquaintance, or confessor to the lives so carefully and lovingly presented in these 22 stories/sketches. But until the end of the book, George very seldom comes into his own as a character. We know he harbors dreams about Helen White, the banker's daughter, but that's really all we know of him until the last three stories--Sophistication, Death, and Departure--where his character is explored in greater depth than at any other time in the book.I can't help making a comparison to two other of my favorite works in this vein. Joyce's \\"Dubliners\\" and Wilder's \\"Our Town.\\" Like \\"Dubliners,\\" \\"Winesburg, Ohio\\" is a collection of stories about the various citizens of a particular place at a particular time in the world. It evokes all the mystery, nobility, and even pettiness that drives these people without ever condescending to them, pitying them, or trying to make them appear better than they are. Each has a secret sorrow, and each bears it with grace and dignity. The prose is often lyrical and haunting, but it never rises to the level of greatness that Joyce achieves in his greatest story \\"The Dead.\\" To be fair, though, I can't think of ANY author whose prose achieves that lofty level, so it's perhaps not a fair comparison. Much more does \\"Winesburg\\" compare favorably with \\"Our Town.\\" In a little town in Ohio, at the turn of the century, 18 miles south of Lake Erie, the entire human drama plays out. Girls lose their virginity, a boy loses his sobriety (if only for a night), a man loses his one great love, and a mother loses her fight with death. These people, along with all the others in these stories show us that, in all times and in all places, people are the same.That's all we can ask of great books--that they unite us."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"This book of connected stories contains some of the greatest prose poetry in all American literature. Winesburg's people will break your heart and make you love them all your life. Strange that this, his first work, was Anderson's only great book; all the rest of them, except perhaps the book of short fiction collected at the end of his life, were mediocre. But Winesburg, Ohio, short and easy to read and utterly beautiful, is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"This brought on a great book club discussion.

Anderson's portrayal of the local residents leads people to believe that small town life can have the same problems as city life."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"The font of this book was similar to a typewriter. The lines of the words were as thin as my dead rabbit whose all bones in my backyard; every word was a strain to read.

It is an easy read and some may really enjoy it but I did not."},{"Title":"Winesburg, Ohio (Modern Library, 104.1)","review":"Winesburg, Ohio is a book full of unhappy people.

I dont consider myself a beginner in the field. I've been doing dolls as a hobby for gifts to friends and family but when I found the auction on ebay for a signed copy I said what the hay - I have seen the artist's work before and wanted to see what her techniques were like. Well, now that I have the book I can honestly say that the book was worth the wait, AND my twenty bucks! The author is obviously a good writer with alot to say. She made me laugh and made me feel like she was talking directly to me. She has an honest, very personable and friendly approach to dealing with her readers. The language is simple and very user friendly. I have not tried to re-create the doll as of yet, but she is so interesting looking that I believe I will try. The photographs and overall makeup of the book are beautiful and the instructional coincides nicely with the pictures to make the whole doll transition seem easy. I believe that I can use some of her tips and suggestions to fuel my future creations. This whole book is an inspiration! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"This book had some useful information about making over dolls. The hair curling section was helpful. The face painting chapter was very detailed, but even though she says she doesn't like beginners to use watercolors, that's what she demonstrates in the book. So you are warned to follow her instructions very carefully. The costume design chapter was strange but interesting. She's making a showgirl and the entire costume consists of a tiny little panty that she cuts out and hand-sews together, and some ribbon that she winds around the bosom and stitches to the bottom. She covers all the raw edges with sequins and beads. She even glues some pieces to the doll itself, so when she says \\"one-of-a-kind\\" dolls, she means exactly that. Don't expect to make a costume that you could put on a different doll. The sections on beading and making a display box were new to me, so overall I did learn some new tricks."},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"If you are thinking about customizing dolls this book will help get you started.

Very disappointing to me. A word to the editor: spelling and grammar matter. There were consistent misspellings, such as \\"seperate,\\" and \\"it's\\" for the possessive \\"its.\\" That's just shoddy and there's no reason for it--this is a formal publication, not an exercise for English Comp I. As to the content of the book, I was less than thrilled to see that the author had merely painted over the existing facial screening of the doll rather than removing the original paint and starting from scratch. And pardon me, but not everyone is into the \\"Vegas showgirl\\" look, which was the only fashion this book showcased. Very limiting. Overall an amateur effort."},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"I'm just getting started in this industry and found the book extremely helpful.

I am a male in the field and have been taunted by my friends because I love to design for fashion dolls. The author makes me feel like this is not a 'women's only' hobby but that everyone can take part and become successful in it. I really like the layout of the book.

The doll she chose has genitalia(not a Mattel) - completly disgusting, but still she's a good artist when she puts her skills to GOOD use."},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"This book is meant to be a springboard for your own creations. Ms Guidice shows you how to &quot;enhance&quot; the face the doll came with rather than totally wiping the face and repainting it. (The idea of repainting a doll's face scares me something awful.)You will learn how to give a fashion doll a &quot;perm&quot;, enhance the makeup, and generally glitz up the doll's face and hair. She shows you how to create the costume on the front of the book and then opens her gallery of dolls to see what she has done with this &quot;basic&quot; beginning.I'd recommend that anyone considering trying fashion doll makeovers to start with this book. It won't overwhelm you with so much information that you lose your vision or (in my case) nerve!"},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"The new book by Sabrina Giudice, &quot;Creating Fashion Dolls&quot;, is the most informative start to finish explanation for OOAK designers in the industry. If you are a beginner or a seasoned professional there is much to learn here. Her descriptions of fixing hair and perms were easy to understand. Information on repaints and paints to use, right down to brush size, and use of appropriate blush is extremely useful. Also, if you hand sew or machine stitch your own designs, she gives you examples of looking at fashion in a new light. This is a MUST for serious doll designers and ones thinking they would like to attempt this type of art. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"Had I been able to see really look through this book before purchasing, I would not have spent my money. I believe even beginners would appreciate more in depth coverage on costuming than what was provided.The only \\"hand sewn\\" items were the panties and the strap around the neck, both with raw edges. The rest of the items were purchased and glued. I have found better information on both costuming and makeup on internet sites. Needless to say, I found this book disappointing."},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"This book covers very little that is helpful in the world of fashion doll makeovers. It does nothing about repainting techniques, only &quot;enhancements,&quot; which means changing the color a bit. It also uses colored pencils and those do not work on all fashion dolls. Other questionable techniques are presented. The end result is a &quot;Vegas showgirl,&quot; but so little is learned and so much of it is wrong or ill-advised. A beginner will be more messed up by following it than helped."},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"I did not like this book. Although parts of it are helpful, like the hair section, I didn't like the costume section. I think that it would have been better if it gave a few costume suggestions rather than just the one. It did show a few photos of other dolls, but it seemed to more showcase the artist, but did not say what or how she did things to them. It's ok for a beginner book, but I have seen better. I wish it would have gone over different looks, rather than &quot;make this doll that you see on the cover&quot;. Also, the doll used isn't widely available like Barbie dolls.

I'm SO glad that I didn't though. I don't understand how anyone can say that this book is not a resource God for beginners! The book is extremely well written aside from some grammatical errors on the part of the publisher - and as someone else in the reviews said, it is more teaching than advertising. Sabrina uses a very friendly approach and starts off this first book with just the basics so that a beginner like me can get a feel of painting and sewing very minimally and still creating something exotic, glittery and gorgeous. I wouldn't part with the book personally. I've come up with a thousand and one ideas just from looking through the pages. Definetally worth the money!"},{"Title":"Creating Fashion Dolls: A Step-By-Step Guide to One-Of-A-Kind Dolls","review":"This book was somewhat helpful when I wanted to learn how to makeover dolls.

Clearly and concisely written, Petty's &quot;Tolkein the the Land of Heroes&quot; takes us beyond Middle-Earth into the greater mythologies of all human history and imagination. Unlike many analyses of his works, this one does what it's supposed to do--it makes you want to read those works of Tolkein which you haven't read, and re-read the ones you have.Both heroes and villains in Middle-Earth have their ancient ties. We find out who they really are, and how our Middle-Earth heroes and villains exemplify the archetypes of human culture. The author is a learned guide through the tangled webs of many paths and many stories, weaving them into a coherent whole. Her fondness (to say the least) for Tolkein is evident throughout this intelligent, clearly-written analysis.For readers familiar primarily with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, this book will motivate you to read Tolkein's other works, most especially, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, where all the stories really begin. Dr. Petty's carefully-crafted work is a must for all serious Tolkein fans."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"Not written in dissertationese, as the author's &quot;One Ring to Rule Them All&quot; is, but in very colloquial English. Petty even apologizes for considering LotR alone without the context of the drafts, but there's no need to do that: it's a clear, straightforward, and insightful study of considerable quality."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"I loved this book! This is the kind of book you want to be reading for you college lit courses. Its a fun and easy read that uses comparisons that everyone can understand and/or relate too. I have to give Anne C. Petty high praise for using anime characters and plots in comparision to Tolkien's. Being a VERY BIG anime fan myself, I was very excited to see this in her book."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"I'm reading this book now and love it. A friend gave it to me for my birthday because I'm obsessed with Tolkien. Everytime I go in the bookstores I always check the Tolkien shelves for anything new and there was this one I had not seen before. I haven't put it down since I got it. I finally understand the 'big picture' of what Middle-earth and Tolkien's world view was all about. I tried The Silmarillion a couple of times and couldn't really get into it, but I think now I'll try it again, because there is a great discussion of the Fall of the Elves, starting with Feanor and the silmarillion jewels. I reccommend this book to any Tolkien fans."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"Ditto what everybody else said about Tolkien in the Land of Heroes. I got it based on the Amazon reviews and it totally lived up to what they said. Conversational style with an impressive knowledge of Tolkien. Best book on Tolkien I've read this year."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"My wife gave me this book for my birthday this year, and it's the first time I've ever been disappointed by a gift from her. I read 75 pages of this before I couldn't force myself any further.The book reads like one long run-on sentence. Ideas that should have taken a few words to mention are given several paragraphs; those that should have taken a paragraph are given many pages. An example from early on: the author spends an inordinate time speaking of how Melkor's tainting of the Music of the Ainur and his eventual exile compares to the Eden story in the Judeo-Christian belief system. The author states explicitly that she assumes familiarity with the Silmarillion; anyone with such familiarity who was raised by or near Judeo-Christian folk, who also has this presumed knowledge of the Silmarillion, will find this to be obvious and nearly trivial. Instead of being a building block for a larger theme, is in itself given several pages of aimless discussion!Furthermore, if (besides Silmarillion familiarity) the reader has anything more than a thin overview of knowledge of Greek and Norse myths, then nothing of interest can be learned here. My guess is that, like me, you'll find that you can rewrite all the useful information contained in the first 75 pages as a single paragraph, not taking even a single page, and conveying the same informational content. I wouldn't bother."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"Solid scholarly content in a readable, thought-provoking format. Not just another &quot;Tolkien&quot; bandwagon effort, this is another fine book from Petty. More readable than her first one, which I assume was her doctoral dissertation. Much mature thinking here, with good awareness of the general reader."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"This is a very interesting book. It throws yet more light on the richness of Tolkien's mind and learning, and of the world he created. Plainly this is a mine from which much treasure is yet to be dug!To compliment it I would recommend Hal GP Colebatch's &quot;Return of the Heroes.&quot; This looks at Tolkien's relevance to modern mythologies."},{"Title":"Tolkien in the Land of Heroes : Discovering the Human Spirit","review":"What I liked best about this Tolkien book was the approach. It's written by a Tolkien scholar, but the style is highly readable. It was like having a conversation with someone, looking at all the general Tolkien issues from a couple of different points of view, and maybe deciding that there's not any one right answer. She poses intriguing questions as well as offering answers; this book makes you think. A couple of times I laughed out loud, too. Thoroughly enjoyable and interesting. A valuable addition to my Tolkien books collection."},{"Title":"December: Time's Up! (Countdown, No. 12)","review":"I'm a little sad that the Countdown series is over with this book, since it is my favorite series. But if it had to end, this was an awesome conclusion. The true identities of both the Demon and the Chosen One are revealed, as well as just what the Demon wants. So if you have read the other Countdown books, you must read December!"},{"Title":"December: Time's Up! (Countdown, No. 12)","review":"I'll admit I'm a sad about the Countdown series being over, since I'm a huge fanatic and made a big deal of it coming out each month, keeping my friends updated. The series had the most wonderful plot with so many twists and turns, but in the end, you can still understand how it followed through. It really surprised me, and I'm good at figuring out who everyone really is, but this just boggled my mind about how it changes. I recomend it to anybody. I hope Daniel Parker comes out with another series, his writing is very real, like he jumped into the charcters head, no matter what age. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Free Will (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)","review":"It is easy to overestimate a book from Oxford University Press with the brief title \\"Free Will.\\" One is inclined to think that this will describe all of the in's and out's of the ancient and fascinating problem. Though a little reflection ought to make clear that no book of 450-odd pages could ever do justice to the task, it is still an impression that is hard to shake.Be advised that is a textbook--it is meant to introduce particular subject matter to students. It is not an introduction to the problem of free will and it is not a solution to the problem of free will. Just as the back cover states: \\"This volume brings together some of the most influential contributions to the topic...[made] during the past 50 years, as well as some notable recent work.\\" This means three things:1. The essays are those mainstream academic philosophers consider to be the most influential essays published on the subject since World War II, as well as a few that the editor thought would be interesting to throw in.2. These essays are collected so that it is relatively cheap and easy to get at them. Few would be willing to dig through The Proceedings of the British Academy from 1962, for example. Still others of these essays could not be obtained in print anywhere else, such as Chisholm's and Watson's excellent introduction.3. Expect only passing reference to ancient, Medieval, Enlightenment, and \\"Continental\\" treatment of the question. Remember that this is coming from from Anglophones, who do not generally read contemporary philosophy from outside their world.Once one understands these limitations, one can appreciate the book for what it is: an engaging, informative, and very useful introduction to a cross-section of the free will debate. These essays are very good and have been influential for good reason.One thing I did find disappointing, though, was the dropping of Charles Taylor's \\"Responsibility for Self\\" from the first edition. That is a marvelous essay that looks at the problem in a new way under the influence of Hegel and Heidegger."},{"Title":"Free Will (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)","review":"Some of the terminology is a bit dated but as long as you understand how the writers use certain words, this book is well organized and has great articles."},{"Title":"Free Will (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)","review":"The selection of essays is standard; the production standards of the book are low. Since the first edition, Oxford University Press has transferred this title to digital printing, which means that the book's typeface is 'dirty' and of fax quality. As this is a mere reprint (of the aforementioned bad technical quality) it also does not contain any new writing on the problem of free will. This books is not good value for money; most of the classic papers can be found in other anthologies, such as the one in the Hackett series, while the more recent ones reflect a biased perspective from 15 years ago."},{"Title":"Free Will (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)","review":"I got this for a paper and it was extremely useful. The shipper was fast to send and the condition was perfect."},{"Title":"Trigun: Ultimate Fan Guide Number 1","review":"When I first picked up this UFG for the TRIGUN series, I was unimpressed with how thin the book is. However, when I opened the fan guide, it revealed all my favorite characters in rich color from various episodes from the series. In the back (last few pages), the characters were drawn in black & white so if the reader wished, they could easily take a stab at tracing, copying or draw the characters free-hand. I am extremely interested in re-drawing these characters such as Vash, Wolfwood & Meryl...so the book really began to catch my eye with not only a creative outlook on interesting b & w poses, but cool facts & descriptions (that I only breezed over) that appeared to be pretty neat.All of this is based on the Anime not the Manga, so if you are interested in the cool series (that you may have seen on Cartoon Network) then I suggest this guide as an interesting read, but try and find it for $10...maybe $15 at most, as this is all it is really worth."},{"Title":"Trigun: Ultimate Fan Guide Number 1","review":"When I bought this I expected it to be much thicker and have alot more information! The cover posted here is wrong too! If you love Trigun, you'll like this book but if you're not really into it, then I don't think you should buy this! (Save it for a cel or use it on the episode sceries!) .. Also, when this book arrived to me, the cover was scratched and had dirt on it. Don't get me wrong, it was packaged nicely, but the book was beaten up and if you asked me, I think I'd like to be the one who damages the book!"},{"Title":"The last gamble, (Red badge detective)","review":"I bought these for my wife.

There is little discussion of theory and no yakking -- just straightforward microeconomic problems and parables. Use it for review or to get you through your final exam. Very helpful and much clearer than your textbook."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Microeconomic Theory","review":"This book is an intermediate microeconomics book intended primarily for undergraduate, upper division students. However, those not attending college can also benefit from this book by using it for independent study or reference material. There are no major prerequisites other than some knowledge of basic economics. For those who have a calculus background, the author does include one to three solved problems at the end of the majority of the chapters which are clearly marked.Of the 14 chapters that make up this book, one is an added chapter and three are optional chapters. The added chapter introduces such topics as the Lerner and Herfindahl indexes which deal with measuring monopoly power, peak-load and cost-plus pricing, and game theory. Some of the concepts presented in the three optional chapters are: the Hicksian and Slutsky substitution effects of a price change, deriving indifference curves from inferred consumers' preferences, price index numbers, utility theory under uncertainity, the Cobb-Douglas production function, linear programming, and general equilibrium and welfare economics.A weakness of this book concerns how some of the concepts are presented. In other words, the author introduces some new ideas at the end of some of the chapters in the \\"problems\\" section rather than in the main text. However, overall, I think this book provides valuable information that can benefit many people, even those who have a minimal economics background. The author presents a reasonably clear explanation of the subject matter covered which includes providing a glossary at the end of each chapter."},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Microeconomic Theory","review":"As stated I have 30+ Schaum's Outlines and have used them since being a college student in the '70s.

Why anyone would pay more than $10 for this out-dated book of 112 pages is unbelievable.In short you are to lose weight and gain muscle, i.e. change your \\"body composition\\" by eating wholesome foods like vegetables, poultry, meat, fish, etc. (yes, amazing information!) and working out four days/week on a mixed variety of exercises with decreasing reps and rest periods as the weeks progress.These topics fill up all of the 1st 50 pages. The exercises Poloquin recommends are fairly basic with a few quirky ones like Duck Leg Press (yeah, right I'll get right on that one) and Split Squat Rear Foot Elevated w/Dumbbells..??? Anyway, I guess this is the author's attempt to show that he is trying to introduce something original that hasn't been yet seen in the 1000's of weight training books available today - wonderful, but hardly worth $79.The remainder of the book, all 60 pages contain the requisite exercise instructions and photos, many of them showing incorrect form such as the chin-up which shows the subject pulling his legs into his chest, and the deadlift starting position resembling that of the squat - incorrect!And this gem \\"I have found that squeezing in that 7th meal a day versus only 6 meals makes a world of difference in gaining mass. Never go hungy!\\"Unfortunately Poloquin endorses the mainstream myth that one must eat more than 3 meals/day to \\"gain mass\\". This is absolutely false and what's more, dangerous for one's health. If you doubt me, do the research and you will find that in controlled experiments, subjects did not gain any more muscle mass on 6 meals/day versus 3 meals/day.Here is an example of a \\"Tip\\" from Mr. Poloquin: Tip 11 Add Flavonols To Your Thermogenic Stack - gosh, that actually sounds kind of dangerous - where is my thermogenic stack and how do I add a flavonol to it? What a crock!Or this produndity: Tip 20 - Eat Like a Caveman. In this section of all of 3 paragraphs Poloquin explains the latest (at least in 1997) \\"pop science\\" about how cavemen didn't eat carbohydrates - probably because McDonalds wasn't yet invented? Okay that last part is my own contribution but just goes to show the absurdity of advice from trainers who have read the latest snippet on \\"nutrition\\" on the internet and take is as truth.And finally, a question and answer section for those who didn't get it all the amazingly complex information the first time.Good on Mr. Poloquin for his standing and reputation to command the big bucks for his books and (probably) his training services - however, the average trainee can easily find programs as good or better than German Body Comp Program for free."},{"Title":"A Notorious Woman","review":"This was truly the most boring book I have ever tried to read.

Speaking as one who has visited one of that vessel's many sister ships (HMS Stubborn - deliberately sunk off Malta in 1946 as an Asdic target), I know a little (albeit very little) of the excitement these ships are able to generate. This book vividly brings to life the work and experiences of those who took part in WW2 in such craft and it is the very combination of that war, that type of submarine and the daily events of routine, danger, deprivation and even fun, which is something at which we who enjoy the freedom for which they fought can only marvel.This is a well written book which tells a story. Though centred on the wartime life of the author, it is not a book which is just about him and his ship. It is about the people and the events which he encountered along the way. Theirs is a story which forms part, perhaps only a small part, of the huge jigsaw which was World War Two. Nevertheless, their contribution still remains a vital part of the overall war effort made all the more interesting by the way in which it is told.At over 300 pages of well written dialogue with the addition of just the right amount of photographic plates and maps, this book represents real value for money and reads better than any novel.NM"},{"Title":"One of our submarines","review":"WWII threw up a lot of interesting characters, forcing some people to go to war who would never have expected to otherwise. Vasily Grossman in Soviet Russia was probably the most unlikely, but Edward Young, Penguin publisher turned Royal Navy submarine captain, is also a contender for the title. He was the first reservist to end up a submarine captain, and while perhaps not the finest sub captain of WWII, he has given us all a great story in One of Our Submarines. He covers the process from junior officer to captain, and includes the loss of HMS Umpire, as one of a handful of survivors of an accident on a training cruise.Interestingly, his story covers the bulk of the war, from the frozen North Sea off Norway to the Med, and then the Japanese War out of Ceylon, and finally Perth. That's just about all the theatres of war you could drive a submarine in.Young is upfront about his mechanical shortcomings, and you can feel his frustration with some initial poor shooting with his torpedoes: he is an ordinary man doing a hard job that needs doing. He also holds up a mirror to Britain's dawning realisation that her Navy - so long her pride - was being outstripped, easily so, by the growing USN both in quantity and quality.This is a superb little memoir of WWII submarining, when you submerged by day but for a periscope, and surfaced by night in the safety of darkness - its completely different to submarine operations today, when you can stay underwater for months on end. As a little piece of history, this is an excellent read."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"What if the Doctor Who television movie was picked up as an ongoing series? What would it have looked like? What would be the tone? These are clearly thoughts that went through Jonathan Blum's and Kate Orman's heads as they wrote VAMPIRE SCIENCE.Blum and Orman manage to capture the slick feel of the telemovie so well it seems effortless; you can almost see Paul McGann and company flying down the streets of San Francisco (via Vancouver) as the vampire menace rears its ugly head.Blum and Orman manage to capture the new Doctor's mannerisms and personality excellently, and their story manages to both take on the same tone as the telemovie, while at the same time expanding the scope and blowing the &quot;budget&quot; through the roof. VAMPIRE SCIENCE is one of the few early Eighth Doctor novels that really feels like an entity in its own right, not a &quot;generic Doctor&quot; story with the serial numbers filed off.A clever plot, great characterization, and excellent prose; this is a wonderful addition to the Doctor Who mythos. Very well done."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This is the 2nd book in the new Dr. Who series by BBC books and only the third novel to feature the 8th Doctor. Finally, the books are on the right track with their portrayal of this new Doctor for the '90's. Authors Orman and Blum manage to not only capture the personality as presented by actor Paul McGann in the TV Movie, but expand on it in lots of clever ways. The Doctor's penchant for little magic tricks; whimsical changes of subject and driving a VW around San Fransisco are great extensions of the character. It's hard to believe that there are only 90 minutes of film on which to base this character as they have made him so 3-dimensional. Unfortunately, his new companion, Sam, dosen't fare as well. She comes off as a &quot;clone&quot; of Ace, a companion of the 7th Doctor's. The &quot;one-off&quot; compainion of Caroline works better in this story than Sam. The story itself is very successful in capturing the &quot;Doctor Who for the '90's&quot; spirit that the TV Movie exuded by setting the vampires in the &quot;goth&quot; nightclub scene that is rampant in most major cities these days. The vampires themselves are well rounded characters and fit into the mythos of Anne Rice quite nicely. There is also a lot of humor laced throughout. I loved the vampire snail story! An attempt is made to throw in the &quot;traditional Dr. Who monster&quot; near the climax, but it wasn't really needed as the story's strength comes from the fact that it bucks tradition. I'd like to see more in the sereies like this."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first in the new series. One of the Time Lord's oldest and greatest enemies resurfaces in San Francisco and Sam and the Eighth Doctor rush to stop a possibly disastrous confrontation between UNIT and a newly discovered Vampire cell. A lot of this book is spent giving you an impression of the Doctor's new personality, both through his statements and Sam's observations of him. Is he a pacifist that will do anything to find a peaceful solution, or is he simply trying to hold back a violent desire to destroy a threat to the universe. There are interesting characters in this book, but at times the story seemed forced around an attempt to flesh out the new Doctor's personality. Still a good read, but not as riveting as most others in the series."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"An Ann-Rice-esque coven of vampires are found hiding on modern-era Earth, and Time Lords have a biological impulse to destroy them. Every character, from the Doctor, to the whining, pathetic C-cast humans, undergo reams of development. Also, intoxicating innuendo happens in a seedy poser bar.This is a tightly-written story with no wasted words, and immense payoffs which constantly surprise you.I expected to hate this book, especially because it's about vampires. Also, the premise is a distinct, and overused, Who-formula (vampires! they're really aliens! sexy hipster aliens! and vampirism is a scientific thing!) ...but this formula is neatly subverted, with expert storytelling, a few genre-savvy characters, and satisfying plot twists around every corner.The character developments will either worry you, delight you, or both - and will pay off in grand ways. The exception will be character development that catches you off guard - with even bigger payoffs. All characters are amazingly consistent, through all their changes. The villains are breathtakingly deep.You will squirm, shout, giggle, gasp, and tingle at this book. Contrast with Kursaal, an Eighth Doctor Adventure about werewolves, which burns well and absorbs spills."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The amount of actual science in Doctor Who has varied over the years, depending on the writer of the particular story and how much people are paying attention (watch the sixties serials to see how flexible the word \\"galaxy\\" can be) but there comes a point where you have to draw a line between science and fantasy. Vampires tend to be more on the \\"fantasy\\" side of said line, and yet the show has never really shied away from them, bringing them up late in Tom Baker's run (acutally the first episode I ever saw, and yes, it scared the heck out of me) and only occasionally pretending that science was at all involved. The Eighth Doctor runs into vampires in his second BBC adventure, but the authors take a different tactic than you might expect. After a rather bloody beginning where the Doctor and Sam hunt down a vampire in San Francisco, they come back twenty years later to find that vampires are still running around, an infestation that has caught UNIT's attention. Lines are drawn for a battle that could be quite messy indeed, but the Doctor has other ideas, perhaps a way that the vampires could still feed without killing everyone in sight. Orman was one of the better New Adventures authors and someone like her was needed to wash the bad taste that \\"The Eight Doctors\\" left in everyone's mouths, since people were looking for an actual story and not a string of anecdotes. I'm not sure what Blum adds to the mix but Orman's trademark attention to character detail and nicely crafted small scenes show up here in spades . . . the authors handle the cast deftly and keep things accessible, while making nods to continuity for the longtime fans (the UNIT representative keeps making references to the Seventh Doctor and his rather more manipulative ways, perhaps as a way to highlight how different this Doctor is). By focusing on characters they play more to the strengths of the current Doctor, who isn't as plot-happy as his previous incarnation and a little more adverse to blowing up planets to fulfill a grand scheme, his attempts to find a solution that doesn't involve people dying left and right seems proper for how the character is portrayed. The vampires themselves are depicted as more than bloodsucking killers, while some are only interested in being creatures of the night, others are taking a more active role in researching how they can stop hunting people down for food, a goal the Doctor is keen to help with. Indeed, the plot is fairly tense, as the two sides keep squaring off and come thisclose to wiping each other out, the authors play the internal vampire politics and the feuding views of the humans involved off each other well, and while this isn't the world's most densely plotted book, the conflicting motivations helps keep things moving. Sam, for one, comes across better in this story, her introduction in the last book was both boring and annoying at the same time, and while she isn't about to join the companion pantheon yet, she is both capable and a believable teenager, although sometimes the authors push the \\"she was raised by hippie parents!\\" too far at times. Meanwhile, the Doctor is finally given a story to stretch out in and he acts like you would think the Doctor should, straddling the line between \\"I have a brilliant plan\\" and \\"I'm making it up as I go along\\" as well as acting both more human and more moral than his previous incarnations, he's friendlier but you can still believe he's an alien. All in all, a decent and quick read, the BBC line was still finding itself at this point and it still feels like a really good TV episode as opposed to the envelope pushing and experimention of the New Adventures line, but it was early yet. You should skip \\"The Eight Doctors\\" and go right to this and not feel like you missed a thing."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"Saddly, its the Mel-factor again. Remember how annoying it was when Mel (the sixth &amp; seventh Doctor's companion)was just plunked into the TV serie's plot-line. Wasn't that annoying! Well, get ready because here we go again. After the fluff and non-introduction that the new companion got in Terrance Dick's infantile novel, I'm sure you're thinking that Sam will be introduced in the next novel. Surprise!!! Insted, we get treated to a introduction that sounds like this...&quot;The Doctor and I have been traveling for sometime now&quot;. And speaking of the new Doctor that we are all so eager to get to know...don't get your hopes up. He is hardly the central character of this book. What is with all these &quot;secondary&quot; characters that eat up most of the plot? I use the term &quot;plot&quot; very loosely. It is infact a story that has the characters running from one location to the other (and back again)pointlessly. The first two outings in the new BBC line of Dr Who novels are five star yawns. Do yourself a favor and watch an episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; because in the end that is what this book is more akin to. Sorry Kate."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"I think &quot;Vampire Science&quot; was a good, entertaining story, well suited to the Doctor Who style. Even though there are parallels to &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (the attitudes and personalities of the vampires), I still greatly enjoyed the story and emotions involved. I felt the story was written well enough to let your imagination wander to think, &quot;Man, what would I do if something like this happened?&quot; I like Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum, I think they're both fine authors who obviously put as much thought into their work, and work as hard, as any other author.I look forward to all the upcoming Doctor Who novels, and am sure I will enjoy them equally."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"The primary characters in Vampire Science are very well developed. The Doctor is a caring individual but is willing to defend the innocent at any cost. These two qualities are shown by his trying to reconcile the differences between James and Carolyn and confronting the vampire, eve, back in 1976 when the Doctor and Sam first met Carolyn. Sam's character shines through in this novel as opposed to her first appearance in Eight Doctors. She is shown to be inquisitive, intelligent, and not afraid to take risks when necessary. General Kramer is shown to be very distrustful of the Doctor at first since she mentions to Carolyn in the beginning of the novel how the Doctor had a previous companion whom he had under his &quot;control&quot; What made Kramer interesting was that the man she distrusted was the one she needed to stop the Vampire killings. General Kramer could have used a little more personal history to flesh her character out more. It would not have been a bad idea for Orman and Blum to have Kramer tell Carolyn her first encounter with the Doctor in detail. UNIT itself was rarely seen in the novel except towards the middle and the end. Orman and Blum, if they decide to use UNIT again, should make them more proactive even if there is not a dangerous situation they must combat. Joanna Harris was a very weak character in that she didn't seem to be very smart nor very cunning. Her character is so dull that the reader may find it hard to remember that she is the leader of a vampire clan. Slake was a very interesting character and his arguments with Harris made for interesting dialogue. Also, his dialogue with Shackle bordered somewhat on dark humor. Slake's description of vampire life in the middle of the novel was very descriptive and crisp. Carolyn and James were not very interesting characters. Their characterizations were mediocre and they appeared to be too emotional throughout the novel. The balance between narration and dialogue was perfect. Sam's dialogue showed much bravado and the Doctor's was offbeat. Slake's dialogue was also fresh and insightful. The only dialogue the reader may find boring is from Kramer, Carolyn, Harris, and James. The structure of Vampire Science worked to the story's benefit. Starting the story in 1976 with Sam in a coffee bar was unique. The action scenes did compliment each other except when UNIT and Kramer raided The Other Place nightclub. UNIT and Kramer playing peacekeepers was not very realistic. Detail also benefited the structure as well. For example, the Doctor's car, the TARDIS library, description of The Other Place, and the description of the theatre the vampires lived in. The tension in Vampire Science did keep the story moving. Several events in the story that kept it moving are when the Doctor subdues and accidentally kills Eve the vampire in 1976, Sam gets bitten by a vampire, the Doctor and Harris bloodfast, Harris and Sam trying to escape Weird Harold, and the Doctor near death after being bitten by Slake and his followers. The setting in Vampire Science could have been improved. The reader will find that going from the theatre back to Carolyn's house in the beginning does get repetitive. When the novel flashed back and forth to different scenes such as the TARDIS and The Other Place nightclub, that was when the setting did not make the reader lose interest. There is no theme in Vampire Science but the novel does prove that the vampires, the Time Lords' enemies, are not beyond hope since Harris was turned back to a human when the Doctor snuck her the vamp-away formula The style and tone of Vampire Science benefit most of the book. The poor characterization of James and Carolyn are the reason why the both of them are excessively sentimental which ruins some of the novel.James is mawkish and too uncertain of himself and everything in the story. Carolyn was portrayed more as a love sick teen than a cancer doctor. Her fascination about traveling with the Doctor in his TARDIS watered down the decent narration in some chapters of the novel."},{"Title":"Vampire Science (Dr. Who Series)","review":"This one is THE first novel of the BBC series for many who've read it. &quot;Eight Doctors&quot; simply didn't have anywhere NEAR the 'oomph' that Kate Orman and her hubby Blum's tale does. The Eigth Doctor's personality is explored quite thoroughly, none of the cardboard vestigial tripe that Dicks presented in his novel.

This book sets the foundation for the rest of the series in that the Doctor's character is wonderfully depicted. After the first few pages it soon becomes easy to fall in love with the novel - it is nothing short of fantastic. The novel is also very accessible to new and old fans of the program. Part of the book's appeal is that it has a 90's feel to it, younger fans will find that they can relate to the novel very well indeed while hard-core fans will appreciate it's regenerated form.

She finally gets her character well fleshed out, and the Doctor is shown as a more compassionate, &quot;touchy feely&quot; persona than any previous incarnation. Carolyn is also well done. What's not right about this book? The plot. It's fine and all, but seems to wander, as though not quite sure of where it's going next.

This well conceived and finely crafted work should grace any library. Bringing skillful research and writing skills to relating the evidence of human origins, Leakey and Lewin demonstrate why this team has been so successful. More than simply technical skills are visible here. There's a strong sense of humanity applied here to everything from flying an aircraft to preparing a specimen for appraisal. A major element in Leakey's presentation is his willingness to revise his opinions in the face of new evidenceLeakey once suffered from 'lack of credentials' in his work as an paleoanthropologist. Drawn to this work by a fascination with our past instead of by an academic background, he's shamed his critics with stunning finds, excellent logic in assessing their value, and the presentation talents shown here. The lack of academic constraints frees him to bring fossils to life in speculative scenarios no schooled scientist would dare. He does it here with plausible accounts of our ancestors possible lifestyles. The guild scientists may complain that 'there isn't enough evidence' to draw these scenes, but Leakey is careful to point to the evidence, drawing many elements together to produce these scenes. They are vivid and thought provoking in portrayal and need no more defense than that. And they are supported by fine illustrations of many aspects of paleoanthropology.Leakey's examination of language development occupies a significant part of his discourse. These arguments are worthy of your close inspection. Verbal communication has long been viewed as the sole distinction between humans and the other animals. Leakey shows how even this feature cannot be considered a sharp demarcation. He examines the function of language over the course of human evolution, concluding that language and our oversize brains result from a continuous feedback loop.There are few shortcomings in this book. Foremost is a lack of bibliography [yes, this remains a shortcoming even while defending Leakey's 'non-academic' background]. It would be nice to further pursue details of some of the contentious issues. Lewin's own BONES OF CONTENTION makes a fine starting point. It lacks however, any mention of Owen Lovejoy's thesis on bipedalism related in Johanson's LUCY, the most succinct depiction of human evolution in print. Leakey uses Harry Jerison as a source for brain/language interaction, but you'll look long to find Jerison's BRAIN SIZE AND THE EVOLUTION OF MIND. The lack of a reading list can be overcome with a bit of work on your part. There are many good titles available and the effort will expand your view of our origins. Start here, you will not find many other works that will touch your own humanity as closely as this one does."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"Richard Leakey introduced millions to the evolution of humanity in his first &quot;Origins&quot;, but over the years it had inevitably become outdated. This book is less dramatic but far more complete scientifically, and is an essential read for anyone who wants to keep up with our past. Moreover, where the first book tended toward philosophical speculation, in this one he builds theory on facts; where before he focused on his own views with little discussion of other researchers, in this one he quotes them with the dilligence of a reporter. Where the first book was often gramatically infuriating, this one has the polished language and clearly stated logic that make learning complex concepts seem effortless.Best of all, this time he takes us along on the adventure of discovery. Leakey is no closeted academic; he can find food and water as the ancient hunter-gatherers did, with no modern tools, in what looks to the untrained eye like a dry wasteland. He understands the politics of the illegal ivory trade as well as the interpretation of fossils. He was not stopped in either his explorations of human origins or his quest to save African wildlife by years of kidney failure, near-fatal pneumonia, death threats from poachers, or even the loss of his legs in a plane crash. He covers the science in full detail, yet the reader has a sense of immediacy one never gets from the academic literature. We are parties to acrimonious debate and feel the thrill of pouncing on the apparent error of a rival. We spend months in the bush, and are immersed in a lifelong search that yields, after innumerable frustrations, to the occasional astonishing discovery.There are a few shortcomings; Leakey glosses over some of the points he made eloquently in the first book which turned out, in retrospect, to be radically incorrect. The photographs, critical to understanding the discussion, are grouped together and hard to relate to the appropriate text, and the critical diagrams of the human evolutionary tree are small and difficult to read. But overall, the theory is so cogently explained, and the narrative has such a sense of realism, that we feel we could do it ourselves, flying over the Great Rift, sifting through ancient sand and rock, pushing back the frontiers of time to discover ourselves."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"Richard Leakey is one of the most well-known, and respected, fossil-hunters today. One must stop to appreciate the irony of his rebellion toward his parents, without whom he may have actually had to go to college to establish the credibility he enjoys due to his last name.Leakey's &quot;shots&quot; at Donald Johanson and other scientists aside, much of the analysis presented in &quot;Origins Reconsidered&quot; is quite interesting. His rebuttal of the &quot;Lovejoy hypothesis&quot; is well-articulated and rather persuasive. But the way he barely hints at his infamous &quot;4-million-year-old homo habilis&quot; fossil debacle (a claim he held far longer than evidence supported it) is awfully self serving.The driving force behind Leakey's studies is this fundamental question: &quot;what separated members of the genus homo from the &quot;bipedal ape&quot; australopithecines, and what were the environmental factors that favored homo's survival and led to australopithecus' extinction?&quot; Nearly the entire book focuses on the analysis of this question, and rather eloquently at that.This book would be best for the student of paleoanthropology, whose reading list on the subject would extend beyond this single volume. While scientifically valid, the range of theories in the area is vast, and each developing theory carries its own controversy. Only by understanding the range of these theories can one hope to have a good idea of the bipedal-ape-to-human evolution."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"This book covers in details the exciting discovery of Turkana boy, a nearly complete junvenile H. erectus skeleton. Although a little limited in scope (look for other books for a good overview of the current state of human evolution) it does a great job of detailing the discovery and its significance. Leakey also does a good job of trying to peer into the minds of these primitive hominids, examining their intellect, speech, compassion, etc. in the last several chapters and what makes us who we are. This book however is more of description of the discovery than anything else, as shown by the considerable amount of space dedicated to the descriptions of the area and the sequence of events leading to the discovery and excavation. Overall a good book with some good anthropology in it and also an exciting depiction of the discovery."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"\\"Men it appears would rather believe than know. They would rather have the void of purpose...than to be void of purpose.\\" E. O WilsonThere is a concept of \\"convergence\\" that is used by many evolutionary scholars to make their case that evolution is real, factual and not only tells us about history but allows us to make valid predictions about the future. This notion of convergence tells us that there is not one specific event or proof that guarantees that the theory of evolution is real but there exists detailed evidence in many arenas of science that all point to the same conclusion.Origins Reconsidered provides a methodology of convergence that is critical in making a case for what appears obvious to the thinking individual. Unfortunately, the theory of Evolution requires constant re-proving. Evidence which has been overwhelming for the last 150 years is still subject to \\"debate\\" for a contingent large in numbers, who have attempted to erode the credibility of this science by locating little chinks in the over all armor. Briefly, convergence is the making of inductions from classes of facts that may be disparate in and of them selves, and making strong scientific cases for each class. Once that is done the convergence of all of these explanations makes an extraordinary case for the over all objective. In this case the objective is that the theory of evolution is once again, strong and obvious.The book is written in six different parts that take the reader through an explanation of methodology, through some obvious conclusions and lastly into some speculation about what the future bodes. The authors tell most of the story in clear and sequential ways. Initially part one \\"In search of the Turkana Boy\\" is more prosaic and nearly fictional in style. It describes the setting and friendships amongst skilled and intellectual colleagues in search of \\"Missing link\\" or at least additional verification of paleo-anthropological evolution. In this section I did worry that I was reading the wrong book; that I was about to endure a book of anecdotes about what life in the anthropological dig would be. Fortunately I did not give up.Leakey attempts to make a case for how the first humans came about. At what point are those of us who are considered human distinguished from other nearly similar hominoids? Leakey explores aspects of personality that of course include the use of tools but extends the search to the beginning of language, writing, musical instrument making and art to name a few aspects.He explores the concept of consciousness and morality to further his premise. While many animals have instinctual altruism and show human signs of affection it is the ability to remember things distant and to create an ethical code of morality that distinguishes us from Cro-Magnons and other late near humans.Leakey furthers his case by addressing evolution itself and the arguments against it. He talks about the arguments and dismisses them succinctly. \\"In many cases the urge to know surpasses what can be known; questions without answers.\\" Many find this impossible to accept and seek mysticism in its place, extracting meaning where none exists.Leakey would applaud the fact that mankind has evolved into the most powerful animal on earth but he has no delusions that this is part of a divine plan. There is no predestination in evolution. Mutations occur that are of benefit and help those survive to pass that gene on and improve the species. What has happened in history is only one possible result. There is no inherent superiority in adaptation. Humans have always tried to have a gap between them and animals mainly because of the need to assuage our subjective consciousness.Origins Reconsidered also discusses how difficult paleontology really is. He uses the problem of distinguishing early hunter/gatherers from scavengers as an example. Both leave their orts in locations that are very difficult to distinguish. At the same time these are very different survivors.Ultimately Leakey maintains that while currently humans rule the earth it may not always be so, at least not as we understand humans. He sees the future as one wrought with ecological problems. He uses the notion of mass extinction to make his point. He asserts that throughout history there have been many periods of natural mass extinction. Those were precipitated by events such as Ice Ages. He maintains that Biota are fairly resistant to natural disaster. Floods for instances can apparently wipe out some local vegetation but that same biota can revive. Man made ecological disaster is another matter. Leakey's concern is that the current trends toward smog, deforestation and global warming my create a pathos that vegetation cannot withstand.Leakey and Lewin display very clearly, the science behind their own efforts but they also describe the weaknesses of science in making determinations about what is a human. Those weaknesses are noble when they are ascribed based on sound scientific theory and otherwise when \\"proven\\" by only considering results that make one's point.Leakey may have an axe to grind. He presents excellent scientific evidence but was never trained as a scientist in any field. Of course he is a scion of one of the most prolific of paleontologists; he never received a degree of any sort to lend to his credentials. His skills come from \\"on the job training\\" but they are sound. I believe it is rare that an individual can produce sound evidence to back up their empirical claims without the scholarly background, Leakey has done it.As a non scientist, it is my endeavor to understand evolution from as many perspectives as possible and this is a book that weighs heavily on that purpose."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"I found this book both enchanting and informative; not academic, but personal. This is probably the next best thing to sitting around a campfire on a dig, and listing to the shop talk about what's going on.The reconstruction of social necessities from the fossil record is excellently done. The lesson regarding (the lack of) directed-ness in evolutionary trajectory should not be missed. The human evolutionary tree has become the evolutionary bush, with mostly dead branches. One might speculate on the fate of current primate relatives given the fate of Homo Neandertalensis, Homo Heidelbergensis and Homo Erectus, all existing when Homo Sapien emerged. Additionally, the example of persistent coevolution of related anatomic or ontogenetic phenotypic expressions such as lengthening childhood, larger mature female birth canals and expanding brain size represent evolutionary puzzles with more than a touch of mystery."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"This sequel to his earlier (1977) book is both readable and informative. His not infrequent pokes at Johanson detract from the first part of the book. (One has to read LUCY for &quot;the other side of the story&quot;). The last chapter, however, is the best, easily making up for any deficiencies that preceed it. In it he comments upon three topics: The Inevitability of Homo Sapiens, The Gap between us and &quot;lower&quot; animals, and The Sixth Extinction. He concludes that our existence here on Planet Earth is a matter as much of happenstance as any thing else. Echoing S. J. Gould, we are a &quot;contingent fact of history, not the march down a predestined evolutionary pathway&quot;. As for a Gap between us and other life on earth, Leakey calls that an illusion, an accident of history. If you look closely enough you will see our links with the rest of life. Leakey has written an entire book on the last topic, The Sixth Extinction. Comparable in scale to the other &quot;big five&quot; we are in the midst of the sixth, with some 50% of species predicted by some to be gone in 30 years or so. Dispairing of our intelligence or ability to solve the problems we are causing, he envisions an earth without Homo Sapiens. Someday our brief sojourn here may be considered an &quot;abberant blip&quot;. Still we should do all we can to preserve the environment, if only to post-pone the inevitable."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"I almost gave this book 3 stars for it's difficult narrative style, but that would have taken away from the fact that it is full of great ideas.

I collected a set of books on various kinds of science and have kept them over the years, gradually reading them. I mostly read sections in each, to sample them.From 2003 till about 2006, I systematically went through them all, plus others that I had added in the course of this reading plan. Thus Leaky and Lewin sat in almost new condition on my bookcase for many years till I absorbed the whole thing finally in 2005.AcquaintanceOne reason I bought this book is because of my acquaintance with Richard Leakey. We never had an extensive relationship but I met him early in my experience as a young man in Africa. I met Richard in 1972 in Nairobi, when my wife and I were members of the Kenya Museum Society. While living in Kenya for about 25 years, we followed Richard's career in paleoanthropology, conservation and politics in the precarious rough and tumble of Kenya's volatile tribal atmosphere.I appreciated Leakey's stand on moral and scientific standards. He resisted the pressures of political expediency and the pragmatism of a party trying to stay in power. The situation made it difficult for him to conduct some of the public duties even while he was the Director of the Kenya Museums.Species RevisionEdith and I heard and early lecture by Richard, presented to the small group of Society members one evening, on the change in theory of human pre-history arising out of his discoveries. In this book Roger Lewin assists Leakey to present a scenario of pre-history, reconstructed from fossil findings and surmises of archaeologists.A key theme is that Neanderthals and other humanoid beings were NOT direct ancestor species of the modern human, homo sapiens sapiens. This has been proven definitively now by DNA research. DNA also proves Leakey's theory that the human race had one common beginning, in Africa. This book is very informative.DramaOrigins reads like a novel, which it basically is. There is a dramatic motif spinning out how it must have been, filling in from imagination the details to bridge the great gaps between the relatively few bones of various kinds from which a humanoid evolutionary history has been reconstructed.The stories attempt to paint a picture of daily life and interaction with their environment. This novelesque approach helps bring to life these beings as real living individuals. There is extensive cultural information, however, on various human cultures.Leakey and Lewin make important connections from various disciplines of science to explain aspects of human culture and suggest possible ways these practices and social structures arose in human history."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"This is a terrific trek through Leakey's discoveries and his philosophy. In humble and readable terms he discusses his find of the most complete skeleton of H. erectus. He then outlines the literature in several problem areas of human evolution. Why does man have language when other species do not? What caused man to evolve into intelligent beings? What is the evolutionary meaning of consciousness? For anyone interested in the mechanics of paleoanthropology - and the deeper questions this science raises, this is a great overview. A story well told and well worth understanding."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"a wonderful book. writted by a person who has worked in the feild and truely knows what he is talking about. philosophical towards the end of the book, he has written a masterpiece. a must read for someone who is interested in human evolution."},{"Title":"Origins Reconsidered: In Search of What Makes Us Human","review":"The first part of this book is average, the last half (chapters 12 -19) is superb.

His stomping ground: Persia and what is now Iraq. His principal claim to fame is the decipherment of cuneiform, giving us the ability to read for the first time texts that were between 2500 and 4000 years old.In this endeavor he was entirely self-taught, virtually cut off from potential colleagues in Britain and on the continent, and working under the most hostile conditions imaginable. To decipher cuneiform, he had to first acquire samples of ancient text -- which in one especially important instance meant clinging to a cliff-face hundreds of feet off the ground and laboriously copying the strange script into a notebook.The book itself is well written, well illustrated with drawings and photographs, and filled with stories of Rawlinson's contemporaries -- including real heroes, like Henry Layard, who excavated Nineveh and Babylon, and not a few semi-villains. All in all, an amazing story and a terrific book."},{"Title":"Empires of the Plain","review":"The Victorians invariably inspire, and that is certainly the case in the story of how cuneiform was deciphered in the 19th C. told very abley by Lesley Adkins. She takes us to a stage full of larger than life haracters fiercely competing for the prize of being the first to crack the ancient alphabets of Babylon. And the scenery is nearly as interesting as the story: India, Iran, Iraq, an interlude for the Afghan war, club land in London, and Ireland. Centre stage is the ambitious gentlemanly Henry Rawlinson, successful soldier and diplomat who becomes engrossed in trying to find the meaning of the ancient alphabets. And so we find him at Bishapur, Mount Elwand, and Bisitun precariously balancing on ladders in the scorching heat copying cuneiform from the inscriptions on the rocks. Later we join him for the very bloody Afghan war where he has to retreat from Kandahar, clearly as fanatical and doped up then as now. He then foregoes promotion in India and leave to England, so he can be based in Baghdad as Consul to resume work on his \`old friends' the cuneiforms. Rawlinson's discoveries were received with great excitement back in London, and he looked set to become the winner of the race. But it wasn't quite so simple, for he was not alone. There was Austen Henry Layard, who had a less than formal education, but was widely read and was especially enamoured by \`Arabian Nights'. After turning his back on a profession in the law, he borrowed 300 from his mother and started travelling east, towards Nineveh, where he spent hours drawing the ruins, including the cuneiform: soon he was in correspondence with Rawlinson. As the story unfolds, Layard and Rawlinson initially become something of a team, with Layard being the chief excavator, supplying Rawlinson with more and more cuneiform, and Rawlinson the chief analyst. Then there is the opium smoking Frenchman Paul Emile Botta, whose excavations inspired Layard. The amount of support he received from his government also irritated the Englishmen as they had to largely rely on their own means. These three were men who knew the heat and dust of Asia, and were friends, of sorts. The fourth character in the drama was not. This was Revd Edward Hincks, shepherd to an obscure flock twenty miles south of Belfast, who knew only the rain of Ireland. But he was a linguistic genius. Working only on the cuneiform available in the public domain, he had worked out the name Nebuchadnezzar on one of the inscriptions before Rawlinson. He presented his first paper on \`Old Persian and Elamite Cuneiform in 1846, and, as Adkins says, \`his achievement was more remarkable because he did not have a copy of Rawlinson's Bisitun inscription'. There is a sense of rivalry between the two men from the start. When Rawlinson hears of Hinck's advances, he writes to Layard \`A certain Dr Hincks has got much further than I and pretend(s) to have succeeded.' They met four years later in London, but there was no friendship and later when both of them were answering questions at a meeting in Edinburgh, Hincks was annoyed that Rawlinson did not acknowledge his significant early contribution, and later Rawlinson would refer to Hinck's \`over confidence'. The neglect of Hincks continued when in 1851 the American Oriental Society published a long analysis of Old Persian: Rawlinson was mentioned, not him. Infuriated Hincks eventually published a new paper detailing the scholars responsible for the discovery to all the letters so far deciphered. The tone makes it quite clear who has been more successful - \`Of the 177 values we have in common, 100 were first published by me in my former paper...' By now Layard, writing popular books on the romance of the discoveries, was siding more with Hincks in print. This enraged Rawlinson who used his influence to oppose Hincks' employment at the British Museum, which was very important for the poorly paid cleric. As well as this rivalry, there was also some scepticism among the wider public regarding the whole enterprise, some saying the translations were just \`moonshine'. To settle this Royal Asiatic Society held a literary inquest in 1857 where scholars analysed both Rawlinson and Hinck's work. The result was a vindication for both scholars - and Hincks was shown to be just as capable translator as Rawlinson. Despite their rivalry they laid the foundation for all that is now known about the ancient Babylonian languages. Hincks ended his days in obscurity in Ireland; Rawlinson, always famous, became very much the establishment man of London society. The characters and the story make the book fascinating, but it also reveals much about Victorian Britain: the insatiable desire to explore; the great importance of knowledge about the ancient civilisations, especially regards corroborating the events in the Bible,. There is the exactitude demanded by the academic societies; and finally there is the strange, almost extraordinary confidence of these Victorians. A confidence that made them sure they would be able to decipher the cuneiform alphabets, and a confidence that never questioned their right to excavate the plains of Babylonian. Some of this was done by the young Layard with a team of Arab helpers. He would bring up the obelisks; ship them down the Tigris to Bombay, and from there to London and the British Museum. He was not doing this with a military escort. The local Arab and Iranian rulers were allowing it. The question screaming in between the lines is, why weren't the Arab and Iranian scholars trying to decipher their own ancient languages? The answer must be to do with the stark difference between the intellectual climates of West and East. Quite rightly Adkins doesn't explore this, her story is already complex enough, and she tells it superbly to the end."},{"Title":"Empires of the Plain","review":"I read books about Howard Carter and his search for ancient Egyptian artifacts. I also read about the Egyptian hieroglyphics. Then I saw a BBC Horizon special on cuneiforms and purchased this book to learn more. Unfortunately, the book reads like a compilation of personal letters and diaries of a few individuals but usually Henry Rawlinson. This has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, you get a first hand account which makes for very interesting reading. On the other hand, he is what he is, a wealthy aristocrat that treats others badly, so you may learn more than you bargained for about the British especially with their current fondness for bashing the Americans and claiming that they wrote the book on fair play. The behavior of his colleagues in India and Afghanistan can only be described as barbaric. In any case, much is left out with this one-sided view of history.Henry is first and foremost a military officer working for the East India Company at a time when Asians are referred to as Orientals whether they are Indian, Afghani or Iranian so some of the titles of various professors or scientists will seem odd. Henry has surprizingly little to do most of the time so he spends his time ruining horses in racing contests and shooting anything that moves for the pure pleasure of killing. He can't really bond with anybody because of the class war and because he didn't enlist in the regular army or go to college so he spends his time drinking and chasing women (the author alludes to this only briefly but considering the sources used...) and ocassionally looking at ancient ruins. And there's the rub. He wants credit for discoveries so he pulls aristocratic strings that force dramatic delays in progress with regard to either finding artifacts or translating them. A better man would have chosen at most a few areas to study or having rediscovered an ancient site, urged another less busy person to come hither and investigate but not Henry. His military career puts him in India, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and possibly Turkmenistan or Azerbaijan. When time is available and it often is not, he takes a chance to explore ruins and speculate about his findings. He didn't go to college so he is in over his head. He does copy a few writings here and there but then he hints to the Royal Society of London that he has found major breakthroughs and of course refuses to cough up more than bits and pieces. Some British and French scientists are keen to use the Christian Bible and ancient Greek stories to uncover lost civilizations. Surprizingly, nobody seems keen to use the Koran or ancient Roman stories. Surprizingly, some Christian leaders are against excavations on the grounds that they might uncover disturbing scientific facts that discredit the Christian Bible. Henry is continually asked to share his discoveries so that more talented experts can assist with the digging and the translation but he refuses out of selfishness and offers the most pathetic excuses. Because he is a military officer, he rarely gets a chance to return to these sites to do serious assessments yet still demands full credit for discovery and his interpretion of ancient events based on his limited knowledge. Several years later when he can finally take a leave of absence without damaging his military career, he returns to Britain and provides findings that are helpful but still extremely limited in scope. Thus the selling point to the British public is that this brave young man climbed a dangerous cliffside to view some ancient carvings written in 3 languages. He's a hero because one French archaelogist attempted the same thing and gave up. Apparently there wasn't much competition in those days nor was anybody interested in doing it right by bringing better telescopes, ropes, ladders or perhaps an engineer that can build such things? He's also a hero because he translated a few stones. Hard work by another member of what is now the UK is ignored because of his racial background (One really must admire those British and their fair play). Hard work by French and German researchers are deliberately delayed, downplayed and eventually discredited so that Britain can have a hero. Well done! The behavior of the Royal Society of London borders on inexcusable! The French discovered an ancient ruin and dug several items out of it, moved them to the river and sent them downstream to boat waiting to bring them back to France for research and display, but the British force the boat to wait MONTHS before leaving for no other reason than that the British want to poke around in the same ruins, find more stuff and claim first credit. One sees the dark side of archaeology in all its glory.At this point, you might be wondering about cuneiforms. I know I was. The author weaves an interesting story but is rather weak on the linguistics. Cuneiforms are not discussed except to suggest that multiple ancient civilizations seemed to like the concept of writing things down and apparently tweaked cuneiform to tolerate their languages (similar to the way many European languages use the Roman alphabet) rather than simply inventing their own written language. This sounds intriguing but we are left without any details. Similarly, we learn that two writing methods are used: written and cursive and two methods are used: clay tablets to keep around the city and stone carvings in mountainsides to last an eternity. All this is very interesting but clearly I need to read a different book."},{"Title":"Empires of the Plain","review":"At initial glance, any biography of Sir Henry Rawlinson would seem to be a ready made best-seller. Here was a man who found time to decipher three ancient languages over several decades, while still keeping his day job of fighting wars and conducting diplomacy. Thus, if a writer focused just on Rawlinson's life, the resulting biography should be both entertaining and informative. But, Adkins' real interest lies in archeology. Consequently, she can't resist spending extra time detailing the elements of cuneiform creation and decipherment. These details, while mildly interesting, can't compare to the better story of Rawlinson's life. As a result, it's hard for the non-archeologist reader to maintain enthusiasm through the book's non-biography portions.It seems that Adkins the scientist was fighting with Adkins the would-be popular writer when this book was written, because it sometimes reads like two distinct books. The end result of this dichotomy is a story whose sum isn't greater than its parts. Empires of the Plain isn't bad. But, it would have been a better book had Adkins focused a bit less on the science and a bit more on the biography."},{"Title":"Uber Bad Taste","review":"I really enjoyed this book though its not for everyone, it is highly \\"experimental\\" and if you are looking for a book written like every other book you've read than you probably won't like this, although it is more linear than the author's \\"The FBI says this is not called The Sociopath\\".the plot is a classic, I found it to be a very funny parody and did not consider it to be in bad taste but then again I am probably insane. God and Satan, being bored, get together and start a fight, using humans as pawns. This takes place during and before WWII and God takes the side of the Nazis, Satan takes the side of the Allies. Its funny to make Satan the \\"good guy\\" but the plot is more complicated than that, neither one can be classified as purely good or purely evil, which may (?) have been the point of the bookif you are up for something unusual and trying out a new writing style- text used to create art and stucture- then Uber bad taste is a great choice of something to read."},{"Title":"Uber Bad Taste","review":"I must admit that I don't know as much about WWII as I should.

As someone who keeps up with this trend, I am always amazed by how little of the basic food science is understood by Sous Vides many proponents. Botulism is a real concern when cooking in an anaerobic environment. Understanding the time and temperature continuum is essential for producing safe food.Sue Ghazala's text is the only book available that really discusses these important concerns. The book was written by and for food scientists. Nevertheless, a lay person who is willing to spend the time can with some effort follow the basic arguments. Again, this is a science text and if you are looking for receipes or how to instructions, you need to look somewhere else.I believe it is just a question of time before a well meaning chef accidentily ends up killing or seriously injuring his or her clientele. The reason this has not happened yet is that in raw numbers, very little Sous Vide cuisine is being produced in Europe and North America. This book is a must purchase for anyone who is thinking about scaling up their Sous Vide production to a commercial scale.

These deities have nothing to do with Brahminical Hinduism but now are considered to be part of the Hindu pantheon (these deities have been assimilated into the Hindu religion by creating new mythologies surrounding their origin, making them avatars of prominent Brahminical gods etc. (Meenakshi Amman, Alagar, Ayyappan, Murugan and Venkateshwara are some examples)). This book focuses primarily on some of the local deities of Andhra Pradesh (Nellore District). The author uses the word &#8220;Dravidian gods&#8221; to describe these non-Vedic gods. I am not sure if that is the right term. Most people think of South India when the word Dravidian is mentioned but such gods can be found in every nook and corner of India.This book was published in 1915 (prior to India&#8217;s independence) and there is a slight Western bias. In page 79 the book details the mythology surrounding a local god called Potukuri Verabramham who was born in a carpenter&#8217;s family. As a boy and as an adult he resurrected dead individuals. Three days after his own death he arose from the grave and informed his disciples of a coming judgment of punishment and rewards. The author quickly comes to the conclusion that this is an adaptation of Christian teachings!! The sacrificial and resurrecting god mythology is found in many ancient cultures. The most popular of these gods happens to be Jesus."},{"Title":"Manual of Histologic Staining Methods of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology","review":"I've been searching for a good reference online and offline and never have I come across a manual as good as this one!

Apparently this is not completely wrong or true. In either way you are going to be happy when you buy Advanced Learners Dictionary since it gives both. The software it its CD is much more satisfying than other commercially available online dictionaries. QuickFind feature of the software shows the meanings and definitions without doing anything except you move the pointer to the word. Even now I'm using it to write this review. Although I am using computers all the time in the office I'm much more delighted with my paper-ink version dictionary. The definitions are very clear and concise. Especially guidewords technique are a very intelligent invention. Many times it happens that while I'm reading something with the help of my dictionary I stop reading the book and start reading the dictionary instead. I had the Cambridge International Dictionary of English before. But Advanced Learner's has much more for me. I gave my old dictionary to my cousin. I was so anxious I couldn't wait it in Amazon.com and ordered from England (amazon.co.uk). I highly recommend it especially to those learning English as a second language."},{"Title":"Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary HB with CD-ROM","review":"I consider the CD-Rom you get with the book the best dictionary on the market. Each entry has IPA symbols and also a red loudspeaker icon for the British pronunciation and a blue one for the American. A microphone icon let you practise your pronunciation.The feature I like using every day is the QUICKfind with the automatic sound. You just point the mouse at a Word document or at the text on a web page and the software speaks up the sound for you. While listening to the sound, the QUICKfind let you have a small dictionary window open on the screen with the meaning of each word you are pointing the mouse at, and the two loudspeakers with both English and American pronunciations are still there. Just imagine all those foreign languages and literatures university students who are going to prepare for their oral exams and have to be able to read aloud loads of poems with a perfect pronunciation and also explain the words' meanings - what a lot of time saved with the aid of this software!The main window has three other useful icons, i.e. Exercises, Pictures and Study pages.Among the Exercises, you can find Word Exercises (adjectives and adverbs, affixes, homophones, irregular and problem verbs, noun forms, suffixes, verbs meaning 'perform') and Pictures Exercises (animals, back, birds, body, car exterior, car interior, cars and trucks, clothes, flowers, foot, fruit, hair, hand, hats, head, in the kitchen, in the office, kitchen equipment, office equipment, phrasal verbs, planes, ships and boats, skeleton, sports, vegetables).Among the Pictures you can find about 100 tables of content with colourful drawings. If you point the mouse at a drawing, its word appears, whereas if you click on the drawing, its meaning appears.Among the Study pages you can find very useful documents in PDF format, divided into two categories, i.e. &quot;Vocabulary, Grammar, Pronunciation&quot; (a guide to pronunciation, determiners, homographs, homophones, irregular verbs, modal verbs, phrasal verbs, prefixes and suffixes, punctuation, regular inflections, regular verb tenses, relative clauses, word building) and &quot;General Information&quot; (common names, common symbols, computers, geographical names, letter writing, measurements and quantities, money, periods of time, relationships, sounds and smells, telephoning, varieties of English, work and jobs).I would give this item six stars, if only I could!

Like Acel Stecker, Hungry Men's protagonist, Anderson spent time as a bum, riding the rails, playing music, and boxing.Hungry Men is an account of the young hobo Acel, who was once a small-time musician and is now penniless. It's a brutal look at the 30's and it's chapters are short and establish different moments in Acel's traveling and the many alliances he forms. I found the friendships between the bums interesting--symbiotic as each tries to bring something to the relationship that makes him of value; meanwhile the friendship provides a sense of protection against policemen, railroad bulls, and politicians. The social dynamics make the book very interesting. Acel takes work here and there, trying to scrape together enough money to buy a cheap suit and put a girl up in a hotel. He tries desperately to find work, but is often turned down or away. Along the way he meets Lundgren, a kind, but very ill man, and Boats, the Socialist, who challenges Acel's thinking. Initially antagonists, Acel comes to adopt Boats philosophy in a surprising turn. Eventually, Acel is forced to choose between his new ideals and surviving in a society that is violent towards anything resembling Communism. The ending is subtle, but Anderson makes a strong literary and political statement through Acel's actions. The title makes the story all the more compelling, because as Acel and his fellow travellers move from state to state and camp to camp, they are always searching for sustenance. Their profound hunger for food, money, love, and acceptance is well conceived.At times I found Anderson's dialogue clunky or Acel's speech and thought patterns a bit contrived. The conversations seem a little stilted and dated, but again, this might just be representative of the time. It took me a little while to actually get into the slightly jarring tone and to feel empathetic towards Acel, but I warmed when I began noticing that he treated all of his bum buddies fairly.The cover on my copy of Hungry Men calls it \\"an American Classic\\". I'm not sure I would go that far, but I do believe its an honest look at the Depression. Because Anderson experienced much of what he wrote about, his descriptions are reliable. No Steinbeck, but Anderson's a decent writer and certainly has picked an interesting subject and protagonist. Recommended as historical fiction for anyone interested in turn-of-the-century writing and the Great Depression."},{"Title":"Little Infamies: Stories","review":"No slacker, Karnezeis packs 19 stories into this small, 281-page book. The stories are set in a Greek village in the 1950's. Although it contains less than 40 houses, and thus is about to be deprived of official existence, it contains an amazing assortment of personalities, from spinster to prostitute, from priest to thief to pimp. Each has his own hopes and fears. All must cope with an earthquake, a drought and the obliteration of the village by a new dam and reservoir. As many authors, Karnezeis has trouble with endings, sometimes leaving the reader to guess at them and sometimes lacking credibility. Not a native speaker of English, the author muffs a few idioms, as when a character stands on her heels to reach an object overhead. Nevertheless, the work is fascinating and absorbing."},{"Title":"Little Infamies: Stories","review":"I once heard a story about a southern writer -- may have been Flannery O'Connor or Eudora Welty -- who, in response to a foolish complaint that her stories contained far too many freaks and monsters, declared that this was because in the South they can still tell a freak when they see one. This book by Panos Karnezis not only recognizes freaks and monsters but also tries to explore what makes them what they are, thus bringing out the beeauty of their basic humanity as well as their brokenness. This exploration is enormously, sometimes shockingly successful as the author unleashes his expansive, explosive imagination on a Greek town so poor it doesn't even have a name. He involves all the reader's senses, even smell and touch, to describe how his characters make what seem to them reasonable moral decisions and lay out what they consider logical plans for the future they will never have. Their reason and logic is of course the ethos of poverty and ignorance, which is what largely characterizes their existence. The reading public has reason to celebrate Karnezis's arrival on the literary scene. As I understand it, he is still under forty. Good grief."},{"Title":"Little Infamies: Stories","review":"These strikingly original short stories are set in a small village in Greece, &quot;so poor it doesn't have a name&quot;. They are extraordinary: shocking, colourful, amusing, resonant and sometimes tragic. Although Panos Karnezis writes in his second language, his style is fresh and lyrical and he has enriched and subverted English making it into a delight to read. He has created unforgettable characters and has cast a sharp eye on contemporary Greece. He is a master of the genre, like James Joyce, Raymond Carver or Guy de Maupassant."},{"Title":"Little Infamies: Stories","review":"Last year I read Karnezis' novel The Maze, and although I found it rather uneven and a little baroque, I thought this earlier and more modern collection of short stories might be more to my taste. (Being 1/4 Greek, I feel obligated to try and dip into a little fiction from there every now and then.) However after finishing most, but not quite all, of the stories in this collection, I found myself similarly unmoved by the semi-gothic storytelling, which shows heavy influences of Borges and Calvino, among others.Set sometime after WWII and the Greek Civil War (presumably in the 1950s), the stories all take place in a small village (too poor to even have a name) in an anonymous region, and are framed by episodes of biblical woe. The book begins with a story of the the town being stricken by an earthquake. One of the consequences is that the local priest is shown to be a fraud, and so the story is suggesting a literal attempt to shake the town awake to the coming modernity. Near in the middle, drought wreaks destruction upon the land. Then in the final story, when the stubborn villagers have demonstrated their loyalty to traditional ways, the village is washed away under a new hydroelectric project. A little gimmicky and unsubtle perhaps, but not a bad way to frame such a collection. I'm sure those with a religious background could spot many more allusions throughout the book.The stories are mostly little character studies or morality tales, sometimes ending with a jolt, sometimes with a whimper -- but very often suffused with a sense of magic possibility that gives them the timbre of more than mere reportage. Among those we meet are the priest, the doctor, the whore, the barber, the pimp, the spinster, the farmer, the barkeeper, the station agent, the landowner, the virgin, the bus driver and so on. Revenge is a running theme, and a number of the stories end with a punchline in which someone gets their (sometimes lethal) just deserts. Karnezis writes with a sly, dark wit, and the humor is one of the better elements of the collection. Another running theme is the danger of outsiders, for in almost every case, when the villagers interact with outsiders, bad things result. From two incidents of petty theft, to swindles, the indifference of regional bureaucrats, to the menace of a pair of gun-toting hunters. Elements of Greek mythology appear as passing characters as well, including a centaur and a mermaid. I'm not a big fan of magical realism, and so the stories where that became more prominent were of lesser interest. None of the stories made a particularly huge impression, and it's one of those books I doubt I'll recall having read in a year or so. However, it may definitely posses greater to charms for other readers."},{"Title":"Gradual failure: The air war over North Vietnam, 1965-1966 (The United States Air Force in Southeast Asia)","review":"The U.S. Air Force (USAF) reached its nadir during the opening two years of the Rolling Thunder (RT) air campaign in North Vietnam (NV) which began in March 1965.

Of course, Durant's works are in many cases outdated today. Roberts updated his work in order to \\"fix\\" things where evidence has leaned one-way or-another over the last several years, as well as to bring it up-to-date with the fall of the Soviet Union and the new global supremacy of the United States.Of course, Roberts only hits the highlights. But he doesn't ignore anything; even so-called minor issues are discussed. In many ways, he is outlining how the modern world came to be the way it is. All too much of what passes for history now a days is really little more than gossip about minor events in the relatively recent past. The grand sweep of historical events is often lost. Looking at well sells as history books today can make one cringe that somebody would read something, let alone write it.Because people lack and true appreciation and understanding of history, they seem to be electing leaders who also lack the willingness to learn from past events. Democracy is on - at the very lest - a tenitive rise. Leaders need to know how Rome or Britain affected things in the modern political landscape. Churchill made decisions that are still being played out in the Middle East and Iraq today. Roman and even ancient Greek leaders had to deal with the issues of in the Balkans in southeast Europe over two-millennia ago. You can't fully understand the former Yugoslavia without understanding Roman province carving and its long term affects on world history.How can leaders hope to make the best decisions if they don't understand the causes of the original problems? And since democratically elected leaders are, at least in the West, the norm now, people need to understand history in order to recognize people who understand it.Roberts tries to restore the grand scope to the matter of human history. Something people and our political leaders seem to have very much lost sight of now.

Within each description are references. My guess is it is the last name of the horticulturist who took the observations, the past year(s) it was observed growing and the plate number. It also lists any 'synonyms'; other names the apple cultivar was known as. Then it goes into a detailed description. Every few pages their are plates that show both the fruit whole and cut it in half, so you can see the inside. Some are in black and white and others are in color BUT the detail is awesome. You feel like you can actually pick the fruit right from the page and eat it. It is that good.Okay, bummer, I just saw that the last page, with no print, is ripped. Still, this is a treasure and something I will appreciate for a long time. At 360 pages it is jammed with great information.

Sinnema.'Self-Help' was published in 1859 in England, and became the instant bestseller, with 20,000 copied sold within the year after publication, making Samuel Smiles a household name. It is hard to categorize this book into any genre, but basically 'Self-Help' is a statement on the virtues of hard working, or in Smiles's favorite word, 'perseverance,' amply illustrated by many examples of biographical records collected by Smiles.The chapter names would show the contents -- 'Self-Help: National and Individual'; 'Leaders of Industry: Inventors and Producers'; 'Three Great Potters'; 'Application and Perseverance'; 'Helps and Opportunities'; 'Workers in Art'; 'Industry and the Peerage'; 'Energy and Courage'; 'Men on Business'; 'Money: It's Use and Abuse'; 'Self-Culture: Facilities and Difficulties'; 'Example: Models'; 'Character: The True Gentleman.'Each chapter tells you the examples of hard work and its eventual triumph, and with many biographical episodes, Smiles argues the importance of being earnest, no matter where the supposed readers belong to the social ladder of England. For example, in the Chapter 'Three Great Potters' you can see the life of three potters -- Palissy, Bottgher, and Wedgwood -- and how they. in spite of the numerous obstacles rushing to them, succeeded in their art, with which their names were recorded in the history.Like this, Smiles' book has a pattern -- it states its point first, championing the virtue of hard work, then he supports his statement with mini-biographies about many people, which include that of mechanics, philanthropists, scientist, musicians, soldiers, politicians, merchants, and many others. But as this is written in the middle of the Industrial Revolution, many pages are devoted to the inventors of new machines, or their privation, suffering, and final victory.Often his styles are preachy, and Smiles didn't include many remarkable women who should have been included (if he does, those women's roles are often as men's 'help-mates'), and it has been pointed out since the publication that the cases Smiles cites as examples are all successful ones. But as it was written long time ago, we should take the book as it is now.Oxford editon included concise introduction by Peter W. Sinnema, and helpful notes and glossary of the names the book deals with.This is not a so-called 'how-to' book (if you want to read that way, of course you can), but a good proof as to how Victorian working class and lower-middle class thought about being 'viruous' and 'respectable.' If you want to see the glimpse of Victorian ideas among ordinary people, and how such ideas greatly influenced the writers like Dickens who created Mr. Bounderby in 'Hard Times,' you should read this book."},{"Title":"Self-help","review":"Because of this book the Japanese learned to be servants instead of masters. \\"Self Help\\" Totally Changed History of Japan.

Self help was a series of lectures given by a physician named Samuel Smiles to a group of boys in England who came out of the mines, mills, and factories that wanted an education.

The works of Sam Smiles are often attributed as the inspiration for many later works on the subject as well as plenty of successful individuals; and for good reason. Smiles is a very talented writer and proved to offer insights of a timeless quality.Self Help provides a fantastic overview of the importance of developing yourself, not just for your own needs, but for the betterment of society. Smiles focuses on the core attributes such as attention, persistence, imagination, and patience. He also deals in depth with character, thrift, and humility. Although these topics have been handled countless times by many successful authors, few have done as much justice to them nor have many matched Smiles' ability to express why these attributes are so important.Smiles manner of writing is eloquent and flowing. He provides an incredible amount of examples to support his points. Although he acknowledges the equal importance of studying those who failed as well as those who succeeded, he justifies a focus on the latter merely by matter of interest and intrigue. The book is an impressive collection of stories about those who lifted themselves from small beginnings to great successes using the principals outlined in the book.Although there is no secret recipe for success, Smiles work is a testament to the importance of maintaining the right attitude in various areas to at least greatly increase the probability of success. Without question, if all you do is read this book to gain the some of the knowledge Smiles has to offer, you will be a better person for having read the book.

Although Burr had the advantage of coming from a line of presidents of Princeton, he lost both his parents early, and was raised by an uncle he had little feelings for. However, he was an extremely smart and ambitious youth, and made his way through education to become a distinguished soldier (except in the eyes of George Washington, who never trusted him) and a lawyer who practiced in New York. He was always aware of how important appearances were, so he lived far above his means, to the point of being in perpetual debt. Because of a combination of intelligence, ambition and fortunate circumstances, he found himself sought out by Democrat Republicans to be Jefferson's running mate against John Adams in the 1800 Presidential election. The truth was however, that Burr lacked any strong political views, and could have easily allied himself with the rival party, the Federalists. Burr, indeed had his ardent supporters (known as \\"Burrites\\") as well as arch-enemies (as Lomask points out, it's difficult to say when exactly Hamilton would fall into this category), not necessarily along party lines.Burr attempted, as best he could, to keep himself above the struggles of the most powerful New York politicians, and he was, at first, uncontroversial enough to be nominated as Jefferson's running mate. However, because of a quirk in the electoral college (each elector had two votes), Aaron Burr received as many votes as Thomas Jefferson, placing the election between these two in the hands of Congress. Amazingly, Jefferson and Burr never spoke, but the Democratic Republican party asked Burr to announce that he would not serve if elected President, whereas the Federalists now supported Burr as the lesser of two evils (they thought Jefferson, who had served as Vice-President under Adams, would ruin the Country). Burr, playing the middle, refused to say anything, causing Jefferson, when he was finally elected after multiple votes were taken, to absolutely despise his Vice-President, to the point where Burr became a complete Washington outsider, even though he was supposedly the number two man.Of course, the most notorious part of the first half of Burr's life was his feud with Hamilton, which arose from Burr's learning about a negative comment Hamilton allegedly made at a party concerning Burr's character (Burr was something of a cad) leading to, by far, the most famous duel in American History. And, if you read my review of Lomask's biography of the second part of Burr's life, you will see that the utterly bizarre life of Aaron Burr would become even more bizarre.The subject matter of Lomask's two biographies, which are both quite good, cannot be more interesting. I do believe, however, that it's only a matter of time until we get a biography about this fascinating and strange man from a more top-flight biographer, perhaps Ron Chernow, who one would think would consider writing a book on Aaron Burr after his extremely well-received biography of Hamilton."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Young Hearts","review":"This sweet, well done book, is my daughter's favorite bedtime book. It's story, set in rhyme, is easily memorized and relaxing. I am purchasing our second copy."},{"Title":"The Prayer of Jabez for Young Hearts","review":"Children's books are foundational; they should be worth reading rather than following money-making fads. So it's particularly frustrating to see a best-selling book turned into multiple editions that include children's books, without special care made to see that the children's editions are well-written and true to Scripture.Scripture does not tell us to pray this prayer daily. Nor does Scripture tell us Jabez prayed this prayer everyday! (This book tells us he did.) The suggestion that he was a godly child praying for God's blessing from childhood is so far beyond what Scripture tells us that this book should not be given to kids unless adults explain it's a made-up story. Scripture just doesn't say that much about Jabez. It's so much more important to have children memorizing passages Scripture does emphasize (the Lord's prayer, for example) and learning about biblical people the Bible treats as important parts of its story (the patriarchs, the kings, the judges, the apostles, etc.--and especially Jesus Christ).If you find the prayer of Jabez life-changing, fine. Tell your kids about it as PART of your teaching them about Scripture and about prayer. But please don't let it get out of balance, and don't make this book the way your kids learn about it, as it IS out of balance."},{"Title":"How to Spot a Crooked Stockbroker: The Tricks and Scams Unscrupulous Stockbrokers and Brokerage Firms Use to Steal Investors Savings Every Day","review":"How to Spot a Crooked Stockbroker: A Safety Guide For Investors is a good, basic 50 page booklet that introduces the reader to common broker scams.

And really, the gripe reviewer is confused. As the books index notes, there are exactly TWO pages out of 300 that talk about contests. The author's web site (www.cheaptravel.net) explains something I never knew about, FREE travel cash deals going on for the past 15 years and which are NOT contests. It was easy to follow the author's advice and receive $3,000 of Jonny Cat Litter free travel cash which was used to help pay for vacations over 1 1/2 years until this particular deal expired just last May 2,000! The book offers off the beaten trail tips like the best travel insurance policy that pays when others won't pay a dime for a missed vacation. I never thought to use Entertainment editions in Australia and Maui. Never heard of London and Paris for LESS books! Or that one call to United Airlines gets you a free companion ticket good anywhere in the US! Also, the book is fun to read especially with the author's first hand around the world stories like the Carnivore Barbeque Restaurant in Nairob that serves Zebra, Giraff and heartebeast! (also, chicken, beef and ribs). Do you know why Diner's Club is better to use than any airline card? I didn't! I love books that &quot;pay&quot; for themselves. And this one does big time.

When a man named Colonel Armstrong arrives moments after his death and warns Allison that she is in danger, she is shocked. As her uncle's private secretary, she alone holds the key to the unbreakable cipher that he was working on before his death. He promised the key to the Colonel but left nothing behind but an encoded message. The Colonel demands the key, something that Allison cannot provide.To get away from the stress of the situation and to get rid of a pesky cold, Allison goes to Altonrea, a summer cottage in the mountains. She had spent summers there with her uncle, and although she will be alone and the cottage has no electricity, she welcomes the thought of solitude. She brings her blind cocker spaniel along for company, and finds it to be a quiet place to relax-- at first. At night, noises abound, and fear begins to creep up on her, especially when she finds evidence of her uncle's own paranoia, and that of the previous owner of the cottage.The sounds she hears outside alternate between those of a human and those of a beast. She wonders about Pan, the god of the animals whose name served as inspiration for the word \\"panic.\\" To add to her anxiety, Allison begins work on decoding her uncle's deathbed message and the cipher he called unbreakable.Another entertaining story from Helen McCloy, Panic introduces a group of memorable characters and vivid settings which makes for a story that is easy to follow and which remains engaging throughout. The major flaw of this work is inclusion of long explanations of different ciphers throughout history. We don't so much care how Allison's uncle's code is broken, so long as it is. However, the climax is solid and makes for some fast page-turning to get to the conclusion."},{"Title":"Let's go to the circus,","review":"For the age of the book I was very pleased with the quality of the binding and the pages.

For instance, this isn't the best place to first read about characteristic classes and topological K theory (I would recommend, without much hesitation, the books by Atiyah and Milnor &amp; Stasheff, instead). Much to my disappointment, the chapter on spectral sequences is quite convoluted. Parts of 'user's guide' by Mcleary would certainly come in handy here (which sets the stage rather nicely for applications).So it turns out that supplemental reading (exluding Whitehead's massive treatise) is necessary to achieve a better understanding of algebraic topology at the level of this book. The homotopical view therein will be matched (possibly superseded) by Aguilar's book (forthcoming, to which I am very much looking forward).Good luck!"},{"Title":"The intimate papers of Colonel House,","review":"I purchased this book a few weeks ago. \\"The Intimate Papers of Colonel House.\\"What they don't tell you, before you buy the book, is that the book only coversa time period of 2 years 1915-1917.

Trevor, whose other literary credits include The Flight of the Phoenix and Bury Him Among Kings, was spurred by his success to write a nineteen-book series about Quiller's further missions under the pseudonym of Adam Hall. Although the books have had a loyal following, especially in Britain, none has received the acclaim which greeted this first novel in the series. A bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic, it was eventually filmed as The Quiller Memorandum with George Segal and Alec Guiness.Quiller is a &quot;shadow executive&quot; for an officially unavowed British intelligence agency known only as &quot;the Bureau&quot;. The novel opens in post-war Berlin where he has been working with the Z police, a German agency devoted to the prosecution of war criminals. War-weary from an undercover assignment at a concentration camp during WW II, Quiller is due to return home. The Bureau convinces him to stay, however, by revealing to him that a forming neo-Nazi movement in Berlin may be headed by Zossen, the commandant of the concentration camp from which Quiller had helped Jews escape. Working alone in a faceless city which presents hidden threats at every turn, Quiller accepts the assigment that has already left one agent dead -- stepping into, as his field director puts it, a gap between two mobilizing armies which cannot see one another in the fog.Hall's writing is consistently terse and compelling. He is at his best in evoking the tension of working for a manipulative secret beaurocracy whose motivations remain obscure, but whose local culture seems vitally real and believable. Quiller is a soldier at work for an army that he knows only from the ranks, whose generals are shrouded in shadow. It is in evoking this culture that Hall's writing transcends the genre, exploring complex themes of loyalty and disillusionment, and the specifically 20th century Kafka-esque relationship of an individual to the beaurocracies that determine his fate. But the real strength of the novel lies in its pure ability to entertain. Hall manages to maintain a level of tension and suspense worthy of comparison to any of espionage fiction's masterpieces, from The Spy Who Came in from the Cold to The Ipcress File. If some of the writing now seems cliche, that is because to a large extent THE QUILLER MEMORANDUM created the cliches. It has had hundreds of imitators both in print an on the screen since its publication, but anyone going back to the original (even thirty years later) will likely agree with the New York Times Book Review that &quot;no one writes better espionage than Adam Hall.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"Whether of not you've seen and enjoyed the movie version of \\"The Quiller Memorandum,\\" you are in for a rare treat. The novel is different, but in many ways even better than the film. Adam Hall's Quiller is a cold-eyed realist (colder, more introverted and more introspective than that played by George Segal) working for an unnamed and unacknowledged British agency in Cold War-era Berlin. Ordered to infiltrate and expose a ring of old and neo-Nazis, Quiller attempts methodically to probe the depths of a secret organization that is bent on resuscitating the Third Reich. This work is dangerous, and is made more so by the uncertain allegiances of some of the characters. Although the novel takes place twenty years after the end of World War II, it was still unclear where certain characters, even those in high government positions, stood.The detailed descriptions of Quiller's reasoning and analyses demonstrate the workings of the mind of a master spy. What makes Quiller so compelling is that while he is brilliant, he is flawed. Quiller makes mistakes, sometimes tragic ones, sometimes avoidable ones. I disagree with the view that the characters lack depth and are one-dimensional. Inga, for example, is as complicated a character as one is likely to see, for biographical and psychological reasons that are well-explained. Rothstein is not quite what he appears to be on the surface, either.But the true joy of this novel is its detailed descriptions of the \\"how\\" of spycraft -- how messages are transmitted; how they are received; how the emergency backup works; how one loses a tail; how one endures interrogation under pressure. The psychological reasons why certain characters behave as they do are also intriguing. Yes, the references to the \\"id\\" and the \\"ego\\" are a bit dated, but the kindergarten-level Freud-speak does not detract from the real mind games that the characters are playing here. Overall, \\"The Quiller Memorandum\\" is an outstanding spy novel that is one of the best of its genre."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"As a reader, I've always been fond of thriller, police and crime stories. They are often - undeservedly - considered a lesser genre, none the less they present an extraordinary opportunity to test logic skills, appraise different possibilities and sometimes also exercise in virtual history.The Quiller Memorandum is no exception.It has even a pedigree, as winner of the Edgar Allan Poe for Best Novel in 1966.Basically it is the story of a secret agent employed by the British intelligence in the '50s to track down former Nazi criminals hiding under respectable new identities, who comes to confront a dangerous German neo-Nazi secret association, the Phoenix, trying to regain power.Many of the situations described bring to mind \\"The Odessa File\\" by Forsythe and \\"Fatherland\\" by Robert Harris, and I guess that this novel has been an important inspiration - if not source - to both of them.None the less both \\"Fatherland\\" and \\"The Odessa File\\" are far more consistent and superior.I believe the book is a bit out of date to the modern reader and shows the marks of time: under some aspects it is a typical product of the late '60s, with its faltering hopes and gloomy expectations.The hero is James-Bondlike but not so successful and formidable, and neither so optimistic: unlike Bond he doesn't seem able to be able to control the outside world, while is an expert in self-control, that is psychoanalysis (there are some dull remarks about Es and Ego), mnemotechnics and psychology.There's pervasive pessimism in the usefulness of reason and logics and a suicide-like attitude in many of his actions (the mythological image used is the Greek tauromachia, the man who fight the bull with his bare hands) that is kind of self-destructive mysticism.His adversaries appear to be all-pervasive: they are ghostlike and always in advantage, but they too finish to act irrationally.Unlike classic thrillers, this is mostly the description of a nightmare. The scene is reduced at minimum (we know it happens in Berlin), the individuals are reduced to primeval pulsions (pure masochism in Inga, sadism in Oktober, multiple personalities in Zossen, revenge in Rothstein and so on), time can contract or expand according to the needs and logic may be faultless but of no use to forecast what will happen.With these cautions, the novel is still readable and can offer a few hours of interesting time offI hope my impressions may have been of help to you.You are truly welcome if you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"I liked \\"The Odessa File,\\" \\"Marathon Man,\\" and \\"Boys from Brazil,\\" but this beats them all. Quiller is a ruthless loner in the mold of the protagonist in \\"Eye of the Needle.\\" Unusually, in a book written before the age of political correctness, he refuses to carry a gun. His story is basically that of a man who finds himself in a dark tunnel, unarmed, knowing there are predators but not knowing who or where they are. The book has plenty of action but is basically an extended intellectual puzzle in which you must not only figure out the moves but who the actors are and whether they can be trusted. Since Quiller seems constitutionally inclined to trust no one, this unending procession of double- and triple-crosses suits him well, but even he is surprised by revelations about one of his friends.The book is dated, of course, and someone like Quiller could not win today by exactly the same methods as those in the book because of the development of technology, but the portrait of a man alone, who accepts his essential aloneness and is prepared to live or die by his wits is well drawn and a story to keep and hold the attention of the reader. It is very dark, and if Daniel Craig were not already playing Bond, I would suggest him for Quiller.Speaking of that, if you enjoy the book, do not make the mistake of watching the movie, whose producers seem to have misunderstood the book completely. George Segal was cast to play Quiller in the movie as a smirking, simpering pretty boy who resorted to flip comebacks and petulant retorts to make his way; his character had nothing to do with this book.Read the book instead and savor the story. It sets up a universe that is very bleak and stays with you a long time after you finish it."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"Quiller, the shadow executive for a British undercover agency is sent on a mission to Berlin that requires him to uncover the plans of Phoenix, a Nazi group. Quiller is beaten and battered but finally uncovers several planned exercises in terror. The novel is a synthesis of a James Bond novel with the best of Len Deighton. There is plenty of action for the Bond fan, but taut believable plots for the more serious spy aficionado. No supervillains, but a shadowy ominous realistic group of villains. Quiller Memorandum gives you the best of both worlds."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"Bravo Forge for reprinting this classic; I pray they have the rest of the Quilliad in their sights and mean to rectify the disgraceful lack of availability of this brilliant writer.What can one add about Quiller that isn't said in the rest of the reviews? Except that Amazon can now remove those gloomy references to 'Memo' being out of print.Let's hope this signals a revived interest, not just in the pseudonymous Hall canon but in the whole of Elleston Trevor's superb writing. A likely start will be the remake of 'Flight of the Phoenix', rumored to be gracing our screens this very autumn."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"You will be hard put to find any writer who can jack up your heart rate the way Adam Hall manages to in these relatively few pages. His story is a marvel of relentless pacing. With sentences that read something like Hemingway under the influence of bad speed - a steady drumbeat of monosyllables, phrase after short phrase linked by \\"and,\\" an economy of language - and a first-person voice that Hall maintains pitch-perfectly from start to finish, this book is one of the best-written thrillers ever. It doesn't resort to bloated descriptions of technical gadgets or exotic locales; nor is its protagonist a super-hero. (He is smarter than the average bear, and physically tougher, too, but believably so.) It does use the Nazi-comeback formula - imagine how many millions of paperbacks in how many hundreds of airports the ancient swastika image has helped to sell all these years! - but I imagine that in the early 1960s, it was actually one of the first books to explore this now-overused plotline.Hall's description of Quiller's foe-induced, near-psychotic drug experience is particularly gripping - I've looked repeatedly, and I still don't understand how he made this description so convincing that it would likely persuade any reader to just say no.I look forward to reading more in the Quiller series."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"For me, there are two British novelists of this genre that stand head and shoulders above the rest, and that is Adam Hall and Desmond Cory. Hall created the fictional spy hero Quiller, and Cory Johnny Fedora. Both deserved to win the accolades they won among the literary establishment, and both seem to be making a comeback through Kindle publications. I confess I read this book many years ago, but in finding it again and re-reading it, I probably enjoyed it more this time around. Anyone who likes british espionage and spy novels should read this one."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"I came to \\"The Quiller Memorandum\\" straight from John Le Carre's \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,\\" and that is more or less my only reference point since I'm generally new to the genre. \\"The Quiller Memorandum,\\" set in 1960's Berlin, puts the reader on a chase for ex- and neo-Nazis who have evaded justice and remained hidden in everyday German life. Hall lets Quiller take over most of the storytelling, and he frequently goes into detail when explaining to the reader how the tricks of the trade are implemented. This makes the reader feel like they're sitting at the dinner table with Quiller over after-dinner drinks while the former spy recounts tales of his time in the field, and the effect is satisfying.If Le Carre excels at setting a scene and drawing the reader right into the setting, Hall responds by creating colorful characters that you can imagine sitting right next to you as you read. More importantly, he allows the reader to \\"feel\\" the characters, allowing the reader to feel the same emotions and suspicions as Quiller when interacting with the novel's cast.A quick, entertaining read that is perfect for a Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"...this author did to the spy thriller--don't be put off by the number of pages, each is fast-paced and the writing style is both accessible as well as being completely original--with all the hoopla over Brosnan quitting the Bond series, Broccoli and co. could do no wrong using this character and series as a template--HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"The Quiller Memorandum","review":"Brainy and impassive Quiller in the strasses of suspicious Berlin.

The books gripping opening poem on the Civil War caught hold of me and I could not stop reading until I had travelled in the book several thousand miles and a few centuries later to Kyoto where a small gesture from a stranger brings this magical work to a stunning close. Relax, make yourself a cup of tea or coffee, and read this book. In a short while you will feel wonderfully enriched by the great spirits who inhabit these poems, the historical events that swirl through the pages, and the deep and elusive insights that suddenly snap into focus in odd places. Its one of those books that makes you want to buy all the other books an author has written. If his other works are half as good as this one I'll happily read them all."},{"Title":"When the Tiger Weeps","review":"Works are so numerous in this excellent volume that it is almost too imposing to write something specific enough to be helpful in a brief review. There are long poems, very short poems--translations and original work, and then prose pieces too. The artistry is of the highest order. Very helpful, is that if all these works were not organized well, \\"When the Tiger Weeps\\" would have a problem, but the book is not only of high quality, production wise, but organized in such a way that it \\"works\\" fine. It is organized in Books One and Two, the former hallmarked by \\"Orion's Sword\\", a long poem of the American Civil war. Long poems are the most difficult and challenging for a poet to manage, and O'Conner establishes himself as a literary artist in his highest, most mature form. \\"Orion's Sword\\" captures the cadence of military tragedy like few others I've read. Yet there are numerous shorter poems in both parts, and a list of standouts would be long. My favorite short poem in part one is \\"When the Blue Jay Goes to Bed\\", from the section on Ishi, the tragic native American, \\"the last of his kind\\". In part two it is \\"Words for XN\\". This poem is included in Mr. O'Connor's translations of diverse street poetry written anonymously during the Tienanmen Square protests. The epigram which opens this book--a quote from Bullfinch's Mythology-- seizes perfectly my feelings for this book and its poet: \\"Orpheus sang his complaints/to the rocks and the mountains/melting the hearts of tigers and/moving the oaks from their station."},{"Title":"People in Crisis: Clinical and Public Health Perspectives (Jossey-Bass Health)","review":"I used this book to supplement material in a graduate level Crisis Intervention class, and found it to be invaluable.

Very practical and readily applicable, the text lends a firm backbone to anyone working in the crisis management field for the first time, and even for old timers who have never felt quite comfortable with suicide, etc. Takes the guesswork out of understanding the issues behind the problem, and empowers the worker.

It is the untold history of the Korean War Artillery Forward Observer, told by the men themselves. From the earliest days of the war in 1950 through the harrowing battles of 1951 and on into the so-called \`stalemate' period of the hill battles of 1952 and 1953, into the final climactic battles before the cease fire, the Forward Observer, or FO, was there. Korea was and is known as the \`Artillery War' and it was the job of the FO to direct this artillery onto their targets. FOs are the eyes of the artillery, and the importance of their job in Korea has been largely overlooked until now. Serving as infantrymen, but not being considered one, Forward Observers lived, ate and slept on the front lines, ever ready to respond to an attack, or defend friendly troops and positions, and sometimes losing their lives doing it. The awesome responsibility and firepower that was placed on a 22 or 23 year-old lieutenant or sergeant was staggering, and after reading these first hand accounts, one can easily imagine what these young men faced on a daily basis. With over 100 interviews of Forward Observers, from all time periods and from all locations and battles of the war, the grittiness and reality of what these servicemen went through in the \`Forgotten War' is brought to life so that their deeds may be remembered for future generations, so the battlefield known as Korea and it's veterans will not be forgotten any more."},{"Title":"Fire For Effect!: Artillery Forward Observers in Korea","review":"Artillery is the killer of the battlefield. And the forward observers or FO's are what make it happen. The gunners can't see what they are shooting at. So up front, living in the dirt with infantry is the FO.One of the big advantages the US forces had in World War II was artillery. Yes, the German 88 mm dual purpose gun got most of the attention, but it was an anti-aircraft gun also used in the anti-tank role. The real killer is a lot of guns firing explosive ammunition, especially with proximity fuses, sometimes called Variable Time fuses, that make it go off in the air above the troops.After the start it received in World War II, the Army learned to let the big guns do as much work as they could. The Chinese entered the Korean War eventually, and what they learned as an army was the effectiveness of good artillery well served.This book is in the form of individual stories of young men charged with the responsibility of making the big guns effective. Their stories describe a part of the war not often told.Korea was a time in between, as I guess all wars are. Now the FO has much more sophisticated equipment in the form of laser range finders, laser designaters that make him even more effective.Fascinating Book."},{"Title":"Fire For Effect!: Artillery Forward Observers in Korea","review":"This book is an excellent read about a relatively unknown job during the Korean War. As in WWI and WWII, the artillery Forward Observer was the eyes and ears of the artillery battalion, but in Korea this job showed it's worth and set the standards for the legacy of what an FO can bring to the fight, now more than ever with Afghanistan and Iraq as our present conflicts. Over a hundred interviews of FOs from across the Korean peninsula from all time periods, this book gives the reader a great feel and appreciation for the role of artillery during the 'Forgotten War', seen through the eyes of those that delivered that artillery onto the target(s) before them. A good solid book that is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Fire For Effect!: Artillery Forward Observers in Korea","review":"This is an interesting and valuable book regarding a group of soldiers in the Korean War who contributed greatly to the success of UN troops, because of their ability to offest the preponderance of Communist ground forces in Korea by delivering precise artillery fire on these specific targets.

Each section shows the full alphabet of several typestyles and a few have illustrations and notes of how to draw them correctly. For a beginner they can be traced and transferred. Typefaces include the basics like simple italic, block and script styles, decorative versals, uncials and art deco Anna, fun ones like Party and elegant ones like ITC Vintage. There is a typeface for almost any project.A nearly endless array of projects can be enhanced with lettering and a wide range of typestyles are included here. My favorite projects include gilded glass coasters, an etched glass floating frame, botanical note cards, dotted gradient dessert plate and a raised Chinese character lampshade. All the projects are great and fairly easy to follow, but I was a bit disappointed that a full alphabet for my favorite typeface the author uses (stained glass) was not in the book.In the back there is great resource list.

The chapters are more a series of reflections than a discourse on Scottish history. Ascherson moves back and forth in time, dealing with such subjects as the Stone of Destiny, which was finally returned to its ancestral home after many years in the Royal Palace, ostensibly to deny Scotland any right to royal ascension. But, its course proves to be a very interesting one.Ascherson also looks at what Scotland's re-established nationhood means to Americans, including those with rather shaky connections, such as Trent Lott, who pushed through a resolution calling for Tartan Day in the United States in recognition of the 1320 Declaratin of Arbroath. Ascherson seems a bit puzzled why Americans would still so strongly identify themselves with Scotland, being so many generations removed.He also criticized the overt Scottish nationalism which has grown in recent years, at times reaching the point of shear madness. But, for the most part Ascherson looks at the more subtle aspects of Scottish independence, rooting them in history and mythology. It is a very engaging book and should rekindle your interest in Scotland's storied past."},{"Title":"Stone Voices: The Search for Scotland","review":"I thought this book had it all. A wonderful introduction to contemporary Scotland (as of 2002) that also has fascinating looks at nearly all the significant (and some forgotten) bits of Scottish history. The author is very erudite, it's true, for instance drawing interesting parallels with other parts of Europe. (He compares the bus tour he was on for the Yes campaign for a Scottish Parliament with the bus tour Gunter Grass organized for the SPD/Willy Brandt's 1965 election campaign, thereby giving the reader a bonus glimpse into German history.) I didn't find this book dry at all, I thought it was hugely entertaining. I don't think you need be all that knowledgeable about British politics to understand the points he is making. The author gives adequate background about everything and is not making assumptions about the readers' prior knowledge. (On the other hand, I remember a book by Ascherson about Eastern European politics that really was too dry for me to get through. Stone Voices isn't like that.) Very informative, thought provoking and nuanced look at a country that remains elusive, maybe even to its own inhabitants."},{"Title":"Stone Voices: The Search for Scotland","review":"I picked up &quot;Stone Voices&quot; to learn a little about what it is to &quot;be Scottish&quot; in modern times from Ascherson, a long-time political journalist who focuses on Scottish issues.Ascherson has some wonderful insights and deep understanding of his topic. For example, I really enjoyed his essay on &quot;when was Scotland&quot;--i.e., what period in history are people thinking of when they think of when Scotland was most itself, and how the answer to that question has changed over time. The &quot;highlandization&quot; of Scotland (the sense that it is all ruddy guys in kilts) is a related theme.A large percent of the volume is given over to a discussion of 'devolution' - the gradual decoupling of Scotland from Great Britain as a whole - including the recent establishment of a separate Scottish Parliament. This bit will be quite dry for most readers, and pretty difficult to understand if you don't already know a bit about British politics. Also, the essays as a whole meander a bit and don't have a real sense of direction.However, I got what I came for - an appreciation of what Scotland is really like &quot;now&quot; - from someone who knows."},{"Title":"Stone Voices: The Search for Scotland","review":"I have read, or attempted to read, several books of Scottish history over the past 40 years. \\"Stone Voices\\" is the first that really connected the threads of this confusing saga. I first borrowed this book from the local public library, then wanted a copy for my personal library. I was happy to find a \\"brand new\\" book at Amazon.The author has a remarkable understanding of the age old \\"personality\\" of the Scottish people, from Pictish times to the present. He deftly links historical events to Scottish decision-making today. For example, the very different attitude of the ancient Picts about choosing a king: This was a representative system, rather than a \\"divine right of kings\\" kingship. He talks about the Declaration of Arbroath, a letter from the Scottish nobles to the Pope in Rome in 1320, during the kingship of Robert the Bruce. Practically unknown in the US, it served as a model for our Declaration of Independence. The ancient political system in Pictland likely formed the basis for governance in the Presbyterian Church and the US Constitution.This is a must buy for Scotophiles."},{"Title":"Stone Voices: The Search for Scotland","review":"Another eminently readable work by this author, this time returning to his own homeland, Scotland, whose history, Ascherson says is like a \\"huge, reeking tip of unsorted rubbish across which scavengers wander, pulling off interesting fragments which might fetch a price or come in handy\\".This is not a formal \\"history\\" of Scotland, no chronologic exploring of kings or themes, more an exploration of that mysterious \\"Scottishness\\" and the fierce pride and sense of place that finally led to the enactment of a British Home Rule law that created a Scottish Parliament so that \\"this proud country could rule its own affairs\\". Ascherson does not venture too deeply into how much this ambition has been achieved or how it could be supported without the overall security and infrastructure of a parent - plus of course, like the creation of all of the new wave of \\"independent\\" countries from regional aspirations, just a little more taxes. Politically active always in the pursuit of Scotland's \\"fredome\\" Ascherson credits two events for the final concession from Westminster - the Scots youth fascination with Mel Gibson's populist portrayal of William Wallace in \\"Braveheart\\" -\\" a hairy Hollywood distortion\\" and the death of Princess Diana. The crisis of the monarchy in England after this death led to a surprising resurging of ENGLISH nationalism. This, Ascherson argues, engendered a sympathy for Scotland's (and Welsh) autonomy, causing a turn-over of the long, political denial that finally led to the granting of some measure of the equally long-held need for independence.The voices of the stones the author hears are from rocks, mounts, monuments and walls of the Scottish landscapes, rocks, he says, that are as open to the Scots as the \\"throat of singing birds\\". That land is so hard and scarred by man that \\"Scotland is like 'a poor woman with little flesh between her skin and bones' who carries the scars of many years' use.Och aye, but she's bonny still."},{"Title":"The origin and development of the Bengali language,","review":"Suniti Kumar Chatterji was the founder of the modern study of Bengali. This book, a revised version of his University of London doctoral dissertation, remains the standard work on the history of Bengali. Although it focusses on standard Bengali, it is in many ways a history of the entire Magadhan group of languages, which includes Assamese and Oriya as well as smaller languages sometimes regarded as dialects of Bengali, such as Sylheti and Chakma.The comprehensiveness of the work is almost overwhelming. It begins with a survey of the linguistic situation in South Asia and the Aryanization of India, moves to the earliest known stages of Sanskrit, and works forward from there. Along the way it discusses foreign influences as they arise, such as that of Persian as a result of the Muslim invasions and later those of Portuguese and English.Typically for a work of this period, it is confined to phonology and morphology. It discusses syntax only in those few places where a syntactic point arises from the discussion of the morphology. It is also typical of its time in its lack of explicit recognition of the phonemic principle.In the main text forms cited are given both in the original script (usually Bengali, but occasionally something else, such as Devanagari or Perso-Arabic) and in romanization. The only index, however, is a length index of Bengali words cited, which is only in Bengali script. A very detailed table of contents makes up to some extent for the lack of a topical index.The book is not for the casual reader as it consists of over 1,000 pages of mostly dense, technical, material, packed with examples, paradigms, and sound changes. Some background in historical linguistics and Indo-Aryan languages is necessary, and even for the reader thus equipped, it is not easy going. For the reader with a serious interest in the history of Bengali, however, it is absolutely essential."},{"Title":"The Sphinx and the Rainbow: Brain, Mind, and Future Vision","review":"Talks about theories on the mind foreseeing the future.

I have read the Canadian/UK edition, which is called &quot;A Little Love Song&quot;. While the story seems to be very much the same, in &quot;A Little Love Song&quot;, there are only two sisters, Diana and Rose. While UK/Canadian editions often have different titles, it is unusual for entire characters to be added/removed.Michelle Magorian's books all seem to be set during or just after the second world war. This is a period that may not appeal to younger children, but for older teens and adults, these books are wonderful stories. While the plots often sound rather lame, the charcters and language mean that the novels are enjoyable, humourous, touching, or exciting. &quot;A Little Love Song&quot;/&quot;Not a Swan&quot; is a coming of age story, and deals with first love, sexual awakening, and sibling rivalry, along with many other human emotions that will be familiar to many of us.If you enjoyed this one, look for &quot;Cuckoo in the Nest&quot; also by Michelle Magorian. It tells the story of a working class boy who wants to become an actor, and his relationship with his father, who doesn't approve. While it doesn't appear on Amazon.com right now, it is a new title, and is available in Canada and the UK (also through amazon.co.uk)."},{"Title":"Not a Swan","review":"THE ONLY RESON I REALLY LIKE THIS BOOK IS CAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY BOOK I'V TRULY NEVER PUT DOWN I DID CRY I SURE AS HELL LAUGHED SO MANY EMOTIONS WERE INVOLVED AND I WAS ONLY 13 HAVING FELT SO MOVED BY MS.

The pictures add a lot of zest to the story."},{"Title":"The anxious bench","review":"Here's the myth: Roman Catholicism invents the idea that the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper actually conveys grace. This eventually becomes the superstition of Transubstantiation. Then Luther and Calvin rise up and liberate the masses from such belief in magic. Luther never quite liberates himself, but Calvin gives us Luther's justification by faith undergirded by nothing more than hard-core predestinarianism. The sacraments are simply symbols, pictures, and/or dramatizations of a spiritual truth designed to bring it into the participant's remembrance.Nevin's _The Mystical Presence: A Vindication of the Reformed or Calvinistic Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist_ was a reality check for American Evangelicalism. He demonstrated that the assumption of American &quot;puritans&quot; that their heritage came from sixteenth-century Geneva was purely a delusion. Calvin believed and taught repeatedly and emphatically that believers truly partook of Christ's flesh and blood in the Lord's Supper. The idea that the Eucharist was merely a symbol was a complete abomination in Calvin's eyes.Nevin's makes his case masterfully. He quotes copiously from Calvin to show that His view of the real presence of Christ in the rite was not an obsure part of his teaching but an essential componant of his theology. He also explains how Calvin's view of the Eucharist was essential to his soteriology. For Calvin, a person is not saved from the wrath of God simply because God imputes &quot;in a merely outward way&quot; Christ's righteousness to him. A person is saved because he is incorporated into Christ's human body so that he is more intimately bound to Christ than a branch to a tree, a member of a body to his head, or a human to Adam. Only those united to Christ in this way by the power of the Holy Spirit can benefit from Christ's righteousness, having it imputed to them as His glorified human life is imparted to them.The Lord's Supper, says Nevin, according to Calvin and the other sixteenth-century Reformers, renews and strengthens this union. We are truly given Christ's human body by the Holy Spirit when we partake of the Sacrament. Anything less would not be sufficient for our salvation and sanctification.Nevin carefully distinguishes Calvin's view not only from the socinians and other rationalists, but from that of traditional Lutherans and Roman Catholics. Regarding the former, Nevin must have made his contemporary Evangelical readers wince when he pointed out that their view was identical to that of unitarians and other liberals of the day. On the other hand, unlike tran- and consubstantiation, Calvin's view did not allow for actual material particles to be locally present in the elements or to pass into the bodies of partakers.Probably one of the most difficult aspects of Calvin's view was his insistence on a real participation in Christ's flesh and blood without any matter being transported into the participant. Thus, Nevin's attempt to formulate and improve on Calvin's explanation is perhaps one of the most valuable aspects of the book. Nevin make the rather obvious but head-aching comment that a physical organism does not consist in particular physical particles! Living human beings pass out and ingest new particles all the time. Our human body is actually a &quot;law&quot; or &quot;force&quot; which must have matter to exist but is not identical with it. An acorn is considered identical to the oak tree which grows from it, but the oak tree is exponentially more massive and probably does not possess one material particle in common with the acorn from which it originated. By these analogies Nevin clears away the conceptual difficulties which make Calvin's view hard to believe. It would do no good if mere dead particles from Christ's flesh were transported into us. What we need is Christ's life. By the power of the Holy Spirit, Christ's resurrected, glorified, human life is given to us so that we become sharers in it.There is much else of value in Nevin's work, more than I can recite from memory as I punch out this brief review. Perhaps the most questionable portion of Nevin's work is his exegesis. There he makes statements about the incarnation which are hard to makes sense of. On the other hand, the texts he uses are very similar to those used by Richard Gaffin in _Resurrection &amp; Redemption: A Study in Pauline Soteriology_. In other words, Nevin was a century ahead of the cutting edge of conservative Reformed scholarship. The difference is that Gaffin concentrates on the Resurrected humanity of Christ, instead of the &quot;theanthropic person&quot; which concerns Nevin almost exclusively and in my opinion leads to some difficulties.Anyone claiming to be Evangelical and/or Reformed needs to read this book. There is simply nothing else like it. You will never be the same again.Mark Horne"},{"Title":"The Mirror of the Sea","review":"When Conrad was struggling with the writing of big fat novels like Nostromo or Razumov (Under Western Eyes), he was suffering. Writing was torture. He needed an escape mechanism, and he also needed money. This edition unites the 2 products of that double motive. The first is a collection of essays about the sea, the second a short autobiographic walkabout.I like A Personal Record a lot better than The Mirror of the Sea.With Conrad, fiction beats non-fiction.An amazon friend's review of a Gide essay collection recently was entitled \`non fiction beats fiction'. (Gide was Conrad's French friend in the literary world.)My opinion on Conrad is: while Gide's fiction may have sunk with time, and his essays may still be floating, with Conrad it is the other way round. His sea fiction has enormous buoyancy, while his essays have a certain leaden quality.During his struggle with Nostromo, in 1904/5, Conrad wrote, on the side, and by dictation at night (I am wondering about the opportunities involved in that), a series of sketches of autobiographical nature. They were all published separately in newspapers and magazines, and then collectively as The Mirror of the Sea.The book was a critical success, but it has been shown that it was unreliable as a biographical source. Conrad made things up and misrepresented facts. Which proves my point, he was a fiction writer.The book is a lament of the lost culture of the sailing ship, and at the same time of a closed chapter of his own life. He had quit the sea for the life of a writer on land, and it was a hard life, the writing.JC says in his own introduction: I have attempted here to lay bare ... the terms of my relation with the sea. ... for twenty years I have lived like a hermit with my passion! ...Within these pages I make a full confession not of my sins but of my emotions.So, he goes and writes, at times entertainingly, about landfalls and departures, anchors and wrong language (casting!), drinking captains and presumptuous mates, storms, pleasure sailing, the ethics of craftsmanship, ships in calamity (overdue, missing, stranded, lost), the near mystic relation between man and ship (a she!), between man and nature, about river estuaries, ports, docks, about Nelson and Trafalgar and about some stories from his youth... This is an easy process for Conrad, compared to the hard labor of his fiction. The writing did not require his usual meticulous composition; the voice is that of a TV documentary host. The texts are assembled without subtitles, and in a sequence which is different from the publishing chronology.Is it worth it? For me and for other members of the fan club, sure. For aficionados of the subject, i.e. ships and the sea, certainly. For others, hardly.Now the Personal Record is another matter entirely. JC wrote it for his soon to be former friend F.M.Ford, who wanted to start a new magazine and publish literary autobiographies. JC's text focuses mainly on two subjects: his escape from Poland for the sea, which meant moving to the West, and his escape from the sea for writing as a living. Interestingly, he denies explicitly that the question why he chose to write in English is a legitimate question at all. After all, what else could he have done?We follow different episodes involving the growth of Almayer's Folly, his first novel. We follow JC on a visit to Poland to his relatives and hear a lot about the family history back to Napoleon and about the uncle, who had adopted JC when his parents had died.Why did he \`run away' to the sea after all? He was a reader from childhood on. He likens his escape to the exodus of Don Qijote from his village in La Mancha: the romance of adventure.Now, honestly, does that amount to a \`Personal Record'? Critics at the time were annoyed. Not only was the text absolutely no record of anything, rather a rambling discourse which jumps through chronos like we love it from Conrad's fiction. Well, some of us do. I do.Conrad anticipated some opposition. He quotes Marcus Aurelius asking for heroic truth. He makes a categorical statement: JC's truth is more of the humble kind.And anyway, another quote, now from Novalis (not so beloved by me): I will believe myself as soon as I find somebody else who believes me. (Maybe that's less a quote than a free interpretation.)As I said, Conrad was great at fiction, his fiction beats his non-fiction hands down. Lucky for us, he was no fanatic of bare facts."},{"Title":"Impact: Short Stories for Pleasure","review":"A marvelous collection of short stories; some humorous, some very dark.

The book is part memoire, part reflection on capital punishment. It's rational and fairminded, but very short (barely 120 pages)and very light on legal analysis or social science.Its core rhetorical strategy is to consider a few actual death penalty cases that plunge the reader into the pain and moral ambiguities of capital punishment. On the one hand, these horrific crimes cry out for vengeance. It's difficult to imagine a 10-year old girl being raped, tortured and strangled without wanting to string up the perpetrator. And yet...there's no evidence that the death penalty deters murder. The killers themselves are badly broken beings, victims of child abuse or mental retardation. Innocent men are sometimes sentenced to death: when a grisly crime is committed, juries are eager to convict someone (anyone), and some cops and prosecutors are willing to cut corners. And the whole death penalty system is arbitrary and biased against non-whites: the evidence shows that juries value the lives of white victims more than the lives of non-white victims. It's a wretched human landscape.Unfortunately, Turow's potted case summaries are too rushed and underanalyzed to really do justice to the subject. The book feels like a long magazine article. In the end, he decided that he is against the death penalty. That's an understandable position but it was no excuse for not writing a longer, more serious book.Memory Lane: I worked briefly as a deputy district attorney in California in the mid-1980s after I graduated from law school. Every ambitious young deputy aspired to put a \\"bad guy\\" in the gas chamber someday -- this was the ultimate box to check in a prosecutorial career. We rookies were encouraged to observe an ongoing capital case. The lead prosecutor was an ex-Marine and Vietnam vet, an uptight, creepy guy who tried to impress women by telling stories about killing Viet Cong. The details of the crime were revolting -- the defendant, a security guard, had bludgeoned a young woman to death and then violated her corpse. Until then I had been moderately pro-death penalty. But sitting in the courtoom only a few feet from the defendant, it was inconceivable to me that he should be put to death, no matter what he had done. His life seemed sacred. I was happy to quit that job."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"A quick read yet very throrough analysis of the death penalty.

It is fascinating to trace Turow's own education on the subject. You won't look at this issue as black and white again. However, there is one subtle flaw--Eddie Murphy did not play Alex Foley in 48 Hours as Turow claims--it was in Beverly Hills Cop that Alex Foley was found. Simple error, but certainly a reversible one."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Being a death penalty agnostic I was pushed to the pro-capital punishment side of the aisle by Mr. Turow's book. He uses the wrongly convicted and prosecution malfeasance as his main reasons for opposing the death penalty.The criminals that Mr. Turow choses to highlight are for the most part deserving of termination. The fact that one criminal in a group murder gets the death penalty while others in the group get 45 years is not a reason to say the death penalty is used inappropriately. All of the criminals in the group who participated in a crime where death of the victim was caused should be given death. I was very disappointed in the way defendants of capital crimes were referred to as \\"Henry\\" or \\"Chris\\" by Mr. Turow. Sympathy for defendants in a controlled environment was ill founded. Advocating proper and intelligent prosecution and investigation of crimes would be a better cause for Mr. Turow.Mr. Turow is not a death penalty agnostic. He is clearly on the side of anti-captial punishment and trying to appear objective by saying he \\"would push the button on John Wayne Gacey does not fool me."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"\\"Death Penalty....Eh\\"Spare yourself reading this book, because well, the above phrase is its basic premise. The book bills itself as an unbiased look at the death penalty by a lawyer with first hand experience, when in reality it reads like a brainstorm of ideas without a conclusive stance by an author who appears to be writing for the purpose of fulfilling some contractual obligation. Let me summarize that: THIS BOOK IS POINTLESS.First of its 166 pages, only a hundred or so of it is the actual book. An entire third of the book is the transcript of an unreadable report given to Governor Ryan of Illinois. That would be like writing a book on Sept. 11 but then including the 9/11 report as filler for the back half. Don't forget that every third paragraph seems to mention the fact that the man helped write the report either.Speaking of George Ryan, the man is revered by the author of this book, despite the fact that he was basically run out of office due to his scandal plagued term of office. I'm not saying that being part of a scandal voids every ounce of your credibility, but to be lectured on this man's moral achievements is like hearing about President Clinton's contribution to the re-strengthening of public trust in governmental office.But let's get to the actual writing itself. You won't learn a thing reading this book. Why? Because it lacks decisiveness and clarity. \\"I disagree with using the death penalty as revenge; however, I don't agree that the death penalty itself is innately vengeful\\" Yeah, well thanks for clearing things up. One chapter supports capital punishment, while the subsequent following three work to disparage District Attorneys and Judges who use it.Basically, the book ends without contributing a single thing to the death penalty debate. It is, at best, a summary of arguments for both sides without any original analysis of either. The only saving grace of the book is, in fact, its shortness in length. If it were much longer, you would no doubt bill the author for wasting your time."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Turow opposes capital punishment. He teases the reader so much in the first few chapters about \\"do I?\\" or \\"dont I?\\" that you quickly get the idea he opposes it. And the last chapter confirms your suspicion.His chief objection to capital punishment is lawyers. Capital murder cases mean more than life or death to prosecutors and defense counsel; death cases are the ticket to financial wealth and political influence for the lawyers. And while he feels bad that monsters will escape the hangman if capital punishment is abolished, to frolic in prison, mocking the system and everyone, what can you do?What you can do is make the stakes a whole lot more important to lawyers. And you do this by dis-barring them if they get it wrong and hang the wrong guy. Ditto for defense counsel; if they set the guilty free you dis-barr them, too. Make both sides really interested in getting at the truth.More importantly, capital punishment dampens the requirement for lynchings. I study lynchings. The American People are very impatient with lawyers and a judicial system that conspires to abort justice in heinous felony cases. Probably the worst example of this conspiracy occurred in 1927 Tampa when a common laborer murdered 5 people with an axe, then 4 more people with a hammer. All of them while they slept. The murderer had no money and gets a former Supreme Court Associate Justice to defend him. The governor activates the National Guard to protect the guy, and the NG kills 3 people near the jail. And the appeals go on forever. The People wanted this monster dead!Because common people understand that unless you kill a monster, some lawyer-fool is likely to set the monster free. And the courts are full of fools. So capital punishment lessens the enthusiasm for lynchings. Turow doesnt get it, of course."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Not a bad read...pretty good really.

That would then have been a good choice decision, and I congratulate you for taking it.Well done."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"While more of a hard-cover pamphlet or essay than a book, Scott Turow's \\"Ultimate Punishment\\" is a good look at the key issues involving capital punishment in the United States. The book is drawn from Turow's experience on a commission created in 2000 to review capital punishment in Illinois, a state that clearly had problems and inconsistencies in its use of the death penalty. This commission indirectly lead to Gov. Ryan staying the excecutions of 167 prisoners on death row in 2003. The book's brevity serves Turow well, in that he doesn't get bogged down in certain narrow arguments (particularly concerning statistics related to deterrence) relevant to the debate. Further, there is no moral grand standing. He takes the concerns of both sides in earnest, but eventually comes to believe that the death penalty should cease to exist. He writes and argues clearly and convincingly for his position, I think a great number of Americans will agree with him. Turow believes that eventually the United States will do away with capital punishment. His book marks a further step in that direction."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Scott Turow was one of 14 members of a Commission named by the then Governor of Illinois, George Ryan to study and make recommendations on the state's death penalty law. This book is a result of that study. Turow discusses the usual arguments for and against this ultimate penalty. Some of his findings conclusions are expected; others were surprising, at least to me. The usual conclusions are here-- the vast majority of individuals convicted of crimes are guilty. Whether you get the death penalty or not depends on where you live. You are much more likely to get the death penalty in rural areas than in large urban areas. To quote Turow, other factors are \\". . . race, gender, geography, who the lawyers and jurors are, and the sheer serendipity of circumstances. . .\\" Some people are guilty of the crime of having the wrong defense lawyers, and, of course, of being poor. Turow discusses the case of Chris Thomas, a death row inmate, who had been defended by two private attorneys under contract with the local public defender's office that paid them $30,000 per year to defend 103 cases, one of which had to be a capital case. The two attorneys worked together on Thomas' case. One of them had never had any role in a death penalty case; the other had been standby counsel for a defendant, already under a death sentence in Ohio, who had represented himself. The attorneys therefore mounted a six hundred dollar defense for their client. I had always thought that black people are more likely to get the death penalty than whites. Not so, according to Turow; black people just get convicted more. In Illinois 70% of all persons convicted and sentence for first-degree murder are black; their victims have been 60% black. Once convicted, however, white murderers are sentenced to death at a rate two and one half times that for black murderers. Turow's conclusion is that white people tend to kill other whites and that \\"choosing a white victim--turns out to be the controlling variable.\\" Turow also points out though that because wealth, power and status for the most part still is in the hands of white people, that race of course is a factor.Some of Turow's chapters are \\"Convicting the Innocent\\",\\"Bad Faith\\", \\"The Victims\\",\\"Deterrence\\", \\"Redemption\\", \\"Will They Murder Again.\\" I was blown away to learn that some death penalty advocates can live with the notion of occasionally executing the innocent and make the comparison of childhood inoculations and driving an automobile. The overall good outweighs the risks. Turow disagrees with this logic, saying that the prospect of executing someone who is \\"blameless cases a special pall over the death penalty.\\" Turow discusses with great compassion the plight of victims' families and loved ones. \\"What made the deepest impression on me was my eventual recognition that losing a loved one to a murder is unlike any other blow delivered in our often-cruel lives.\\" He concludes, however, that the expressed desires of survivors should not be permitted in deciding who gets the death penalty.Turow, who described himself as a \\"death penalty agnostic\\" when he began this study ultimately became a believer against the death penalty although he respects the judgment of the greater number of U. S. citizens who believe the death penalty should be given for the most horrific of crimes. Turow's conversion certainly came not for religious reasons. Unlike Sister Helen Prejean, he maintains if his job called for it, he could \\"push the botton\\" if the crime were heinous enough. Even though Turow comes down ultimately against the death penalty, he says \\"I admit I am still attracted to a death penalty that would be available for the crimes of unimaginable dimensions. . . The pivotal question. . . is whether a system of justice can be constructed that reaches over the rare, right cases, without also occasionally condemning the innocent or the undeserving.\\" It is Turow's belief that the answer to that question is \\"no.\\"As you would expect from someone who is also a novelist, Turow writes with a great deal of flair in this insightful, well-reasoned book. Whether it will change anyone's opinion, who's to say? Everybody has opinions on abortion, gun control, gay marriage, the death penalty, etc. although people cannot express any logical reason their their views. Regardless of whether this book changes the way you think about the death penalty, you will come away from it better informed and should have an opinion you can back up with facts."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Excellent, excellent book. Essential, even.Everyone should read it.See, because my own views on the topic were very... elementary. And the topic itself is anything but elementary. The issue of capital punishment is not easily dealt with, it is not rudimentary. It is very intricate. It's convoluted.It's a matter of life. And death.It is ignorance to say, \\"I believe in it\\" or \\"I don't believe in it\\" without examining what is involved in choosing either decision. And here are 125 pages that are a great introduction into the matter.Turow, a respected criminal lawyer [and bestselling author of crime-novels] was one of fourteen experts Governor George Ryan of Illinois appointed to serve on his Commission on Capital Punishment. While in office as governor, Ryan declared a moratorium on executions in the state. In March of the year 2000, realizing that abolition was not a current valid option, Ryan posed the following question to the Committee:What reforms, if any, would make application of the death penalty in Illinois fair, just, and accurate?Wow!How's that for a homework assignment, huh kids?For 24 months this Committee researched and deliberated, utilizing their combined years of experience and expertise to finally offer [in April of 2002] an impressive list of proposals for reform of the current system as applied to the state of Illinois.Reading this book, one gets a sense of the arduous journey that is necessary in coming to any sort of reasonable expression of how we may humanly [not to mention, humanely] accomplish the inexpressible... the legalization of the taking of life.All of that journey, not just a portion of it, is uphill.And all of it is never-ending.Turow [convincingly, in my opinion] argues that capital punishment and the promise of due process of law are incompatible, and concludes by saying that if he were asked on a ballot whether Illinois should retain capital punishment, would put his \\"X\\" on \\"No.\\"Read this book, and then sincerely ask yourself, if you would not do likewise.All I know is that It has profoundly altered the way I have formerly thought about this impossible-to-exaggerate dilemma of our time."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"This book is a good review of what should be done to someone who commits murder.While there are many choices that have been used over the centuries;this book zeros in on the option of the death penalty.All the reasons for and against using the death penalty are presented; but in only brief detail.Turow shows that the pronouncement and application of the ultimate punishment has been so inconsistant for a variety of reasons ,that there is some logic in elimination of it.It seems that no matter how much the issue is studied that people will continue to have their own agendae,convictions and reasons to be for and againstit.At one end of the spectrum are those who feel that criminals are not responsible for their actions,it's because of what society has done to them.This is the old victimization theory.\\"When something goes wrong,it's somebody's fault,not mine.\\" At the other end of the spectrum is the idea that people have a free will and they are responsible for their actions,not somebody else.So,the issue that is really at hand is not the Death Penalty ,but what to do with the criminals and how to protect those who live responsible lives from those who have no respect foe life.It would seem that an alternative to the death penalty would be to remove those convicted of henious crimes from society for good.You have to agree that the death penalty,with all its issues does that in spades. What would be a solution would be if those convicted never got released.If most people who support the death penalty really believed that that was really going to happenr that isn't going to happen,then their support for the death penalty would disappear.Here in Canada a \\"life term\\" ends up being something like 7 years.Canada no longer uses the death penalty,but turning murderers loose is not the answer --especially for the victims and society."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Scott Turow delivers yet another great read. This book gives you an insight into our so called Justice System, its a MUST READ for anyone who is pro or anti-death penalty."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Scott Turow is an attorney who served as one of the fourteen members of the Commission appointed in March, 2000, by Illinois Governor George Ryan to consider reform of the capital punishment system. In his deliberations on the Commission, and with deep refection, Mr. Turow has come to the conclusion that capital punishment does not serve society well, mainly because ultimate punishment demands infallible decisions----perfection----something we as human beings cannot deliver, resulting in the execution of innocent people. In 2010 there were 3,260 people on death row nationwide; if our judicial system was 99% perfect in its capital punishment decisions would mean there are 32 innocent people who will die.Scott Turow writes, \\"I admit I am still attracted to a death penalty that would be available for the crimes of unimaginable dimensions like Gacy's, or that would fully eliminate the marginal risks that incorrigible monsters like Brisbon might ever again satisfy their vampire appetites. But if my time on the Commission taught me one lesson, it was that I was approaching the question of capital punishment the wrong way. There will always be cases that cry out for the ultimate punishment. That is not the true issue. The pivotal question instead is whether a system of justice can be constructed that reaches only the rare, right cases, without also occasionally condemning the innocent or undeserving.\\"If you are struggling with the issue of capital punishment, this book will help you attain a much better insight in which to arrive at a decision. Turow writes with eloquence and a profound sense of compassion for the family members who have suffered the loss of a loved one at the hands of murderers with \\"vampire appetites.\\"As the only civilized country that still embraces the death penalty, this book is a must read. \\"[W]hen Senator Simon called upon us all to offer a definitive judgment on the death penalty, a number of my fellow commissioners revised their positions. But I appear to have finally come to rest on the issue. Today, I would still do as I did when Paul Simon asked whether Illinois should retain capital punishment. I voted no.\\"Scott Turow is the author of nine best-selling works of fiction, and two non-fiction. They have won a number of literary awards, including the Heartland Prize in 2003, the Robert F.

He uses examples, rational thought, and very logical arguments. I urge all judges, lawyers, and policy makers to read it. If you do not fit into one of these categories, then you as a citizen of the world must read it and then have the policy makers listen to you.

A quick, easy, and thoughtful read."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"I have been a fan of Scott Turow's fiction for a number of years. So, when I was asked to read and review his latest work, a nonfiction book dealing with one of the most controversial topics in America today, that of capital punishment, I eagerly anticipated the opportunity to find out what this bestselling author-lawyer had to say on the subject. I was not disappointed. Turow's very short treatise on the \\"ultimate punishment\\" (only about 120 pages of actual discussion) immediately brings the controversy into focus and lays out the arguments on both sides of the issue.Admitting that initially he was an \\"agnostic\\" regarding the death penalty, Turow was appointed to serve on the Illinois Commission on Capital Punishment by then-Governor George Ryan, who had declared a moratorium on further executions in Illinois on January 31, 2000, a decision that was heavily criticized by many both in his own state and also nationwide. Ryan's justification for his action was that the Illinois' capital justice system was \\"fraught with error.\\" Shortly after he issued the moratorium, Governor Ryan put together a fourteen-member Commission to look into the matter of reforming the system. Former prosecutor and now-defense attorney Scott Turow has used his experience serving on the Commission to examine the very serious debate over the death penalty in \\"Ultimate Punishment.\\"Turow's examination of capital punishment is not merely theoretical. He has been directly involved in death penalty cases, including successfully representing two different individuals convicted in death-penalty prosecutions. In other words, he can speak from practical experience and not just from the ivory tower of academic debate. Along the way, the reader will get a brief overview of the history of the capital punishment debate in America as well as insights into the pros and cons that have divided those in favor of the death penalty and those opposed to it. To his credit, I found Turow to be profoundly fair in his analysis of both sides of the argument.One senses in this book that for the author this has been a very personal quest for wisdom regarding the matter of capital punishment. One can sense a continuing wrestling with the issue over a lengthy period of time. This book seems to be no \\"rush to judgment\\" on the part of Scott Turow. His writing at times is very introspective and at points, one might say, it is a clinical study in self-analysis involving very private ethical conflicts over a matter of supreme importance. He discusses the ordinary elements in the debate -- conviction of the innocent, deterrence, recidivism, and redemption -- but he also pays attention to the victims and their concerns, and how these concerns should be addressed in the calculus of the debate.The death penalty as a form of punishment is not a subject one should take lightly. For decades, I have publicly debated the issue, written about it, and agonized over my position regarding it. Ultimately, I decided that capital punishment as a punitive practice should be discarded by society, not because it was cruel and unusual, and not because it didn't really deter, but simply because, since the right to life as a natural right is not derived from the State, the State had no right to take a human life. While Turow does not address the natural right argument in his book, he does discuss one aspect of the controversy to which I had not in the past given serious thought, namely the matter of \\"moral proportion\\" or \\"moral order.\\" If nothing else, I thank him for bringing this matter to my attention for further thought.After the Commission finished its task of investigation and discussion, Turow says in the final pages of the text, \\"when...called upon...to offer a definitive judgment on the death penalty, a number of my fellow commissioners revised their positions. But I appear to have finally come to rest on the issue. Today, I would still do as I did when...asked whether Illinois should retain capital punishment.\\" How did novelist-lawyer Scott Turow vote on the issue? Well, you'll just have to read the book to find out. I'm not going to tell you.At the end of the book, Turow includes a copy of the Preamble to the Report of the Illinois Governor's Commission on Capital Punishment, issued in April of 2002, with the suggested recommendations of the Commission. If capital punishment is to remain the policy of the day, then the recommendations made by the Commission demand everyone's attention, no matter what state they reside in, simply because the ultimate punishment, if it is to be fairly and rationally applied, needs to meet the highest standards of justice possible. Also, for those who want to go beyond Turow's brief discussion of the subject, the book includes thirty-eight pages of notes with citations to legal cases and text references, many of them available on the Internet.In summary, this is a book to be recommended to all Americans because the issue is timely and very important. Turow has made a significant contribution to the subject of criminal justice and he is to be commended on his sober and impartial presentation."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"I am not the type to offer a verbose review. Suffice it to say that this is an exceptional work of non-fiction that offers arguably the most balanced view to date of the U.S. system of capital punishment. I am a reformed death penalty proponent who went through a period of Turow-esque \\"agnosticism\\" before settling firmly on the side of opposition. I am no longer ambivalent. The death penalty should be abolished--period. Though Turow's book had no effect on my change, it did help solidify my current stance. This book should be required reading in any course of study dealing with the criminal justice system, and I do plan to use it in the future in the college criminal justice courses that I teach, along with Scheck, Neufeld, and Dwyer's \\"Actual Innocence.\\" Perhaps the powers that be will eventually wake up and smell the stench of injustice . . . but I'm not holding my breath. . . ."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Rendered with his fictional writing flair, Turow has tackled a subject matter that literarily deals with life and death. In this short though thorough essay, the novelist reflects on the many arguments surrounding the death penalty. In March 2000, a Moratorium on executions was declared by the then Governor of Illinois, George Ryan. Turow, along with many distinguished lawyers and academics, after two years of deliberation, submitted their recommendations. As a result of these findings, Ryan made international news by commuting the sentences of 167 persons left on death row. (This made headline news in Australia as the death penalty here was abolished over forty years ago) It should go without saying that this was a bold move by the Governor and potential political suicide. However he was at the end of his tenure and decided to make a choice and act on that choice. This book summarizes the many aspects of the Moratorium's deliberations, which makes fascinating reading.Before the Moratorium, Turow admits that he was a \\"Death Penalty Agnostic\\". In other words, the man was a fence sitter, refusing to make a stand either way. However, after two years on the committee, and by the end of the essay, if asked whether Illinois should retain Capital Punishment, his answer is a certain, no. After reading the many reasons for and against the debate, I found it understandable why he fell off the fence. That the system is fallible and the fact that, for the most part, we seem to be hard wired for revenge, it has been all too easy, in our zealousness for justice or retribution, to execute innocent people. This has occurred far too many times for any government to be comfortable executing its citizens. But of course, as Turow plainly points out, this issue is a complex one, which begs to be further unpacked, potently analysed, in order to make it law, either way, across the boards.From my reading, the actual recommendations from the committee are reasonable and fair. For example, ensuring the videotaping of all questioning of a capital suspect conducted on a police facility; that the eligibility criteria for the death penalty is narrowed to five points; that the death penalty is not available when a conviction is based only on the testimony of a single eyewitness. (p. 122) The Moratorium did not want the death penalty abolished entirely, however, these recommendations are designed to ensure an innocent defendant stands a lesser chance of wrongful execution.Turow writes great novels about the law. In this case, he has approached a subject that absolutely requires further debate. And he has done it with honesty and enthusiasm with a novelist's flair and elegance. Good reading."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Scott Turow shows us the illogicality of the death penalty by telling of his own experiences as both a prosecutor and as a member of a task force assembled to inform the governor of Illinois on death penalty policy. Contrary to what many people may think, the book does not condemn the death penalty for moral reasons but on the basis of the ambiguity with which it is exercised in America. It would be too absolutist to say every American should read this book, so I will limit it only to those Americans who feel the death penalty has a place in our society and legal system. I doubt they will come away so staunchly in support of capital punishment and all that it entails."},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"Heard ULTIMATE PUNISHMENT, written and read by novelist ScottTurow . . . it is a sobering, nonfiction account of Turow's service on the Illinois commission that investigated the administration of the death penalty and influenced Governor George Ryan's unprecedented commutation of the sentences of 164 death row inmates on his last day in office.I remember in 2003 when I read about the above how I wondered,&quot;What gives?&quot; . . . although not a strong supporter of the deathpenalty (then), I still believed that it did serve a useful purpose in certain instances--and it was a definite deterrent to future crimes of a heinous nature.Now, after reading Turow's latest effort, I'm not at all sure . . .

While he never really takes a position, he examines the issues from all angles, from a very good discussion of victim rights to a very good discussion of alternate incapacitation of criminals. He candidly admits that this is a book based on his experiences and not necessarily on scholarly study. Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone interested in the topic, with the caveat that you don't limit your reading on the topic to this book.As far as Turow goes, I'm not even a big fan of his non-fiction work.Happy Reading"},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"In January of 2003, Illinois Governor George Ryan commuted the death sentences of every resident of death row in his state. As a result, 167 prisoners were spared from possible execution by lethal injection. The decision, made during the last week of Ryan's term as governor, was the culminating event in a four-year journey through the labyrinth-like issue that is capital punishment. Ryan, a strong proponent of the death penalty in 1999, became an equally strong proponent for its abolition in the span of four years. Along the way he converted many others to his viewpoint. When told by an accomplished writer such as Scott Turow, the story of that conversion has the ring of a classic and suspenseful novel.Turow's ULTIMATE PUNISHMENT: A Lawyers Reflection on Dealing with the Death Penalty is the author's personal reflection on his service on Ryan's Commission, created to examine the Illinois Death Penalty Law. Upon election to Governor in 1999, Ryan faced a capital punishment process in Illinois that had run amuck. Like many states, Illinois had reinstated the death penalty in the late 1970s. During the 22 years that the law had been in force, 12 men had been put to death in the state. In that same time period, 13 men had been released from death row because their innocence and wrongful convictions had been established. Governor Ryan became convinced that serious flaws existed in a criminal justice system that convicted innocent people. In January of 2000 he took two important actions. First, he imposed a moratorium on further executions in his state. Then, he established a commission of lawyers, criminal justice experts and others to examine the Illinois law and recommend procedures that would fix a fatally flawed system. Turow was a member of the commission.Although most readers are aware of Turow's work as a writer of courtroom fiction, many may not know that he continues to toil as a practicing attorney. Turow's career as an attorney began as a federal prosecutor in Chicago. During his legal career he appeared in court as both a supporter and opponent of capital punishment. At the time of his appointment to the Ryan Commission he considered himself a &quot;death penalty agnostic.&quot;ULTIMATE PUNISHMENT is not a lengthy study of capital punishment in America. As public opinion on the issue has careened wildly from opposition in the 1960s to strong support in the 1980s and 1990s and now serious doubt in the 21st century, there have been many exhaustive treatises on the issue. Turow seeks to examine the issue from a very narrow, less legalistic perspective. Accepting that there are circumstances when the death penalty is appropriate, he ponders whether the criminal justice system can decide those cases correctly and still make certain that the innocent or otherwise undeserving remain protected. After serious introspection and consideration, Turow's answer is no. Because of the serious manner by which he confronts the question, his answer is entitled to substantial weight.Turow has documented his position with a plethora of footnotes and supporting material. ULTIMATE PUNISHMENT is therefore not only thought-provoking writing but also a potentially valuable reference source for anyone interested in this subject. America has not yet resolved the criminal justice system dilemma of capital punishment. As the debate intensifies, the viewpoint of men like Turow will be of great value to those who view the debate on capital punishment as an important comment not only on the criminal justice system but on our society as well.--- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman"},{"Title":"Ultimate Punishment : A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty","review":"If you are like me, you mostly know Scott Turow from his many best-selling legal thrillers, including Reversible Errors which death with a death penalty case. Although his book jackets point out that he is lawyer, I haven't gotten a strong sense of that part of his life since his first book, One-L, in which he described life as a new Harvard Law School student.In his legal career, Mr. Turow has had some exposure to capital punishment cases both as a prosecutor and as a defendant's attorney. From these experiences, he learned that the law doesn't operate as smoothly as advertised in death penalty cases.I picked up the book because I had read a little about Illinois Governor George Ryan's commutation of 167 death sentences on the last day of his term in office, and wanted to know more about how they came about. The book more than fulfilled my interest, because Mr. Turow was a member of a commission looking into reforming the application of the death penalty for Governor Ryan. The findings of that commission and the subsequent foot dragging by the legislature caused Governor Ryan to act.Although I have been opposed to the death penalty for as long as I can remember, I was shocked to find out how poorly the sentence had been applied in Illinois. Prosecutors overlooked police torture to obtain confessions, judges overlooked obvious procedural errors, defense attorneys were expected to defend their clients at trial for a total payment of $300, defendants to the same crime often didn't receive the same sentence even when their acts were worse, AND many innocent defendants spent years awaiting death. If you want to understand all the gruesome details, this book provides them in a reasonably dispassionate way.When he started with the commission, Mr. Turow described himself as an agnostic on capital punishment. By the end of the commission, he was an opponent. Most will agree with him that it's unlikely that the death penalty can be applied in a fair and rigorous way.Although the book's subtitle was &quot;A Lawyer's Reflections on Dealing with the Death Penalty,&quot; I was ultimately disappointed that Mr. Turow didn't deal more with the moral and spiritual sides of the question.To me, the most gut-wrenching part of the book involved the description of the most currently dangerous multiple murderers in Illinois and what their life is like in maximum security prison for 23 hours a day under lockdown. It's not much of a life.The most revealing information came in Mr. Turow's description of what happened after the commutations. The electorate was evenly split on the point, and only prosecutors were uniformly negative. The new governor indicated that he will also probably defer having any executions until reforms suggested by the commission are in place.Anyone who cherishes their person freedom will be very upset at reading how truly innocent people are railroaded into false confessions, are betrayed by lying witnesses, and abused by prosecutors who know better.

In a different literary context, these case studies could be of immense value. Also, Chapter 7 has value to offer.Yes, I realize that racial discrimination issues are critical, especially given the level of racial discriminiation that exists in the human family. However, focusing on such discrimination as the root issue has stalled civil rights. It has accomplished pretty much all it is going to accomplish. It is time to recognize that predudice is part of the human condition.I invite Ms. Nieto or others to write a text based on the biological and sociological roots of prejudice aimed at helping the reader and, in the context of college classes, the student realize their own propensity for prejudice, recognize how it might show up, and correct the issues of their own prejudice as they emerge."},{"Title":"Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education, Fourth Edition","review":"Affirming Diversity is an excellent text book for anyone involved in the field of education. This book is also a good read for parents. It reads fairly easily, and uses case studies to give insight to lessons. The case studies bring light to the experience of being a minority in a dominated culture. The book is written with sensativity and intelligent. Sonia Nieto is not afraid to write about the struggle, frustration and pain that minorities experience."},{"Title":"Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education, Fourth Edition","review":"I found this book to primarily address the issues of eastern seaboard minority students rather than the issues faced in the southwestern US. Here in AZ there is a very strong prejudice against Immigrant students of Spanish speaking origin. Did you realize that in most workplaces in AZ we are not allowed to speak in a language other than English to a co-worker? Some paranoid person, usually a transplanted Anglo from out of state thinks we are talking about them. Ms Nieto needs to make her text more of a national treasure by not just focusing on those in the Midwest and Eastern seaboard nothern states. This book is due for an update!"},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"Even just after reading this book, I am really mixed on how much I liked it! The basic plot premise was a very interesting one---dealing with a mother's dying in the same year you are dealing with being a mother for the first time. Some characters were well drawn, especially the young stepsons and the main character Kate. It's hard to have believable children in a good, but Jonah and Sam were really well done. The parts of the book that were written in a fairly straightforward well were also very good---what it is like to start out with nursing, how it feels to wake up over and over to care for a demanding baby, etc. However, the style of this book is quite odd and not one I like. Each chapter starts with a long flashback in italics--remembering a visit to Kate's mother when she was first diagnosed with cancer and when Kate was telling her she was pregnant. The parts of the story told in the present are told in a circular way---you never find out the whole story of an incident until it's told over and over, with a bit more revealed each time. Minor happenings in Kate's life (especially a few shopping trips) are described in minute detail---I think these parts are supposed to reveal more than is said on the surface, but for me sometimes they didn't. Also, the book has several minor characters that to me muddle the story and don't add much---the babysitter Amy, her sister Hannah, the neighbor Camille, several home health aides at the end---all these people have interesting stories, but there are just too many of them for me to care about all of them! All this being said, I did finish the book and cared about the ending, and I think the story was a good one to have told---as I am sure there are other's in Kate's situation, and in fact I had a friend who went through something very similar. I guess a potential reader would have to decide how much the distracting elements would bother them!"},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I didn't find this novel to be the easiest thing to read that I've picked up in the last few months -- but, that being said, I felt that the beauty of the language compelled me to finish it, once I had begun.Jayne Anne Phillips has taken on a monumental task in writing this book. She has reduced the events and emotions of life-changing events -- the birth of a child, the agony and ecstasy of breastfeeding, and the at-home hospice care of a dying mother -- into words, onto the printed page. Her observations and meditations of these events are illuminating and moving. The seemingly everyday events in the lives of her characters take on a luminosity usually only bestowed by painters on their subjects. Things we take for granted -- a walk down the street to the market, a confidence shared with a friend, the touch of a mother's hand -- all take on an importance that is magnified. This magnification is not a falsification -- it is an opportunity for us to realize the importance of small things, an importance too often overlooked in our busy lives. This novel, then, becomes a study in priorities.I had a hard time getting past the first 100 pages or so -- and I think, in retrospect, I can attribute this to the author's pursuit of the 'mundane' details in everyday living. When I finally accustomed myself to the style she employed, I was able to relax more, take my time, and relish her creation.As far as other works I've read by Phillips, I must say that I enjoyed her novel SHELTER a bit more -- but her talent is genuine and accomplished, and I look forward to reading other works.Lastly, I have to say that this is a book that should be read by more male readers -- its subject (mother-daughter relations and the birth/breastfeeding experience) might tend to cause it to be classified as 'women's fiction', but that would be doing it a disservice. It would also cause it to be passed over by men who could use the lessons it teaches in order to allow them to better relate to their female counterparts. Understanding and empathy can go a long way in strengthening a relationship -- and we could all use a little more understanding, especially between the sexes."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"America's greatest author triumphs again with this absolutely stunning new work. Returning to themes familiar to her many loyal readers, Phillips incontrovertibly demonstrates that no other author could find so many interesting ways to present the same material again and again. Her boundless creativity and unique ability to take language into new and unexplored realms sets her apart from every other writer. Like so many other devoted fans, I am eagerly awaiting her next great work, which will doubtless offer the same level of pure excellence as this one."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"This story about birth and death is lyrical and replete with sensory detail. I found the visit to the toy store to be a particularly effective use of graphic nuances that made the reader actually join her on the trips down the aisles. The reader feels the real constraint of time that is the plaque of any one who faces the problems of the sandwich generation today. The author makes the reader empathic about the compelling pulls of the protagonist by husband, mother, step-children and baby.Parts of the book seem disjointed as when the main character, Kate, trips down memory lane. I am not sure that these scenes added much meat to the story. They did provide more insight into the character yet I would rather have had more details about the emotional stresses she was undergoing as she sought to fulfill all her demanding roles.The only part that was particularly weak was the final death scene. I felt cheated that there was not a clear sense of the finality. This is the reason for my evaluation of four stars. Had the final scene been more dramatic, the book would surely be a five star.I'm now ready to read other books by this author who clearly has the gifted talent necessary to make characters come alive."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"Phillips' writing just flows easily from one chapter to the next. In this semi-autobiographical novel, Phillips illustrates the bond between a mother and daughter from birth to death, and the various ways in which all women become nurturers. Kate discovers she's pregnant shortly after her own mother, Katherine, is diagnosed with a serious illness. Katherine leaves her home in Pennsylvania and moves in with Kate and her boyfriend in Boston. Kate's life is turned upside down as she becomes her mother's caretaker, a stepmother to two boys, then gives birth to her own child and needs some care of her own. Through flashbacks, we meet all of the female caretakers that come in and out of the women's lives--the young woman who comes in to prepare meals until the new mother gets back on her feet, the babysitter, the next-door neighbor who offers her own brand of nurturing, and the visiting nurses who help her mother through the last painful days of her life. My only complaint is that the male characters are minor characters with no substance. Obviously, Phillips had her reasons for writing them that way, but as someone who was nursed back to health by a husband after a serious illness, it bugged me that all of the nurturers in the book are women. Aside from that, it was a good read."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"MotherKind is a novel that perfectly depicts that moment when generations shift and the weight once carried by the parents falls to the shoulders of the child as she begins her own seasons of parenting. Phillips's language is lyrical and rich with sensual detail--blending the experiences of death and birth within the context of everyday life in a way that brings the reader full circle and leaves him/her awed and humbled by the reality of our most primal needs and emotions. Particularly moving are the glimpses back into the marriage of Kate's parents-- those moments that in many ways have defined Kate's life and her own expectations. And then, there is that incredible shift of strength and wisdom that brings Kate into her own landscape. A wonderfully satisfying book."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I agree with readers who feel Phillips' short fiction is superior, and I did feel the dialogue really sank at times. Also, I couldn't get over the time setting of the book--if Kate is 31, but she was in grade school when Kennedy was shot, does the book take place in the late 80s? If so, why? That said, I still deeply enjoyed the book. The prose is luminous, the plot is quiet and more a meditation than a traditional narrative, and I find that all perfectly acceptable. Despite the book's flaws, I couldn't stop reading or wanting to return to Kate's world."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I found this book very boring and it took me a real long time to finish it. The character are not strong enough to hold interest and there really wasn't any story at all. I cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"Perhaps to compare this novel to its protagonist, Kate, expecting her baby and feeling very encumbered is trite, but it is apt. I felt that Phillips wanted to have her cake and eat it too -- she wanted someone young, 31, but this is a baby boomer woman, not anyone who is 31 today. Yet she attempts to give it an 'anyone/anytime' feeling (the ability for me a the reader to place the story chronologically was very difficult) which only distorts from both the 1985ish story she is telling and trying to &quot;place&quot; this novel in a contemporary time.Frustating, from start to finish. This is a woman who made her name writing about her generation, with all the gifts and burdens that come with it. Perhaps she was simply trying to do to much for too many."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"One thing you can say for Jayne Anne Phillips--she knows the topic that is selling at the moment. Publishers love her, and no wonder: When Raymond Carver-esque short stories were the hot ticket, we got Black Tickets. When Vietnam was the fictional selling point, we got Machine Dreams. Now that the Boomers are burying their parents and producing babies, we get Motherkind. Don't waste your time or money on this bland, but oh-so-topical, autobiography masquerading as novel. This writer hit her stride in the 1970s; thirty years later, she's plodding."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I can't believe I spent $13 on this book. It reads like the rough draft of a novel--not an actual novel. It's banal. The heroine is nursing her baby and her breasts are sore! Wow! What an insight! Phillips' brain must have been on auto-pilot when she wrote this. It got decent reviews in the media when it came out in hardcover. Why??"},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I am furious that I wasted my time reading this book. The characters are vague, impossible to envision, and prone to terribly boring dialogue. The plot has almost no forward movement. Phillips seems to expect that the symmetry of her extended birth/death metaphor will carry the novel, but it doesn't come close."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"This graceful, moving novel tells a heroic story of ordinary life in a way that echoes long after the book is finished. The passing of power and responsibity from one generation to another, the bittersweet flow of family energy passing through Kate at the center as the death of her mother overlaps the birth of her son, the struggles of a young blended family trying to gain a foothold under the weight of terminal illness...all told touchingly against a backdrop of seasonal holidays, neighbors, birthdays. For anyone with a family, this is a must read. Men and women alike will find that Motherkind resonates with the reality of modern family life, reminding me of many of my own experiences. It serves as a guide for those of us hoping to face the challenges of birth and death, marriage and divorce with courage and clarity."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I finished &quot;Motherkind&quot; just the other night, and I must say, rarely have I experienced such disappointment in a novel. Phillips, the author of the highly acclaimed story collections, &quot;Black Tickets,&quot; and &quot;Fast Lanes,&quot; and two previous novels, can be a brilliant wriiter. Yet this novel saddened me--not because of the subject matter, which centers on the juggling of a new baby, husband, stepsons, and the death of the protagonist's mother--but because the narrative flow was so often diluted by overly sentimental, maudlin scenes and expository, didactic dialogue, most of which would have succeeded better as narrative. Perhaps having read interviews with Phillips discussing the death of her mother influenced my reading, but I could not help feeling what a dangerous thread of thinly-veiled autobiography Phillips was treading. As a writer, I give her kudos for her courage in tackling a subject so close to her own life and for her lyrical poetic language, yet the novel reinforced my feelings about her earlier novels: as a writer, Phillips is simply better suited to the short form. There are lovely passages, yet the novel as a whole feels hollow, somehow, as if Phillips were never quite able to penetrate the protective membrane in which she has encased it. Sadly, this is not work of a writer--as one would expect it to be--at the height of her powers."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"MotherKind is cathartic. The book is full of humor and insight, and best of all, basic human decency. The relationships between mother, daughter, grandmother, lovers, fathers, friends are familiar and believable, carefully described and absolutely convincing. The resolution of each conflict is so satisfying that MotherKind's conclusion has the comforting resolution of a Bach fugue. Masterful. Thank you, Ms. Phillips!"},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"This is one of those books that I wanted to like more than I did. The characters are interesting and the sense of time and place are moving, but ultimately it didn't move me. I suggest people take it out of the library or buy a used copy (as I did) if they're going to buy it."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I'm officially done with Jayne Anne Phillips. Having read Lark and Termite and now MotherKind I know for certain that she is definitely not my type. I found the novel extremely boring. You all enjoy if you want, maybe this book is for you, but you'll have to judge yourselves. It is definitely not my kind of book."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"Anytime a Jayne Anne Phillips book comes out, the temptation is to compare it to her great story collections Black Tickets and Fast Lanes. But Motherkind fails on its own terms, with bland characters and even blander, flabbier scene setting. It's hard to care about a narrator so self-obsessed. Just as a friend's pregnancy is more interesting to her, the narrator seems to think we'll be fascinated by her endless litany of childbearing/childrearing, most of which is old hat. An earlier Phillips would have undercut this sentimentality with vicious irony (without lessening the characters), but here she piles on even more. Her last novel Shelter was overdone too. Maybe it's time to pare down and go back to short fiction."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"As a nearly 300 page character study (or relationship study or exercise in putting many beautiful sentences together) this book is first rate. Phillips is clearly a gifted writer. But...I kept waiting for something to happen. Since we know on page 1 that Katherine is dying that no longer counts as the crisis that keeps a good story moving. Perhaps this book should be looked upon as a slice of life--often beautiful, sometimes strikingly mundane--but not the stuff of the engrossing novel I was hoping it might be."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"This book had great potential, but no point. There were so many loose ends. I guess that's like life, but it doesn't make for good reading. Ugh. Painful."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"This book seemed like a glimpse of someone's hectic everyday life. I am amazed I finished it. I enjoyed the author's writing style (some great imagery and thought connections) but the story never amounted to anything. The characters seemed like aquaintences-I knew some details of their lives but I never really cared about them or about getting to know them. The relationships of the main character (her name escapes me) were of interest at first, but again never amount to much. Her relationships with women were strong, her relationship with her husband, disconcerting. The book felt like it was building to something but it never peaked. Can I assume this is the author's comment on life?If I were to turn back time, I wouldn't read this book but would pick up another by this author. I will consider reading other work of hers in the future."},{"Title":"MotherKind : A Novel (Vintage Contemporaries)","review":"I found this novel to be extremely moving and luminous. Like all great art, the book takes great risks to achieve its emotionality: it draws on and transforms &quot;real-life&quot; and it even risks what would be in lesser hands sentimentality. The protagonist is a shrewd and funny, yet Phillips doesn't waste our time with a character who uses humor to push away feelings; instead, the novel embraces even the painful responses and arrives at insights that took my breath away."},{"Title":"Interpreting Southern History: Historiographical Essays in Honor of Sanford W. Higginbotham","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in southern history with at least one qualification. This is a rather serious work. The book is a collection of thirteen historiographical essays on a broad range of southern historical topics. Because it is a late eighties publication, a good deal of the most recent scholarship is reflected in its pages. If its a quick read on southern history you want, this may not be the book. If you want to understand what historians have said over the years about southern history (a must for graduate students), then this is definitely your book. I recently purchased the book knowing shamefully little about southern historiography, and now consider the book indespensible, without substitute."},{"Title":"Morning Moon","review":"This book tells the story of a family through multiple points of view and creates a fascinating picture of lives torn apart and rebuilt. Though it deals with cultures and a time period that have no particular appeal to me, I found the book absolutely riveting. You really feel for the characters and experience their heartaches and joys. I've lent this book to lots of people (male and female) and everyone loves it. But it was out of print for a long time. Why aren't there more books like this being published??? Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Morning Moon","review":"Miss Reibel was my teacher and my guide when I was a child in the Bronx. She gave me the tools to change and improve my life. I, as many other students, adored her. I moved away, lost contact, and made a good life for myself. Recently, I found out that Miss Reibel had become a college professor, a writer of Regency novel, and several other novels under various pseudonyms. I so wanted to contact her and let her know what I had accomplished. Alas, I was too late as she had passed away. I ordered a copy of A Morning Moon. It is an amazing poetic journey from the shtetels of Europe to America and I sense her beauty in every passage.
