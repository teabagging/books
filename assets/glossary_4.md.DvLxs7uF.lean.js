I really hate the long waits between the installments of &quot;Thecorps&quot; , but it usually is worth it. And &quot;Retreat,Hell&quot; is no exception to this rule.The novel picks up shortly after the Inchon Invasion has succeeded in a spectacular fashion , with McCoy , Zimmerman , and technical sergeant Jennings on patrol. &quot;Pick&quot; Pickering , General Pickering's son , has been shot down and missing in action as a carryover from the novel , &quot;Under Fire&quot;, that immediately precedes the current work. The patrol narrowly misses finding young Pickering , but manages to effect the capture of a North Korean officer thought by McCoy to be a high level intelligence officer.Through many twists and turns of plot , evidence of Communist Chinese , intent to intervene in the war are unearthed by McCoy and Zimmerman. What really keeps us riveted to the book is the unwillingness of those of MacArthur's staff to pay any attention.The interaction of General Pickering , General Ralph Howe , and others with President Harry S Truman keeps us turning page after page.It is not really my intent to give a blow-by-blow synopsis of the book ; it would spoil the outcome for the reader.On my &quot;warts&quot; list , I only comment that WEB sometimes loses touch with the characters he has created : in &quot;Under Fire&quot;, Pick Pickering' paramour , Jeanette Priestly , is described as a &quot;lanky brunette&quot; , but in &quot;Retreat, Hell&quot;, she removes her cap to release &quot;her long blonde hair&quot;! Whoops!I sadly miss many of the characters WEB introduced and developed so well in the WW-II episodes :Steve Koffler , Robert &quot;Easterbunny&quot; Easterbrook , sergeant Percy Everly , and Jim Weston. Perhaps we'll see these characters all &quot;returned to duty&quot; in the next installment. The Korean War isn't over yet , so there is still lots of potential left in this series.Still my favorite series from my favorite author. As usual , I can't wait for the &quot;next one&quot;. I just gotta give it five stars !"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"There have arguably never been more substantial real-life characters than Harry S. Truman and Douglas MacArthur. To bring their personalities and significantly different styles to a work of fiction, and do so in a manner that makes the reader feel \\" in the room\\" with these men, is nothing short of masterful. To bring the historical significant year of 1950 to life, and then weave through it a tale replete with anguish, danger, intrigue, frustration, elation, humor, heroism, and moral outrage, is nothing short of phenomenal. To develop fictional characters with dynamic and diverse personalities, and bring them to life through dialog, is nothing short of fantastic. A work of fiction that can do all three is brilliant. Retreat Hell! is W.E.B. Griffin at his finest. Retreat Hell! is brilliant, and the W.E.B. Griffin is a literary genius by any standard. This is his best work to date. If you can read this book without laughing out loud, you never served in the military. If you can read this book without tears, you never served in the Marine Corps. If you can read this book without feeling outrage, you must be related to MacArthur. If you can read this book without being thoroughly entertained, then great historical fiction is beyond you. Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"W.E.B. Griffin's novelistic account of the Korean Conflict in 1950 teaches even as it entertains. Douglas Macarthur - who is still revered as the hero his president wouldn't listen to by many South Koreans - is primed for glory, but has to deny the massive Chinese presence that awaits his troops if he's going to get there.Enter Ken McCoy, your basic straight-talking grunt who sees clearly, shoots when he has to, and wins the day. Sort of.Not a brilliant literary piece, if that's what you need. But a colorful introduction to the no-win drama of the Korean Conflict and some of its key players, not to mention an interesting insight into the psychology of the Corps when its civilian and military masters wander off the beaten track."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"Just a short observation that WEB Griffin has done it again. For those of us that thoroughly enjoy his writing, and the stories of the Corps, this continuance of the life and times of his characters is exciting and grabs you by your imagination to experience what the characters are actually going through. Great story. Can't wait for the next."},{"Title":"Retreat, Hell!","review":"His books are always good. I really haven't found I read of his I have not enjoyed.

Griffin's tenth installment in the Corps series is 600-plus pages of misdirection and missed opportunity. The only thing this book has in common with the rest of The Corps series is a few character names. The book opens with Malcolm &#34;Pick&#34; Pickering on the run behind enemy lines after he crash landed his Corsair at the end of the last novel. Like all good Americans, the only thing on his mind is getting back to his loved ones, especially the suddenly realized love of his life, Jeanette Priestly of the Chicago Tribune, which is why he can't use a signal mirror though most kids figure our this skill before fifth grade. And that is the end of the action in this book. The rest of it is conversations about how great McCoy is, how horribly unfair history has treated General Edward Almond, and how well-stocked the CIA larders are&#8212;everyone drinks top-shelf, single malt Scotch. The title of the book, part of a quote attributed to Marine Corps General O.P. Smith after the First Marine Division is ordered to retreat through thousands of Chinese Communist soldiers from the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, appears in the author's note after the book ends. Griffin spends so little time on the Marine Corps in this book that the reader unfamiliar with history might come to the conclusion that Marine Corps is an intimate club of men who'd rather be in the CIA. There are way better books out there than this, which actually chronicle the Korean War battles of the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.

I didn't always agree with her, but DeMars got me talking to my coworkers and my boss about what was the best solution-which was exactly DeMars' purpose for writing the book in the first place, I suspect. Yes, sometimes good employees do bad things--so here's what you do when it happens."},{"Title":"You Want Me to Do What: When Where and How to Draw the Line at Work","review":"Bettie Currie, Fawn Hall, and Rosemary Woods needed this book. So did I. Lots of us face ethical choices that keep us up at night, or cause us to wince inside. DeMars uses lots of real-life examples to help us resolve the common dilemmas we find every day at work -- dilemmas about confidentiality, loyalty, office romance, harassment, information manipulation -- it's all here.She also coaches us about how to get the ethics discussion going -- without losing our jobs.My favorite chapters were on lying (only very little lies told for social convention and very large lies told to save lives are OK) and &quot;the trouble with the boss&quot; (here's how to talk to him about his profanity, disrespect, lies, thievery, harassment, whatever). DeMars says high ethics boosts productivity and retention of customers and employees, then shows us how to have those long-overdue conversations about how we treat each other. A great book, period. I am so clear now about where I need to draw &quot;that line&quot; between what I will and will not do, and I am so confident about how to do it."},{"Title":"You Want Me to Do What: When Where and How to Draw the Line at Work","review":"I purchased this book after hearing Nan DeMars speak at an International Association of Administrative Professionals meeting in Plymouth, MN.

We have kept in touch (I'm fortunate to live nearby) via phone, e-mail and luncheon meetings, and our conversations are always lively and informative. Nan has given administrative assistants everywhere permission to stand up to those who would ask us to bend the rules a little - or a lot! It is okay to say \\"NO!\\" Her book also highlights what can happen if you choose to go along with requests that are un-ethical or even illegal. Companies no longer offer protection for assistants who are merely \\"following instructions.\\" For your own peace of mind, I encourage you to devour this book and follow your conscience when confronted - in the workplace or anywhere else - by requests that are not ethical.

The Guides claimed to be from the other side. They helped her with the construction of this book which is written on the basis that we are the sum total of all our experiences including our past lives. The philosophy of reincarnation believes that with each thought, word and deed we are building the person we will be in future lifetimes.The book is filled with skeptics and believers who relieved their past lives like Dr. Stanley Krippner, Dr. Kelsey and Joan Grant, Henry David Thoreau, Louisa May Alcott, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, David Hume, Henry Ford, Harry Houdini and a horde of other famous and not so famous individuals.Hugh Lynn, the son of Edgar Cayce, recalls an experience he had during WWII when he moved through an Austrian village as a soldier. While he was drinking beer, he noticed a bridge and an old structure of a building that reminded him of the times during the crusades. He saw himself desert his wife and young child to follow the crusaders to liberate Jerusalem. Then forward a few hundred years when he was drafted and forced to leave his wife and young son with whom he longed to be. He drew the conclusion this might be a circle come full turn which settled a karmic debt. The reader will get the gist of this episode better when reading the whole book.The Guides assured RM that servicemen who kill the enemy of their country in the name of man-made laws for which they have no lust or liking, are not responsible for their acts as long as they do not go beyond the call of their duty relishing the slaying. The intent breeds the sin not the act itself.Bill & Judy Guggenheim wrote a book \\"Hello from heaven!\\" where the same rules shine through. At least that is the impression I got when reading the book. By the way RM and Bill Guggenheim both have Swiss roots.Edgar Cayce, the famous Kentuckian psychic, has a prominentplace in this book. He gave hundreds of physical readings (diagnostic and healing) and life readings. He tapped two sources while half asleep. One was the subject's subconscious which remembers all acts. The other was the collective unconscious or akashic records on which are written all deeds and thoughts since the beginning of mankind. With some practice, apparently, everyone can tap these two reservoirs and view their past lives.Edgar Cayce's remarks about group karma are also worth mentioning. This is the tendency for certain souls to be drawn closely together like a close-knit family where everyone knew each other in various relationships during several previous reincarnations. He stressed repeatedly unless we are willing to be linked in lifetime after lifetime with person(s) we dislike we should work ar solving the animosity which forges that bond.If nothing else, reading this book might make you a better person. Who knows, maybe the principles explored by RM might have a basis of truth. Your guess is as good as mine."},{"Title":"Here & Hereafter: A Fascinating Key to the Experience of Reincarnation as it has Shaped the Lives of Prominent Americans","review":"I was already a high school drama teacher when the 70s began.

The book provides compelling evidence to support reincarnation.Ruth Montgomery takes you through actual past life regression hypnosis sessions and what the people said, readings from psychics on people's past lives, and the readings of Edgar Cayce in both medical diagnosis and past life analysis to explain the subject's relationships with others and why certain events happened in their lives.The author also showed patterns, like people who died violently or suffered greatly had hurt people in previous lives.Some interesting occurrences that arose out of the regressions were the extreme level of detail the subjects were able to remember and how intense their emotions were during the recall.All the regressions were interesting, but the children who had total recall of previous lives which was verified beyond any doubt by trips to visit their prior life relations was the best.An excellent, timeless book."},{"Title":"Here & Hereafter: A Fascinating Key to the Experience of Reincarnation as it has Shaped the Lives of Prominent Americans","review":"This is a great book that will get you thinking about how you live your life in the present time on earth and how it could affect how things go for you in the here after.

It includes Lalique, Fouquet, Gautrait, Gaillard, Vever, Wolfers, Masriera, and Cranach. Each of these artists has a small section written about them, some including their signature/stamp/trademarks (black and white pictures of the artisans), followed by a selection of beautiful (all color) glossy pictures. About 95 color pictures in all. In the back is a small biography on each artist, and the entire book is printed in both German and English. This book is wonderful for an overall report on the topic, but not highly detailed on any selected person. So if you want a lot of information on one particular craftsman, this may not be the best book for you to buy right now. After you get the individual artist's book, you definitely need to get this one. The only negative comment I have is one I have for many &quot;art&quot; books. There are a few (three-five) pieces that are blown up to be shown on both pages, and of course the book binding splits up the picture, causing a loss of quality. But I'm picky.

I loved the movie and &#34;of course&#34; the book is ALWAYS better right??"},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Frankly, I continue to be confused by the praise that this book receives. Cross Creek is an account of the author's life in the backwoods of Florida, and Rawlings does indeed do a fine job of describing the natural aspects of her surroundings. But the mean-spirited, rants that are interjected throughout the book make it near impossible to focus on her observations about nature. Many will argue that the author's racist attitudes simply reflect the language and tone of the time period, but she goes beyond simple name-calling. I did not see any light-hearted humor in the chapter in which she says that the young black girl that she \\"bought\\" from her father should have been drowned at birth, or in her description of field hands as monkeys in the trees, or in her musings about how the black race is childish and cannot be relied upon. How anyone can read these descriptions and still be left with the warm, happy feelings described in many of the reviews of this book, is truly beyond my understanding."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Amazing use of language to describe people, situations, surroundings, feelings, flora, fauna, food, etc. Just visited Cross Creek...it was really interesting to see how isolated the area is and how simply Ms. Rawlins lived. I was curious as to her marital status as I can only recall one reference to a husband. Apparently they got divorced while residing in Cross Creek and she did her best writing there subsequent to the divorce. She was obviously greatly inspired by her surroundings."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"I loved Cross Creek, with its lush descriptions of central Florida before Disney World turned it into an artificial muddle. Florida already enchants me, and Rawlings put my feelings into words perfectly. I wish that this book had never ended.My only problem with this book actually comes from the time when it was written. Rawling's most flattering term for Cross Creek's African-American residents is Negro or darky. Other Cross Creek terms are more disturbing. I don't believe that Rawlings was racist, but reading about a \\"big black buck\\" raising his voice in a Negro spiritual reminds me how far our society has come since \\"Cross Creek\\" was published in 1942."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"The book Cross Creek was not available in my local public library, so I bought it. Once I started reading the book, I became suspicious it had been banned from the library. The language and racial attitudes are unsettling. But, they are typical of what existed in the 1930s in much of this country, and especially in rural Florida.This is as much a cultural and social work, as literary. It captures a part of our history that largely has vanished and has been forgotten. The characters, their portrayals, and their language probably are greatly exaggerated, to make the book more captivating. The book can be viewed as racist, but Rawlings pretty much treats the Cracker Whites about equally to the not-too-far-from-slavery, Blacks. Rawlings was sued for libel by one of her white neighbors she depicted in the book.This was a foreign land; Rawlings could just as easily have been writing about a hamlet in some Third World country. She was in it, became part of it, but was born in it. She had the degree of separation and perspective needed to write about Cross Creek. But, she also portrayed some of her characters quite harshly.Many of Rawlings' Cross Creek backwoods neighbors, black and white, lived at the fringes of society, culture, and the economy. They had a subsistence lifestyle, and experienced severe privation and even real hunger in the 1930s. They survived on bream (sunfish, or bluegills), grits, black-eyed peas, and collard greens. \\"White bacon\\" was a real treat. Some of these people were the \\"left behinds,\\" as the more capable individuals emigrated to urban areas, South and North, in the early to mid 20th Century to improve their fortunes.As a native of the Deep South, I enjoyed reading this beautiful description of an earlier time and now transformed place. This is the \\"Old Florida,\\" more of which still existed and I remember as a child over 50 years ago. I've visited the house in Cross Creek (now a Florida State Park) a couple of times, and I highly recommend visiting Cross Creek, as well as reading the book. These are true remnants of the \\"Old Florida.\\""},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Cross Creek is a wonderful vignette look into early 20th Century life in \\"Old Florida\\". The book is different in style from Rawlings well known work, The Yearling.

Ms. Rawlings writes of her life in a Florida rural backwater called Cross Creek that she moves to after leaving her husband. Alone, she must learn the ways of the Creek people, how to manage a large but neglected orange grove, deal with snakes, bugs and overgrown gardens and, a neighbors errant pigs. Life at Cross Creek was also the inspiration for her modern classic, The Yearling and other stories. Written with humor and a determined but spirited nature, you will find Cross Creek an enjoyable peek into the unique lives of those who called it home."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"\`Cross Creek' is an extraordinary book written by a woman with the keen ability and insight to draw out the poetic from the mundane. An educated cosmopolitanite from the northeast, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings plunged into the rustic life of cracker Florida with a ferocity belying her Leo sun sign. She longed for the farm life, which ran deeper in her veins than did the comforts of urban living. A Pulitzer Prize writer, a naturalist, and gourmet cook, Marjorie was also handy with a shotgun as a person or two found out who mistook her gender for a sign of weakness. Marjorie was a great observer and devotee of nature which she expressed with a resonance that lingers on the heart. She animated the inanimate and bestowed upon the humblest of Florida's creatures, personality. 'Cross Creek' has reached out to me from the deep past to quicken my present experience of living in Florida. I find myself looking expectantly for personality in the natural world. The evidence already exists in 'Cross Creek'. I wish that I had known Marjorie. She died the year I was born."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Rawlings explores the lives and interations of the odd assortment of people living in Cross Creek, Florida in the early 1900s. It is often assigned reading for teens, but I doubt that most of them can appreciate it. Her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior.The lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing. Your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies. She turned those into a cookbook which I'll have to try out.Modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the N----- word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible, drunken, immoral, etc. It is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written, so recognize it as a snapshot of the times. Then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book. (I deducted 1 star for this)The reader becomes absorbed in Rawlings' love of the land and the creation of a home. It gives much the same feelings as A Year in Provence or Under a Tuscan Sun."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"In the late thirties and early forties two women writers were finding in the area of the St.John's river in northeast Florida a basis for their stories, true or imagined. These two women were Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who had discovered north Florida, and Zora Neale Hurston, who left it for New York City. Today Hurston's reputation is very great while Rawlings, who remains widely read, is generally considered sentimental. I have often thought it would be interesting to teach a class that included both Hurston and Rawlings, particularly so that one could address straight-on issues of Race in Rawlings's Cross Creek. The stories of black and white living at Cross Creek might be illumined by Hurston's stories, their uses of dialect compared, their attachment to an environment explored. I like Cross Creek, have liked it for many years, but I have always wished I could read it in the context of what the black population actually thought. Hurston might help me to do that. The best parts of Rawlings are her sensitivity to the natural world and her open acceptance of just about everybody. She lived in a world and tried to undersand it, not reform it, but it would be interesting to see how Hurston plays against her."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"For any who don't know, Rawlings gained her initial notoriety for the book, The Yearling. Cross Creek is an autobiography of her years spent on 75 acres just below Gainesville which became her retreat for a number of years. This was in the 1940s when much of Florida was still rural. My wife and I own a mobile home in rural Lake City, Florida, but it is not nearly as secluded as Rawling's place. She presents a wonderfully vivid picture of untamed Florida during this period. Surprisingly, the book is not a self-indulgent reflection on her books and how well they sold. She concentrates more upon her natural surroundings and the individuals around her, both friend and foe. If I recommended a memoir by a writer living in rural Florida, you would probably not run out and buy the book. But Rawling's honest transparency and unabashed candor make this a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"I have been familiar with this work for a number of years and have been rather saddened that more attention has not been paid to it. Yes, they did a sort of TV movie some years ago, but while pleasant, it certainly did not do justice to this particular work by Rawlings. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a rather autobiographical story of one womans struggle at a time when struggling was common, particularly for women. I personally perfer this work over the Yearling, as I simply feel it is better written and far more insightful. This work gives the reader a glance at what this country was like earlier in the last century, both good and the bad. The author does have way with humor and is able to laugh at herself, something that is always refreshing. For a pure joy and a wonderful read, I would recommend this one highly."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"I have difficulty putting my love for this book into words. I feel a kinship with Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings that defies reason. After reading this book, I had to buy every book I could find about the author, and then I went to Florida to see her house and farm at Cross Creek. I have read the book aloud to other people twice and have given copies of it to friends. It may not move others in the same way as it does me, but it is a lovely depiction of life in rural Florida in the 1930s."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Cross Creek is a series of entertaining if perhaps embellished anecdotes relating to Florida in the years preceding World War II told from the perspective of a educated emigr&eacute; from the North. Some of the language, which was typical of the times, would no longer be considered politically correct and might be offensive to some. The book, however is totally delightful and gives some insight into life in rural Florida at the time. An excellent companion read is Tom Glisson's The Creek, which gives a native's view of the same time and area. Both books are a must read if you live or are interested in North Central FL."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"It was very disconserting to me to read the reviews on this book and and see the term &quot; racism &quot; used so much. Ms. Rawlings revealed the old south and old Florida as it was and is and will always will be. Accept it or don't waste your time reading this marvelous book of the old south of and of old Florida. Robert G. Holloway"},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings (Pulitzer Prize winning author of The Yearling) moves into a cabin in Cross Creek and tells of her life in this tiny community in central Florida around the 1930's.She makes the change from life in a big city to a life that is simple and yet demanding, quiet yet open to all and full of new,unimagined challenges and conquests.She uses language of the time. While it would not be considered politically correct, the language does bring the realities of life in rustic Cross Creek into a clearer more tangible experience, abundantly filled with the feel, the taste, and the scents of life in the backcountry.Her education in the flora and fauna, her tribulations with hired hands, her understanding of those around her are all so vividly told that you feel as if you could have been there watching it all take place before your very eyes.The insight into the mind and heart of Marjorie Rawlings was both intimate and detached at times. Sometimes she was a delicate piece of the \\"machinery\\" driving this backcountry haven and at other times she seemed to feel as if she were but an observer, an outsider, merely watching from a well placed vantage point. This is an intriguing look into the life, the heart and the soul of this beloved classic author."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"This book will always be a book that I go back too for a southern kick in the grits. I love this book. I have been to Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings place up north Florida and I think this book out of all the books I have observed of Cross Creek, this one is the best because of the drawings and easy reading."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"We love Marjorie Rawlins.

The entire pesentation, from cover to end, with all the lovely new line drawings really does credit to this amazing journal of Marjorie Rawlings in the primitive Florida swamps of the '30's. I am going to get another, for a gift to my daughter. We are also going to try some of the recipes."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"I bought this book for one story but it turned out all of the stories were great."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings always makes me cry. The other reviews of this book here describe it so eloquently and throughly that I don't feel the need to add to that aspect. The book has a strong emotional pull that made me cry and made long to go to Cross Creek and see it for myself. Rawlings is one of my all-time favorite writers, ever since my seventh-grade teacher read the newly published book The Yearling to her class, a chapter or two each day after lunch."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Wonderful view of an isolated place in FL (near Gainesville) circa 1930 written by a brave, independent woman."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Had read Rawlings' book many years ago, and, having recently visited her home at Cross Creek, decided to reread it. More enjoyable the second time around. Her descriptive narrative sings with the essence of central Florida living circa 1930s. Enjoy a slice of history served up with grits and white bacon. Satisfying to the soul."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"In the late thirties and early forties two women writers were finding in the area of the St.John's river in northeast Florida a basis for their stories, true or imagined. These two women were Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, who had discovered north Florida, and Zora Neale Hurston, who left it for New York City. Today Hurston's reputation is very great while Rawlings, who remains widely read, is generally considered sentimental. I have often thought it would be interesting to teach a class that included both Hurston and Rawlings, particularly so that one could address straight-on issues of Race in Rawlings's Cross Creek. The stories of black and white living at Cross Creek might be illumined by Hurston's stories, their uses of dialect compared, their attachment to an environment explored. I like Cross Creek, have liked it for many years, but I have always wished I could read it in the context of what the black population actually thought. Hurston might help me to do that. The best parts of Rawlings are her sensitivity to the natural world and her open acceptance of just about everybody. She lived in a world and tried to undersand it, not reform it, but it would be interesting to see how Hurston plays against her."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"This book has me torn between love and hate. The writing is excellent as might be expected and parts made me laugh out loud and yet there are other parts that made me feel great dislike for the way the author speaks about people of color, using the N word. Well you might say she was a product of her times and that was acceptable back then. Was it? Did other Pulitzer Prize winning authors speak of people using those and other demeaning words? I can't recall any and it took the joy from the stories for me.I recently visited the authors home in Cross Creek FL, took a delightful tour there and at the end was given a list of books both by Rawlings and other books about the area. Luckily \\"The Creek\\" by J. T. Glisson was on that list. This contemporaneous neighbor of Rawlings tells some of the same stories in his own voice and from the point of view of the people who lived there and how Rawlings fit into the \\"Creek\\". This book is truly wonderful in it's story-telling and treatment of people of all races. I highly recommend it if you are, as I am, enchanted by how life was lived by a unique group of people and how they interacted.And just to follow on with how Rawlings book was perceived by the people she was writing about, she was sued by a woman she wrote of who felt she was libeled in the way she was portrayed. She was white and her portrayal was far, far less negative than Rawling's treatment of non-whites. The neighbor won part of the libel suit but because she could not prove what her actual loss was she received $1. Is that what a person's reputation is worth?Rawlings felt vindicated, that an author should be able to say whatever she wanted about a person. Afterwards she wrote little else of importance and died an untimely death. Perhaps if she had lived she would have edited Cross Creek to remove N words and other unnecessary harshness. We'll never know."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"The book I ordered was delivered in a timely manner and was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Cross Creek is located just south of Gainesville, Florida, and in spite of the urban sprawl the community is today almost as isolated as it was in 1928, when Marjorie Kennan Rawlings and her first husband Charles Rawlings purchased a farm house and citrus grove in the area. At the time of the purchase, Rawlings was a failed novelist in a bad marriage, and both farm house and grove were neglected. A decade later she was a respected writer on the eve of her most popular novel and happily divorced, and the farm and its citrus groves were very much going concerns.Rawlings would eventually remarry, and both her second marriage and her literary success would gradually lead her away from both her farm and the Cross Creek community--but she would never leave them entirely, always returning for the inspiration that fed her best works. The property was still in her possession and still in use as both a citrus grove and occasional residence at the time of her sudden death of cerebral hemorrhage in 1953. Rawlings left the it to the University of Florida, and in 1970 the property was turned over to the State of Florida for restoration and management. Restoration was completed in 1996, and while the large citrus grove that once surrounded the farm house has been reduced to a representative portion, visitors can now see the property as it existed in the 1930s and 1940s.Although Rawlings won the Pulitzer Prize for her novel THE YEARLING and would publish several other novels and short story collections, today her literary reputation rests largely on the book CROSS CREEK, in which she details both her own struggle on the land the lives of the community as she knew it during the 1930s. While the book is clearly autobiographical, it is not autobiography per se; she gives little attention to her personal history, preferring to focus instead on the landscape and the individuals that surround her. The stories she offers are by turns funny, sad, thoughtful, each informed by an intensely felt observation of her environment. And while critics may accuse her of having been excessively sentimental in her fiction, no such sentimentality besets this particular work. It is brilliant from start to finish.CROSS CREEK was published in 1942, and while it is very much of its era in its depiction of rural society and racial considerations, it also proved very much ahead of its time. It is profoundly concerned with ecology long before the term was popularized, and not only are its characters vividly alive, they move against a landscape that is as alive as they, a landscape that at once harsh and nurturing, at once giving and indifferent, and throughout the text (and most particularly in its final chapter) Rawlings repeatedly takes the point of view that we are not the owners of the earth, but its trustees; its care is in our hands.I have read CROSS CREEK several times, and I returned to it in the wake of a visit to the Rawlings farm in 2003--and while it is not necessary to actually visit Cross Creek in order to fall in love with this book, they each inform the other. The book is somewhat obscure; the community of Cross Creek is difficult to find on the map and awkward to reach, hardly a place you would stumble upon by accident. It must be reached in deliberation. The guide at the Rawlings farm told me that in spite of this they received some forty thousand visitors from around the world each year--visitors drawn by the power of Rawlings' work and a determination to share in the environment she so loved. That is both testament and recommendation enough.--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--"},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Cross Creek is one of the finest memoirs ever written, filled with grace and beauty from one of America's greatest writers, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. Perhaps no other writer has so perfectly and honestly captured a place and time like Rawlings did in Cross Creek. It will transport you to that small acreage of backwoods Florida and cause you to wish for a life such as this.Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings purchased a seventy-two acre orange grove in this remote area and fled her aristocratic life in the city to perfect her craft and get published. It is here all her beloved books would be born, including this memoir covering the years of hardships and beauty at the creek. Rawlings herself would become a part of the earth and land as she was reborn here in Cross Creek and would leave behind literary achievements such as \\"South Moon Under,\\" \\"Golden Apples,\\" \\"When the Whipporwill,\\" \\"Cross Creek Cookery,\\" and of course, her Pulitzer winning, \\"The Yearling.\\"Her close relationships with her neighbors at the creek, both black and white, are told with humor and humanity. Their lives were often filled with hardships but serenity as well, for all of them had chosen to live this kind of life rather than conform to society. Especially poignant are Rawlings' observations of a young destitute couple who would be portrayed so movingly in Jacob's Ladder.Rawlings' recollections of her friendship with Moe, and especially his daughter Mary, who was Moe's reason for living and the only one in his family who cared when he came or went, are told with such beauty we feel pain ourselves when he takes his last breath at the creek. Her deep friendships over the years with Tom and Old Martha are told with humor, honesty and a gift for description few have ever had.Tinged with sadness is Marjorie's relationship both as employer and friend to 'Geechee. Rawlings would attempt to help her to no avail as this sweet personality slowly became an unemployable alcoholic. Her mistreatment at the hands of a womanizer unworthy of her love was at the heart of her problem. It is perhaps at the bottom of a few bitter comments from Rawlings.But Cross Creek is about the earth and our relationship to it. When we stray from it we become less because it is a part of us. Rawlings came to believe over time that when we lose this connection to the earth, we lose a part of ourselves. The great and wondrous beauty of nature, from magnolia blossoms and rare herbs to Hayden mangos and papaya, are as much a part of this memoir as the people. Particularly hilarious are Rawlings' descriptions of a pet racoon of mischievious nature and such cantankerous disposition as to almost seem human.Rawlings' world at the creek is perhaps her legacy, a gift given to the reader we can never forget. In order to enjoy this memoir, however, one must read the entire book, taking into consideration a number of factors. Published in 1942 and covering many years prior in a backwoods area of Florida, at a time when racial equality was a distant dream, some may be offended by Rawlings' casual, though never mean spirited observations. Rawlings honestly relates actual conversations from this time and place between blacks and whites, and blacks to other blacks. Rawlings treated everyone fairly but a long string of farmhands prone to drink and violence, including the one who would destroy her friend and employee 'Geechee, prompted her to lump an entire race into one group, her friends at the creek being exceptions. I do not feel the comments of this southern woman and most gifted of writers should keep anyone from reading this most beautiful and heartwarming of memoirs.Rawlings' graceful prose, whether describing a chorus of frogs singing at night as a Brahms waltz, the scent of hibiscus drifting through the air at dusk or a myraid of dishes meticulously prepared and labored over for hours, is delightful and unforgettable. Cross Creek will make you hungry for succulent fruits, cornbread and hot biscuits with wild plum jelly, and the living of life itself.Reading this lovingly written memoir will leave you with a wistful desire to walk away from society as Rawlings did and live the life we crave in our very being, even if it is not possible, and can only be lived in our hearts.\\"Cross Creek belongs to the wind and the rain, to the sun and the seasons, to the cosmic secrecy of seed, and beyond all, to time.\\"Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings(1896-1953)"},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"I picked up a copy of this book from my mother's bookshelf and began to read it, only to find myself returning to it at every opportunity. As a black woman, I found the racial terminology the author used discomfiting, but did not let that deter me from reading the book. I thought it one of the most lyrical, thoughtful, and in-depth descriptions of a people and an area that I have ever read. Transplanted physically to Florida from Los Angeles, California a few years ago, I found myself transported mentally as well, as I read this book. I recognized Ms. Rawlings as a truly gifted writer. You will not regret having read her story."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Although I am a native-born Floridian, it was not until a bitter winter's day that I first picked up a tattered, first-print copy of Cross Creek in the old library in Hope Valley, Rhode Island, a town where I resided for five long, cold years. I missed Florida terribly, more than I had ever missed any person. From the first few paragraphs, I felt a special kinship with the author. At last, someone understood! I found great comfort in the pages of this wonderful book, with it's beautifully written, descriptive passages. Mrs. Rawlings had a deep appreciation for even the minutest details of the land, creatures and water that surrounded her. I truly wish I could have know this lady. Today I live about 25 miles from Cross Creek and visit her old homestead and groves whenever I get the chance. They have been well preserved in the condition in which she left them 45 years ago. It is easy to see where her inspiration came from when you stand in her yard among the beautiful and fragrant orange, grapefruit and tangerine trees--and when you view the creek itself. I was amazed to find the creek and farm were almost exactly as I had pictured them while reading Cross Creek. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"More than 50 years ago, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings made rural Florida her home and the subject of some of her best writing. Her humor, lyricism and nostalgia are best captured in Cross Creek.Cross Creek is a book of essays about the life and people in Marjorie's world. Some of her characterizations might not translate in our ethnically-sensitized world and I understand the author was sued by one subject who didn't appreciate her characterization. However, Marjorie's respect and affection for her subjects is apparent in every sentence. Her appreciation for the natural wonders of her world (even insects and reptiles) will refresh the perspective of those who live close to nature and create a longing in those who do not.Finally, Cross Creek is a glimpse into a long overlooked and vanishing part of the American South. Before the explosion of Orlando, a lot of Florida was rural acreage inhabited by people who lived off the land. Marjorie does not romanticize this existance; one of her wryest essays is about her long-running battle against outdoor plumbing. However, she does show the victories and tragedies of a vanishing people.Cross Creek is to be read, re-read and loved. I only wish I could discover it all over again, myself."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Over 30 years ago I found a copy of this book by Marjorie Rawlins in an English second-hand book shop and, as a former sea-cook and enthusiastic home entertainer I bought it. I cooked from it so often - particularly now living in the south - that it fell apart and I see from a note in the fly that I purchased my last replacement in 2007. This edition is even more a pleasure as it is generously illustrated by the sketches of Robert Camp.Much more than a cook book, more than a collection of easy-to-follow recipes, each of the book's chapters has a page or two of Rawlins witty comments on life in the South, on her \`help'; Idella who she clearly adores, or useful notes on technique or produce and, of course, her guests. The recipes are useful today (although Jersey Cream from her cow is a bit of a challenge) and delicious, from the percussion of her duck diner, known to bring gourmet Professors to their knees to a lyrical last chapter - \\"Better a dinner of herbs\\" - on hosting, kindness and guests.My only hesitation in offering this review is that currently there are few who seem to have found its delights - perhaps, like our favorite beauty spots - we should keep this treasure to ourselves? But no - I urge you to read it and try those recipes. Bon Appettit!"},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"As a native Floridian (although transplanted now to South Carolina), I have found the works of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings to be a welcomed homecoming and a delightful insight into the &quot;frontier&quot; Florida life of the 1930s and '40s. Rawlings' words are timeless because they animate a timeless period in Florida history--when things were still largely rural, natural, and undisturbed by capital investment and the tourism boon of the last thirty-plus years. &quot;Cross Creek,&quot; moreover, is the perfect introduction to Rawlings for the uninitiated, a moving narrative of her life and career amid the backwoods and streams of a bygone Florida. Yet &quot;Cross Creek&quot; is not simply an autobiography; it is a lavish tale in itself. I highly recommend it.I also suggest the motion picture version of &quot;Cross Creek,&quot; starring Mary Steenburgen and Peter Coyote (1982?). It has recently been re-released, so you should be able to find a copy easily. The movie is perhaps &quot;even better&quot; than the book, with its stunning cinematography of the natural beauties of Florida woods, creeks, rivers, and swamps. It stays fairly true to the book, as well, and Steenburgen and Coyote are endearing as Rawlings and Norton Baskin. Rip Torn is another wonderful addition to the cast.Pick both of these up today!"},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"Rawlings explores the lives and interations of the odd assortment of people living in Cross Creek, Florida in the early 1900s. It is often assigned reading for teens, but I doubt that most of them can appreciate it. Her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior.The lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing. Your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies. She turned those into a cookbook which I'll have to try out.Modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the N----- word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible, drunken, immoral, etc. It is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written, so recognize it as a snapshot of the times. Then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book. (I deducted 1 star for this)The reader becomes absorbed in Rawlings' love of the land and the creation of a home. It gives much the same feelings as A Year in Provence or Under a Tuscan Sun."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"This is truly a classic. The humor is so sharp that even the most urban can laugh hardily. The moral lessons are here! Marjorie Rawlings uses lots of &quot;fancy&quot; words but her message always comes across. She really transports you to a different century and you will finish the book feeling as if you have really visited Cross Creek or with a wish that you could visit now."},{"Title":"Cross Creek","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book. Before I read it I was expecting an account of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings life and how she homesteaded. While this book has some of that, it actually wasn't the type of homesteading account I thought it would be.There isn't really a set time line to this novel. She jumps around back and forth between years and seasons and people. While she does describe some life on the farm, the majority of her time is spent describing the people of Cross Creek, and not always in the friendliest of ways.Since this book was published before the civil rights movement, I expected some of the language that this book contains and knew it could be offensive. That didn't bother me. What bothered me was that it actually was racist. I could have respected Rawlings if the only time she appeared blatantly racist was just in her names of Black people. However, with the exception of a few she paints a picture of them being lazy, unintelligent, primitive, and quality only for servants. As she was quite the progressive lady in other ways during the novel (being divorced, running a farm on her own) she disappointed me in this area and it really spoiled the book for me.When she's not talking about the people of Cross Creek the book is beautiful. Luscious descriptions of food she make abound and I might have to take a look at her cookbook. She describes beautiful scenery and the passing of the seasons through her farm. She describes the harvest and the natural wildlife that frequently show up unexpected in the least likely of places (snake in the bathroom). To me, the food chapter was the saving grace of this novel. In fact, its the reason I gave it as high as three stars.If you are going to read this novel please be prepared to be offended. But also be prepared to experience the joy of running a Floridian farm.Cross CreekCopyright 1942368 pages"},{"Title":"The Illustrated World Atlas","review":"The pictures are great and it contains little bubbles of information which is informative. Eye catching. However, I have to give it one star as the environmental tone it contains really is a turn off. It would be a great book without its jabs. While some of the information has truth to it, it seems they're using blanket statements leading readers to assume \\"all\\". I don't care for books that lead young children to think one way by using lack of information. Not only so, it doesn't need to be in this book, but perhaps in a political science type book where students can actually analyze and discuss these issues.This book was bought with a Christian curriculum, so I was taken back by its environmental tone. If that doesn't bother you, or if it's read along with a parent who can discuss some of these issues, it's a great book."},{"Title":"Soccer: How to Play the Game: The Official Playing and Coaching Manual of the United States Soccer Federation","review":"IF YOU ARE A YOUTH SOCCER COACH IN THE US, THEN YOU SHOULD OWN THIS BOOK!! (and then attend your state soccer association's coaching certification classes).This book is the most complete, well organized collection of soccer coaching information that I have in my library. True, if you're looking for tactical depth, there are better texts available, but that's just it - unless you're coaching a high-level U-15 team or older, you shouldn't be burdening your players with heavy tactical instruction. LET THEM LEARN FROM THE GAME!What you do get is: - a great section on coaching philosophy - information on preventing and treating injuries - a section on teaching proper technique - a section on how to structure a productive practice - a set of exercises and games that are ready for you to insert into your next practice.Even the best intentioned coach can do damage to his/her players by over-instructing and judging his/her performance based on the number of wins his/her team has racked up in a season. Read this book and start measuring your sucess by how much your worst player has improved and how much your players look forward to your next practice.Bravo to the USSF for finally publishing a text that not only covers the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; but also provides coaches with a philosophy that will continue to nurture the growth of the sport in our country."},{"Title":"Soccer: How to Play the Game: The Official Playing and Coaching Manual of the United States Soccer Federation","review":"This has instantly become one of my two favorite coaching books.I have been coaching for seven years and playing for 22. When my son became a teenager, I was forced to take coaching more seriously and began reading coaching books voraciously. This is one of the two best soccer coaching books I have read, and I have read a lot of them. For the new coach, I know of no better introduction: it is designed to take a newcomer to the game from complete ignorance to enough knowledge to coach a reasonably experienced team. That is a very ambitious goal, and I believe it is successful -- a truly extraordinary accomplishment, and the authors should be proud.This does not mean that this is a beginner's book, however! It holds plenty of reward even for a seasoned coach. In my collection there are basically two categories of soccer books: the books focused on drills and ideas for designing practices; the books focused on strategic and philosophical issues in coaching. This book straddles both categories, and does a respectable job at it. The extensive collection of &quot;practice games&quot; include some gems that were new to me; the introductory sections on philosophy and age-appropriateness held some important reminders.My only criticism of the book is that the &quot;practice games&quot; are neither integrated into the text nor well indexed by skill. This means that the book isn't as useful as it could be as a reference; to find a drill focused on a specific weakness requires flipping through all 100-odd drills.Contrast this to my other favorite coaching book, &quot;Coaching Soccer Successfully,&quot; by Roy Rees et al. In that book, the drills are integrated into the discussion of the specific skills on which they are intended to focus, which tends to reinforce both the skill and how the game works to improve them. It is still awkward to find the drills, but at least this organization makes the utility of the drills more clear.These two books are excellent companion volumes, and I strongly recommend the pair to every coach. A more experienced coach or someone coaching an older team would probably prefer the Roy Rees book first; a less experienced coach or one working with young children would probably get more out of USSF book.Both of these books are worth the money -- and more importantly, well worth the time it takes to read them!"},{"Title":"Soccer: How to Play the Game: The Official Playing and Coaching Manual of the United States Soccer Federation","review":"This is a great book and the information contained within would greatly benefit any new coach. It gives an overview of all that is involved from early ages to high school and beyond. Coaching philosophies, rules, organization, tactics, player management conditioning, technique and more are all covered in excellent detail. It's not only packed with drills but it shows you how to successfully utilize these drills to organize practices that are enjoyable! and practical. I wish that this book was mandatory for all youth coaches (particularly 5-10yr age range). I've seen how so many of these coaches (parents too) have turned soccer from a dynamic exciting game into a passive boring one by not allowing their young players (kids) to learn from the game. You play soccer you don't drill or mandate it. Give them the ball and let them play. Ok, I think I'm finished ranting now but this is a subject that really bothers me so I'm not sure.

This large-format paperback, on heavy stock with very clear reproduction, is a quality product. However-- it doesn't work very well. The organization of the material is clumsy and the chosen method of presenting diagrams and figures was conceived by an art director with immortality in mind, and maybe he will be plaing chess with Beethoven in heaven but here on earth I can't bloody stand looking at the frozen plasticized figurines used to illustrate basic soccer technique and positions. Apparently the current thinking in book design is to dispense with headlines and subheads, so as to cause readers to wander aimlessly through the pages looking for &quot;Rule 7&quot; or &quot;How to play center mid&quot;. I have had the book six months, read it cover to cover, and subsequently consulted it two dozen times and I am here to say, alas, it achieves approximately 44 percent of its potential, which is far short of enough. Yet what is the alternative? The goal: a primer for Norteamericano parents who never played soccer and want to help teach their kids, walk the walk, talk the talk, and --look out--someday be able to fullfil the role of linesman without having bananas thrown at them. If there is a better book out there, somebody please list it in a review.

I recommend this book to all Texas educators. It is concise and provides the reader with the ability to judge the provisions of state law regarding teacher and student rights, to see the simplified version of state legislation as it affects schools, and to understand reasons for the laws enacted by legislators which so affect the education of students in Texas. Any questions an educator might have regarding any part of a law are well explained. The book's author Jim Walsh has done a magnificient job of delineating just what can and cannot be done in the classroom, what can be done by administrators and by teachers, and what effects actions of others have on students and their education. Teachers, after reading the book, can interact intelligently with administrators when dealing with situations which affect education. For so long, teachers have been told what the state law says. Now we can judge for ourselves whether or not those \\"in the know\\" really know Texas school law.

Rather than publishing a new edition, this is merely a copy of someone else's edition of the book, including marginalia and underlining. While this may interfere with an initial engagement of the book, it could present an interesting opportunity for scholarship. The publisher, however, is virtually impossible to get hold of, has no listed phone number, does not respond to email, and seems to have little accountability.

I grew up on a farm myself so much of what Miss Seredy talks about is the kind of thing I experienced, though what she describes is more like a ranch. We had a garden and pets, and we had our chores to do.We went to the fair and saw the livestock, but this description of a fair is more like a medieval fair, because they buy supplies for a year. The description of the gingerbread made me hungry because I am inordinately fond of gingerbread.what we didn't do was to get into trouble like Kate does. The story in the beginning, where Kate's aunt gives her a bowl of milk before bed, which doesn't suit Kate so she gets up in the night and has a snack of sausages while sitting on the ceiling beam, and which doesn't suit her uncle, sent me into gales of laughter. I had a mother who used to tell stories of the scrapes she got in which were similar to Kate's.Kate being unable to resist touching the crayfish and getting them stuck to her fingers is also quite believable to me. I stuck a knife in a light socket once, so I know where she's coming from. Sometimes you just have to find out these things for yourself. I had an aunt who couldn't resist touching a large pinching bug, with similar results. My grandmother laughed about that as a woman of 85. If you've never succumbed to such temptation, don't. Just read about it in this book."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"As a child I lived on military bases and devoured literally every book in the small army and Catholic school library I had access to. I was a HUGE CS LEWIS fan but my ALL time favorite book was one my mother also loved as a child and the most AMAZING color illustrations - ever! - THE GOOD MASTER by Kate Seredy. I always loved and rode horses and her stories of the great plains and horseman of Hungary made me long for that country and that lifestyle. I still have my mom's original battered and worn copy from the 30's taken with me on every move I have made in my life. This story will make you want to visit Hungary and wear the exquisite high top red boots that young Kate wore, and ride strong beautiful horses across the plains.Beautifully written with exquisite water color illustrations this is a book that a hundred years later will still be a book children (and adults) will love and treasure forever!"},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"This book, and others by this author, enriched my childhood enormously. As an only child who yearned for adventure, I identified with Kate - as a rather quiet child, I admired and envied both her high spirits and her kind heart. I longed to visit the vast plains of Hungary, so beautifully described and illustrated by Kate Seredy, and to wade in that dangerous river, wear all those petticoats and high red boots, ride a beautiful milky-white horse, and eat delicious sausages, just like Kate did! And Jancsi - who ever had a cousin as wonderful as he? Jancsi's parents' tolerant wisdom, humor and love warmed me as a young reader. In retrospect, I can now clearly see that Kate was not the only child transformed by &quot;the good master&quot;...I also was changed. For life: I became a children's librarian and thus was able to recommend this and so many other good books to literally thousands of children and their families over the years. This is a marvelous book in every way. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"This story, set in Hungary just before World War I, is a delightful story of a young motherless girl who learns the meaning of love and family with her uncle and his family out in the country. It can be enjoyed on many levels - family story, historical novel, ethnic traditions from Hungary, etc. Be sure to follow it up with the sequel \\"The Singing Tree\\" which tells of the family's life during World War I. Enthusiastically recommended!"},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"It seems I have always loved the Good Master. In fact, I first encountered it in the 5th grade. Set in pre-world War I Central Europe on a Hungarian ranch, its cast of characters, the sheperds, the old Jewish grocers, the Good Master, Janci, still inhabit my imagination. The main character, Kate, with her guts, compassion and funny bone became, along with Jo March, a personal hero and role model.This book takes a young reader completely away, visually and verbally, to another place in several other times, and sets his or her senses dancing. Unfortunately Seredy's art has fallen beneath editorial radar This book should be in the personal libary of all upper elementary students who love to read and adults who remember a child's delight in discovering a great read."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I first read this book when I was ten-years-old. My elementary school library had a copy of it, but I could never find another library with it after I left that school. I am now in college, and \\"The Good Master\\" recently resurfaced while I was browsing a used book store. I just finished it, and I still love it as much now as I did as a child.Young Jancsi, living in a farm in Hungary with his parents, is a boy trying to find his place in the world of men when Kate, his spoiled cousin from Budapest, comes to live with the family. Though initially enemies, Kate and Jancsi soon become good friends, and their fun adventures will captivate any kid. Kate grows from a sickly city girl to a strong little farmer, and she teaches Jansci to notice and appreciate aspects of his hardworking rural life that he had always taken for granted. Though the book only covers about a year, both of them have changed greatly by its end, and Jancsi has become the man he longed to be. The wise, understanding presence of Jancsi's father Marton (the \`Good Master' of the title) can be felt even in the scenes where he is not present. The book paints a colorful, detailed portrait of life in the Hungarian countryside, a culture that few Americans know anything about. Though it's aimed at 9- to 12-year-olds, I would definitely recommend \\"The Good Master\\" to adults, too."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"\\"The Good Master\\" is a wonderful book for children (adults, too!) Set in Hungary, it is the story of Jancsi and his cousin Kate, who comes from the city to live with Jancsi's family in the country. Jancsi has been looking forward to having a playmate, but Kate is not exactly what he expected. She is spoiled, wild, and their description of her as a \\"screaming monkey\\" is not far off the mark. After a rocky start, Jancsi and Kate learn to get along, and from there they become fast friends. They have plenty of adventures. For example, you will enjoy their trips to the fair and the circus; traditional Hungarian Easter and Christmas celebrations; a horse roundup; Kate's experience with some gypsies; and plenty more. Through the book Kate goes from spoiled and totally bratty to much more caring and kind- though she never loses her high spirits! This is an appealing book because it is so simple and wholesome. Also, since children love stories, \\"The Good Master\\" is filled with old stories and tales that the adults in the book tell to Jancsi and Kate. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has grade-school-age children... get it for them! They'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I want to echo the comments made by the other reviewers about this outstanding children's book. I was introduced to this wonderful book by my 4th grade teacher who read it to my class in 1980. One would think that a book written in the 1930's and set on the Hungarian plains in the years just before WWI would not appeal to &quot;modern&quot; children. Yet the entire class loved it. I loved it so much that I later read it several times on my own. This book helped instill in me a deep love of reading which I still have over nineteen years later.A well-deserved winner of the Newbery Honor Award, &quot;The Good Master&quot; is a forgotten classic. Kate Seredy's work is nowhere near as popular with children as are the works of Blume, Cleary, Dahl, and Wilder. It's a shame because &quot;The Good Master&quot; was as good a book as I ever read as a child and I was also a huge fan of the books of all those other authors. Jansci and Cousin Kate from Budapest deserve to be considered along with Peter and Fudge, Henry, Ramona, and Ribsy, Charlie and Willy Wonka, and the Ingalls family as among the greatest characters in children's fiction."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"My sixth grade teacher read it to me in 1961.

I think that this book will be great for any on who has ever yearned for adventure."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I loved this book as a child. I love this book as an adult. It is a delightful Eastern European classic about a spirited little girl and the whirlwind effect she has on her uncle's family. She is brave, active, agile and daring. I still crack up laughing over Kate's climbing on the rafters, scarfing &quot;two feet of sausages.&quot; She is a delightful, irrespressible character who helps her cousin Janci emerge from his shell. Urban and sophisticated, she is a cultural enlightenment to her farm relatives. Kate is a keeper. I love this book!"},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"This book is one of my favorite books in the entire world! I love it. It is about a boy named Jansci and his cousin Kate from Budapest. Kate seems bad at first-taking over their wagon and running away with it, splitting her skirts, climbing the rafters for sausage, and racing her boy cousin. But she changes under the hand of Jancsi's father, who is called The Good Master. Then something else good happens..."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"The Good Master and the Singing Tree were two of my favorites books ever as a child. My daughter read the books 5 years ago and we are looking for the old copies for my 11 y/o son to read now. After several moves I am not sure what box they are in so I'm ordering copies from Amazon. My son just read Philomena (really too young for him), but he loved it. My father bought every Kate Seredy book for me (he left Hungary in 1956) so I could get a feel for his life as a boy. My father has passed on, but he is remembered as my kids and I read these books together."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"Kate Seredy, Budapest-born, writer and illustrator (and a former owner of a bookstore for children) met with great success with this tale of Jansci and Kate -- reprinted and repackaged many times since the first edition of 1935. Although she won the Newbery for The White Stag, this was her first book and, arguably, her greatest success.She's an illustrator of great clarity and scope: expressive figures, simple and evocative compositions, a deft use of shadow. And her illustrations really \\"move\\" -- they're dynamic. Notably, she can also be purely decorative, borrowing with authority from folk art traditions (for example, the cover and a few of the chapter capstone illustrations.)Book details... The Viking 1st edition of 1938 was a handsome production with pre-war quality: wide margins and heavy buff paper. It went into multiple printings and the wartime impressions might be of lower quality. Cloth over hardback boards, 210 pp, 19 full page and numerous interstitial b&w; illustrations. Color map end papers. Frontisportraits of the two main characters in crayon."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I was delighted to find a copy of this book with illustrations by Kate Seredy - Her choice of color based in traditional Hungarian design is as much a part of the pre WWI story of life on the plains of Hungary. I read this story as a child after I first read 'The Singing Tree.'During 1939 and 1940 we were hearing bits of what was happening in Europe and the story in 'The Singing Tree' although about an earlier world war, brought the news down to my eight and nine year old level - I admired how the women and children kept life going until the Uncle returns. Then I had to read 'The Good Master.'There are many publications of 'The Good Master,' a story about life on the Hungarian plains, with a cover illustration taken from inside the book. However, for me it was not the same until I found a copy of the original illustrated cover with all the color and tradition of Hungarian folk art to pass on to the child of a friend.Also, there is something special about giving a gift of a used book. There is wonder in knowing someone had read the story and you are following, holding a book just as they held the book while reading the same story."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"Wonderful story of family life in Hungary pre WW I. This book in combination with its sequel THE SINGING TREE are wonderful companion pieces for the 6-8th grade reader."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"For those who haven't had a chance to read anything by Kate Seredy, this is a great starting point. We read this book for our book club for 3rd and 4th graders. They loved it! It is a heart-warming story about the love of a strong family in raising up good-natured children. You'll laugh at the funny adventures of Jancsi and Kate, and appreciate the big part that farm life plays in their upbringing."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"As an expectant mother, I've been trying to compile a collection of books for my child-to-be. Remembering back to my own childhood and the books I loved, this is the first one that came to mind. I haven't read 'The Singing Tree' in years, but the characters and the story are still as fresh in my mind as if I had read it yesterday. If you buy this incredibly well-written classic (and I hope you do), splurge and get it in hard-back; it will be treasured and read well beyond childhood."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"This is a wonderful book forupper elementary or Jr. High girls who just love horses...which is a big section of this age group. The extra bonus is that it gives them a broader picture of girls/horses than the usual stories of girls and their horses in America....this is a great story of a culture and time much removed from their own sphere of experience."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I first read this book in 1979 and loved it. In my mind, I was right there with Kate and Jancsi, especially since I was a horse-loving tomboy. Recently, I started reading it at bedtime to my 7 and 11 year-old sons. Guess what...boys love it just as much as girls! They are both utterly entranced, just as I was. After finishing this book, we plan to read the sequel. &quot;The Singing Tree&quot; is a wonderful way to gently introduce World War I to children. It stresses the effect of war on the people and the land by telling about what happened on the homefront. Read all of Seredy's books that you can get your hands on! She is a evocative, entertaining, pacifist writer!"},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"This delightful classic chronicles the life of a Hungarian farm family in the early 1900s. Their lives are seemingly placid and rather insular (the boy Jansci cannot read at 10 and has never set foot in a classroom) and the expectation is to maintain the homeland.Things come to an abrupt change when hurricane Kate barrels in from Budapest, the \\"big city.\\" Her father is at a loss with Kate and feels she would thrive in the country with his brother's family. Bright, high spirited and irrepressible, Kate describes taxis and telephones, things her aunt and uncle and cousin have never seen. She refuses milk, she climbs up on the stove (\\"that big beehive,\\" as she called it because of the shape) to hide up on the rafters, eating the sausages that hung there. Her poor uncle is up in arms with his spirited young niece; Jansci, on the other hand is captivated by her. Active, agile and daring, Kate is fearless. She takes to horseback riding and encourages her more timorous cousin to ride across the Hungarian plains with her. She even teaches Jansci how to read.An excellent historical and cultural look at Hungary in the days prior to WWII, this timeless classic will remain a cherished favorite. It is also a good teaching tool. I still love this book. Kate was a delightful, strong female character and I love the way her spirit remained unbroken."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I had never heard of this book before I found it on Amazon and looked at reviews. My granddaughter is 8 and is an advanced reader with an outstanding vocabulary, but she is still only 8 and is not ready to process disturbing material--and I don't want her to internalize it! So I choose books and read them myself. This 1935 book has a bucolic setting in Hungary, but the farm is not idealized, and the characters all work hard at chores. The two children have engaging personalities, naughty in a Tom Sawyer kind of way, and the action is lively and dangerous but no one is ever seriously injured. The only possibly disturbing sequence is in a storytelling segment about Atilla the Hun (these are after all Hungarian characters) in which his military history is told in plain terms. Raiding and fighting and killing are mentioned, but not raping. The context is a legend that the Milky Way is Atilla's army, which can come back from the sky. All in all, the story is encouraging, uplifting, wholesome, and entertaining--but in no way namby-pamby or prissy. This would be a good read-aloud book."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"A teacher read this book to my class when I was in the 5th grade. I loved it and always imagined that Kate and Jansci were fast friends of mine and that I could share their many adventures. I now have three children of my own and have shared it with them more than once. I consider this book a very important part of my childhood and I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"This book and it's sequel, The Singing Tree, are the reasons that I am such an avid book reader. My mother read this book to me as a child, and when I have children, I will read this to them as well.This story is a wonderful tale about life in a different time and a different place, and the best things in life."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I found this book (an older edition from the 60s) in a local thrift shop and fell in love with the cover and the illustrations. I showed the book to my children and began reading it to them. Now, every evening, they ask me to read a chapter to them....as I read, they listen attentively to see what will happen next...and I am just as excited to learn what will happen next. I have two children, a son who is 10 and a daughter who is 8. Both love the book and talk about the characters often. My daughter even wants to be Kate for Halloween (in her Easter outfit). It's a beautiful story of life and tradition in another country. It teaches respect for elders and others. We LOVE this book and plan to read her others...soon."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"The rave reviews of this book are true. Kate Seredy (prounounced SHARE-ed-ee) did a wonderful job on this book. My children (a girl, 9, and a boy, 6) both really loved this book, and it's not always easy to find stories that suit both of them at the same time. To tell the truth, I think my wife and I fully enjoyed the book as much as the children. Buy the hardcover, because it's likely to become a well-worn favorite.I really can't praise Seredy enough on her work in this book - it's full of life, makes good points and lessons, is fun and humorous, a well-told story, and has beautiful charcoal illustrations by the author. (I only wish these drawings were presented in a finer fashion, as befits them. One can only hope this will be remedied in a future edition.)Apparently, Seredy started out as an illustrator of children's books, and only began writing late in her career. Too bad, because she is a master of both crafts, and one suspects there is a strong autobiographical element in the charming but mischievous character of Kate. Whatever its genesis, this is a spellbinding tale. Buy this book - your children will love having it read to them, and you will love reading it."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"The Good Master, and its sequel, The Singing Tree, are based on Seredy's own childhood. In The Good Master, Kate is sent to live on her Uncle Marton's farm. Headstrong and willful, Kate is a handful for her uncle, aunt, and cousin. She matures, though, learning to love the farm and its people. In addition to a warm, wonderful narrative, this book is filled with traditional Hungarian legends which are related to Kate by the shepherds, millers, and other workers who live on Uncle Marton's farm."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"A wonderful book for children between reading age and adolescence. The city cousin-country cousin story has been done many times, but Kate Seredy introduces the reader to life on a Hungarian farm while engaging the reader with both Jancsi (country boy) and Kate (city girl). Still a book I pick up and re-read, and I'm pushing thirty."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"Returning to her roots (THE WHITE STAG,1938 Newbery Winner) Kate Seredy shares a nostalgic portrait of the Hungarianplains in this Newbery Honor book. The relatively peaceful lifestyle of Jancsi and his farming parents is shattered by the arrival of Kate, a whirlwind from Budapest. City clashes with country as the cousins verbally battle it out; this tomboy in skirts creates turmoil both indoors and and out, in private and in public.But as the seasons melt into each other until Christmas, this \\"frail\\" but impossible child is gradually tamed by love, respect and the majestic landscape itself--not to mention plenty of hard work! No one in the Nagy family can bear to part with her, but what about her distant father who misses her terribly? Honoring her heritage, Seredy also incorporates four Hungarian folktalkes into her heartwarming story--sharing with American readers the real meaning of the Christmas spirit.Excellent black/white illustraions contribute to the charm of this gentle delight."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I was first exposed to this story in 5th grade back in the 1960s. It's been one of my favorites ever since.As a teacher, I read the story to my class. They were enthralled by the adventures of Kate & Janci. I used the story as part of my multi-cultural program. Besides giving a glimpse into what the world was like when their grandparents and great grandparents were young, the way the author incorporates customs and folk lore into her books expands the horizons of my students on many levels. Through the years I've shared this book with hundreds of children in many grade levels. Both boys and girls can relate and Kate is not hampered by out-dated expectations of being a \\"good\\" girl. She is as robust and couragous as her male cousin.I'm now buying this and the sequel, The Singing Tree for my god daughter.Whether they can read the adventures for themselves or are listening to the tale as part of a nightly installment, children will enjoy participating vicariously in the adventures of Kate & Jansi."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"This was my favorite book from my childhood-- it is a classic children's novel full of great Hungarian folktales and tall tales. It is very autobiographical for the author. Kate Seredy should be an author every child reads at least sometime. I still love this book and bought it to give to my child's teacher."},{"Title":"The Good Master","review":"I adore this book. It makes me wish I lived on the plains of Hungary on a ranch like this family. The Good Master is the story of two twelve year old cousins growing up and learning what it is to be a good, respectful and hardworking person. Jansci, the son of the \\"Good Master\\", is excited for his cousin Kate to come from Budapest to live with them. That is until she gets there. She is not used to living in the country and gets into many different \\"adventures\\". The time setting is about 1900 because the next book The Singing Tree is about WWI. The Good Master is just a wonderful book that everyone will love."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"A sad and wondrous Game it is with options, stocks, and quotes galore.Why do we worry about oil or soybeans?

It started my early education in managing money and great nonfiction writing. The Money Game is a series of vignettes and stories about people trying to achieve fortune and fame and peace of mind on Wall Street. It is not a textbook, although you will learn the fundamental principles of fear and greed and the basics of investment strategies as told through a specific story or person.While The Money Game is a book about money, it is an excellent example of first rate nonfiction writing. In my own writing throughout a long publishing life in academic publication, I have returned to The Money Game for examples of well structured chapters and nicely turned sentences. 'Adam Smith' (the pseudonym for George Goodman) is one of the best writers I've encountered. His style is made more apparent through reading the following companion book to The Money Game, Super Money. If you read both books back to back, the structure and style jumps out almost like a teacher writing an equation on the board."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"\\"If I really had a system for making money in the market and it worked all the time, first of all, I wouldn't tell anybody and second of all, I would soon have just about all the money there is.\\" Adam Smith p. 122Thank you for being so honest. Amazingly this book has helped me more than all the other \\"How to make millions in the stock market\\" books I have read. It is well-written and filled with information, humor, advice and wisdom. It touches on everything from the fabled Mister Johnson (I have a strong suspicion that Peter Lynch got his inspiration for One Up On Wall Street from this book) to charting and random walk theory. The reader is encouraged to find his own trading style and use the wealth of information from the book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"I have recently been reading books about investing written (or revised) before 1980. It is amazing what you can learn from history. Let me tell you, nothing is new in the investing world, at all, and this book really shows that. This is a great book that can really help provides perspective for thinking about contemporary issues, you should read it."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"A humorous but instructive read for anyone who's interested in the stock market. George Goodman's prediction of brokers going public did come true, for better or worse. The cocoa chapter will convince anyone to avoid commodities.Like others, I first read this book many years ago. I was wondering if I'd still find it as enjoyable and relevant as I did then. The answer is yes.The investing world has changed, of course. Huge conglomerates of unrelated businesses eventually broke up, for example, and we no longer have to wait for the morning paper to find out closing prices... in 1/8s. But the personalities \\"Adam Smith\\" introduces us to are a constant, still playing The Game, and his Irregular Rules still apply."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"\\"The Money Game\\" was a game changer for me. It helped me get my first job in the investment industry in 1979, and it has helped me to see my way through financial crises ever since.I first read \\"The Money Game\\" just before going to an interview for my first job in funds management. I got the job. Since then, I've re-read \\"The Money Game\\" several times, mostly during financial crises such as the 1987 stock market crash, the 1997 Asian economic crisis, the Internet bubble and again during the recent subprime mortgage debacle and European financial crisis.There are many insightful and quotable lines in this book. One of my favourite quotes is: \\"The identity of the investor and the investment decision must be coldly separate .... for the market has a way of inducing humility in even its most successful students ... you have to be able to step outside yourself and see yourself objectively.\\"\\"The Money Game\\" is not a book about stock selection techniques, though the writer gives a witty overview of the main approaches. It is a book about market psychology. Reading \\"The Money Game\\" helps you cultivate the right mental attitudes to be a good investor. Written during the 1960s the humour is not always correct by today's standards. However, it is insightful, witty and fun to read."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"This is a classic about the stock market and investing. George covers a breadth of topics in that area based on his insider experience. This includes the psychology of the investor (\\"you\\"), IT systems and their impact on the investing field, the professional money managers and their role in the Game etc. The concepts are introduced in an accessible, and often humorous style. While the author does not offer direct investing advice, he does expose what he calls \\"the biases\\" that exist in the market - that are essential to take into account to be successful together with good judgment.George is very successful at immersing the reader into the culture, the psychology and way of thinking that dominates the financial markets and its participants. While this book is dated, most of the concepts discussed still apply to the financial industry today. A recommended read for anyone looking to gain more insight into the Stock Market.Below are excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:1) \\"If you are a successful Game player, it can be a fascinating, consuming, totally absorbing experience, in fact it has to be. It it is not totally absorbing, you are not likely to be among the most successful, because you are competing with those who do find it absorbing.\\"2) \\"The irony is that this is a money game and money is the way we keep score. But the real object of the Game is not money, it is the playing of the Game itself. For the true players, you could take all the trophies away and substitute plastic beads or whale's teeth; as long as there is a way to keep score, they will play.\\"3) \\"In short, if you really know what's going on, you don't even have to know what's going on to know what's going on.\\"4) \\"You must use your emotions in a useful way...Your emotions must support the goal you're after...You must operate without anxiety.\\"5) \\"The strongest emotions in the marketplace are greed and fear. In rising markets, you can almost feel the greed tide begin...the greed itch begins when you see stocks move that you don't own.\\"6) \\"If you know that the stock doesn't know you own it, you are ahead of the game. You are ahead because you can change your mind and your actions without regard to what you did or thought yesterday.\\"7) \\"Who makes the really big money? The inside stockholders of a company do, when the market capitalizes the earnings of that company.\\"8) \\"What you want is the company which is about to do that (compounding earnings) over the next couple of years. And to do that, you not only have to know that the company is doing something right, but what it is doing right, and why these earnings are compounding.\\"9) \\"What I have told you is a set of biases so you can make your own judgement.\\"10) \\"It is an informal thesis of charting that there are roughly four stages of stock movement. These four are: 1) Accumulation: To make a perfect case, let us say the stock has been asleep for a long time, inactively trade. Then the volume picks up and probably so does the price. 2) Mark-up...Now the supply may be a bit thinner, and the stock is more pursued by buyers, so it moves up more steeply. 3) Distribution. The Smart People who bought the stock early are busy selling it to the Dumb People who are buying it late, and the result is more or less a standoff, depending on whose enthusiasm is greater. 4) Panic Liquidation. Everybody gets the hell out, Smart People, Dumb People, \\"everybody.\\" Since there is \\"no one\\" left to buy, the stock goes down.\\"11) \\"Does this mean that charts can be ignored? Perhaps charts can be a useful tool even without inherent predictive qualities. A chart can give you an instant portrait of the character of a stock, whether it follows a minuet, a waltz, a twist, or the latest rock gyration. The chart can also sometimes tell you whether the character of the dancer seems to have changed.\\"12) \\"The computer is going to sanctify charting. The Chartists are on their way.\\"13) \\"The characteristics of performance are concentration and turnover. By concentration, as I said before, I mean limiting the number of issues. Limiting the number of issues means that attention is focused sharply on them, and the ones that do not perform well virtually beg to be dropped off...Furthermore, you are going to be scouting for the best six ideas, because if you find a really good one it may bump one of your other ones off the list. Turnover means how long you hold the stocks...All that turover has doubled the volume in the last couple of years, and the brokers are getting very rich.\\"14) \\"The further we come along, the more apparent becomes the wisdom of the Master in describing the market as a game of musical chairs. The most brilliant and perceptive analysis you can do may sit there until someone else believes it too, for the object of the game is not to own some stock, like a faithful dog, which you have chosen, but to get to the piece of paper ahead of the crowd. Value is not only inherent in the stock, it has to be value that is appreciated by others...It follows that some sort of sense timing is necessary, and you either develop it, or you don't.\\"15) \\"The aspiration of the people are a noble thing and no one is against jobs. But it does seem easy to produce them with currency rather than productivity. Central governments soon learn the utility of a deficit. It is convenient to take the views of the economists who followed Keynes and spend money during recessions. There are even problems on that side of the equation, because even with the breadth of statistical reporting and with computer, speed, this kind of economics is still inexact, and the central government can find itself pressing the wrong lever at the wrong time.\\"16) \\"The love of money as a possession - as distinguished from love of money as a means to the enjoyments and realities of life - will be recognized for what it is, a somewhat disgusting morbidity, one of those semi-criminal, semi-pathological propensities which one hands over with a shudder to the specialists in mental disease.\\""},{"Title":"The money game","review":"I found it a great book.it's not \\"technical\\", but showed me many new things and approaches to the market.it's not a novel, but I assure I laughed out loud in the middle of the night!it's not about \\"psychology\\", but the last chapter made me understand much more about my inner thoughts on me-as-a-trader than a whole book...I would recommend for the ones who, having red about ten books on \\"how to trade, and be a millionare....\\", would like to taste something different.but only if they like, also, reading good books."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"It's an actually must-read for all investors. This is an extreme excellent book and can be treated as one of the first pioneer books about behavior finance. All the ideas in the book are what behavior finance scholars try to model.

Moreover, George Goodman's witty nuances show that he knows economics much more than the average finance journalist. His descriptions of technical analysis and efficient market theory are superb... Perhaps most amazing is the similarity of the passages on the 60's high tech bubble to the late 90's madness."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"That's the beauty of this book, it's based on actual experiences of a Wall St Insider during the '60s. I have to give it 5 since there just not many investment related books out there that are funny, informative, and a good read."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"If you liked Livermore'sReminiscences of a Stock Operator: With New Commentary and Insights on the Life and Times of Jesse Livermore (Annotated Edition), you might like this book about the stock market from the late 1960s. The book certainly gives you a perspective of the markets at the time, written by somebody who probably considered himself more thoughtful/analytical than Livermore. The author is more analytical than Livermore, but not much. Most of the essays have a very smug style as opposed to curious. The book is written by somebody that was centrally positioned in the investment social network at the time. With such a position you get the conventional wisdom, which most of the time is fairly correct. However, it does not make for interesting insight. For instance we get the standard trashing of technical analysis without any curiosity whatsoever. I do not particularly like war stories, so I cannot say I enjoyed this book very much. However, the book is well-written and a minor classic according to some that I do not know. If you like war stories you will probably like this book. Personally, I would only consider this a two star book."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"This book is an excellent take on the Wall Street speculator-financial manipulator crowd as it existed in the late 1960's when the regulatory apparatus had not been captured/deregulated and was still in place to protect the \\"sober \\" people from the Wall Street crowd of projectors,imprudent risk takers,and prodigals,to use the description of the original Adam Smith.The only problem with this book is that the present day writer who calls himself Adam Smith does not cover the real Adam Smith in a satisfactory way.He does understand his Keynes from the expose made by Keynes in chapter 12 of the GT(1936) about the deleterious impact of the speculators on Wall Street on the economic prospects of Main Street."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"The book was written to summarize the experience of the 1960's.

The book doesn't offer a hint. The author tells about what technical analysts do, what fundamental analysts do, and how the random walk behavior of stocks thwarts both types of analysts. After reading this book, one would think the succesful investors just have a feel for &quot;the game,&quot; but the author does not do a good job telling the reader how the succesful investors apply technical and fundamental analysis. To be fair, he does mention some anecdotal reports of some investors, but he does not publish the record of these investors in a way that would make me respect their philosophies.If you want to learn how to apply analysis for making money in the stock market read Peter Lynch's books Beating the Street and One Up on Wall Street, read Malkiel's book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, read Jack Bogle's new book on mutual funds, read all of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reports, and subscribe to Outstanding Investor's Digest.The one interesting point in The Money Game worth learning is that corruption has ALWAYS been a part of Wall Street. All earnings reports should be taken with a grain of salt unless you're an expert in analysing them! Companies have been managing their earnings for decades! Wall Street is like any other market: Caveat Emptor"},{"Title":"The money game","review":"I studied finance in college and I think I could have just read this book instead of most of the finance classes I took.First of all, \\"The Money Game\\" starts out with the thesis that the stock market and all other equity markets are just a game. It is not long-term investing that wins in this game for most. This would be heresy for most finance professors and financial planners out there. One example from the book involves a family that passed IBM stock down from generation to generation, it was only sold to cover estate taxes. Many members in the family became very wealthy. However, they worked just hard as their cohorts with no money, and the buy and hold stretagy profited them almost nothing despite the fact that they were \\"wealthy.\\" Another example is a man who died in the late 1800s with a portfolio worth over $1,000,000. By the time the inheretence was passed down, the portfolio was worth 0, as the companies had gone out of business.\\"The Money Game\\" gives a great explanation of crital issues such as technical analysis, fundamental analysis, mass psychology, mutual funds and their managers, \\"performance\\" vs. more conservative funds, accounting practices, random walk theory, \\"valuation\\" of equities, and most importantly the money game itself.Ever wonder how a company like Priceline.com could be worth more than the market capitalization of all the airline stocks put together? This book explains how something so out of whack can happen and gives many examples.In this game, money is how you keep score. When someone is making lots of money, they are winning the game. When they are loosing money, they are loosing the game. But the game is there to be played, win, lose, or draw. For the players, it's just too tempting to stay in, it is vital, it is life for many."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"This is a great book on many levels, for both investors and non-investors.The setting is Wall Street in the late 1960s. Alcohol flows freely, and smoking is not taboo (don't forget about sex, these were the \\"Go-Go Years\\"). It is an almost exclusively male, smaller, whiter, and more white-shoe environment (most women in the book are referred to as \\"pretty young things\\"). Nevertheless, don't let the differences fool you; there are many things to be learned in this tale told from the inside.New York has come into its own as a financial center in the 1960s, and the electricity in the air is communicated through the pages. London, which was more of a co-equal in the prior, twenties bull market, is now a shadow, with Wall Street houses decorating their dining rooms with (page 223) \\"...paneling [that has] been flown over from busted merchant banks in the City of London...\\" The foundations of the confident World Trade Center are being drawn up. Older Depression-era Wall Street hands are still dominant, but as the Vietnam War hovers in the background, cracks in the establishment are beginning to show as twenty and thirty something \\"gunslinger\\" investment managers show up on the scene.Almost every major investment paradox or problem we face today is foreshadowed in miniature in this book. As a work of literature, it combines an engaging text with profound underlying meaning. The chapter \\"What Do the Numbers Mean?\\" on aggressive accounting was eerily prescient.The constant presence of John Maynard Keynes and Sigmund Freud as background figures to the culture of the times left an odd taste in my mouth, but the author (George J.W. Goodman, writing under the pen name \\"Adam Smith\\") never missed a beat in deftly applying their insights to the world of finance. The book has a strong undercurrent of behavioral finance, but it's about much more than that. There's a lot of humor, but there is also tragedy, when he recounts the tale of burnt-out and broke ex-millionaire Harry (many names are changed in the book to protect anonymity):(p. 93) \\"Time is getting shorter,\\" Harry said. \\"I'll be forty soon. You have to do what you're going to do. All professionals use leverage. You have to, or you end up just another face in the crowd, someone who worked on the Street thirty years and saw a lot of markets and retired with a hundred and twenty thousand dollars. That's no reason to be on the Street.\\"(p. 96) \\"[Goodman comments on Harry's misfortune] We all know what a millionaire is, and when the adding machine says, \\"$1,000,000,\\" there is a beaming figure facing it. But when the machine says 00.00 there should be no one at all because that identity has been extinguished, and the trouble is that sometimes when the adding-machine tape says 00.00 there is still a man there to read it.\\"Read this book, whether you are an investor, English major or engineer. You'll get a lot out of it."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"I've read hundreds of investing books; skimmed hundreds more; even written one myself. But dare it be said: This beautifully written work may well be the best book on the subject ever written. Not because it covers everything, or promises to make you rich. But because it offers timeless insights into how players, amateur and professional, really do play the game, and thereby gives you rich food for thought on how, or whether, you should play. Sure, you won't find anything on program trading, IRAs, 401k's, the great fund boom, or dot com stocks. However, that just goes to show that you needn't read today's papers to truly learn today's market. A bestseller in its day, there is still something for everyone here. Simply put, The Money Game is a classic, the first book on investing you should read."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"'Adam Smith's' The Money Game presents the reader with some interesting musings on modern finance, as practiced in the late 1960s, and depressingly, today. The book's content actually came from a group of (in)famous essays submitted by the fictitious Mr. 'Smith' to a variety of financial publications during the Fabulous Go-Go Years which spanned from about the mid-1960s to early 1971.In this book, we see the market revealed for what it truly is. All markets consist of people, and contrary to popular belief (and all common sense), not all people participate in financial markets to make money. Such insights make up the core theme of the book, and Mr. 'Smith' explores this theme in detail in the first part of the book. While it is true that many people do come to the market to make money and hopefully get (filthy) rich, and equally true that most people exit the market chastened, embarassed and with empty pockets, wallets and bank and equity accounts, most secretly approach the market as either a diversion from an otherwise staid and desultory life, a form of entertainment and excitement, or as some sort of perverse challenge. The truly successful in the marketplace, however, approach it as a game, like any other, and as such have acquired a philosophical outlook on the markets and life. As such, shades of Nasim Nicholab Taleb's remarkable financial book, Fooled by Randomness, resonate with particular force with this book. Thus, Mr. 'Smith' admonishes the reader to understand our reasons for participating in the market, and along the way, he divulges the real secret to getting rich in the stock market (besides either running the market or being some sort of middleman in the market). Mr. 'Smith' also admonishes potential players to look upon the market as a Game (with a capital 'g'), and this particular insight makes for the second major theme of the book. Here he relies on the words of Lord Keynes and the legendary founder of the Fidelity Group for support.In Part Two of the book, he puts both ivory tower foolishness and market foolishness to the test, and as most intelligent readers might accurately guess, both fail spectacularly. Based on his treatment, we learn that the random walk theory and the Dow theory share opposite sides of the same coin. Adherents to one or the other champion them with equal fervor (and trash their counterparts with the zeal of religious fanatics), and while one says that prices can be predicted from the past moves, and the other says no such luck, both profess to be the one true path to riches. Part Two really gets to the heart of investing. Who has the best system? It turns out that nobody does, and that is the central message, along with the fallibility of numbers, trends and past data (and the slavish and potentially bankrupting reliance on computers and programmed trading). All 'systems' for money-making depend on the analysis of the past to determine the future, and though this works well in the controlled environment of the science lab, it fails spectacularly in the uncontrolled marketplace.In Part Three, Mr. 'Smith' paints a disturbing picture of professional money managers. The reader gets to see the pros in action, and even though the pros have more money and information, they too often act as clueless as the Little Guy whose money they take and quite often berate. Part Four of the book allows us to partake in a little roasting of the financial doomsayers, ever-present then as they are now, and always seeing signs of the Apocalypse in every upward or downward movement in one or more economic indicators. Here, Mr. 'Smith' reminds us that goldbugs and other fear mongering speculators and opportunists will always be with us so long as there are marketplaces in which to trade.Part Five winds up the book, and Mr. 'Smith' reminds the reader that in the end, the market and investing are best approached when looked upon as a Game. Whether it is the Go-Go Sixties or internet New Economy Nineties, the players and their passions, hopes, dreams and desires all remain the same. Change the names and the dates and you really couldn't say for sure if you were in one period or the other. The wise reader would do well to look inward first before making any outward financial moves going forward. Readers of this book who desire to learn more about the history and cyclical nature of business, industry, markets and money may want to read Devil Take The Hindmost by Edward Chancellor."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"I gave this book 5 stars for a few reasons, it kept me entertained, it is funny, it is very true, it also relates perfectly to todays markets and market participants.\\"The more things change, the more they stay the same\\" I don't know who originally said that, but it really does apply to the financial markets. The author paints a great picture of the markets during the 60s and you will have a hard time reconciling the fact that he is not talking about the present day.Its a good book and I recommend it highly for any investor."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"Much to my surprise, I find myself in agreement with a prize winning economist. (Paul Samuelson has dubbed The Money Game a \\"modern classic,\\" and it is).A brief but insanely great read, Adam Smith made me laugh out loud at least half a dozen times with his dry sarcasm and sardonic wit. If Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is an all-time ultimate classic for traders, then The Money Game is one of the all-time ultimate classics for investors.Written almost a decade before I was born, the book is just as relevant today as it was in the latter half of the sixties. The high flyers Smith writes about are so similar to those of the 1990's bubble, it is literally as if nothing but the symbols have changed (and perhaps the clothing styles). Sixties screamers like Brunswick and Solectron were bid up to hundreds of times earnings, then flamed out and fell through the floor with spectacular declines of 90% or more... just like the JNPR's and CMGI's and JDSU's of our more \`enlightened' age. The Great Winfield, master tape reader of his day, is the perfect 1960's equivalent to the dotcom daytrader banging bids on Island or Selectnet. The technical analysts of the sixties, with their punch cards and their vacuum tube computers, are in perfect harmony with the high powered number crunchers and stochastics trackers of today.And when Smith discusses the complete and utter wackiness of corporate accounting methods, complete with a hundred and one ways to massage earnings statements six ways to Sunday while technically remaining within the law, you would swear he is foreshadowing the fall of Enron. And of course there is good old John Jerk, proud representative of the uninformed public... buying high, selling low, and generally getting taken behind the woodshed, just as he still is today.The old hands are always saying that the game is the same. (Jesse Livermore said it 80 years ago... no doubt some ancient mariner passed such words on to him.) Young gunslingers and wet behind the ears traders nod and smile, because they know the old timers are wise--yet the youngsters are still nave enough to harbor doubts in the back of their minds as to whether it is true. Is the game really and truly always the same? Couldn't it be different this time? Couldn't it?The Money Game goes a long way in putting the question to rest. There is no way a book written in 1966 could sound perfectly suited to 2001, no way that bowling stocks and fiber-optic packet-switching stocks could give near identical performances under mania circumstances, unless the game is indefinitely, immutably the same.And why shouldn't it be? We can put a man on the moon, but we certainly aren't any more humble or mature than we were yesterday. Our collective knowledge may increase, but greed and fear do as brisk a business as ever.Bravo Adam Smith (or should I say George Goodman). I don't know if you are even still alive to read this praise, but your book is as fresh today as it was the day you wrote it."},{"Title":"The money game","review":"It is difficult to express in words what a joy reading this little gem was. Very little escapes Smith's survey of the market, its nature, its winners, its losers and (importantly) its dreamers. Smith's keen observations combined with his wry wit make \\"The Money Game\\" a pure pleasure. No, it didn't make me millions (it's not designed to), but the understanding I gained about \\"the game\\" makes it hands down the best work on the stock market I've ever read.To \\"useless book\\": come back to this book in a few years.

This is proof that most investment bankers and fund managers are complete morons, especially in the light that they haven't changed in over 40 years (same mistakes and bad attitudes year after year).This should be mandatory reading for anyone considering a glamorous career involving trading or any type of Exchange.

Khuri then examines how the body in Arab-Islamic communities communicates messages, attitudes and feelings through body movement, facial expressions and gesture. Using the Qu'ran as his main focus, Khuri develops a framework to show that body ideology affects behaviors and the day-to-day interaction between people.Khuri divides his book into two sections to investigate the ideological assumptions concerning body ideology and body language in Arab-Islamic culture. He begins with body ideology to set up a framework, which he then uses to analyze body language. First, he describes how the physical becomes spiritual through the performance of rituals (prayer, fasting, rites of passage). Through the performance of these rituals, the body becomes a vehicle for spirituality and this spirituality is expressed through its physical attributes. He then extends this notion to discuss body ideology and how it differs between Islam and Christianity and between men and women. The differences can be seen in the contrast between the idea of being spiritually pure (tahir) and spiritually polluted (najis). He points out that these are the main categories of classification but they do not necessarily reflect inherent qualities in humanity and nature and argues the point of Mary Douglas, that pollution is a quality of creatures that is difficult to classify. Indeed, the qualities of purity and pollution change and have the ability to affect other creatures and substances. Substances such as blood and semen are examined in a deeper context because they, like humanity, have a dual nature. Blood is polluted when it flows unintentionally or naturally but if shed intentionally, it is pure and causes purity. Unlike blood, Semen is always polluted and causes pollution whether it flows intentionally or unintentionally, but at the same time, it must be recognized that semen is a source of human life.Once an understanding of body ideology is in place, Khuri goes on to discuss the connection with body language and distinguishes between language, body language and sign language. Body language is connected to the spoken word but has its own separate domain and certain localisms, which vary in different cultures. Khuri focuses on posture where the body in its entirety transmits meaningful messages by the amount of social distance in interaction and the strategies of sitting in different contexts. Also examined are gestures and movements, which signify different emotions, moods and personal characteristics. Khuri extends these ideas to show that body ideology and body language come together to form among Arabs the \`Antara complex', the belief that love goes in one direction, the direction of a women loving a man and not the reverse. Finally, Khuri raises the issue of freedom in research and writing and finds that when one abides by Islamic shari'a, considerable freedom is allowed. He ends his book wondering if these freedoms extend to political action and social reform, ideas that unfortunately go undeveloped.Although Khuri's succeeds in his objective to relate body ideology to body language in Arab-Islamic contexts, his investigation relies strongly on structural oppositions. The interesting part of binary oppositions is the space between, the area that connects the two poles and brings the differences together. Had Khuri explored these connections, the first part of his book would have reached a deeper level of analysis that this topic deserves, instead of being stunted as a description and summary of conclusions based on specific suras from the Qu'ran. In addition, a large amount of the book is spent discussing the contrast between Islam and Christianity; a topic that although interesting is not necessarily pertinent to his goal, that of body ideology in Islamic culture. Khuri concludes his book by bringing up the topic of freedom in academic writing when justified with a religious goal. This too seems off topic and like the contrast between Christianity and Islam, would be better if left to a different investigation. The fact that Khuri incorporates a large amount of extraneous materials leads me to the conclusion that this subject area warrants further exploration. Perhaps Khuri would have been more successful had he continued the book further developing his ideas from the final chapter titled \\"A Viewpoint for discussion\\".The Body in Islamic Culture does make the case that body ideology impacts body language and communication. This topic is important because understanding the differences people have in communicating helps to connect cultural contexts and respecting the different and varied viewpoints that other people hold. It would be beneficial if Khuri continued to develop ideas about the contrasts in Christianity and Islam, what perhaps his findings mean for the treatment of women and how body ideology and body language impacts national relations between Arab-Islamic and Western countries."},{"Title":"Yu-Gi-Oh!

This is the first updated book I have found on the subject.The book lays out in logical order the basics of leather, working with it, construction techniques and variety of projects that use those techniques in modular fashion.The book is easy to follow, the project instructions are not cluttered with commentary, and are concise. This book is excellent for a beginner who has had no experience in making shoes and sandals at home, and does not assume a great knowledge in any one craft. Instructions as to what tools are needed, how to buy leather and findings, and finishing are all included. Willingness to try something new and a little time is all that is needed on your part. (plus a trip to the craft and leather stores!)The kind of shoes and sandals presented in this book are suitable for most casual wear. The style of construction used doesn't lend itself well to what most people would consider business-like or formal shoes. They will be sturdy and if you construct them well, I see no reason why they wouldn't last as long as any commercially available shoe.Although it is not stated in the book - all the projects are clearly designed for women. But the book shows you the basics of creating your own patterns. After all - feet are feet - no matter who they are on, so with a little creativity you can design your own patterns (and choose materials) that would compliment a man's outfit, with the instructions in this book.One minor disapointment, the book does not have a project for strap sandals. However the author has a thoughtful website and sells several additional patterns (to be used with the techniques in this book) for sale at very minimal cost.The author also includes some colorful trivia and history on shoes, througout the book."},{"Title":"Crafting Handmade Shoes: Great-Looking Shoes, Sandals, Slippers & Boots","review":"From the book you learn to make simple flat to low-heeled shoes.

The book is out-of-print but available for $25 directly from the author over the Internet simpleshoemaking.com. The book is black and white, with color photographs on the cover and worth its price. It is in no way worth the ridiculous price asked by second-hand dealers.I also recommend \\"Make Your Own Shoes\\" by Mary Wales Loomis, which shows how to make higher-heel elegant ladies' shoes from fabric on your sewing machine.

I would have thought a host of expensive and hard-to-find tools and materials would have been necessary to create \\"real\\" shoes, but that's not necessarily true, as laid out in this book. Sure, if you want leather shoes (as opposed to fabric), it will cost a little, but you can make one of the more simple designs in this book and not have to invest a lot of dough. The author even suggests taking the finished upper portion of your shoe to a shoe repair shop to have soles put on it...Sound wonderful to me, although I haven't tried to find a shop locally to see if that's really do-able.At any rate, if you want to make serious shoes, this book is definitely for you.

The book is well presented so it looks like everything should be in order but when you actually really try to put it into practice as I have tried to do (for two days of my holidays!) it just doesn't add up. I have read some other reviews that actually commend the book; the only explainations that I can think of for this is that: 1. the reviewers haven't actually tried following the instructions to make shoes, 2. they are relatives of the author and are trying to promote the book, 3. they have a completely different copy to the one I have."},{"Title":"Crafting Handmade Shoes: Great-Looking Shoes, Sandals, Slippers & Boots","review":"This book really stimulated my imagination and inspired me to make a pair of shoes.

It's one of those where we have to go through it 4-5 times before she's ready to put it down, and even then she often comes back to this book. Many times I've found her in her room, quietly turning the pages and making noises at the cute animals. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"I bought this book for my son when he was 10 months old. He is now 16 months and still loves it. It's so tattered and torn that we had to buy him a new one. It't definitly a book you'll read over and over and over."},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"This is my one-year-old son's favorite book! He loves playing peekaboo, touching the texture of the animals, learning the animals' names, looking at himself in the mirror on the last page, and this book taught him what it means to kiss! Now he opens the flaps and kisses the animal! It's so cute. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"I took a chance and bought this- for far more- at a book store for my daughter who was 4 months old at the time. I couldn't believe how much she loved it and loves it still at 7 months. Rubbing the furry animals inside is her favorite part. I find myself getting into the book as well by making the sounds the animal would make. A good deal, price wise, too. The book store was almost double the cost! I plan to buy more of his books soon."},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"We were given this book when I had my first child. He LOVED it. He would kiss all the animals over and over, opening each flap to do so. Pretty soon he was doing this all on his own! It was adorable. Now my daughter LOVES it too. She also will sit on the floor and open each flap to give each animal a kiss. We have read this so much it is held together with a lot of tape. Highly recommend to anyone with small children or even as a great baby shower gift. How can you go wrong with a book about kisses!"},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"This book is great for the earliest interactive readers. The illustrations are simple and colorful, and the touch-and-feel parts easy to spot for babies who are just learning the game. There are a variety of textures to touch along with a squeaker and mirror - our daughter loves them all."},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"My five month old is just learning the concept of peekaboo, and this book gives us both smiles each evening. The large font is good too."},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"\\"Peekaboo Kisses\\" by Barney Saltzberg.Recently, I gave this book to my granddaughter, Tabitha, (22 months), who was obviously delighted. Each page brings up a different animal: kitten, puppy, sheep, duckling and then a mouse. As you say the words, \\"Peekaboo!\\", you open the flap of a page and there is the animal. Each animal has a tiny hole with the appropriate material: the \\"wool\\" for the sheep actually looks like some wool. The gray \\"fur\\" for the mouse, the last animal, is also a squeaker. An adult finger can cause the \\"Squeak!\\" every time, but Tabitha's little fingers had difficulty now and then.Finally, you come to the last page. As it is opened (with the word, \\"Peekaboo!\\", of course), there is a metallic mirror where the young reader can recognize himself. When asked, \\"Who is that in the book?\\", my granddaughter would answer with her nickname, \\"Tabby\\". So, this book is excellent for both tactile training and self-recognition, while providing entertainment for both adult and child."},{"Title":"Peekaboo Kisses","review":"My son LOVES this book and Animal Kisses, but this is his favorite. It has held up pretty well but I wouldn't let him handle it on his own, like in the car or something. He is always bringing it to my husband to read it to him. He also likes to point to the animals and make the sound that the animal makes. We have also given it as a gift. A good purchase to make on Amazon since copies in a bookstore may be worn already -- that's what I found when looking to buy one for a gift."},{"Title":"The Theology of the Book of Jeremiah (Old Testament Theology)","review":"I really enjoyed Brueggemann's book and highly recommend it to anyone who wants an overview of Jeremiah and a snapshot of how recent scholarship has shifted in viewing this book.While shaped, Dhum's three literary sources (voices) are still accepted. For Brueggemann three traditions (\\"rootage\\") are most significant, the covenant at Sinai (Sinai pericope), Hosea (the Northern emphasis), and Deuteronomy (the later shaping of all). These are referenced through out this book.Recent overemphasis on prophetic literature and its late scribal development often creates a bit of despair when approaching Jeremiah. Bruggemann, unlike a number of current scholars, holds to a real Jeremiah but admits that very little can be known about him leaving a subjective guess through filtered readings of the book.The work is concise but comprehensive in its discussion of Jeremiah's message. There is greater emphasis on tensions about how God is viewed than Israel's (Jeremiah's) understanding of the nature and person of God. In this Brueggeman tends to follow his own emphasis on the tension between continuity and discontinuity. Evident also is the author's emphasis upon verbs, especially the six infinitives of 1:10.Brueggemann struggles to fully explain how opposing ideas and concepts survived later redactional work and community (re)composition. Areas like the royal perspective or Jeremiah's position as a trader in view of the preserved view of him as a great prophet of God are examples of such difficulties.The work is helpful in that is combines essential points of many of the author's earlier writings. Discussion about the centrality of Jeremiah for the whole Bible and a section on Jeremiah and the New Testament are found toward the end. With Brueggeman's extensive work on Jeremiah I would recommend this book to any student of Jeremiah."},{"Title":"The Angry Tide A Novel of Cornwall 1798-99","review":"Metaphorically The Angry Tide is a novel well-named. This is the watershed volume in the series, and also the one that breaks from the eighteenth-century which readers of Poldark had heretofore known, and brings to conclusion many storylines, situations....and characters. Death is more plentiful in this Poldark book than in any other, if not in all others combined. Several central figures do not survive this story, and one who is lost here is not only someone known from the series' start, but a person surely everyone had thought truly irreplaceable: which this person was, for the series is never the same afterward, nor is the shadow cast by this figure's death ever absent in the five books that bring Poldark to its 1820 conclusion.In The Angry Tide, Captain Ross Poldark, a man of independent thought, is elected a member of parliament for the borough of Truro, Cornwall, and he and Demelza travel by coach across the breadth of England, arriving in a London splendidly described by Winston Graham. (After the chapter that sets the characters firmly in the capital, you'll feel as if you've just taken a guided tour of the world's largest city in the concluding years of the 1700's.) In London, Ross and Demelza settle in only to be swept up into the tide of political life and intrigue, as the nation gossips of little else besides the new man of the hour, whose reputation as a master of warfare carries his name fearfully to every mind: Napoleon Bonaparte. Elsewhere, Elizabeth, desperate to heal the rift in her marriage to George, takes the most drastic step imaginable and consults with a famed foreign obstetrician, intend on inducing premature birth of the child she carries, hoping a second premature delivery might lay to rest George's doubts about his being the father of her son, Valentine. In another marriage in the series, the portly, despicable Reverend Osborne Whitworth, far from a sinless clergyman, rediscovers the charms of a more than willing substitute for his psychologically traumatized wife Morwenna, and in so doing gets more than he could ever have bargained for. And lastly in London, the calculating George Warleggan befriends a sadistic former infantry officer, a man who loves killing and fears no one, a celebrated marksman who has emerged the victor in many past duels, and whose lust for Demelza---and distaste for Ross---comes to a head with pistols at dawn in one of the city's parks..."},{"Title":"The Angry Tide A Novel of Cornwall 1798-99","review":"Let's just say that, even though this is a blockbuster terrific read - that I remember clearly 35 years after reading it, I still am not happy with what the author did to these terrific characters.* Captain Ross Poldark is elected a member of parliament representing Truro, Cornwall.* Demelza and Ross arrive in London where the craven Monk Adderly attempts to first seduce her and when that fails attempts to ruin Ross.* George, not content in achieving all he has wanted must find fault in everything he could love and makes those around him miserable.* Elizabeth who has run out of options and patience, confronts George with logic, anger and love but fears it will not be enough to bring them happiness for long.* Morwenna and Drake pine for each other.* The loathsome Reverend Osborne Whitworth finally goes too far.* Dwight and Caroline, is not perfect, but they do their utmost to help their dearest friends.* Aunt Agatha and Geoffrey Charles initiate a chain of events that lead to tragedy and create great havoc for years to come.Totally addicted to this series back in the 70's watching it on Masterpiece Theatre Sunday nights with my mom and sisters. I eagerly gobbled up the first 4 books1945 - Ross Poldark1946 - Demelza1950 - Jeremy Poldark1953 - WarlegganWere I to have named them it would have been Poldark; Demelza; Warleggan; ElizabethI stopped reading the series in 1977 as the novels had gotten so dark that I wasn't enjoying where the author was taking the characters.1973 - The Black Moon1976 - The Four Swans1977 - The Angry TideI was poking in a book store on vacation and picked up \`The Twisted Sword' and enjoyed it tremendously (with one exception - I didn't care for the outcome for Jeremy at all).It was so good seeing Zacky Martin & Mrs. Zacky, Tholly Tregolis, Jud & Trudy Paynter - they hadn't changed at all. Dwight & Caroline Enys (and Horace), Verity & Andrew Blamey. And of course Demelza and Ross (still all too human). George Warleggan remains the same fascinating character. And Cornwall, Nampara (the Ross Poldark home) Wheal Grace and Wheal Leisure all so familiar 40 years later.1981 - The Stranger from the Sea1982 - The Miller's Dance1984 - The Loving Cup1990 - The Twisted Sword2002 - Bella PoldarkI am not sure I will pick up the last book as from the the reviews I don't think I will enjoy it as much. The author passed away in 2003 at age 90 so it is truly the last written by him.From the publisher: Cornwall, towards the end of the 18th century. Ross Poldark sits for the borough of Truro as Member of Parliment - his time divided between London and Cornwall, his heart divided about his wife, Demelza. His old feud with George Warleggan still flares - as does the illicit love between Morwenna and Drake, Demelza's brother. Before the new century dawns, George and Ross will be drawn together by a loss greater than their rivalry - and Morwenna and Drake by a tragedy that brings them hope...' From the incomparable Winston Graham...who has everything that anyone else has, then a whole lot more.Also from the Publisher: the Poldark series, the subject of the landmark BBC series Ross Poldark is a heartwarming, gripping, and utterly entertaining saga that brings to life an unforgettable cast of characters and one of the greatest love stories of our age. An intricately plotted story spanning loves, lives, and generations. The Poldark series is the masterwork of Winston Graham, who evoked the period and people like only he could, and created a world of rich and poor, loss and love, that readers will not soon forget."},{"Title":"The Key to Survival: Interpersonal Communication","review":"find it in a library or used, the book is not worth the price of shipping if you buy it new or used. maybe look for mine when i'm done with it (full of common sense things you already know)the service was great though. thanks amazon"},{"Title":"The Key to Survival: Interpersonal Communication","review":"I do not wish to purchase this item because i am being charged for false items on my card that i have not ordered. please cancel my account!"},{"Title":"Teaching And Learning Are Lifelong Journeys: Thoughts on the Art of Teaching and the Meaning of Education (Blue Mountain Arts Collection)","review":"I think that any educator should read this book and keep it close by.

The careers of most artists whose art displayed such different aspects and such breadth, as well as changes in genres and subjects, would be described as \\"checkered\\" or \\"interesting.\\" But Helion is not simply categorized as this. Despite such heterogeneity over the decades of his work from the 1920s to the 1980s, Helion manifestly surpasses such labelings. For the abstract works with a constructivist accent thru the still lifes and figures of his latter decades, Helion's work evidences a consistent boldness; not only in coloration, but also composition and assorted inner forms. About 125 pages of color pictures of paintings divided into mostly subject and a couple of stylistic categories illustrate this notable modern painter's range of subjects and movement regarding styles. The chronology of more than 20 pages of smaller type with many photographic insets is virtually a compendious biography of Helion. The five-page bibliography of the same smaller type contains hundreds of entries. In short, this work is the present major publication on Jean Helion; and with its high quality of production and design and its encompassing content, will probably stand for a long time as the major introduction and reference on Helion."},{"Title":"How to Live Large on a Small Planet","review":"Solara is a dedicated woman, and even if you don't like this kind of book, you'd have to aknowledge the passion and deep feeling this is writen with.

A superb book for any one interested in modern identity, in Jewish identity and in Jewish education. Noam Zion, author of A Different Night, Family Participation Haggadah"},{"Title":"The Jew Within: Self, Family, and Community in America","review":"The trend pointed out in this book toward increasing Jewish retreat from communal participation and responsibility fits in with the wider pattern in American society as a whole. The shift in focus from inherited shared traditional commitment to absolutely autonomous individual choice in defining one's relation to the Jewish community is both a fact of life and a signal of decline. The contradiction to this trend is the improved Jewish education an increasing minority of the community is receiving. Such education ideally does strengthen communal commitment and responsibility.I have heard Steven Cohen speak about the issues raised in this book and had the sense that he was far too optimistic in believing that the very partial and limited kinds of Jewish connection so increasingly prevalent among American Jewry can be a source of real communal strength in the future."},{"Title":"The Jew Within: Self, Family, and Community in America","review":"I had the opportunity to listen to Professor Eisen during a Scholar in Residence weekend at my synagogue.

Not only did John Steadman attend every game ever played by the Baltimore Colts as a reporter or team official, he also saw every game the Ravens played until last December when his soon-to-be-fatal illness ended his streak. Steadman was an official for the Colts during the mid-50's until the opportunity to return to the Baltimore News-Post presented itself. So he was very familiar with all the inside details. Steadman pulls no punches about the Colts' operations under both Carroll Rosenblum and Robert Irsay and is complimentary towards neither. He also takes the National Football League to task for allowing the Colts to be stolen from Baltimore in the middle of the night and for denying Baltimore the rights to an expansion team. Art Modell doesn't escape the Steadman scorn, either, for the way he ultimately treated the loyal Browns fans in Cleveland, even though the result was a new team for his hometown, Baltimore. John, like most Baltimoreans, wanted and expected an expansion team, not one that was stolen from another city. If you are interested in reading about the behind-the-scenes activities surrounding one of the NFL's storied franchises and in one of the most controversial franchise shifts, this is the book for you. You might be surprised by the actions of some of the people you thought you knew from their press clippings. By the way, this is not a hatchet job by a disgruntled writer. John was not that kind of reporter or columnist."},{"Title":"From Colts to Ravens : A Behind-The-Scenes Look at Baltimore Professional Football","review":"the stories in here are quite entertaning and there are some pretty good pics in here as well Mr steadman did a very good job with this book..my only complaint(this is why i gave it 4 stars) is that while talking about the browns moving to baltimore in the beginning of the book he tends to be a bit repetitive"},{"Title":"From Colts to Ravens : A Behind-The-Scenes Look at Baltimore Professional Football","review":"I purchased this book for my son for Christmas and he loved it.

To know the history behind the glory days as well as the sad days of Baltimore football you must read this book. A must read for ANY football historian."},{"Title":"Norman Mailer: The Radical as Hipster","review":"Although over twenty-years old, this interesting book is a clearly readable and scholarly study of the issues of Norman Mailer's fiction. Critical, though not diatribal, the book is interesting because it is a genuine study of Mailer's work, rather than a bunch of quotes, citations, and contorted relations to obscure authors.Most of the issues are broached: Mailer's sense of masculinity, the hip, and the racial and gender issues raised by his &quot;philosophical hipster.&quot; Thankfully present is an all too brief discussion of the morality engendered by Mailer's philosophical perspective, somewhat limited by the scope of work that Ehrlich is dealing with.A good resource for those studying Mailer's particular cosmology of the individual."},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"A delightful book covering some of the most unique and entertaining acts presented over the years in Side Shows,Circuses,Stages,and famous Rooms in Europe and America.Although I remember going to Carnivals,Side Shows and the Circus since I was a kid in the late 40's and after.I also remember many great Magic and Illusion Shows over the years ,brought right into our home via Television.I always had a preference for the side act,oddities,daredevils,illusionists,etc., over the animal acts.Yes,I can still see the Monkey Woman,the King and Queen of the Midgets at home in their Castle in Montreal. Then there was the World's Smallest Horse,The Alligator Boy ,whose body was covered in scales,the man without arms who drew portraits with chalk using his feet, A Flea Circus where real fleas did all kinds of things,even pulling a tiny carriage, and on and on.What surprised me most about this book is that many,even most of the people and acts covered were new to me.I guess this sort of stuff was more popular in the 18th,19th and early 20th Centuries and more so in Europe than America.I really haven't seen much in recent years. I guess Political Correctness and activist groups have had a major impact on these acts and people. The media is forever doing a story about mistreatment of animals in the Circus etc. Maybe the diversions this kind of entertainment gave us did us more good than realized.I know as kids we waited with anticipation for the Circus to come to town and particularly the Side Shows that accompanied them. I can tell you one thing,there was no need to drug up the kids on Ridlin,then,like you see today.For my money,I would far prefer to watch an act like La Roche climbing the spiral tower while inside a sphere;than any Olympic event.To me ,shaving one hundredth of a second off some record I've seen hundreds of times is pure boredom.It seems that the most excitement is created with announcers debating calls by referees ,judges or as a last resort;who has failed a steroid test or broke some rule.So, if you ever saw a good Side Show, saw some great feat of magic or illusion;this book will give you some wonderful memories of how entertaining this all was.It is jam packed with photographs and wonderful illustrations ;both in color and B&W.; You may have to make a bit of an effort to find this book.It is out of print, but thanks to finding books on the Net now,It is available at a wide range of prices and some even signed by the author.It is a \\"must have\\" for anyone who loved this form of entertainment that may become a thing of the past.All we can hope for is a revival."},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"\\"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women\\" is a tour of peculiar performance through the ages by modern master and scholar of the magic arts Ricky Jay. Each of the book's 17 chapters is dedicated to a different type of performer that awed audiences with his or her unusual skill or expert illusion. These are not all practitioners of misdirection or deception. Many are people who possessed very real unusual mental or physical talents. And some were not even human. There are scholarly pigs and horses, slight-of-hand artists, hypnotists, faith healers, poison resistors, and mind readers. Also featured are painters who happened to be limb-less, a blind and dumb musical prodigy, daredevil divers, mnemonic sensations, sword swallowers, musical farters, a man who could grow 6 inches at will, and more.The book does not attempt to be comprehensive on its subjects. Ricky Jay limits himself to \\"pioneers or refiners of peculiar performance\\". The truly extraordinary and inventive, not their many imitators. So many famous and impressive performers are not included. Ricky Jay's writing is precise, fluid, and conveys his admiration and awe at these human oddities and pioneering showmen. Jay's occasional references to his own experiences when they are relevant add interest. There are black-and-white reproductions of posters, playbills, and other illustration throughout. In the center of the book are 16 pages of full-color poster reproductions. \\"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women\\" is an education in eccentric performance and the unusual, determined individuals who have created it. And it's great fun."},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"All the reviews have hit this book on the head. What more can I say? However I do have a request. Several years ago PBS ran a lengthy television show where Ricky brought his book to the stage. As Master of Ceremonies he introduced people who today keep these arcane performances alive. It was a terrific show. Has anyone run across a tape of this program? I'm amazed PBS has not made it available on their on-line store. If anyone has any information please let me know."},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"I'm sorry, maybe I'm missing something here, but this book is not nearly as marvelous as everyone claims. The entertainers profiled are not nearly as odd as claimed. The guy who could produce any scrap of paper named by the audience? The guy who could maneuver a ball up a ramp while curled within? The man who stretches his body a few inches? They sound interesting, but there's not much more to the book than is evident in the sentences you just read.Jay seems to have done his research through advertising and printed materials, rather than first-person sources, and this means his stories rely on conjecture where there should be depth and soul."},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"You've come to the right place. Buy _Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women_ if you want amazing stories, incredible histories, unbelievable accounts of some of the best acts of the last few centuries.If I didn't know Ricky Jay's fine reputation as a magic historian, I'd think this book was a joke. The people and acts described are too outlandish, too impressive to be true. But I trust Jay to strike awe into me, and he does so repeatedly and without fail in this book.The book's illustrations and photographs are marvelous supplements to Jay's smoothly written histories of performers--memory artists, dwarf magicians without arms or legs, women who walk into ovens. This is the quintessential introduction to this bizarre world."},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"In Learned Pigs and Fireproof Women, Ricky Jay takes on the history of oddball performers: men who claimed to cram their entire bodies into quart jars, armless ladies who could paint miniatures holding a brush between their teeth, gentlemen whose specialty was to enter large ovens accompanied by raw meat and exit (unharmed) with fully-cooked steaks, as well as mind readers of all sorts and species (human, pig, and horse).Organized into chapters by skill by oddball skill, Jay is sometimes able to document such performers back into the 1700s by tracking newspaper reports, handbills, etc., many of which are reproduced in color plates and black-and-white photographs.Ricky Jay occupies an engaging hole in intellectual space between enthusiast and academic. He is comprehensive in the extreme, but his writing style is anecdotal and he does not go for any elaborate sociological explanation of why such performers exist or what they \`mean' to society. He just wants you to have fun, and perhaps to freak you out just a wee bit.The book is also very nicely designed; its large wide pages lie flat and there are loads of remarkable illustrations. Definitely worth a look!"},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"A celebration of the strange in performance, by a man who has made a career out of amassing the most comprehensive collection of stage and vaudeville arcana imaginable. Jay isn't just a brilliant performer: his writing crackles with desert-dry wit, and deep affection -- never, and this is important, condescension -- for his subjects, even for the crackpots and con artists. This is a glorious celebration of performing artists who are wonderful in their sheer oddness, and a paean to all that is uniquely human, and humanly unique. Marvelous; it's one of my favorite books of all time, and more than stands up to multiple re-readings."},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"As a magician and card wielder Ricky Jay is fascinating to watch as well as listen to.

The contents of this meticulously researched and lovingly presented book often boggle the mind, inducing, at times, a wonderment that is nearly stupefying. Profusely illustrated with contemporary broadsides, lithographs, and photographs, the book is also enlivened by Jays seemingly inexhaustible knowledge of each performers antecedents, biography, and critical reception. Engrossing from start to finish, but particularly notable for Jays account of the controversial career and bizarre death of mind reader Washington Irving Bishop, whose story beggars imagination. Also not to be missed is the final chapter on Joseph Pujol, whose career as Le Ptomane was based on his ability to create music and sound effects with the least reputable of bodily orifices. A treasure"},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"Loaded with photos and Mr. Jay's learned commentary, this book must be the best of it's kind, a celebration of what individuals can do, even under the toughest of circumstances. Yes, some of these may seem like &quot;Freak Shows&quot; in circus/carnivals of old,but still these performances are awe-inspiring even today,sometimes hundreds of years later. The most incredible is the severely handicapped Matthew Buchinger, master engraver/artist, who had neither hands nor feet, perhaps neglected among art historians, but revived thanks to Mr. Jay. There are many others here as well, perhaps equally interesting and unusual, but you can be sure that Mr. Buchinger's story is worth the price of admission here!!"},{"Title":"Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women: Unique, Eccentric and Amazing Entertainers","review":"This review is a precis of Adam Bresnick's comments in Forbes Magazine, Feb. 22, '99. Ricky Jay is one of the more engaging figures in American entertainment - a cunning vaudellian, a resourceful actor and a delightful writer. But is is Jay's prose that may prove his most delightful contribution to civilization. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux has just reissued Jay's Learned Pigs &amp; Firproof Women, a beautifully crafted homage to some of the most pointlessly gifted individuals the stage has ever seen. &quot;The Man Who Grows,&quot; was able to stretch his body from 5 feet, 10 inches, to 6 foot, 4 in front of astonished audiences. Blind Tom, an African-American idiot savant of the 19th century, had no formal musical education, yet upon hearing a song, he could immediately duplicate it on the piano.

I have often 'dug it out' to show friends that I am not making this stuff up.This is a delightful tome that gives in-dept details of the rise and fall of some of our past unusual \`performers and artists'. This is an account of some of the most fascinating and compelling novelty shows in show business history.The writing is first rate and the author's enthusiasm for this arena is clear on each page. The reader is guaranteed to not have to suffer a single boring page. Moreover, the book is laid out in a easily grouped way that makes the journey of this book even more enjoyable.If you have a curious or eccentric relative or friend, this would make a perfect gift. I would suggest you hurry as the price of this book continues to rise. I saw one for sale at $349!

The book explores a number of issues within the vast field of globalization. The chapters do this from the point of view of the process' political economy, but also from a theoretical point of view. The authors' views come across in the chapters, but with superb substantiation for these views, and carefully considering others without always recurring to counter-factual arguments. All the chapters are easy-to-read, not heavy reading at all, written in a vivid style and captivating. All in all, a must for those studying the subject, and great reading."},{"Title":"Daniel: An Expositional Commentary","review":"This commentary on Daniel is concise. It does a very good job of keeping the reader focused on two main topics, mainly the topic of people of God living in an ungodly world such as Daniel in Babylon, and the topic of the prophecies as revealed in the book of Daniel. The comentary also does a very good job of relating the various parts of the book of Daniel, such as the vision of the statue of various types of metal compared to the vision of the animals. And I especially liked the dealing with the prophecy of the coming Anointed One and the seventy \\"sevens\\"; the commentary did not go into elaborate detail, which can be very interesting but which might be out of place in a commentary such as this which is concise; the high level presentation of three different possibilities and their calculations of the seventy \\"sevens\\" was well done."},{"Title":"Daniel: An Expositional Commentary","review":"You can't go wrong with any expositional commentary written by Dr. Boice. I especially appreciate his honesty. He obviously is from a reformed background, but in terms of his eschatology and his own interpretation, he often gives credence the viewpoints of premillenialism.Daniel is a difficult book to study but Dr. Boice is able to break it down in such a way that it is easy to grasp and see the big picture through out."},{"Title":"Daniel: An Expositional Commentary","review":"The best description of this commentary on Daniel is -I think- the one offered to the author himself by one of the elders of his church: \\"Instead of going into all the minuted details of these profecies the way some do ... you've tried to extract the main principles and apply them to our lives now.\\"I thank the author for the clarity of his exposition, his humility when -sometimes- announcing that his interpratation may be wrong, and his bringing the text to our modern lives. As for the events announced and that have been fulfilled, this is a good survey; as for those events that are yet to be fulfilled the author does not speculate but sets clear demarcation marks between the former and the latter.I also appreciated this book for the concise and clear way that historical facts were presented as the chapters in this prophetic book of Daniel progressed."},{"Title":"Daniel: An Expositional Commentary","review":"If you are looking for a clear concise analysis of Daniel, then this is the book for you.

To this extent I was a little disappointed for I have heard and read some of his other material and he gave quite extensive details and explanations. My wife and I are studying Daniel, Olivet Discourse and Revelation over the last few years, so I purchased this book and Walvoord's Daniel Commentary to help us more thououghly understand.

The robot's name, Robert Daniel, may be a nod to Asimov's R. Daneel Olivaw, or vica versa, depending on when the respective stories were written.Good Night Mr. James - a psychologist accidentally releases a dangerous and hungry life form and sends out a clone to reel it in, but finds himself in a game of wits with himself.Drop Dead - a group of planetary explorers find a planet with no life but a type of grass and a single species - a shmoo like entity which obligingly will serve itself up for your meal. Yet there is more than truth to the saying that you are what you eat.No Life of Their Own looks at luck, farming and a mixed community of aliens and earthlings along with a not quite working time machine as seen through the eyes of boyhood pranks and friendships.The Sitters and Crying Jag both take place in the middle American town of Millville. In the former aliens brought home by a former ne'er do well make a living babysitting the town's children, however the children are growing up too quickly and the price may be too high. In the latter we are visited by an alien who gets drunk on the stories of human suffering. Confession may be good for the soul but custodian Sam may have bargained for more than he can handle.Installment Plan is an interesting look at interstellar monopolies and capitalism. An expedition from Central Trading shows up too late to pick up a planet sized consignment of podhars, potato like vegetables with unique medicinal qualities, only to find a new competitor has got there first. However the interesting aspect of the story is the relationship between the human leader of the expedition and the team of robots that accompanies him.Condition of Employment is the shortest story in the book, and least complex - it looks at the psychological factors that will drive man to the planets. Unlike the others its a one note story - OK but not as complex as the others.In Project Mastadon a team of 3 men attempt to get rich by claiming North America by traveling 150,000 years into the past and demanding recognition as a country. However things get complicated when they find that they are trapped and need to be rescued.All of the stories appeared individually in SF magazines between 1951 and '62. The writing is excellent and Simak tosses out concepts like rose petals at a wedding - a must read for fans of good SF."},{"Title":"All the Traps of Earth","review":"Perhaps it would be best to start with a few observations about the version of this collection that I am reviewing. There are several books by Clifford D. Simak titled _All the Traps of Earth_ (1962). But not all of them are complete. Some might be more accurately titled \\"Stories From _All the Traps of Earth_\\". I am reviewing the original, complete version (the Doubleday hardback or the Avon paperback) consisting of nine (count 'em, 9) stories. The title story was originally published in _Fantasy and Science Fiction_ in 1960. The remaining eight tales all came from _Galaxy_ between 1951 and 1960. All of the stories range in quality from good to excellent.I believe that it was Alfred Bester who first pointed out that one of the virtues of a Simak story is its _unpredictability_. Usually, it is hard to look at the beginning of a Simak story and accurately predict exactly how it will end. There are usually zigs and zags, twists and turns, and unexpected angles before the stories are all logically resolved. Mind you, the resolutions are solidly connected to the beginnings. But they are not _predictable_ from the beginning.Let us look at the beginnings of several of the stories in this collection. In \\"All the Traps of Earth,\\" a robot who is the last member of the aristocratic Barrington family is closing up the family accounts. Because he is legally \\"property,\\" his memory will be erased and replaced by another robot personality. In \\"Good Night, Mr. James,\\" a man named Henderson James wakes up on a hillside on Earth packing a gun and has a mission to fulfill that he cannot remember. What is it? In \\"The Sitters,\\" a high school principal patiently listens as his coach bewails the loss of his star football players. It couldn't be really important... Could it? In \\"Project Mastodon,\\" we see a man talking to the Secretary of State. The man claims to be a representative from the country of Mastodonia. And here is the opening to \\"Crying Jag\\" verbatim:It was Saturday evening and I was working up a jag. I had my jug beside me, handy, and I was feeling good and fixing to feel better, when this alien and his robot came tramping up the driveway. (163)Engaging openings every one. But I'll bet that even armed with the information that I have given you, you will not be able to see where Simak is going with these stories the first time that you read them. But sharp-eyed readers may have noticed my earlier qualifier of \\"usually\\". One story, \\"Condition of Employment,\\" is shorter, much less elaborately plotted, and a touch more predictable. It's not a bad story-- simplicity is not always a vice in fiction-- but it doesn't have quite the dazzle of most of the other tales.In case you haven't guessed by this time, I am a great lover of Simak's fiction. This is one of his best collections."},{"Title":"All the Traps of Earth","review":"Wonderful stories, all nine. In Simak's typical fashion, they mix a sense of rural/suburban hominess with the alien and cosmically vast. Roughly half end on a happy or hopeful note, while the rest are blackly humorous or outright horror. Oddly enough, even these latter manage to retain the \\"homey\\" feel, something which few authors indeed could infuse into a dark short story (without making a mess of things, anyway). My favorite tale is \\"No Life of Their Own,\\" about a boy on a Wisconsin farm, his alien neighbors and a race of wispy personality parasites that give good luck to one at the cost of bad luck for everyone else."},{"Title":"All the Traps of Earth","review":"Magical collection of Saimak's short stories!!! Saimak is definitely is one of the best sci-fi writers of all-times, but unfortunately he is the most unappreciated one in my opinion. If you haven't read Saimak before - this collection is a wonderful way to get acquainted with his works - incredibly humane, compassionate, inventive and original. There is not a single one bad story in this collection, so it's definitely worth getting."},{"Title":"AN Easter Disguise (A Zebra Holiday Regency Romance)","review":"Harriet Haversham is the plain eldest daughter of a country vicar.

She finds herself in the suds when Lord Weston invites her parents to a dinner party. Her mother and father have secretly gone after their middle daughter who has eloped with one of Lord Weston's grooms. If Lord Weston discovers the truth, he may dismiss Harry's father like he did the last vicar...for unseemly behavior. Harry's youngest sister, Augusta, convinces Harry that they must attend the dinner party to avoid suspician. But they cannot attend unescorted, so Augusta talks Harry into dressing up like their father.The result is a hilarious dinner party that caused me to laugh out loud and a tangle of deceit that may cause Harry to lose the man of her dreams to a beautiful rival.

I loved the part where there are male-points-of-view discussions in addition to the usual girls' talk (men do talk and talk, too, you know). That last part, the egg race, made me wonder a bit if the male lead had given up but that's one of the reasons why this book is a joy to read. I look forward to more by this author!"},{"Title":"History of the conquest of Peru (Everyman's library : History)","review":"The conquest of the mighty Inca empire by a small contingent of Spanish adventurers, and their subsequent civil wars fought for control of the region, is a story so dramatic and improbable that it's hard to believe it actually happened. Prescott's artistic style, meticulous attention to detail, and brilliantly structured narrative bring out all the drama and excitement. Unlike many histories, this work has nothing about it that is tedious or dry--particularly remarkable since Prescott never visited South America and developed his sweeping account exclusively from literary sources. The author's ability to reconstruct the attitudes and motivations of the key characters gives the reader a much deeper understanding of the events. Before reading the book, I knew next to nothing about the Incas or the settlement of the region. Upon finishing it, I felt as though I'd received a thorough (and most enjoyable) schooling."},{"Title":"History of the conquest of Peru (Everyman's library : History)","review":"A wonderful book! It reads like great fiction but the events aren't fiction-- they actually happened! This book kept me captivated, I couldn't put it down! Prescott does a marvelous Job!"},{"Title":"History of the conquest of Peru (Everyman's library : History)","review":"I read this one while traveling around Peru and the local experts confirmed the accuracy of Prescott's 150-year-old writings about Inca culture. Many of the most important actors in the book were surprisingly old considering the hardships that they endured. For example, Pizarro himself was 60 when he started heading down towards Peru through terrible storms in wooden boats, often getting stranded in mosquito-infested jungles without food for months at a time. He was 65 by the time he actually conquered Peru. One of the Pizarro family's most effective generals in their fights against other Spaniards was 80-84 during the period of these civil wars.This book makes a great gift for anyone traveling to Ecuador or Peru and for anyone over the age of 60."},{"Title":"History of the conquest of Peru (Everyman's library : History)","review":"When you travel to Peru, even today, the country's landscape and country are dominated by the conflict that occurred between the Incas and the Spaniards in the 16th century. Spanish style buildings are intermixed with those of the entirely different culture of the Incas. This book portrays the battles and conflicts in vivid terms, and although it is a sad story, one of greed and conquest, it is still quite interesting. If you have been to Cuzco you can superimpose the events of the book on that city in your mind and just sit back in awe. For those who find this part of the world interesting I can highly recommend this book. You get a better sense of the Spaniards but that is probably because most of the written history comes from their records. Whatever sophistication the Incas had in their culture and architecture is still a bit of a mystery."},{"Title":"History of the conquest of Peru (Everyman's library : History)","review":"History of the Conquest of Peru by William H Prescott is a very thoroughly researched and interestingly written account.of the Incas way of life and the subsequent changes when the Spaniard conquistadors invaded the country in the 16th century. I enjoyed this book because it satisfied an ambition to \`know\` what happened in those early formative days.The edition I read is a re publication of the original printed in 1847. My copy is a paper back with small print and an extensive bibliography.I would recommend this book to anyone requiring an authentic, unabridged and fascinating history of a remarkable country."},{"Title":"History of the conquest of Peru (Everyman's library : History)","review":"Five stars because I learned so much about Peru and the ancient Inca culture during the mid-1500's. The conquest was deceitful and brutal. The country and especially Cuzco, the ancient city, were far more interesting and meaningful when I later visited. The Spanish stole all of the gold and sent it back to Spain while slaughtering the indigenous people and destroying most of their highly developed civilization . I must confess that I pretended to spit on Pizzaro's tomb when I toured the site.

ATHAHUALLPA (to whom he left the northern part of the country, with the capital of Quito), who was not from a mother of Inca blood, though she was the Inca's favorite; and HUASCAR, son of his lawful wife and sister, the legitimate heir to the crown. Huascar received the southern part of the country, with the capital Cuzco.After the Inca died, the two brothers precipitated Peru in civil war; Athauallpa won. Upon the arrival of the Spaniards, Francisco Pizzarro captured Atahuallpa; his subjects were utterly disheartened at this sacrilege. Remember the fascinating episode of Atahuallpa sitting on the ground and the Spanish horseman approaching him until the horse was very close to the Inca's face; though Atahuallpa had never seen a horse before he did not flinch. However, some of his retinue were scared and pulled back. The Inca had them killed the same day for showing fear and dishonoring themselves. During his time in captivity the Inca had his brother Huascar killed. Atahuallpa was put to death by the Spaniards even though he filled a room with gold from all over the country as a ransom for himself and his familiy. After being pressured, he embraced the Christian faith right before being put to death; instead of being burnt alive, he was garroted.Atahuallpa's general Chalcucima was burnt on the stake and Quisquis was killed by some of his own men who were tired of fighting against the Spaniards. Manco Inca was then crowned new ruler of the Incas as a puppet of the Spaniards. However, after some time he managed to escape and to live in freedom for a long time in Cajamarca.Juan Pizzarro died wahile storming the citadel of Cuzco. Almagro and Pizzarro began a civil war. Almagro was captured and put to death (garroted in prison).Hernando Pizzarro, upon returning to Spain, was imprisoned for twenty years in a dungeon and released in 1560. He died at the age of 100. Followers of Almagro assassinated Francisco Pizzarro (1541) and started a feud against the Pizzarros. The son of Almagro was captured and behaded as well. Manco Inca was assassinated by a group of Almagristas whom he had sheltered in Cajamarca (they were afterwards all slain by the Incas). A feud erupted between Gonzalo Pizzarro and the viceroy Blasco Nunez. They went to war and the viceroy was captured and killed on the battlefield. Pizzarro proclaimed himself master of Peru.Pedro de la Gasca was sent to Peru in 1545 to straighten things up, on behalf of the emperor Charles V. He was a very good cleric and a good administrator. The offer of surrender and of pardon which he extended to Gonzalo Pizzarro was turned down. War erupted between the royalists and Pizzarro. Carbajal was an old brave and cruel general who fought on the side of the Pizzarros. He was captured and executed; same fate befell Gonzalo (1550). Prescott, who wrote in the 1800s without ever setting foot in South America, tells all these stories in a very captivating way. He is never dull, always exciting and a pleasure to read!

This is almost certainly not true - and the only other time the word is used in the NT, it means \\"appoint.\\" If he is wrong on this point, his entire argument essentially falls apart.Beyond this, he mishandles virtually every other passage concerning elders in the entire NT - dismissing the most natural and obvious understanding of those passages.He also tends to set up straw man arguments time and again by stating that the NT letters were to the churches rather than to elders specifically. He sets up similar arguments regarding numerous other points, as well.He also sets up the entire message with a straw man argument concerning the Lord's words about the apostles not \\"lording authority\\" over others. Just this by itself is worth a several-paragraph rebuttal.The tone of the entire message gives the impression that Mr. Viola has an axe to grind - perhaps because of a bad personal experience - and thus also gives the impression that he is coming to the text with an agenda. Then, even though he repeatedly decries ripping verses out of context, he repeatedly does just that while giving trying to give the pastors the impression that he is honoring both the literary and historical context.In addition, he makes more than one factual mistake - including one that appears to come directly out of the introduction to Galatians in the Expositor's Bible Commentary - where that commentator makes a mistake when he attributes a problem in the church at Syrian Antioch as happening in Galatia (Pisidian Antioch?). Viola repeats this mistake almost verbatim, apparently not checking the Scriptures to confirm the veracity of the commentary. (Admittedly, this is an unusual sort of mistake to find in the EBC, but it is the responsibility of any expositor / teacher to not simply take a commentary for granted as being right.) And it is this mistake which forms part of the foundation for his argument.Far from making the case for the house-church movement, it seems to show how little, if any biblical support there is for it.Dave James[...]"},{"Title":"Pewter Wings, Golden Horns, Stone Veils: Wedding in a Dark Plum Room","review":"I picked up this book in the remainder bin at the bookstore of the Centre for Canadian Architecture in Montreal at a good price. I had heard of the late John Hejduk from some architect friends, and was interested in how he was described to me: an architect who uses drawings, poems and travel to create a narrative framework for his buildings and proposals. &quot;Pewter Wings&quot; falls definately into this category; this book traces Hejduk's travels through Spain to highlight his interest in sacred spaces of architecture--churches, cathedrals and chapels in particular. More than a document of his plans and ideas for new places of spiritual awe, this book traverses the fine lines between mental and physical landscapes, arguing for a holistic approach to building design. Focusing on regional folklore, &quot;Pewter Wings&quot; suggests that architecture should somehow participate in- and contribute to- the mythmaking of a particular site, and ultimately act as a &quot;poetic cohesion&quot; to bring these places of worship to life. Containing hundreds of watercolour paintings, travelogues and poems, this beautiful book allows a narrative to unfold between these various mediums. &quot;Pewter Wings, Golden Horns, Stone Veils&quot; is a delicious, throught-provoking read that suggests an inspiring alternative to the traditional architectural strictures of site, form and functionality."},{"Title":"The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, 31st Edition","review":"The Overstreet Price Guide is, without a peer, the best annualized report that can be published for the entire sphere of comic book price indexing. Of course you're going to have the sellers who peddle their wares online and otherwise, disputing this fact, using their record-breaking &quot;...ten times guide...&quot; reports as their alibi, but they've got to realize that the guide is based on a broader sales arena. Not just the trendy sales, fresh after a movie and not just the eccentric purchases of a few mega-rich individuals. You'll notice the guide shows a generally upward trend on the prices of the comics throughout the years...similar to the nation's economy. If they were to bump prices up based on every outstanding report, there would be up and down prices more reflective of the stock market. For the future sake of everyone's investments in the comic book product, it is much better to have conservative growth. It may not appeal to the greedy seller, but to the average investor The Overstreet Guide is safely and effectively the best comic guide for &quot;tout le monde&quot;. It may not be perfect, but it is The Best so far...it keeps a lid on the sales-hounds, and it allows the average Joe-collector, like myself, to at least have an overview of what to expect when going in on a purchase. With the exception of a few books (esp. those with characters appearing, or soon to appear on movies), both Sellers and buyers bend towards the guides price. This over time has proven, not to be a bad thing. ~C'est tout."},{"Title":"The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, 31st Edition","review":"I have been an on again/off again/on again type of collector. I started collecting back in the mid 70's when I really didn't know what/how to collect (age 9). Sometime in the early 80's, I found a book that had information within, that explained some of the confusion about collecting. The book explained what type of comics were worth collecting (aka pricing) and explained (in the best terms of that time) how a collector should properly care for the comics in their collection. It also explained how a comics condition could be determined. There were also articles relating to the authors/writers/inkers/publishers of the comics I was collecting. The name of that book was the Overstreet Price Guide. The # was 13. What caught my eye initially about the book was that it had my favorite superhero on the cover (Superman) and there were many pictures of some of the most expensive comic books.Throughout the years, the Overstreet price guide has reflected well upon the different aspects of comic collecting. With issue #31, the Overstreet Price Guide reflected upon the newer standard of grading. It mentioned a little about CGC and predicted that CGC would not die out, but become a better stronghold in the industry. With CGC, a person could command a better price for their collected memory. With e-Bay starting to show some of the sales in the market, CGC was a natural for online reliablility.There were other articles in the book as well. Wonderwoman and the Fantastic Four had their history explained. There were articles about Murphy Anderson, the story of Palmer Cox, information about Bendis, information about 1st appearances, crossovers, and so much more.Yes, the Price Guide is about pricing, but it covers many other areas of collecting. It has so much information to the point that it is a collectible in and of itself. A collector that doesn't consider investment potential, is a foolish collector in my opinion. Yes, a person should purchase a comic because it has some meaning to them. I buy for the stories/art, or pivotal meaning, but in a day and age where layoffs happen to someone you know everywhere in the country, or other hardships occur that could be eased by the knowledge that this book could provide (which issues might be profitable over the long run), it makes sense to understand the importance of what you collect.The price guide is but a tool. If all you buy the book for is for the pricing, then I would suggest it might not be the book for you. If you are a true collector though, a great deal of information lies at your fingertips when you own this book. One of the best features that I like about it, is that the price guide lists dealers.Without this book, I would have to go to great efforts to find a store that I can buy rare comics from. Just recently, I purchased Action Comics #17 from Metropolis Comics. Would I have known where to find this without the price guide? Possibly. But what effort would I have had to go through? Within a week, I had located a copy. I tried looking everywhere in my own hometown. NOBODY had one available within a 4 city radius.I say that there is a reason many people consider this book, \\"The BIBLE of the comic book industry.\\"To the person asking about Whitman and Gold Key (sorry, don't know how to e-mail you), the difference is in reprints. Gold Key started the line and Whitman finished it. Whitman also reprinted the earlier stories as well (which may be why you are seeing two different indicia) They didn't always state they were reprints back then. The main difference was the logo on the cover. Some people find no price difference whereas others find Gold Key over the Whitman. Because the reprint line (Whitman) wasn't produced with the same volume that Gold Key was, some people find Whitman more collectable than the Gold Key. As to worth, it mainly goes by the collector. In any case, the price shouldn't be too far off of what you see in the guide though. Hope that helps."},{"Title":"The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, 31st Edition","review":"The oldest and best price guide out there. What can I say? An invaluable resource, a must own for old and new collectors alike."},{"Title":"The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, 31st Edition","review":"To get my biases out of the way: I am of the opinion that comics should be collected for their entertainment value and not as an investment. Even then, collectors need protection from price gouging, so if the guide actually played the role of protecting collectors by helping establish what a good price is for each comic it would be of some use. However, it has earned the nickname of the \\"Overprice Guide\\" for a good reason, and as a result isn't even of much use to investors, let alone collectors.1. Many comic stores use the latest guide as an excuse to raise their prices as much as possible regardless of their own experiences of supply and demand. Many stores will even charge over the priceguide listing suggesting that the demand has continued to rise since the book was published when the opposite is usually true. Then, in a vicious cycle, the next guide reflects these changes. Speculators taking note of brief trends in the price guide will also temporarily incr!ease demand and decrease supply of the listed comics by buying them out, thus lending the Price Guide some artificial legitimacy through self-fulfilled prophecy. This sort of thing then usually winds up collapsing in on itself when speculators try offloading their hoards of speculative treasure and wind up flooding the market with titles with little actual demand. Look for example at the death of Superman issues or the brief Valiant craze. Hot titles one year are found collecting dust in bargain bins the next, thanks in part to the speculative market supported by the price guide. By basing its own listing on irrational market activity, Overstreet (which is unfortunately the most influential guide) contributes to this problem.2. It is easy to compare two editions of Overstreet's Price Guide one or two years apart and find many listed prices that have dramatically decreased because the Guide has fallen into the trap of reflecting brief trends. The Guide is obsolete almo!st as soon as it comes out. The only areas in which the Guide IS useful are for titles whose trends have been well-established over many years (e.g. old EC comics, Action Comics #1, etc.) and how many can afford that? Sure, the rolling average helps a bit, but most irrational inflation occurs with new titles that haven't yet been listed and therefore are immune from the rolling average. The rolling average then helps keep these titles listed at an inflated price even while the market tries to correct itself.3. If you try TRADING, let alone selling, a comic to a comic store, you can only expect a small percentage of the priceguide list (unless it is a classic collectible) because the store will refuse to gamble on the possibility of selling the latest overpriced dud or probably already has it in stock or doesn't need it wasting valuable space that could be put to better use. If the Overstreet, as it claims, reflects the market accurately, customers should get better !rates on trade. They don't because THE OVERSTREET HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ACTUAL RATES OF DEMAND.4. If the book were truly for collectors, it would list as many lesser known titles as possible. But it doesn't. Many titles that aren't trendy are not even listed, and I'm not referring here to totally obscure self-published mini-comics and their ilk, but to well respected alternative and underground titles, etc. Thus the Price Guide is very incestuous, keeping some titles in the limelight and others in obscurity.5. For a book that is half full of paid advertisements, the price is horrible. It seems like the book could be free and the publisher would still make a profit. The advertisements aren't even much of a service. You can locate most of the stores listed for free on the internet or, if you're visiting a new area, find a larger number of local stores listed in the yellow pages. Why should the buyer pay for largely useless paid advertisements?I consider! the price guide a sad, unfortunate waste. Buy some comics instead and enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, 31st Edition","review":"Hello, I haven't bought the 2001 comic digest because they don't seem to change in price to much so I do every other year. However I found the 2000 book very helpful. The only problem I have is finding Walt Disney comics prices. Usually the dates or the numbers don't match up for some reason. Is there a difference in the price of Goldkey and Whitman. They seem to have run the same comic and number but have different dates. Usually the whitman comic has the different date. I have some disney comics that I have not been able to price because I can't find them. Example: Huey Duey Louie #13 has a whitman and a Goldkey, the goldkey is dated 1972 and the whitman is dated 1969, what is the difference. The price on the comic itself tells me that the whitman is also a 1972. What is the difference?"},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"I bought this Audio CD to listen in my car....

So far, it has been a pleasant read as Thoreau points out and comments on people, geography, history of the Cape, and events that occur, e.g., a shipwreck -- to which many people not directly connected to the tragedy don't seem to care a 'hoot'. The book was recommended by a friend who is an English professor as we in a book group were discussing 'The Thoreau You Don't Know' by Robert Sullivan -- which most of the group enjoyed and learned from. The recommendation came up after I mentioned I was reading 'A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers' which I retitled 'An Infinity on the Concord and ...'. That has to be the most boring book I ever read next to 'Vanity Fair'.So far, 'Cape Cod' is written in a relatively lively style compared to other Thoreau writings I've encountered. It has been enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"I have the Princeton Classic edition (1988; 2004), but the text is essentially the same. Thoreau is at his best here in his descriptions of nature and the people inhabiting this (then) difficult place. The book really is a paean to the Sea...Thoreau is awed by its power and beauty. Much of the work tends to be descriptions of the sea or its influence on the land. More than once he mentions that one is never far from the noise of the breakers or the winds. He also discusses man's influence on the land (usually negative), yet how mankind is still dwarfed by the power of the sea. Even if you are not a Thoreau fan, read this. It makes for a good read on a cold winter's night."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"Each year, in preparation for a week's retreat to the Outer Banks of North Carolina, I go in search of a book that would be perfect for a sojourn on a desert island. Of course, the Outer Banks are hardly deserted--the locals have printed up Wege's infamous photograph of a packed stretch of Coney Island with the caption &quot;Nags Head, circa 2000 A.D.&quot;--but there we are on an island for seven days, my husband experiencing near death in the waves while I read. Sometimes we stop these pursuits and prowl the beach. Mostly we live as if we're the last two people on earth (which is easier in the off-peak season).I've learned that not every book is right for this way of life. The perfect desert island book has to celebrate the place you are in, not transport you. It should offer a tinge of society, because, after all, a human is a social animal, but it should not make you yearn achingly for what has been left behind nor should you be so repelled by it that you will never fit in again when you leave the island (you always leave the island). It should have some narrative sweep to withstand the competition of the seascape. It should make you think, at least a little: you want the stress to wash out to sea, not the little grey cells.Cape Cod by Henry David Thoreau is the benchmark by which I've chosen beach material for several years. it is the quintessential celebration of littoral life. If you are on the beach, you appreciate it all the more; if you are not, well, at least you know vividly what you are missing. There is drama, as in the specter of villagers racing to the shore at the news of a shipwreck. There is information, as in what part of the clam not to eat, how the Indians trapped gulls for food, how a lighthouse really works. There is Thoreau's contagious respect for solitude, his occasional crankiness, and that magic trick of his that can suck in high school sophomores and get them through his books without so much as a whimper.There is one flaw to Cape Cod: brevity. It lasts about a day and a half on the Robinson Crusoe plan. This is not to say that it does not withstand re-reading, it does, but at some point after you have committed it to memory, you may wish for the collected works of Shakespeare and move onto the Bard's beach play, The Tempest."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"This hardcover edition from Peninsula Press is unquestionably the best available edition of Thoreau's Cape Cod, for these reasons:1) While all other editions are based on Thoreau's journal entries from only his first three visits to the Cape, this edition includes an epilogue compiling Thoreau's notes from his fourth and final visit, in which he traveled south to Chatham and Monomoy.2) This is the only edition to translate the many, many Greek and Latin phrases Thoreau includes throughout the work, and it is also the only edition to provide illustrations, maps, and sidenotes in-text.3) This is the only indexed edition ever created.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for fans of both Cape literature and Thoreau in general."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"You will forget about the outside world when you read this; nothing but sand, wind, and water. Plus some natural history, local folklore, a few shipwreck tales. Typical Thoreau; he finds beauty, interest, detail in the wilderness. The desolate landscape will help to clear your mind. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"Thoreau visited Cape Cod in 1849, 1850, and 1853. These trips formed the basis for a series of essays, several of which Thoreau published in magazines. After Thoreau's death, the essays were gathered together and published as \\"Cape Cod\\" in 1865.Thoreau's \\"Cape Cod\\" is different in tone in theme from his earlier books. The tone is leisurely and light. Instead of solitude or the wild woods, the picture that remains with me from this book is that of a long walk, or, as Thoreau puts it, a \\"ramble\\" through the sand and dunes of Cape Cod. The book is picturesque, full of humor and wry observation. Thoreau unforgettably describes the ocean, in its storms, vicissitudes, and moments of peace, the fish and the fishermen, the sands, birds, plants and lighthouses of Cape Cod, and the people. I have visited portions of the Masachusetts coast, but I have never been to Cape Cod. Thoreau took me there in his book.The book is arranged into ten chapters. It opens with a description of the shipwreck of the St John on a rock off the Cape. Thoreau then describes a ride by coach across the Cape. But the heart of the book lies in the following chapters in which Thoreau with a companion walks the 30 mile beach from Nauset Harbor to Provincetown with many stops and diversions along the way. I felt the salt air and saw the fishermen and the sandy beach as I walked with Thoreau.The most vivid characterization in the book is in the chapter \\"The Wellfleet Oysterman\\", as Thoreau describes a grizzled, taciturn, and ancient native of Cape Cod and his family who offer him hospitality for the night. Another memorable chapter involves the description of the Highland Lighthouse, no longer standing, and its keeper. The stops with the Oysterman and the Lighthouse punctuate Thoreau's long walks through the day over the beach and his meditiations about and descriptions of what he finds there.Thoreaus walk ended at Provincetown, on the northernmost portion of Cape Cod, with its wood walkway, shanty houses, and ever-present scenes of fishermen, boats, and drying fish. Thoreau offers what I found an affectionate portrait of these hardy fishermen and their families. Following a description of what he found at Provincetown, Thoreau offers a great deal of historical background on the exploration of the Cape, from the Pilgrims reaching back to earlier French, Icelandic, and English explorers.Thoreau's \\"Cape Cod\\" is a worthy companion to his books describing his experiences inland, on Walden Pond and on the rivers and woods of New England and Maine. It is beautifuly written with unforgettable descriptive passages. It made me want to get up and go from my life in the city, and over 150 years after Thoreau wrote, wander and walk for myself along the dunes and sands of Cape Cod."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"This is a comment about the edition rather than the book:I bought this edition based on the review about the very helpful index. Please be careful about what edition you are actually buying. Many of these reviews are about different editions. I bought the BiblioLife paperback book with a picture of the green bicycle on the cover. I just received it and there is NO INDEX.It looks like the original text from an original printing (with smaller physical dimensions) was photocopied page by page and put into this paperback book. This will do the trick but I am a little disappointed and wish I had bought a different edition.It is confusing on amazon because when you click \\"look inside\\" it shows an index, with a tiny note saying the \\"look inside\\" refers to a different edition."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"This book details the flora, fauna and people that Thoreau found in Cape Cod in the 1850s. Thoreau organizes the book around a single trip to Provincetown, although much of the material that he uses in the book came from various visits to the Cape, and to the ocean in general. He starts with a description of a shipwreck at Cohasset, then a stagecoach ride from Plymouth, then a walking trip with a companion along the outer shore to Provincetown. Along the way, he describes not only the plants and animals he encountered, but also the people who he met. The book finishes with a lengthy academic historical account of the discovery and mapping of the Cape.I found this to be the most humorous of all Thoreau's work. The character sketches he provides in this book, sharpened with his trained eye for observation of natural phenomena, are legendary. The cultural description of the Cape and its environment is quite fascinating for those interested in the history of daily life in 19th century Massachusetts. As Thoreau describes the desolate, treeless desert that made up the far reaches of the Cape, one begins to comprehend what it meant for an economy to be based on wood and whale oil for fuels. Thoreau stresses how valued driftwood was for residents of the Cape, as one of their main sources of heating and cooking fuel. Doubtless, he would not recognize the Cape today with its lush new forests. Or its Wal-Marts--switching to an oil economy has brought mixed blessings for the Cape. For those who think Thoreau to be a humorless didactic philosopher, this book shows a very different aspect of Thoreau as a writer."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"I'm not sure why Amazon identifies Josep Moldenhauer as the author of this book which is in fact written by Henry David Thoreau.Cape Cod is made up of his rambling observations he ambled about the Cape with an unidentified \\"companion\\" during the 1850's.I was looking forward to an evocative description of the unspoiled Cape which, even today in its over commercialized state, is redolent with romance, timelessness, and above all with the sea. Instead, the reader is exposed to dithering minutiae, delivered in a style that often borders on the unreadable.Here, for instance, is what must be one of the longest sentences ever written in the English language. It deals with the act of looking into a house on the beach through a knot-hole in the door. Hold on - you're not going to believe this.Here goes...However, as we wished to get an idea of a Humane house, and we hoped that we would never have a better opportunity, we put our eyes, by turns, to a knot-hole in the door, and after long looking, without seeing, into the dark, - not knowing how many shipwrecked men's bones we might see at last, looking with the eye of faith, knowing that, though to him that knocketh it may not always be opened, yet to him that looketh long enough through a knot hole the inside shall be visible, - for we had had some practice of looking inward, - by steadily keeping our other ball covered from the light meanwhile, putting the outward world behind us, ocean and land, and the beach, - till the pupil became enlarged and collected the rays of light that were wandering in that dark (for the pupil shall be enlarged by looking; there was never so dark a night that a faithful and patient eye, however small, might at last prevail over it), - after all this, I say, things began to take shape in our vision, - if we may use this expression where there was nothing but emptiness, - and we obtained the long-wished-for insight.Can you believe it?This monster sentence says that they looked into a house through a knot-hole, and since it was dark it took some time for their eyes to adjust, but eventually they were able to dimly make out the interior. That's it! And yet it contains not less that 207 words, twenty-four commas, seven dashes, and one semi colon.Anyway, apart from this sketchy style, Cape Cod is eminently forgettable."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"Cape Cod, by Henry David Thoreau, a book reviewReading Cape Cod is like visiting with a distant relative or a fond acquaintance. Thoreau, who we have all heard about for most of our lives, rarely lectures or preaches on these pages. The chapters ramble through a Cape Cod of yesteryear and are comprised of articles and journal entries from Thoreau's walking holidays in 1849, 1850, 1855, and 1857. He describes the countryside, the tame and wild vegetation (complete with botanical names), architecture, people, food, farms, ships, fishing, economic activity, and everything else that presents itself to his view.While Thoreau waxes poetic, and even philosophical, from time to time, this reads like a casual travel log, albeit from a very learned and intelligent scholar. The text includes quotes in a variety of languages, including Latin, Greek, and French, which are not all translated. Those looking for uncommon quotes are sure to find a few juicy tidbits. If you are looking for encouragement for reading the Christian Bible, exhortations against organized religion, or beautiful thoughts on nature and solitude, you will definitely find them here.What I found most fascinating, is the ecological destruction that had already occurred in the area. Some native shellfish had been nearly wiped out, and \\"seed stock\\" was being imported from other areas. Trees no longer reached the height that they had originally grown, crop land was no longer as productive, and erosion was enough of a problem that the government had stepped in with programs and regulations. Thoreau documents that the people blamed \\"Providence\\"--meaning the Creator--when their crops or natural resources failed them. It seems it never occurred to them that their own actions might be detrimental to their environment.Thoreau also documents the thinking about the ocean and its resources back in those days. Even he sees the ocean as nearly infinite and unlimited. This thinking is reflected in the fisheries and especially in the take on what they called \\"blackfish.\\" The \\"blackfish\\" is a small whale, or perhaps a dolphin, with a blunt shaped head. Schools of these creatures are chased aground by men and boys in small boats. They are then murdered for their blubber and left to rot. Thoreau asks one of the \\"fishermen\\" if the meat is good to eat, and the fishermen replies that he prefers it to beef--when it is fresh. Thoreau's only comment on this waste is that the poor soil needs the nutrients that this \\"manure\\" supplies.The edition that I read, which was arranged with notes by Dudley C. Lunt and was published by W. W. Norton & Company in 1951, contains a history of Cape Code in the appendix. This history, written by Thoreau, is rambling and disjointed, but worth reading. We all know that we have been sold a bill of goods in regards to Plymouth and the Pilgrims. A close reading of this history emphasizes just what a good sales job it was. The first thing that really grabbed me is the fact that three prior successful, permanent, European settlements had been established in North America (before Plymouth); one in Florida,--one I believe he said--in New Mexico, and one in Nova Scotia. (The one in Florida I have read something about before. When doing some research on the first Thanksgiving I ran across an article about a Florida town that claims it was celebrating Thanksgiving before the Pilgrims even thought of coming to the \\"New World.\\") Thoreau also documents early Viking and French visits to the area, and quotes texts that claim European people had been fishing in or near Cape Cod for many hundreds of years before \\"America\\" was \\"discovered.\\"Anyone researching the history of the East Coast, New England, or early contact between the two continents will find this a rewarding read. Thoreau sites the documents he quotes and others that may contain valuable information. However, you don't have to be a scholar or a student with a project to enjoy this book. Anyone with an interest in sustainability, history, botany, or the writing of Thoreau will be enriched by the time spent between these pages."},{"Title":"Cape Cod;","review":"(My review is on Thoreau's Cape Cod rather than this specific edition).While some literary critics seem to slight this work by Thoreau, saying that it is not as \\"powerful\\" as his other works, etc., I personally find this one very enjoyable. Sure, it does not have as much \\"philosophizing\\" as other books by him, but it is full of humor and very fun to read. The part where he describes the old man spitting into the hearth is particularly hilarious. The part about him sleeping in a lighthouse is also very funny. It lets us experience the more jovial side of Thoreau. This is probably one of the easiest to read among Thoreau's books.Published posthumously, this volume is surprisingly consistent and complete (unlike \\"The Maine Woods\\" which is chopped into three different parts), it gives one the feel of walking along the entire cape, although the materials are quarried from several different trips. One only wish Thoreau had lived longer and had seen the West, imagine him taking a trip in the Sierra!

Due to her effectiveness in organizing labour she was persistantly persecuted by authorities and in 1913 she was convicted of conspiracy to commit murder on trumped up charges. The sentence was commuted and in 1914 Mother Jones again played a prominent role in publicizing the massacre of 20 people by machine-gun fire during a Ludlow, Colorado miner's strike.

What a disappointment !!!"},{"Title":"Life lines","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Life Lines, Jill Ireland's second book. It comes after her initial battle with breast cancer, when she is in remission. She details her life of when she was a child and the early years of her marriage to Charles Bronson. It gives a much more detailed look at her personal life than was given in her first book, Life Wish. This second book accurately describes her dilemma those of us known as \\"the sandwich generation\\" live on a day to day basis. Many people have to face the prospect of caring for elderly parents as well as the heavy mantle of motherhood. In Jill's case it was very trying dealing with a substance addicted son at the same time trying to care for her parents,(her father was a stroke victim) who live in England. She would regularly fly her parents over to her home in California for Christmas holidays or for the summertime, when they would stay at their Vermont house. The challanges came when a problem with Jason (her son) arose at the same time as a problem her father was having. Her father had lost all means of communication due to his stroke. She manages both of these with grace and good humor for the most part. A very good read!"},{"Title":"The Pattern Companion: Beading","review":"This book is really good with great illustrations in color on the techniques including netting, peyote, squared needle weaving, tubular right-angle weave, ladder, brick and herringbone stitches, square stitch, loom bead weaving, bead knitting, crochet, tubular beaded crochet, embellishment techniques and knotting. This is followed by good material on the beads and tools . The many projects are also well illustrated with great drawings to help. One caveat though: this book is a compilation from 4 other books which is annoying if you've got them already and if you don't have them, you may not want to buy them either. The four are: Ann Benson, Beading for the first time, Gay Bowles, Beaded cross-stitch treasures, Valerie Campbell-Harding, Beaded tassels, braids and fringes, Gourley, Elizabeth, etc, Art of seed beading and C.W. Wells, Art & elegance of beadweaving.But the price, even without any discount here, is good and this is one of the best books on beading that I've bought so far."},{"Title":"The Pattern Companion: Beading","review":"There are a few patterns and projects here but this book is more about making yourself more knowledgable and proficient with beadwork.

Looks more the the very rough outline of the concept of a book project that was never finalized. Many ridiculous situations, including: the East Germans keep hands off the family farm; a character goes to a meeting with Saddam Hussein and the official car he's in--and his escort officers--are successfully waylayed by a bunch of street punks. Totalitarian regimes don't work like that. And there's lots of cliche-ridded stuff about loyal retainers who would willingly die for whoever it is they're willing to die for. I paid nothing for this book (got it as a gift), and it's probably worth less than that. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This was the first, and probably last, book of Higgins that I read. The consensus opinions are right about this - poorly plotted, rushed ending, boring villians, and cardboard heroes.The initial premise is fairly captivating; Hitler's diary saved from the bunker in Berlin, and the potentially world-shaking secrets held within. The problem is that the promise of the concept never delivers. Ultimately, I felt the great secret in the diary was not so astonishing, and would have little relevance anymore 60 plus years after the war.The 'cameo' of Saddam Hussein was forced at best, and didn't add anything to the story. I found the dialogue to be wooden and terribly cliched. The best parts of this book were the early scenes set in WWII. Once the story advanced to the present day, all the interest was lost as it became a fairly typical by-the-numbers thriller. You could expect this level of story-telling from an episode of most crime dramas on tv."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"In the waning hours of World War II in Europe, Hitler is holed up in his bunker with Eva Braun contemplating his own personal ultimate solution.

I had high hopes early on as Bad Company starts in Hitler's bunker amid the bombs and bullets of the last days of the war. Higgins paints a desperate, atmospheric word picture of the chaos that existed as fruits of a madman's harvest bring down a country. But as the audio CD moves from the 1940s to modern times, we get a confused, predictable tale, low on surprises and not much fun (especially the ending). I was disappointed that the good guys were not more likable than the bad guys - especially with Nazis and IRA killers popping up every now and again. Everyone is a crack shot, planting bullets in the brains of people at unbelievable distances while weathering storms and machine gun fire from the enemy. Really laughable. Even harder to swallow was Patrick Macnee's attempt to do German and Italian accents. Maya Got! Atsa no gooda! This is only for die hard Higgings fans - all others can safely pass and know they didn't miss much."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Jack Higgins is just spinning his wheels in this boring \\"thriller\\" that recycles his usual cast of characters with very little new interest (and is anyone else besides me getting tired of them?). The \\"McGuffin\\" in this book is so weak that one wonders why this crack team of international tough guys even cares about it. Everyone walks through the paces without much reflection or embellishment. I agree with another poster that \\"SOLO\\" and \\"EAGLE\\" are top-form Higgins and should be where new readers start.The audio version with Patrick Macnee takes it down a notch. I loved P.M. in The Avengers, and he has a great voice, but as a book reader he goes WAY over the top emotionally. Every line of dialog is read with undue intensity, like in a corny stage melodrama, and his Italian accent is so bad that I laughed every time he used it."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"To say I was disappointed is putting it mildly. This books lacks any suspense. The plot was phoned in. Other than some of the characters there is no resemblence between this book and other Jack Higgins books. Do not think of buying this book. Avoid borrowing it from the library. Use your time to read any other other Jack Higgins book."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This is the worst book in this entire genre, which is saying a lot. The plot is so thin, the characters so stupid and stereotypical. For example, high-level, British gov't-sponsered assassins/special agents discuss their plans outloud in public places and are...shocking!...overheard! One guy \\"confesses\\" to a priest/psychiatrist all the details of his crimes, in a church with his arch-enemy listening in the wings. Sort of a Laurel and Hardy version of a Tom Clancy thriller. How Higgins got to be a millionaire from writing is beyond me. This one was written by the proverbial hundred monkeys randomly pounding keys. No offense to any monkeys out there."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Jack Higgins has gone from author to hack in the past decade, and this piece of rubbish is a continuance of his down-hill slide. The characters are one-dimensional at best, with zero development. The plot, for lack of a better word, is contrived and predictable.How many bottles of Krug &amp; Bushmills can they drink? How many times can he mention a Carswell silencer? How often can the good guys win while only suffering the loss of a single throw-away character? Does anybody care about these boring and repetitive plot lines or the translucent characters?When I got to page 33 and the Germans fleeing 1945 Berlin were passing around a wine bottle WITH A SCREW CAP (not invented for another 25 years or so), I knew the author and the publisher didn't care about anything but the revenues.You can buy this hard-bound cartoon and read it, or you can scoop your eyes out with a rusty spoon. They both provide the same level of enjoyment . . .I apologise for the single star, but they don't offer a zero star option."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"I have always liked the way that Jack Higgins can imagine circumstances that occurred in the past that could have profound, negative consequences today. In Bad Company, Mr. Higgins has once again developed such a concept. In the waning days of World War II, the Nazis hold secret talks with the Americans about joining forces against the Soviet Union. Although those talks went nowhere, the U.S. representative was the father of the current U.S. President, Jake Cazalet. And thus you see the risk of grave embarrassment.The book takes a strange turn in two ways. First, Mr. Higgins grafts this interesting concept onto a continuation of the Rashid family saga . . . which doesn't really add anything to the book. In fact, it makes the book work less well. Second, the German protagonist is a confusing mix of a good German who turns into a supporter of post World War II Nazis . . . and a father who wants to dote on a monster.On the side of the angels is the usual devil, Sean Dillon, who routinely annoys and dispatches all adversaries with comic book panache. I personally don't enjoy reading about Mr. Dillon and this book has much too much of him in it.As with other books in this series, all roads lead through Northern Ireland . . . which is fine if you don't mind that sort of thing.As I finished the book, I realized that the interesting premise had turned into a book that could have been written with almost any premise. So an interesting idea was mostly wasted. Perhaps another writer will pick up on the concept and continue with it.If the premise had not been interesting, I would have rated this book at two stars."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Read this book to pass the time. There is no other reason to recommend it. Indeed, that is what I did, and it was short enought to get me through a one-and-a-half-hour Frankfurt-London run. Higgins has written well in the past, this one is probably one of his worst efforts.The story really starts in wartime Berlin, almost at the end of the war. Hitler, just before everything came to an end for him, passes his diary on to a loyal member of his officers elite, Max von Berger. The story then picks up after his repatriation to Germany several years later. The story had great promise at this point, but I was already a quarter way through the book, and was getting nervous. Indeed, it was a dissapointing run from there. The sad part is that the framework of the story is really really good. It was just terribly handled, considering the skill that I know Jack Higgins possesses! The Hitler diary, the fascinating link between the war and the present day President of the USA. The story takes us to some fascinating places: Germany, the USA, England, Iraq, Yemen. BUt the visits are so short, Higgins doesn't take advantage of having travelled us there. He seems more interested in the local cuisine, and that's about it! I didn't like this novel. I found it highly predictable, very shallow, almost as though Higgins was not interested in telling the story at all, but rather a summary of it. Sean Dillon was a little too invincible for my liking, and Rossi doesn't fit in at all! I would rather re-read The Eagle has Landed. One star for a really original idea. It is sad it was so poorly worked."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"1. People got angry at Sean Dillon. They tried to kill him. He killed them instead.2.

I can't believe I even finished it. It was like a comic book without pictures. Except, of course, comic books have better dialog. (ie. \\"I thought I was a good pilot, but you're a great pilot. Isn't he a great pilot, Billy?\\"). There are worse examples but this one was at the end so I remembered it better.How did this guy become a best-selling author?"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"I have been a long-time Higgins fan. His books, as stated by another poster, are all over the place in quality. When Higgins is &quot;On&quot; he's like lightning. When he's cold, he's like a limp fish. This one is a limp fish. I couldn't even finish the book. Got about 25 pages from the end and just gave up on it. Parts of the book are just down-right hokey; as when he talks about hacking computers...like anyone can hack into the most sensitive files in a computer. He also sprays the book with his usual, and now just old and over-used phrases.If you want good Higgins read &quot;The Valhalla Exchange&quot; or if you want great Higgins, read &quot;Solo&quot; or &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot;. Solo is a killer book...I read it in one day."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This has got to be the worst ever Higgins book. Though the author has hit past home runs (the Eagle has landed), this is a really terrible effort. He creates potentially interesting characters, only to kill them off with a sentence pages later. He sets up poitential conflicts (the leading bad guy is given Hitler's diary to safekeep) only to never make it a significant part of the plot--seems that all the Baron got was billions to spend on his own companies! He even sets up potential surprises (Dillon hiding a gun against the moment when the nasties surprise him) only for it never to be used. Higgins, I suspect, wrote this book only after a martini or two. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Jack Higgins has wrote some wonderful books in the past, but he must have written this without much thought to plot or character development. I waited to reach halfway through to see if it would start to make sence, and it didn't even come close. I tossed it in the garbage and told my mother not to even touch the book for she is (used to be..)an avid fan."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"It's the same cast of characters--General Ferguson and Sean Dillon--teaming up again. I particularly enjoyed the beginning, in Hitler's bunker during the last days of WWII. I liked the character of Max Von Berger, an SS officer who was destined to be the keeper of Hitler's secret diary. This book is not Higgins at his best. But, is still better writing than one gets from most authors."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"If you know anything about writing you won't enjoy this book. If you are devoid of information about plot development, characterization and drama you might give this two stars.Isn't there anyone to tell Higgins this is terrible?"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"I used to be a real fan of Higgins' earlier work like The Eagle Has Landed and Storm Warning. I have been less than impressed with his more recent efforts, but fond memories of his past glory made me give this one a try. It will be the last time. Judging from the gossamer plot, inconsistent characters and general \\"I've-written-the-bloody-book-so-send-me-my-check\\" style, apparently all the talent has drained out of Mr. Higgins. I'll grant that it was a fast read, but that's because there was nothing of substance there to hold a reader's attention. Other reviewers have already enumerated the book's many deficiencies. I just have one question. Why would Higgins create such a potentially interesting character as von Berger (an heroic Waffen SS Officer with integrity, who wasn't a member of the Party) and then throw him away with almost no character development? Worse yet, what little development he did give him went totally against the type of person he initially described when he was introduced at the beginning of the book. What a waste."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The plot is sketchy, spanning over 55 years and quite farfetched. The text feels like one of the condensed books by Readers Digest, everything is hurrying by and the situations happen so fast that there is no suspence at all. Everything is over within a page or two.The very worst book I have read is \\"Red Rabbit\\" by Tom Clancy. His problem is to little happening and to many words (=800 plus pages). Higgins is on the other side of the scale - too much happening with too few words.I think I will use this paper back as kindling paper for my furnace. I won't ever read it again and won't let anyone else do it either."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I've read in recent history. I was new to Higgins but figured, how could a guy that's written 35 novels be that bad?Oh, how wrong I was.I should have known when Higgins' dust-jacket bio described him as being a multi-millionaire. Who puts that in their bio?Things got worse from there.The plot jumped from WWII to Saddam-era Baghdad to current times with alacrity.A major plot twist is revealed in the span of a page. It's done so quickly that it seems like a convenient way for Higgins, his editor or the publishing company to avoid a whole messy chapter explaining what could have been one of the more exciting parts of the book.The final 'battle' is over so quickly that the reader is left wondering what the heck just happened.And so much of the story relies on amazing coincidences, exceptionally good timing and plain old luck, that it wears thin in short order.I have one thing to say to Higgins' publishing house: BAD company! BAD! You're a naughty company! Do NOT publish any more of this drivel."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Once again Sean Dillon must come to the rescue. After the deaths of his adversaries, the Rashid family, Dillon now faces Baron von Berger and his illegitimate son, Marco Rossi, who have remaining interest in the Rashid fortune. Von Berger wants revenge and will stop at nothing. He has in his possession the actual diary of Adolph Hitler that can potentially wreak havoc on the leadership of the free world and threatens to use it. Dillon must stop him while trying to save himself.Jack Higgins continues to write spare direct novels that get right to the point. In one quick sentence he announces the death of a main character- no emotion- no build up. With thriller writers today writing bulky tomes, it would seem to be almost refreshing to read a shorter work. However, Higgins may go a bit too far. A word of caution- the book picks up on MIDNIGHT RUNNER and if the reader hasn't read at least that far back, they may be a bit confused as to what is happening. However, Jack Higgins remains an icon and a noted practitioner of the art of the thriller."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Recent Higgins' books have become like a children's game of police-and-thief.Higgins used to produce great thrillers set in WW2 &amp; the Cold War. He also produced some from a more common man's POV, such as Graveyard Shift. Readers could actually feel the flesh and blood of the characters, or enjoy the plot development with unexpected twists.No more.Ever since he hooked up Sean Dillon, the quality of the writing steadily went down.Readers do not feel the characters were going through any real danger, whether it be diving, flying, parachuting, sailing or driving. The villains were mostly UK or US war veterans turned bad, and failed to impress.The worse was it appeared to be a game played in the children's playground - police &amp; thief. The good guys know where the bad guys are, and the bad guys know where the good guys are. Ask the hacker, and bingo, you have your foes' complete historical dossier, his itinerary, not to mention the blueprint of his house, his boat and his plane. The good guys and the bad guys never failed to meet in a trendy London club or restaurant just to say to each other &quot;I'm gonna get you.&quot;At the end of the day, the good guy and the bad guy just pull their guns at each other and the good guy walked away because he was just a little faster. Recurring cast got to live for another book.This is not the same type of the book produced under the author's name that made its mark such as &quot;The Eagle has landed&quot;, &quot;Cold Harbor&quot; and &quot;A Game for Heroes&quot;."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"I eagerly wait for every Higgins novel when it is announced. I am happy to say that I enjoyed Bad Company as much as the others in what could be called \\"The Dillon Saga\\". Those who like Higgins will get what they expect. A \\"villian\\" that isn't really a BAD guy in that you can understand his/her motives and sometimes has some redeeming qualities so it is a little sad when they get their due. You can expect to see appearances by the usual crew, Ferguson, Salter, etc. I WOULD like to see Dillon and Hannah get together...in some fashion, but the \\"Sam and Diane\\" scenario doesn't seem likely to change. Anyway, in Bad Company, good triumphs over evil after a few bumps in the road and it is on to the next chapter in the Dillon saga...Sean Dillon has certainly grown from the \\"villian\\" in his first appearance in the Higgins tales. He, like the others has come to be an old friend.But even we need a break from our friends.I have been a huge fan of Jack Higgins since I was in college and my Dad handed me a copy of Storm Warning. The novel has always been a favorite of mine. I think Higgins is at his best when he is in the \\"historical fiction\\" mode when he mixes real and fictitious characters and events.Since Higgins isn't averse to doing sequels or stories with recurring characters, I would love to see a follow up to that wonderful story that Storm Warning was. Better still, the end of his sequel to \\"The Eagle has Landed\\", \\"The Eagle Has Flown\\" seemed to indicate that another chapter in Devlin and Steiner's story might pop up someday.Since Dillon and Company have seemed to have pretty much wiped out the Rashids and their friends (They didn't have any killer pets did they?), maybe, just maybe Higgins will try something new next time.Not that I wouldn't mind seeing Dillon again, as the groom in a Jewish wedding :)"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"See storyline above.First of all I don't remember Jack Higgins previous novels being this bad. Okay, the plot had potential and the action was there, but this book seemed like it was very rushed. The characters didn't seem there usual self (Dillon being stopped by a tractor in the road? No other explanation?). Please. The brevity of the book and the rushed style (very little depth) made for a very disappointing read.Not recommended."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"If you are a Jack Higgins fan you know what to expect. This book is by the numbers.Higgins goes into great detail setting up the book with the Hitler diaries subplot. However, this whole section goes nowhere. It could have been much more interesting.The Von Berger character as a villian does not really work out.I listened to this on CD. Patrick MacNee does a creditable job as the reader.If you have nothing better to do, you may want to pick this book up. Otherwise, I would try other works."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Our story begins at the funeral of Kate Rashid, the villainess of Higgins's last thriller, whom undercover enforcer Sean Dillon managed to kill before she wrought her vengeance upon him for killing her three beloved brothers. Dillon and his companions watch on, increasingly uneasy at the presence of Baron Max von Berger, a multi-millionaire friend of the Rashid's, who has now interhited their old empire in the Hazar that is worth billions.Now, von Berger himself wants revenge, and it is a matter of honour. Kate Rashid once saved his life, and she was a very dear friend. He is determined to exact justice on those who conspired to destroy the Rashid's and their empire: Dillon, his friend in the government General Charles Ferguson, and their colleague, White House insider Blake Johnson. But, unknown to them, Berger has a secret weapon. In the waning days of WWII Hitler entrusted von Berger, his close aide, with his diary detailing the final six months of the war, and a meeting he had with President Roosevelt which could have stopped the war before it started.Bad Company is another of Higgins's increasingly by-the-numbers, cliched, formulaid thrillers that just reuse aspects from his other books (boats blown-up, planes crashed, assassinations, etc), but it is a primse example. A one character says of the events in the book, \\"It's like a bad novel\\", and that is exactly what they are. They are the evnets of a bad novel. however, they are also the envets of an entertaining story, and this is exactly what this is. A great story, a nice adventure. It's fast, thrilling, enjoyable, nothing more. nothing less. If you are looking for great writing, don't come here. If you're looking for a plot that wont fall apart under close scrutiny, also don't come here. If you're simply looking for a quick, easy read that's a bit James Pattersonesque in style, then do come here.There's only one little problem, really: Dillon is flat and cardboard. Higgins has reduced him merely to proper nouns and pronouns, and as a result the reader tends to prefer the villains, who are more colourful, and that leads to dissappointment come the finale (which is a tad rushed), in which, of course, the heroes unfailingly win.Still, Bad Company is light and easy reading, and it's relatively easy to overlook that almost everything within has been lifted from various other Jack Higgins books. This is about as close to literature as a TV guide, but, then, it doesn't intend to be."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Any reader expecting great literature will be disappointed and, to be fair, having read about a dozen of Higgins' books myself, such expectations would be more than foolish. Higgins is a well-oiled, formulaic writer, able to produce simple, direct sentences, basic emotions, and some color, using a relatively standard set of \\"high\\" elements. In this case, using foggy London, the stormy Irish Sea, forested Germany, and Middle Eastern deserts, he provides some set pieces of almost chivalrous interaction among the caricatured cast: the reformed IRA member, the London mobsters, the head of a shadowy British counterintelligence unit, the crippled computer wonk, the very attractive Oxford assistant, the noble Nazi, the secretive Swiss banker, the out-of-wedlock son, and the elderly one-time secretary to Hitler. Both sides of the battle have polite face-to-face meetings where they swear they will kill each other. What are they waiting for? Characters reveal incredible skills with obscure or unrelated tasks, from playing the piano to speaking multiple languages to working explosives. Sean Dillon could be James Bonds' darker side, or brother abandoned at birth.Moving quickly across time and place, Higgins's prose is as sparse as Hemingway's yet without any of the emotion or power. The \\"emotional event\\" that drives the protagonist, seems small and insignificant. Higgins is more fascinated with food (lots of bacon and eggs), hotels (the Dorchester), restaurants, booze (make it Bushmills), weapons (everybody loves their Walthers), estates (German, of course) and haunts (pubs, night clubs, swank clubs, the London docks) than with his paper mache characters. Even his layout is thin: 282 pages, large font, extra spacing between lines, blank pages between chapters and sections. This is a quick read because the story is so short. Even the stereotypic plot 'device', the Hitler diary, has no real use in the story. remove it entirely and you lose little of the story.One star for weaving a credible (if poorly researched) story and another for making it easy to digest. But that's it. I'm swearing off Higgins."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This is the first Jack Higgins' book I've ever read, and I regret that I've even read it at all. What a waste of my time! I almost couldn't and didn't want to finish it. Since I don't have any prior knowledge of all the characters that appeared in other Higgins' books, I thought, except for Baron Von Berger, NONE of the characters have developed enough depth for me to know and to even care about them. As far as I know they're nothing but a group of thugs and murderers that are feuding over personal vindication in the name of contrived heroic excuses. Halfway through the book, as soon as Baron Von Berger faded into oblivion, I started losing interest in this book. The motivation for Von Berger to declare war against Dillon &amp; Ferguson over Kate Rashid was, at best, weak and contrived. I couldn't find character to relate to or to root for. The plot's thin and the emotion's void. It's extremely disappointing."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"I usually love Higgins novels, be they WWII or other, but this one was horendous. I found myself on page 200 waiting for something to happen. Then I was at page 286, the end of the novel, and nothing ever happened. It seems that he was in need to get a novel out for a contract with the publisher or something."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Jack Higgins has woven a cast of characters that are daring and very real in this dangerous world. He has created a separate hit squad on either side of the Atlantic to deal with baddies - and one of the best characters he has in Sean Dillon, formerly of the IRA and now working for the government. He is a killing machine. Yet it is tearing him apart. He is a shark that must keep moving or else he'll die, and he knows it and must go on.This book gives more info on the Rashid family and how Baron Von Berger made his wealth in part of the Rashids and part of his secret possession of Hitler's diary that implicates the current American President Cazalet's father during world war peace negotiations. The good guys go after the bad company to retreive the diary and stop Von Berger"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Will the real Jack Higgins please stand up. Used to be all you had to do was see the name Jack Higgins and you just HAD to buy the book because it would be a winner. Not this time. Maybe it's the glut of World War II books or the interest in maniacal psychopaths such as Hitler, Stalin, Saddam, but this book didn't interest me whatsoever. The plot -- if you really want to call it a plot -- doesn't start until mid-read, and it is a very hazy plot at that. The ending was not an ending, but more of a stop sign -- put up at the end of a circuitous road involving a search for Adolph's Swiss bank fortune. Too many characters, good guys and bad guys, spoil the too-leisurely flow of the story line."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"If you've ever heard a great professional reader like Frank Miller or David Case, you'll know why I can't stand it when authors or actors narrate a book. Patrick MacNee has no feel and his accents are atrocious. His idea of an Italian accent is to add an 'a' to the end of every word. Just awful!"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Jack Higgins had some incredible books, but this is.... one word that comes to mind \\"terrible\\". Its confusing, badly written, hurried (especially the end). Higgens can do and has done much, much better. The book actually upset me since the bad guys seemed to be the good guys and the good guys the bad.Better luck next time. Don't bother reading this book, unless you want to turn the last page with a very sour look on your face. Suprised it was even published. Read The Eagle has Landed, its great.Hope this helped."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Let's face it, this book is not great literature nor, I suspect, does the author intend it to be. I really think Mr. Higgins just wants to present his loyal readers with an action-packed, page-turning read every so many months, and he has accomplished that once again with this book. It's quite easy to read, and I polished it off in one sitting over about four hours. The usual group of good guys is present, with Sean Dillon given the opportunity to show what, for lack of a better term, is his &quot;soft side&quot; when he reacts to the murder of an elderly woman. There's the usual mayhem, with Dillon and Company prevailing in the end. Sure the plot is fairly predictable, the characters occasionally merely stick figures, but you don't read this type of book and expect to get &quot;War and Peace&quot;! Open it, start turning the pages, and hang on for the expected wide and wooly ride!"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Entertaining and interesting? Yes. A true thriller? Way too predictable to meet that standard. There's no real punch, no real suspense, no real substance and no real characters. It's more like a fast-paced Harlequin read for men. In that respect, 'Bad Company' meets Higgins' commercial goal, but with the number of new military thriller and suspense authors as well as authors like Ken Follett who still stretch their capabilities to achieve five-star thrillers, 'Bad Company' is truly disappointing."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"Screwcaps on wine bottles - actually not invented until about the late 1960s, I think. But that (and a lot of other weird stuff) pales when you compare it to Sara, the secretary of the F&uuml;hrer.A snowball in hell would have had a lengthy life compared to a Sara in Hitler's bunker; bear in mind that one of the most dignity-killing acts under the German Racial Laws was that every Jew had to use a Jewish first name -- Sara was one of those names, as was Moses for men.A little research by the author would have shown that Hitler, at that stage in life, was a foaming-at-the-mouth paranoiac (maybe for good reasons), and his gentle conversation with the \\"SS pilot\\" who renders a forbidden salute to the Supreme Commander of the Reich's military....well, what can I say!Oy, Gevalt, mein F&uuml;hrer!"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"If your looking for more of the same thats what you'll find with Jack's latest in the Sean Dillon saga. Other then an admirable attempt to present a softer Sean to the readers, this is a story that is just as exciting as the others in the series but no more so. Personally I don't have a problem with the &quot;more of the same approach,&quot; but it does cause one to wonder whether the story is losing steam.I enjoyed the book because I love Jack Higgins. However I do hope the series will add a new twist sometime soon."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"It may be somewhat the same as some others, the cast, the scenes, the Bushmills, shepards pies and bacon sandwiches but when any of us see another Sean Dillion novel we don't hesitate do we? Some complain but they have to agree because they also read the book. It must be somewhat difficult after thirty five books to keep coming up with more but it seems Mr. Higgins sucessfully completes that mission. I for one will continue to read all that he writes, I have yet to find a bad one."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"It has been a while since I have read Higgins and I realize I have not missed him. I loved his earlier works, but this was pretty boring. It starts with promise, tracking a S.S. Officer who is entrusted with Hitler's secret diary. This fact amounts to basically nothing and we follow his career to current day where he has become a business tycoon. He finds himself at odds with Sean Dillon and the rest of the plot was like watching paint dry. And as Forest Gump said, \\"That's all I've got to say about that\\". If you want WWII related plots, read \\"Black Cross\\" by Greg Iles or \\"Sands of Sakharra\\" by Glenn Meade."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"One of the deadpan lines delivered by the heroic Indiana Jones in one of the 1930-1940 successful series, reminds me of the question how bad could a book be that continues to punish the Evil empire?Jack Higgins never lets us down. We always know what's coming. The quips between Hannah Bernstein and Sean Dillon; the wisdom and experience of Charles Ferguson; the accolades from the President and the Prime Minister. We've seen it all before and we love it!It's hard to give it a 5 star rating because there's nothing new. Here we have Baron von Berger, having survived certain death in the bunker, presently living the good life as an industrialist with access to Hitler's billions. He eventually becomes involved with Kate Rashid, the sister of Mid Eastern oil barons (the Rashid Brothers) and von Berger's empire becomes exponentially larger.His long lost son, Marco Rossi, returns to him and the two plot vengeance on General Fergusen and Sean, as a result of the latters' involvement in the killing of the Rashid brothers and possibly of the death of sister Kate.Mr. Higgins writes an enjoyable story. A fast read. He won't stretch you like Dennis Lehane or John LeCarre or Elizabeth George. A fun read. If you want more, this is probably not the place to start."},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"During the last days of World War II in the European theatre, Baron Max Von Berger, a sturmbahnfurher of the SS is given Hitler's diary by the dictator personally. The Baron takes the diary and hides it in a secret niche in his home Schloss Alder near the village of Nevstadt. The diary contains never before released information about Hitler suing for peace with the United States and both countries then would invade Russia.President Roosevelt sent Senator Cazalet, the father of the current United States President, to meet with Hitler's representative in a neutral country. Roosevelt rejects the idea of an alliance but if the truth about President Cazalet's father ever comes out, it could topple the government. The president appeals to English operative General Charles Ferguson and his colleague Sean Dillon to get the diary, which will be no easy feat. The Baron and his son hate the president, General Ferguson, Dillon and several of their friends for their role in the death of Kate Rashid, a terrorist wearing the clothes of a legitimate businessperson.Jack Higgins can always be counted on to give his fans a riveting thriller and his latest novel is one of his best. BAD COMPANY starts off at light speed and goes quickly into warp drive, never easing up on the throttle so that readers never quite catch their breath. There's a dark undercurrent running throughout all the characters and the only difference between the heroes and the villains is that the heroes carry a badge. This is one thriller that is on it's way to the bestseller lists.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bad Company","review":"This is a first-rate novel by Jack Higgins. It starts out with the funeral of Kate Rashid. Also with the introducing of new villians such as the Baron and Rossi. Also with the usually heroic Sean Dillion which this time in this book.

Nash's experience in theological circles (including three pastorates)well qualifies him to address a subject in which he only scratches the surface. I found myself finishing the book in a couple of hours, and wanting him to say more. His three or four or five or eight points in each chapter were helpful, useful, and thought-provoking. The issues of community wasn't as fully explored as I was anticipating or expected it to be. Maybe the author could team up with Dr. Stephen Green at Pasadena First Church of the Nazarene (California) and further examine exactly what the &quot;modern church&quot; must do to adequately address and minister to folk living in the throes of postmodernity. The almost comical analogies with the new WALMART Super Centers were cute at best, and lent just a tad to his discussion. Surely there are some &quot;CD churches&quot; in North America somewhere. The problem is only somewhat clear; now the author should help us find some biblical, meaningful and usable solutions."},{"Title":"An 8-Track Church in a Cd World: The Modern Church in a Postmodern World","review":"I am an engineer and go to Church somewhat regularly. After reading this book, I now have a better idea of why I have been discouraged with my religious experiences at Church. Dr. Nash explains the problems that face today's church and its congregation. The points that Dr. Nash discusses, establish a starting point to experience Christianity within our world of mass information and search for a meaningful life. Dr. Nash describes what the new Church will be, and explains there are many roads to get there. It will not be easy, but rather extremely difficult. Mainly because congregations go from &quot;group-followers&quot; to individuals with individual responsibility and in that, lead the Church into a new open world with the ministers and pastors being coaches and supporters. As time passes, we will see who is up for the responsibility to be a Christian and who remains locked behind walls in the old world.

Thiele cuts through the many difficulties of Nietzsche's work to present, in prose accessible to any bright undergraduate, the essence of Nietzsche's project: the creation of a self that gives a noble and passionate answer to the question what it means to be fully conscious, fully human, fully engaged in creating one's values and one's life. I've been reading Nietzsche for some ten years now, and had lately begun writing about what makes him so fascinating--when Thiele's book made my own effort unnecessary. If you want to know (1) why Nietzsche looms large in the modern mind and (2) whether you want to read him yourself, this is the place to start"},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: A Study of Heroic Individualism","review":"This book has risen further in my estimation on re-reading. Intellectually honest and daring, it is a \`must read' for any inquisitive Nietzsche \`searcher and researcher'. For once, Nietzsche the man and Nietzsche the philosopher merge. The author has an undeniable passion and veneration for the eponymous hero, and not (as is the case of many other authors of secondary literature) for himself."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: A Study of Heroic Individualism","review":"Exactly what I wanted. I buy books for instructors who forgot to order on time or ones that are out of print."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: A Study of Heroic Individualism","review":"Could Friedrich Nietzsche actually have a hero? For those familiar with his works, the answer to this question would not be an easy one, for the reason that Nietzsche's writings are so honest as to be almost obscure. It is not common in literature or philosophy to find an author so willingly an exhibitionist. It is as though Nietzsche were himself trying to figure out who he was in his writings, and he never hesitates to reveal his thoughts. But maybe exhibitionist is not the right term to describe Nietzsche, as such a characterization would imply that he needed another's look to justify himself. But it seems as though Nietzsche was not writing for another, but for himself, feeling perhaps that his self-analysis was best done on paper.The author addresses this book to the readers of Nietzsche's works who are \\"victims\\" and have swallowed the bait, and consequently \\"carried along by the flights of his thought\\". She makes sure immediately to caution the reader that the expression \\"heroic individualism\\" is not found in any of Nietzsche's writings. But the equation \\"individual = hero\\" holds throughout his works. The author does a fine job of extracting this mathematics of individuation from the the writings of Nietzsche. One finishing the book, one carries away a deeper appreciation of the playful seriousness of Nietzsche's philosophy and his admonition to do philosophy while always looking in the mirror, and seeing one's own reflection, not someone else's.Nietzsche was always celebrating, according to the author, the death of gods, and his project was to inspire a passion for greatness in a world without gods. But idols are to be smashed, and the grandeur of man is not to be found in a divine origin. It is making use of the dynamism of the flux, and the achieving of fame, and not its achievement, that is true heroism. The hero is a \\"dragon-slayer\\" who must achieve in life the highest value, and it (life) is never to be squandered. Caution though must be ever present, lest one use heroism not as a stimulus to self-development but as a means of avoiding it. \\"Sentimental dirge\\" and Wagnerian romanticism must be rejected.The great man does not seek the admiration of the many, as the author again characterizes Nietzschean heroism: \\"go silently through the world and out of the world\\". The temptation for recognition must be avoided; one must not succoumb to the illusion of fame. The golden calf is not to replace the true self as the object of worship. Glory is always self-administered.So how rare or common today is the hero of the Nietzschean type? Well, quite common...thousands...maybe hundreds of thousands. They are to be found in dance, in science, in literature, on the battlefield, behind the counter, sitting in the classroom and also standing in front of it, in the laboratory....indeed everywhere....the 21st century has no paucity of heroism."},{"Title":"Friedrich Nietzsche and the Politics of the Soul: A Study of Heroic Individualism","review":"I was taking lithium when I bought this book 19 years ago. My interest in philosophy was tangential. There are only a few pages in this book that emphasize how much a true individual would be out of step with the government and morality of a country that taught me dirty jokes like: flick my Bic. I was taking lithium to keep myself from flipping out like Nietzsche lost control after his 44th birthday on October 15. 1888. Feeling so much closer to Nietzsche than to the scholars who try to make constructive use of those ideas that are not directed at women and Germans, I was not open to all this book has to say.

With its authentic photographs and pictureque verbal memories, it is a magical evocation of past custsoms in one of the most romantic dales in Yorkshire.When he gave up smoking in the 'fifties, John Moore was able to buy a camera with the money he saved. This book, with its 56 monochrome photographs of the Yorkshire dales and dales life, is the result! The book is more than a colourful survey of the dales - it is a potted history, for many anecdotes, picaresque characters and old customs are captured here - through the lens of the camera and the sensitive mind of the author. The reader will be taken back not only to the days of Lady Anne Clifford, to the days of the carthorse and the blacksmith, but will witness the passing of the steam railway and the changing seasons in what must be one of the most beautiful parts of EnglandA thoroughly entertaining volume for its picaresque views of people and a place beloved of many!

The author seems to have identified real problems that real people have issues with these days - not the notorious &#34;which knife do I use?&#34; dilemma. Secondly, it's his humor.

He wrote these devotionals intending them to be sold for a penny to the poorer people in his parish. Morning and evening portions means that there are two devotions to read each day, and the portions range from half a page to up to two pages. He does see Christ in every verse, and draws out a spiritual teaching from verses where I wouldn't have ever thought to look. He is constantly writing about Christ, love to Christ, the great themes of redemption, and the glory of God. I found the devotional difficult to read out loud with my wife. Hawker's writing takes some concentration just to read it. I found myself going back over sentences often to catch exactly what he was saying. In all, I liked it and recommend it, though I still prefer Spurgeon'sMorning and Evening: Daily Readings."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"The title of the book might lead you to refrain, since it implies that the story is about a country vicar. One wonders how exciting that might be? However, this book is probably one of Trollope's most suspenseful and well-rounded novels. You have a romance, an unrequited romance, and a young woman at the heart of it whose lack of fortune could lead her astray. Mary Lowther, visiting the vicar and her friend, his wife, receives a marriage proposal from Harry Gilmore, the local squire, who at the encouragement of the vicar, has fallen desperately in love with Mary. Mary has offered no encouragement, and despite the pressure of the vicar and his wife to accept the marriage offer, refuses. Once at home, she falls in love with a visiting relation, but because he is penniless, cannot marry him. Thus she is tossed about on the tides of marital opportunities, continually pressured by friends and family to turn to Harry Gilmore. This portion of the story is rather like a &quot;one woman stands against the world&quot; scene, and it is intriguing, frustrating, and ultimately inspiring as Mary finds her strength not just in love but in herself. If romance doesn't interest you, Trollope has thrown in a second storyline, one unusual in his books. A murder occurs, and the vicar sets about attempting to solve it because the suspect -- even he suspects him -- is a young man from his neighborhood who has been skirting the law and morality for some time. Add to that, we have the character of the beautiful Carry Brattle, seduced by a man outside of wedlock and then tossed out of her home by her insulted father, forced to turn to prostitution in order to eat and find shelter. Her trials and her reform, including her family's eventual forgiveness of her sins, is at once indicative of the harsh lives imposed upon women in Trollope's era and a hope for a future where women are not viewed as the property of men but as persons in their own right. Finally, the vicar does have his own story as he insults a nobleman in his parish and is thereby made an enemy, the nobleman going so far as to build a new church right up against the vicar's property as an insult to the vicar's faith and effectiveness as a man of religion. How this resolves itself is a lark! The story is exciting, and each storyline is so well intertwined that the switch from one to the other as the book progresses is smooth. Never a dull moment in this one, you'll find that from the first page, you cannot put the book down."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"Other reviewers have discussed the plot and the characters of this wonderful mid-Victorian novel; I would rather speculate about what makes the author so much a favorite of mine. Trollope led a jumbling life, traveling constantly during his career as a postal inspector in Ireland, and throughout the world thereafter. He started life as a poor boy suffering hazing at a rich boy's school, was defeated later in a run for Parliament, and ended up a loud, red-faced, hale fellow at clubs. But something developed in his character that gave him remarkable insight into both the upper and lower class mental sets of the English mind of that period. The result is that he can marvelously reproduce both the speech and the thought patterns of his men and women characters as they wrestle with problems they encounter in everyday ethical situations, both ordinary and extraordinary. Thus, we are presented with the dilemmas of a puzzled betrothed young woman, a \\"fallen\\" woman, a youth suspected of murder, an old man torn by grief, a man in the throes of unrequited love, and a fight between a country parson and a lord. Everything is explained and I found myself murmuring, \\"Of course. They would think that, say that, do that.\\" Unlike Dickens, he doesn't deal in grotesques. Unlike Thackeray, he doesn't mock his creations. The novel is therefore a perfect example of the Realist school of fiction writing as well as a fine read. It doesn't cut as deeply as \\"The Way We Live Now,\\" which could be a treatise on the \\"greed is good\\" generations of our recent past, nor does it have the spellbinding comedy-tragedy of the Barsetshire series, nor the political intricacies of the Palliser Series of his novels, but Trollope doesn't disappoint the attentive reader who will suspend \\"presentism\\" type judgments about the role of women or the church in the 19th century or the fact that defendants in a criminal trial could not testify. That was then. He still speaks to us now, and speaks quite clearly."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"As a professor of literature, and as a \\"common reader,\\" I revere Tolstoy above all other novelists I have read, but I would place Trollope just below him, in company with Dickens, Balzac, Austen, and Lawrence. It did not surprize me much to learn, while reading a biography of Tolstoy,that he had a great admiration for Trollope's work. Both these men share, in my opinion, an almost Olympian view of the human beings they have created. I sometimes think these men are writers for grown-ups because they do not deal in villains. We see their characters, as they do, as from a great height, so that Trollope's Crosbie, or Tolstoy's Vronsky demand from us almost as much compassion as those whom they injure. I guess I could sum up why I respect Trollope so: he is the master of ordinary life, and --like Tolstoy--he makes it extraordinary. The clerical hero of \\"The Vicar of Bullhampton\\" is one of the extraordinary, ordinary men. You will remember him."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"I ordered this book and did not realize it is a large format - estimating 8.5 x11 inch -- very heavy in weight, definitely not a pocketbook. The font used is one that looks like it was done on a typewriter, and the ink is quite pale, so not easy to read. The book is so large, my book light did not light up the entire page. The story is wonderful, like all of Trollope's fiction, but this edition is large, heavy, and cumbersome to hold or read. I had to return it."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"My comment on this edition has to do with its print format. It is a literal facsimile of an original edition (Classic Reprint), with the attendant difficulties that appertain to low-tech typesetting: an \\"e\\" often looks like an \\"o\\" (\\"meekly\\" can look like \\"mookly\\"; a single word may be distorted or under-inked, and therefore illegible. Context assists in deciphering, and one does get used to the type style, but it does slow one's progress.It is worth the extra effort to meet the usual fine cast of Trollopian characters, including some well-wrought portraits of working-class folk, and all our favorite societal demarcations and foibles of the Victorian upper classes. But if you are willing to forego the pleasure of reading a period publication in favor of easy-to-read modern print, you will be better served by another edition of this excellent novel."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"Trollope is a great writer and this is among his best novels: less well knwn than Orley Fam and the Barcheter nevels, it deserves to be included with these as one of his best."},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"I'm a great fan of Anthony Trollope's writing. The Vicar of Bullhampton is not my favourite but it's worth 4 stars nonetheless. The familiar theme of marrying for love or money is explored again. Our heroine Mary Lowther is brought to have to choose - is it to be a supposedly idyllic life with family and friends and Squire Gilmore or something more romantic but less secure? Early in the story a murder is committed, bringing a whole new raft of characters into the plot and allowing us to once again look at the tensions and social problems of English village life.Trollope also discusses the problem of 'fallen' women, urging compassion, but falling short of outright acceptance, while Squire Gilmore's unrelenting courtship of Mary Lowther borders on harassment and would not be tolerated in today's world. It's a great read and it also serves to remind us of the changes that have taken place in society, particularly for women, over the last 150 years.Your Life Story: How To Turn Life Into Literature (Turn your life story into a great read)"},{"Title":"The Vicar of Bullhampton","review":"Trollope worked hard, escaping the memories of povertyby producing such; this is only 1 volume of The Chroniclesof Barset.

Nothing special, but not exceptionally bad. I believe the hardcover is also perfectbound (they should call it \\"lousybound\\") instead of sewn; and why would I buy a hardcover, if the binding is not sewn? It won't lay open flat, which makes it even harder to read than a paperback! For $8.00, cheaper than some others, this translation is by far the best on the market.Hays is faithful to the Greek (sometimes overliteral, rarely overfree), more so than other translations. Hays manages to transmit more of the style and mood of Aurelius' actual writing than any other translation by an order of magnitude: this can be a blessing or a curse.However much I demand that my Bibles be literally/formally translated to carry over as much as possible even of the order and form of the God-breathed words (I can't read Hebrew or Aramaic), it's not something I desire in literature, for which, being uninspired (except artistically), the actual words and idioms used generally have no great value, the value instead being in the sense of the text. (I think Hofstadter's Godel Escher Bach is an exception to this, and can't imagine that it can be translated, as so much of the meaning of the book depends on form and peculiarities of the English language.)St Jerome had much the same opinion, stating, I believe in an epistle to St Augustine while defending his (debatable) choice of translating his Vulgate from the Jews' modern Hebrew (which had already entered in on the process of eliminating prophecies of Christ, leaving us with gems such as, \\"like a lion my hands and feet\\", which, with different pointing, reads, \\"they have pierced my hands and feet\\" - the first one doesn't even make sense!) instead of their ancient Septuagint Greek: \\"When translating the sacred scriptures, I attempt to give Greek and Hebrew a clothing of Latin, retaining even the word order so far as it is possible [that is, formal translation: in the process giving rise to \\"Ecclesiastical Latin\\", as the Vulgate is no more Ciceronian or Virgilian Latin than Spanish is] but when translating the works of men, I endeavor to translate the sense of what is being said, not only the words [that is, dynamic translation]\\".De Selincourt's translations of Livy are some of the best examples of the latter. Livy is far from inspired: I care little about the form of the words he used, but the sense. De Selicourt's translation has me laughing aloud, much as I imagine the original readers would have, at the constant ineptitude and malice of the tribunes, always pushing for \\"agrarian reform\\" as a rallying-cry. Ancient historians did not set out to write just a history, but also a work of great literature: mere modern history was accounted unworthy of the pen, and was for the annals of the priests, to be recorded in lists of names, locations, and dates. Names, locations, and dates do not alone a history make: the ancients understood this. That's why ancient history, from Livy to Plutarch*** to Suetonius to Xenophon to Tacitus to Polybius, is uniformly excellent, and why modern history is uniformly bad in comparison. The best of modern history, the transitional and seminal Decline and Fall of Gibbon, is the closest one comes, but it is colored and ruined by a deep hatred of all things clerical, Catholic, and Christian, which absolutely permeates the work, and a subtext of love for the barbaric Mohammedans, whom he viewed as \\"rational\\" in comparison. At least he got his bias towards the degenerate Byzantine empire and its ossified Orthodox religion right.***Speaking of Plutarch, one has two choices: the modern and decent translations of Penguin in horrible editions, issued in half a dozen books with many lives overlapping (i.e. Alexander is in two books, Caesar in three) in a series that is still incomplete, with the lives presented out of order and Plutarch's comparisons either omitted entirely or presented after one of the lives mentioned, whereas the life being compared to is not even in the same volume, let alone back to back: or Modern Library's old translation from the 1600s (updated in the 1800s to remove the most archaic verbiage and most of the archaic pronouns) that reads poorly (even worse than Dickens, and I hate Dickens), as a stereotyped \\"classic\\", but is presented in two volumes in correct order with the comparisons, much as Plutarch intended. One needs both editions, so one can read the Penguin translations in the order given in Modern Library, and then read Modern Library's printing of Plutarch's comparisons of lives. (If one had to choose one or the other, the trade-off for readability in the Penguin is too great, compared to the poor presentation: one should choose the Modern Library.)That brings me to the best of the \\"truly modern\\" historians, Steven Runciman; his work is terrible compared to the ancients, and stellar compared to the rest of the moderns, who are more suited to writing technical specifications or books of law than anything else. Lest anyone think the moderns are more truthful or less biased, Runciman's obsessive fawning over that same decrepit Orthodox religion and overweening sympathy for the degenerate Byzantines (and even a hint of sympathy for those enemies of all civilization, the paynim foe, the Mohammedan, who had encroached on the lands of Christendom for four centuries and were slaughtering and enslaving pilgrims to the Holy Land to attempt to prop up their failing empire by trying to acquire new sources of dhimmis wherever they could be found) should dispel that notion - only sourcing has been improved. But even with bibliographies, one can choose and weight a work towards those extremely biased sources, such as Anna Komnena's report of the Crusade (which Runciman relies heavily upon). Warren Carroll is likely the best historian of our generation, with Jaroslav Pelikan close behind; but Jaroslav Pelikan, unlike Carroll and Toynbee, did not do \\"surveys of history\\", but focused on a very specific topic. Much as all of the professions, except for the noble philosophers and theologians (and even those, to a degree) have become so cripplingly overspecialized as to be facetious to non-specialists.Some philosophy (notably Aristotle) requires the translation to be stiff if one is to follow Aristotle's thought, and not the translator's interpretation of his philosophy (much like the Bible), which can never be trusted today. It reminds me of the old Bollingen Plato which I had to use when studying philosophy, before the much better Hackett editions and the new single-volume one were released, where all of the introductions gushed, \\"Plato was so smart - almost as smart as we (Hume, Locke, Kant, Hegel, Heidegger) are!\\" (blasphemy - Aristotle had more philosophical sense when he grunted to take a shite than Hume did in thirty years of writing ponderous tomes of trash).For other translations, \\"The Emperor's Handbook\\" is lousy, IMO. It's too loose. I cut my teeth on Staniforth's translation, which is archaic, overly flowery, and too loose at the same time. I think the Hammond translation is the second best (after Hays) out there.I also prefer Hays immensely because he leaves \\"logos\\" untranslated (instead of translating it as a range of words, improperly injecting interpretation in to the text, as no one option, such as \\"reason\\", works in all places in the Meditations), and, reading the book as a Catholic, I am often amazed at the insights towards Christ (the Logos) that are revealed in the jarring disconnect between the English translation and the transliteration of \\"logos\\" - I often think that Emperor Marcus Aurelius was writing about Christ; whether by accident of language, coincidence of Hellenistic philosophy, divine inspiration, or because the Christian ethos had already so permeated the Empire by the time of the writing of the Meditations, I know not. Nevertheless, Hays' translation can be used in places nearly as a Christian devotional instead of reading like Enlightenment garbage crossed with paleo-paganism and new ageism, as the Staniforth translation reads (always capitalizing \\"Reason\\", \\"the Whole [as in, 'return to \\"the Whole\\" at death']\\"). When reading Greek philosophy, \\"logos\\" is such a common word it loses its power and distinction as essentially the Incarnate Word, appearing constantly in contexts where Christ never would because of the nature of truth, being seen as in a mirror darkly - not so in the Meditations, this translation has shown, wherever \\"logos\\" is, one can insert \\"the Logos\\" and get an even greater sense of Aurelius' text - I am tempted to say a sensius plenor."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"I poorly chose to read this book straight through and feel I did not give it enough time to sink in. This is a compilation of more or less random musings by the emperor, and while there are themes that seem to surface, it can jump around a bit. Still, his tenets appeal both to logic and emotion, effectively placing themselves in your mind for review throughout the day.The introduction by Gregory Hays does a good job setting up the collection, explaining the format and picking out some of the main ideas.

He addressed the \\"Mediations\\"--which are written in Greek--to himself, and so the text has suffered at times due to careless composition; at times this causes his writings to appear awkward and grammatically flawed, though for the most part they are eloquent, poetic and full of wise sayings. To stress Aurelius deep knowledge of Greek philosophy, it most be noted that while he himself was committed the tenets of Stoic philosophy, his \\"Mediations\\" still contain elements of Platonism, and even Epicureanism as well.

Marcus never intended for his journals (which is what the Meditations are) to be published and was writing to himself. Why would someone writing to themselves write in a technical manner reminiscent of a modern philosophical treatise? Why? Because that was the style in which ancient philosophy was translated in the early 20th century.Marcus scolds those who obsess over rhetoric, grammar, syllogisms and logic crunching within the Meditations and for a very clear reason: he is concerned with a human message, primarily centered around ethics and pursuit of virtue, not any abstract theorizing common to the pretensions of imitation philosophy. It is absurd to assume Marcus would have wrote to himself in such a lofty, holier-than-thou, technical and abstract fashion (see: the \\"standard\\" George Long translation). It is more likely that Marcus would have been influenced by the language of Epictetus, and if the Discourses and Enchiridion as relayed by Arrian are any clue, the language of Stoicism at this time was quite accessible to the common reason.Hays offers a natural translation of the Meditations with immediacy, warmness, humanity and stunning beauty, truly bringing to life the eternal wisdom of the philosopher king. Marcus' words are presented in an almost poetic fashion which inspires the reader to greatness and contemplation in pondering the core themes of transience, goodness and service.The type of man Marcus was, and the type of virtue he advocated, is sorely missing in today's society. Prudence, temperance, fortitude and justice as character traits seem to be gone from the world and only found in the writings of dead Greeks and Romans. But in reading these texts the virtues are reborn, as is the \\"Greek lifestyle\\" of austerity, civic duty and integrity, at least in the mind and heart of the reader.The Meditations is all about how to endure the stresses of the world while coming out on top of them even stronger than before, and even more excellent. I found Marcus' words to be a godsend in times of hopelessness and longing as I discovered that the things which caused me grief were only temporary in nature, were outside of my control, or were irrelevant considering the immense scope of the cosmos (time) and our minute proportion of it."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Written nearly 2,000 years ago, Marcus Aurelius' \\"Meditations\\" seem to become increasingly popular in eras of obscene greed, such as the Gilded Age of the late 1800s and the one we are suffering through right now. It is at such times that thoughtful people reach out for rational guides to living.To some extent, the Meditations provide that kind of guidance, but the reader looking for a comprehensive plan for living well is likely to be disappointed. Instead of an organized body of thought. the \\"Meditations\\" are simply haphazard thoughts that Marcus wrote down over the years as aids in developing his personal ethics. This does not mean that they are useless, simply that they are disorganized and repetitive.To the Stoics, everything is part of the natural order, including cruelty, pain and death. The function of the individual within this world is to suffer with dignity, restraining anger and being tolerant of the acts of others, recognizing that anything they do is in their nature and the natural order of things. The Stoic philosophy is basically pessimistic - Life's a losing battle, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter because we only spend a brief time here, before being recycled by nature. The human body is no more that \\"rotting meat in a bag.\\" (8.38)A pessimistic view, certainly, yet taken as a whole, the Meditations provide useful information for dealing with life's unpleasantries, most of which involve living the simple life - being modest and grateful for the good things that one has enjoyed, treating others politely and fairly, being indifferent to superficial honors and indicia of status, and living life honorably, simply and well during our brief moment on the stage. And if things aren't going well? We'll be dead soon enough, and after that it won't matter.The foregoing sounds simplistic and depressing, yet the effect of the book is positive, perhaps because we all recognize that we are capable of being better people and Marcus gives us very specific advice on how to do it. A self-help book in the finest sense.Gregory Hays' translation is quite readable, although perhaps too modern for some readers. His introduction is excellent, proving a clear and comprehensive introduction to Marcus, Stoicism and their historical context.Readers who wish to pursue Stoicism further should consider:* Arrian's abridgement of Epictetus' \\"Encheiridion;\\"* Seneca's \\"Letters to Lucilius;\\" and* Cicero's \\"On the Good Life.\\""},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"I work in Human Services and see how clearly it is not the situations we are in that are the problem but our attitude towards those situations that is the problem.

Each is well worth reading in its own right. Together, they are a real treat.In the introduction, the author provides a high level but highly instructive overview of the life and times of Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome from A.D. 161 until his death in 180. From the brief biography of Marcus through the discussion of the philosophical traditions that informed the Emperor and, ultimately, the Meditations, to the summary of recurring themes, the Introduction is very worthwhile reading. The author conveniently includes some suggestions for further reading to allow any who are interested to plunge well below the surface that is only lightly touched here.The heart of the book, the Meditations themselves, is a superb and enduring testament to the community of humankind. Written nearly 2000 years ago, the Meditations, which Marcus never expected to be read by anyone other than himself and, perhaps, his son, reveal how consistently and deeply themes like death, integrity, ethics, and tolerance affect all people at all times. Perhaps the most notable reaction to reading this very accessible translation is that here, speaking across 20 centuries, is the basis for a successful career as a 21st Century &quot;self-help guru&quot;."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"In an age where so many of us tune into Oprah, Dr. Phil, and so many other feel good fountains of wisdom, its refreshing to revisit the men who laid the foundations for thought in modern time. Marcus Aurelius' statements sometimes come off as trite, obvious, or even dull; however, one must only remember that he was one of the first to put these notions down on paper to realize how important and interesting the work is. Extolling on the virtues of restraining one's emotions and sacrificing for the greater good, this long gone emperor still strikes home with his platitudes and musings.

However he also spends a lot of time thinking about man's right and priviledge of deciding if and when to end live voluntary.There is an excellent though somewhat long introduction to the book. Hays also provides a list of persons referred to in the book. This is very helpful to at least know who Aurelius was talking about.I only rate the book four stars because I found The Emperior's Handbook by David Hicks easier to read and understand.

He is considered the last of the five \\"good emperors,\\" and he ruled around the time of empire's greatest extent. However, even in his own time many cracks that were later to undermine the entire political and social structure of the empire were becoming visible. The Roman world was experiencing constant turmoil, from triumphant victories on the battlefield to internal strife and constant civil disturbances. Many citizens of the empire sought some semblance of stability and meaningfulness amidst all these uncertainties, resorting to various new religious movements or to philosophical schools of thought. One of these schools of philosophy - Stoicism - enjoyed a significant following with the Roman elite. Marcus Aurelius was probably the most prominent example of this trend, and comes closest to a Platonic ideal of philosopher-king.\\"Meditations\\" were written in Greek (the language of learning and education at the time) during several military campaigns between 170 AD and 180 AD. They were intended as personal reflections on various aspects of one's life, the values that one has espoused, and the way that these have played out in the real world situations. These are quintessentially personal musings that don't aim to establish or further the Stoic school of thought, even thought they are firmly based in this philosophical tradition. Nonetheless, it is this straightforward genuineness coupled with an easy and accessible style that has made \\"Meditations\\" into a classic. By reflecting on them we can appreciate the timelessness of some fundamental human concerns and gain a greater insight into the human condition that transcends even our own metaphysical outlooks. At the very least we realize that we have much more in common with the 2nd century Roman emperor than we had ever thought to be the case."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"I have two translations of this book--one by Andy Fiala, and the the other by Gregory Hays.

But I have to say that this translation is truly abysmal and riddled with intentional archaisms, I can never understand why translators used to want to do this with Greek & Latin texts. The Greek in which Marcus Aurelius wrote was not archaic in his time, so why are we making the translation archaic, and so formidably unreadable?To this, add the fact that the text features misused words, misspelled words, words that don't exist, missing words that should be there but aren't, and (what I surmise is) Greek characters that the printer did not recognize, with the result that some words come across as gibberish with Roman characters but not recognizable as either Greek or English.Maxwell Staniforth's dynamite translation of 1964 blows this one out of the water, and there are more recent translations still that I have not read all the way through, but which are much more reader-friendly.

If you want to satisfy your ego and read something with more flowers, get the George Long version or something else. If you want to understand what Aurelius means and don't care about the difficulty of a book as long as you get something out of it, I'd recommend this because it's probably more accurate in terms of tone and formality, and like another reviewer said before me, it's reads as though Aurelius were right over your shoulder giving you advice.While some of his theories lack sound proof, he never wrote this for anyone else to read, so he has no reason to go out of his way to prove something to himself. It's up to the reader to find the proof, or refute what he says. It's a very interesting, easily understandable read that comes of as some sort of ancient self-help book. It's advice for living a decent life in a complicated and confusing society, with a limit on your existence in this world.

Marcus Aurelius wrote this for his own usage - it was never intended for publication, much less being seen by others. It was something he was writing in uncertain times, and it's an intimate view of a man searching for peace and self-mastery.This grace and immediacy did not come across well in previous, more formal-sounding translations which seemed to imply that Marcus Aurelius was handing down maxims to a large crowd. Hays' new translation lets us get closer to the author, and also gain a deeper understanding of how badly Marcus needed this for his own sanity, and in turn, how much modern life needs his thoughts on being a decent person in an indecent world.I heard about a subway mugging (apologies - I can't remember where I read this, but it was within the past 3 years) in which a young man intervened, injuring himself in the process and becoming hospitalized. When asked why he inserted himself into a situation which he could have easily avoided, he quoted from this book. Just go and read this.

I was intrigued. After reading Meditations, I was even more intrigued, and started buying copies for my friends. I have read Nietzche, Plato, Sartre. But this book tells it like it IS.

Of few things I am quite certain; this is one.I have read a number of versions of this book, and to date, this is the best translation in my opinion. Gregory Hays does a fantastic job and deserves kudos for this translation. The writings are clear, almost as if Marcus was talking directly to you. In some translations you have to read the passages several times before the meaning is as clear as I find it in this translation. Marcus had a profound understanding of human behavior, and this is quite evident from his passages. Reading this is a soothing balm for the soul like nothing else I can think of. I have a version I keep on my bookshelf and one I carry around with me because it gets beaten up.What a remarkable person Marcus must have been, made moreso in my estimation by the fact that he was a ruler. He had everything at his disposal, including wealth, and yet he saw through all of it to what was truly important in life. And the fact that The Meditations was never even written to be turned into a book makes it all the more impressive and meaningful. Who among us has such insightful random thoughts on such a consistent basis?When you have a headache, take an aspirin; when you want to understand our place in the universe a little better, pick up The Meditations to read."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Can't complain about the content of Meditations, but the number of typos was disappointing and annoying for a text like this."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"I've read this book in school in the past and this translation doesn't do this book justice.

While at times a bit challenging to get through, the most impressive quality of the work is its classic endurance.

Overall, an impressive intellectual piece and a good edition to any well-stocked private library."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"There are several things that make this book so special. It is written by a Roman Emperor and is a book of introspective philosophy rather than a publication of his public acts or justifications for his career. Although it was written in the Christian era, it is clearly a non-Christian work and that makes it very interesting as well. One of the problems we have understanding such a work is that our culture, though largely post-Christian nowadays, is rooted in and permeated by Christian concepts and institutions. Be careful as you read this book to not let your present-day mindset fool you into thinking you understand what this mind from a different world of almost 2,000 years ago wrote.The book is arranged in chapters - what we would call paragraphs. And books - that we would call chapters. They were written at different times and not meant to be a coherent statement of the author's beliefs. Often, they seem to be advice to himself.About one-half of this book is notes to help the reader understand what Marcus Aurelius wrote. This is quite necessary, because it is so easy to get off on the wrong track by misreading what is actually being said in this austere and often quite strange book.Yet, it has a nice payoff in helping the reader see the world a bit differently and to bring that portion of the history of the Roman Empire to life."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Marcus Aurelius, the emperor-philosopher, ruled the immense Roman Empire from 161 untill 180. He is the last representative of the Stoa. In this book, also known by the name \\"Diaries of M.A.\\", written between 170 and 180 in his army camp, he reflects about his ideals and his doubts. In his meditations one can (constantly) very well distinguish the ideas of a living human being, a man ... ruled by the universe of the divine providence, where all men live as fellow citizens of the gods. With far more warmth than one may expect from a stoic, Marcus Aurelius emphasizes the social \\"duties\\" and the feelings of solidarity that originate of them.Another ever-recurring motive is the personal liberty, freedom of the individual. This is quite normal because ALL DEPENDS on our judgments (in the sense of 'impression') of the circumstances. Very often WE SUFFER FAR MORE OF OUR JUDGMENT of something or of a situation that we consider \\"terrible\\", THAN OF THE SUBJECT ITSELF !! For example a poor constitution (of the body) and other adversities cannot/could NOT HAVE influence our own inner compass...Top of the shelf literature, STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to ALL OF YOU!!"},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"This edition of Marcus Aurelius' 'Meditations' is an excellent rendition of what may be the most profound book of insight meditation ever written. It is an updating of George Long's venerable 1862 translation, with long sentences untangled and thee's and thou's modernized to you's . At first I found it a little dry and underemphatic, but as I continued reading, I became thoroughly engaged by its clarity and precision. As a literal reading, the Dover edition is a lot more readable than Loeb's Haines translation, and more direct than Staniforth's Penguin edition. And at this price, you almost can't afford not to have it.

Consternation - did the Greek original actually have words like that? It was a 'modern' translation - 'modern' as in 'dumbing down'.So I went looking for another translation, only 40 years old, but more faithful to the original, as in 'think of your many years of procrastination' rather than 'if you keep putting things off'. I don't view it as 'colloquial', I view it as patronising.I'm sorry, but if you can't handle good English, and need the 'dumber' versions, then you're probably too dumb to appreciate the finer points of the work in the first place. Both versions were the same price, so that didn't influence my decision.One reviewer mentioned it was translated from the Greek, and another reviewer corrected them as he was a Roman. If the second person had actually read the book correctly, he would have discovered that this book was written in Greek - thus another mark of the man.Then you can sit back and invest your time in truly enjoying the thoughts & the musings of this interesting man."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"This is not the best translation. The Walter J. Black,Inc. 1944 Classic Club Edition is better, but either way it is just Marcus Aurelius trying to remind himself (over and over again) of the basic stoic theory that as long as we know what pertains to us and what doesn't and avoid gettting emotional about what doesn't pertain to us, all will be fine and tranquil within our souls. It reads like the book of Proverbs, jumping from topic to topic without much organization and with lots of repetition of the same basic themes with a few word changes. Many times, I felt like I was reading a remake of Epictetus Discourses, only not as well written by any stretch of the imagination. Not much of anything new or original, just a follower of a philosophy better stated by Epictetus (or should I say his student admirer, Arrian, who wrote the Discourses from first hand lectures he had heard.)"},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Marcus Aurelius is truly the pioneer in writing the first How-To book in history.

I picked up 1966 translation by Maxwell Staniforth because it was compact enough to fit in my inside jacket pocket. The introduction was more clear and descriptive of Stoicism, than the entire class I took at university. I've even heard from a psychiatrist that Marcus was a \\"grandiose manic\\". I have read 'Meditations' many times, but this time was special. Staniforth even links tenants of Stoics to Early Christianity.Marcus writes \\"To Himself\\"; \\"Accept without resentment whatever may befall.\\" Marcus was on the front, with the Roman Army trying to stop the incursion of tribes of barbarians, in the Roman Empire, there were plagues, floods, famines, plots, Christians, --overwhelming demands. And I get perturbed because there's no cream for morning coffee! But he continues to say that life events are 'neither good nor bad', but describes them as 'indifferent'. I personally would be delighted to see events this way! Impartial, Objective, with equanimity.Staniforth's translation of \\"Meditations\\" (\\"To Himself\\") was a Royal treatment of the words of a Cosmic Messenger.

This is more a book that requires you to spend the time with, read slowly and think about what is being said. I was surprised at how short the book actually turned out to be, with almost half of the book dedicated to analysis.This book is one of those that you put on your shelf and refer back to again and again. Doing so will ensure that you get the most from it. The ideas in the book are not earth shattering they are all simply good common sense but sometimes it is actually beneficial to have these presented to you in another form.A good book but one that cannot certainly be casually. It is however a book that can be read over and over and each time something new can be gleaned from its pages."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"I don't know if I just got a bad copy, but the editing and printing errors were so numerous that it was difficult to read the text. It was evident that the book was never proofread. I'll include the worst example I saw:pg. 77 - \\"What is rv&nfLovia;, or happiness: but a7~o~&d;~wv, or, a good da~rnon, or spirit?\\"Now, this example was the worst I saw, but I didn't get through much of the book because the errors distracted me too much, so there could be others as bad as this. The bulk of the errors were spelling, punctuation, and paragraphing errors that made the text harder to follow than it should be.That being said, I believe \\"Meditations\\" by Marcus Aurelius is a very worthwhile book to read and study, but I would discourage anyone from buying this printing of the book - find another version somewhere that has been proofread."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"\\"Everywhere, at each moment, you have the option:* to accept this event with humility* to treat this person as he should be treated* to approach this thought with care, so that nothing irrational creeps in\\"With these words, Marcus Aurelius succinctly captures the philosophy he shaped his worldview around. Practical philosophy such as this often gets tagged with the phrase \\"common sense\\" but to me this does a great injustice to both the underlying philosophy and to the clearly intense struggle to live life by such a code. The ideals that Marcus articulates are perhaps commonly understood, but rarely translated into practice because human nature tends toward the opposite response: to act selfishly, to taint our judgment with thoughts of \\"what if?\\" and \\"why me?\\", and to rail against that or those we believe have caused us insult or harm. To live as a Stoic--to accept external events as outside of our control, to treat others with justice and fairness and work toward the common good, and to be able to separate objective fact from subjective evaluation--is incredibly difficult. The fact that Marcus felt the need to write these notes down and often repeat the same themes over and over again to himself gives proof to their difficulty.Marcus can seem a bit cold and a bit pessimistic at times, but I don't think this need be the case. It is actually a rather liberating message, both specific and demanding of its adherents. Want true happiness? Be unselfish in your actions. Don't deny your emotions or speculations, but do keep them distinct from objective fact. The things that are done and said to you are only \\"bad\\" if you let them be. Improve what you can control, accept what you can't. If you need help putting things in perspective, Marcus reminds us that all is transient: this too shall pass. More sobering than uplifting, the message is different than your typical modern \\"self-help\\" book. Yet, it is these differences and the insights they produce that make it a stimulating and rewarding read, especially in these turbulent days at the beginning of the 21st century. Due to its excellent introduction and general ease of reading, I particularly enjoyed this Hays translation but encourage potential readers to compare several versions to see which fits their needs best."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Generally speaking, I really dislike \\"new translations\\" for the very reasons that those 3-star ratings below cite--they are usually watered down, do not actually convey what the author really meant to convey, and often treat the reader as an idiot without a shot at getting his GED. In fact, if my study of ancient languages were better, I might go with what they suggest. However, this translation does clear up several impenetrable idioms that the usual reader would find frustrating. And the original does stand up against this treatment. It's amazing. Another item I usually skip--the introductory essay aimed at keeping some professor both in print and in a job--was surprisingly useful. A great little edition full of some often very powerful principles. Very pleased with this inexpensive translation full of useful notes.

Marcus Aurelius was a well liked emperor you lived from 120 A.D. to 180 A.D. ruling in the late part of his life. The book's theme is to live your life in balance with the universe. Do your duty and fulfill the role the \\"Gods\\" put you on earth to do. Let reason be your master always doing what is beneficial to all. Do not sin because you only sin against yourself. Why worry about correcting others behaviors when you have so much uncompleted work to do on yourself. If you enjoy reading Plato, Epictetus, or philosophy in general I know you will enjoy reading this book, it is truly packed with wisdom and will take you back to Roman times and let you see how the wise among them thought before the dark ages and modern religion came on the stage of civilization.

Indeed, it seems ridiculous to us now, when kissing our mother or spouse so say to ourselves \\"I am only kissing a human being\\", so if those people die, we will not be attached to them, and therefore feel no loss. This is what Epictetus, the man through whose Discourses Marcus Aurelius learned the principles of Stoicism, advised one to do in his Handbook.That being said, I feel that there are few works that have ever been more rewarding for me to read. The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius are amazing on two levels. The first is that of a philosophical doctrine, the level on which it is usually considered. The Meditations can be seen as sort of a run-on of the Epictetian brand of Stoicism, which is different in many aspects from early Greek Stoicism. If one (for the most part) likes what Epictetus has to say in the Handbook, but doesn't really feel like sitting through the Discourses, Marcus Aurelius is a nice alternative.The second level is that of a personal struggle. Most people don't admit it, but the reason that Marcus Aurelius stays with the reader more than Epictetus does is because in Marcus Aurelius the reader sees a man with an enormous amount of power in his hands wrestling with himself, trying not only to do his job correctly, but live correctly as well.The Meditations are very intimate, and could be considered a sort of philosophical diary, but for some reason, they never really get this treatment from readers.I would recommend this not only to students of philosophy, but to students of Roman history and political science as well. How many times in history do we have a written account of what it takes to be a good emperor? Most of all, however, I would recommend this to anyone struggling to find inner peace, not that I'm suggesting that it should be taken in a dogmatic manner, but at the very least, a troubled mind will find a companion in Marcus Aurelius.As for the translation, I have not seen another that even comes close. This book is worth every cent of the price and much much more."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"I'm awestruck - just got this today. To think it was written over 1800 years ago! Aurelius combines strict adherence to doing the right thing with a wild and dark sense of humor.

It gave me the sense that the ordeals I face have been faced in similar ways for a long, long time. Circumstances have changed since the late Roman empire, and circumstances will doubtlessly change during the course of my life. Aurelius teaches me in the most direct terms how I can keep focus.Here's an Aurelius quote that got me laughing:\\"The way people behave. They refuse to admire their contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by Posterity - people they've never met and never will - that's what they set their hearts on. You might as well be upset by not being a hero to your great-grandfather.\\"One Amazon reviewer did a wonderful job including some other quotes from the work.

The translation in the Penguin edition always suffered from a kind of stiff literalism. It was as if the translator wanted to make the Meditations a more formal work than it is.Gregory Hays, in his translation of the work, pitches the idea that the Meditations was never meant for publishing, and as such, varies in formal style and quality. He tries to capture this in English, by switching from somewhat stiff, philosophical language in some parts, to a more conversational tone in others. He wants us to see the Meditations for what he believes it is: a kind of self-help book the Marcus Aurelius' wrote for himself; a reminder of what his goals were and how to achieve them.This makes Hays' Meditations a much easier read than its predecessor; he gives Marcus' voice a freshness and immediacy that is missing in other translation. Most importantly, he give new life to the voice of a Roman emperor who lived nearly two-thousand years ago."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Thirty years ago i read this little book, and even memorized some of the meditations.

Other titles assigned to the same book are: 'Personal Notes', 'Thougts', 'The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' et al. It is one of the few complete works of a late Stoic philosopher that still exists today. He wrote his 'Meditations' as personal notes for himself. He writes about solidarity, physical adversity, good and evil, inner freedom and more. 'Meditations' of Marcus Aurelius is a book full of wisdom that brings comfort and contemplation; it is moving and inspiring. I highly recommend it.The 'Meditations' of Marcus Aurelius are grouped in 12 'books' (chapters). The first book is clearly different from the other eleven; it is a 'thank you' to people who have had a good influence on him. For example: 'From my grandfather Verus (I learned) good morals and the government of my temper.' (I.1). The other eleven books contain his notes. His Stoic philosophy emphasizes ethics, especially everyday problems. This book is in the public domain and can be downloaded for free from several websites.This edition has an active table of 'Paragraphs with First Lines', so you can 'click' on a first line and you are directly taken to that part of the book. This books begins with an introduction (location 424-621) giving some background and insight in the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius, at the end there are an appendix (loc. 5603-5908) with correspondence of Marcus Aurelius and a glossary of proper names and obsolete or obscure words (loc. 5908-5983). There are several editions of the 'Meditations' or 'Thoughts' of Marcus Aurelius available for free on the web. The advantage of this edition in relation to the others is this edition's active table of first lines which none of the other editions have.Some quotations from this book:Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. (II.11)Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquillity which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others. (III.5)Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: accordingly say and do everything in conformity with the soundest reason.

The arguments he gives for us to be at peace despite the continual thriving of evil around us center around its chaos and our own inability to change anything. Such a view is profoundly unsatisfying, and leaves us in perplexity over the purpose of it all, anchorless and hopeless. Whereas Aurelius says &quot;The world is chaotic, but you're powerless so be a man and do right&quot;, Solomon says &quot;The world is chaotic because man is inwardly evil, but take heart because it's all part of God's righteous and sovereign plan and part of that plan is our salvation.&quot; Life against God is meaningless, no matter how many nice things you do; life under His loving care is meaningful, because we have a sure hope of redemption and life to come."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"The book was in mint condition.

Rather than reading like a story, these are aphorisms, which are more or less grouped into similar subject matter, but if you want to get the most out of it, you should aim for reading, at most, a couple at a time to really reflect on what Aurelius is saying.An example would be number 15 from Book VII, \\"Whatever any one does or says, I must be good, just as if the emerald (or the gold or the purple) were always saying \\"Whatever any one does or says, I must be emerald and keep my color.\\" This is a very profound and pithy saying. To get the full effect, think about what this is saying and how it applies to us and our doings. Reading many of these in a row would just blur them together.I would recommend this as a reference for helping to reflect on our lives."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"This is my favorite translation of the meditations, an opinion further solidified yesterday when I went to the book store to get a last-minute graduation gift for a young man, and all they had was &quot;The Emperor's Handbook&quot; by the Hicks brothers. It was good, but I think it lacked the manliness and concise clarity of the Hays translation. I have not read the original Greek, (trying to learn some now!), so I'm no authority, but I imagine this is how a man like Marcus Aurelius might write to himself in this circumstance.As for the greatness of the original work itself, all I can add to the other fine reviews here are two quotes I have always loved from Clifton Fadiman's &quot;The Lifetime Reading Plan&quot;:&quot;. . . during the last ten years of his life, by the light of a campfire, resting by the remote Danube after a wearisome day of marching or battle, he set down in Greek his Meditations, addressed only to himself but by good fortune now the property of us all,&quot; and, &quot;Through the years The Golden Book of Marcus Aurelius, as it has been called, has been read by vast numbers of men and women. They have thought of it not as a classic but as a well spring of consolation and inspiration. It is one of the few books that seem to have helped men directly and immediately to live better, to bear with greater dignity and fortitude the burden of being merely human. Aristotle one studies. Marcus Aurelius men take to their hearts.&quot;"},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"As you read the words of Marcus Aurelius, Emperor of Rome, you'll find advice and help that is as helpful now, in the 21st century as it was in his lifetime.I am a voracious reader of self-help books, and I see a lot of the essence of them summed up in Aurelius' MEDITATIONS.Aurelius is a Stoic, which is not to be confused with an unfeeling view of life. He is concerned with living a life of integrity and adopting principles of self discipline, especially in the face of impulse and action. His goal was to be just, self-disciplined, courageous and independent, and to live in the present.The book is divided into sections and the paragraphs are numbered. The style of writing is easy to understand, but it isn't &quot;fast&quot; reading -- sometimes it's possible to read two or three sentences and think deeply.It's a good book to carry with you and read in odd moments -- or when you have a lot of time to read. It will make you think and contemplate."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"The style is direct and unpretentious. The message is simple but extraordinarily powerful: life is short, the past and the future are inaccessible, pain and pleasure have no meaning, but inside each one of us there is a ruling faculty that is touched only by itself. Only that which makes us better capable of confronting our condition with resolution and courage can be said to be good, and only that which makes us worse and more unsatisfied can be said to be bad. The only thing that is of any importance is our own private quest for perfection, which no external power can ever destroy. Marcus Aurelius delivers many insightful and inspirational observations about human nature and the human condition, and he makes an excellent rational argument for seeking the good and for acting modestly and continently. I cannot think or a more satifying and moving work, and it is all the more poignant because it was written by a man who wielded almost absolute power and lived surrounded by the luxury, yet managed to keep things in perspective and to occupy himself only with what truly matters. One sentence captures perfectly the spirit of his writings: &quot;Where a man can live, there he can also live well.&quot; An extraordinary testimony of wisdom and fortitude."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"(Just to be clear, the Meditations is a five-star book. My two-star rating applies only to this Kindle edition.)Marcus Aurelius, emperor of Rome, may be the closest mankind has ever come to producing the philosopher king that Plato envisioned in The Republic. A reluctant ruler and a reluctant warrior, much of his reign was spent in battle, defending the frontiers of the empire from the \\"barbarian\\" hordes. Fortunately for us, he carried a notebook along on his military campaigns, and thus we have the Meditations. Marcus's writings reveal him to be the last and greatest of the classical Stoics. Stoicism is a school of thought that asserts we have no control over our lives, only control over our perceptions. It advocates that the best life is the life that is lived in accordance with nature (not \\"nature\\" as in grass and trees, but \\"nature\\" as in the order of the universe). By concentrating one's thoughts and choices on what is good and virtuous, and disregarding the unimportant distractions of everyday life (even life and death are said to be neither good nor bad, but \\"indifferent\\"), we can avoid negative emotions like fear, anger, grief, and frustration, and live a life of happiness and tranquility. That's an oversimplification, of course. If you really want to know what Stoicism is and how it works read Epictetus or Seneca. What Marcus provides us with are the reflections of a man who studied and lived the Stoic life, and was its ultimate exemplar. Even if you don't buy into Stoicism, or have no interest in Philosophy with a capital P, you can still find inspiration and solace in the Meditations, as Marcus instructs us in dealing justly with others, overcoming emotional hardship, living life to the fullest by overcoming the fear of death, and resigning oneself to the insignificance of man in the universe.The Meditations are divided into twelve books. Each book contains anywhere from 16 to 75 numbered paragraphs, ranging in length from a sentence to a page. The paragraphs are arranged without regard to sequence or subject matter. This haphazard method of compilation is really the book's only flaw. What the Meditations has always needed is a good index, but I've never found a volume that has one.The Kindle edition that's offered for free on Amazon, which is the same as the one downloadable from Project Gutenberg, contains one major flaw. There is an interactive table of contents which allows you to click on the twelve books; that's fine. Following that, however, there is another clickable table of contents that lists the first line of every paragraph in the Meditations. That's a wonderful idea, in theory, but in practice it's a major pain. This extended table of contents is written as one long page of links, so it takes forever to load. You spend minutes staring at a blank screen waiting for the type to show up, then minutes more until you can actually move your cursor. Sometimes the screen saver kicks in before you even get to that point. I wish someone would go into the file and break that table up into twelve separate pages so it might actually be useful. In this edition there are no notes to the text, other than a few translator's notes. Unless you know a heck of a lot about ancient Rome and Stoicism, notes are pretty necessary for a book like this. There's a small glossary of proper names, and an appendix of correspondence between Marcus and his teacher Fronto. I like having a portable copy of the Meditations on my Kindle, but this is one case where the e-book is no substitute for a paper edition."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"When it comes to Stoic philosophy, Marcus Aurelius is second to Epictetus in the discussion of avoiding the indulgence of emotion. However, Aurelius' \\"Meditations\\" is different simply because it's the first leadership memoir based on Stoic philosophy.The book is raw - it seems that these were never going to be published, so it had a bluntness to it and an honesty rare for a military leader, let alone one of the best Roman Emperors in history. He was a spiritual man, and tried to rationalize his duties. It lacks rhetorical flourish but it's honest.I don't know if the book stands alone as a philosophical work, but it is an interesting work about self improvement, duty and service. Despite his reputation as a \\"philosopher king,\\" the book remains a valuable book in leadership and history.The Kindle version itself is pretty well laid out with ample enough notes and historical background on Aurelius himself to help you better understand the man himself. His notes range in length from a few sentences to multiple pages, so there's no real orderly format to the book (to me, this makes it more appealing.)Since the Kindle version is free, give it a try. You'll find yourself better for it."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"I love history, philosophy, and religion. This book covered all three subjects and kept my interest. It is not often that you get a philosopher emperor to write down his thoughts, but this is what happened here. You have a man who by all accounts was a great leader and a good man and we get to see what was important to him and what his underlying assumptions were about life.His values are quite universal. For example, he values self-mastery, and doesn't like complainers. As an engineer, I enjoyed hearing about how he thought things worked. Many are out of date, but several are what we would consider accurate.I got a better feel for Stoicism from his discussions and it helped me understand how the Romans thought prior to adopting Christianity. He did make a disparaging comment about the Christians; he thought they were fanatics that didn't work well with others. I noticed from history that he was involved in their persecution in Gaul.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in philosophy. It got me thinking and sparked more interest in Marcus Aurelius."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"It was interesting to see that one reviewer went looking for a copy of the Modern Library edition of \\"Meditations\\" as a gift, and had to settle for a different translation.There was a time when many publishers had in print their own editions -- usually \\"gift editions,\\" in a range of prices -- of the little book, \\"To Himself,\\" by the second-century Roman patrician Marcus Annius Catilius Severus (121-180 C.E.), known after his marriage as Marcus Annius Verus -- almost always titled something like \\"The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,\\" and most commonly some version (little choice disguised as many choices) of George Long's 1862 translation of the Greek original, originally published as \\"The Thoughts of the Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus.\\"For Marcus, besides receiving an excellent education in Greek, which he seems to have used as naturally as Latin, went on, through a process of adoption and co-optation, to rule the Roman Empire, beginning in 161 with the death of Antoninus Pius, his uncle, who had adopted him as heir, using a third version of his name. For moderns, he is usually just Marcus Aurelius; I found it a bit of shock to see him as just another \\"Antoninus\\" in ancient texts.Under any name, he has been popular, at least with publishers; even now, there seem to be something like sixty versions in English of this book available on Amazon, even though many *are* out of print (and most seem to be of the same few older translations). As usual, a number of these editions and translations are grouped by Amazon for review purposes, and I will mention some. If you find this, or someone else's, review of one translation under a different heading, PLEASE remember that, as Marcus Aurelius saw, some things really are beyond our control.It should require more thought to understand Marcus than it does to follow the English version. The Modern Library's current offering, a new translation by George Hays, is based on modern text editions, and seems to be both an excellent first introduction to the book, and graceful reading for those with no interest in looking further. It has brief but helpful notes, and a glossary of names, which helps keep the notes short and to the point. Some will follow his references to more advanced treatments, including textual as well as philosophical problems.As for Marcus Aurelius, he is generally regarded as one of the greatest, and certainly the most morally and intellectually impressive, of all Roman Emperors. Gibbon tended to see the Empire's real decline as subsequent to his death, a view not without its reflection in the recent motion picture \\"Gladiator.\\" The transitions by appointment from Trajan to Hadrian to Antoninus Pius to Marcus produced one of the most successful set of reigns in history (if mainly from a strictly Roman and Imperial point of view). It is perhaps the best historically-documented counterpart of the Chinese tradition of the Sage Emperors who chose as heirs the Most Virtuous (or Most Effective) subjects, instead of favored sons.The policy had precedents in Roman history, although none so successful for so long. Family loyalty was admired, and inheritance gave access to key property, including the slaves in the bureaucracy, and the loyalty of followers (veteran soldiers, freedmen and other clients); yet the whole dynastic principle was suspect as un-Roman. It was in part accidental, Antoninus, for example, himself almost a last-minute substitute, having no son to be his heir. Marcus Aurelius designated his son Commodus as successor, with less fortunate consequences, after the death of his first choice; although Commodus' evil reputation may reflect his political and military failures, and the interests of his successors, as much as his personality.So one might expect from the great Emperor Marcus Aurelius some manifesto on statesmanship, or imperial strategy, or at least good government. In fact, his twelve books (booklets, really) of little notes \\"to himself\\" contain reflections on fate, on moral lessons from classical literature, on religion, on human nature. They are probably the last thing one would expect of a Supreme Autocrat and Generalissimo.Nor are they an exposition of a philosophic system; no surprise that some reviewers, apparently expecting one, have found them unsatisfying.The first three books have titles (some are subscripts in the manuscript tradition, but, like Hays, I think they are misplaced). \\"On the River Gran, Among the Quadi,\\" refers to a campaign on the borders of the empire. If it is the heading of Book Two, the lack of any explicit reference therein to the hard-fought German campaign is worth pondering. Was this what the Emperor considered truly important? What he wanted us to think he thought was important? (But there is internal evidence that he had no intention of making any of it public.) What he preferred to think about when he could get away from the war for a few moments? It should be remembered that he was a successful campaigner.Hays' clear translation into modern English joins a number of post-Long translations. Older versions include the important version with commentary of A.S.L. Farquharson (Oxford, 1944, out of print; his translation with new introduction, etc., World's Classics, 1990, and Oxford World's Classics, 1998), and two competitors for the student and general reader markets, respectively, by G.M.A. Grube (originally Library of Liberal Arts, Bobbs-Merrill, 1963) and Maxwell Staniforth (Penguin Classics, 1964), which have been in and out of print (but mostly in) for four decades. Of these, I much prefer Hays -- although the additional material in the World's Classics edition(s) is worth a look. (Staniforth, by the way, says that \\"a couple of generations ago\\" major publishers had \\"elegant miniature\\" editions of classics, usually including the \\"Meditations\\" -- those I remember from the 1960s themselves were full-sized, and distinguished only by gilt edges and/or slipcovers and/or presentation pages.)It also joins the highly-praised contemporary version, \\"The Emperor's Handbook: A New Translation of The Meditations,\\" translated by David Hicks and C. Scott Hicks (2002; not seen).It competes as well with a fairly recent (1993) Dover Thrift Edition of the George Long translation, revised (and not for the first time) to modernize his mid-Victorian English and untangle his somewhat convoluted fidelity to (a long-obsolete edition of) the Greek. That Long was not very readable was probably not of much concern to those who used to buy and give (and possibly receive) editions designed to suggest educated tastes; certainly not to the sellers. Long's concern for accuracy should be emulated, but turning relatively clear Greek into opaque English doesn't seem the best way to achieve the goal. (In all fairness, what was plain enough language in mid-Victorian England / Civil War America may now seem obscure for other reasons.)The novelist Mary Renault thought that Marcus' example refuted Lord Acton's view that \\"absolute power corrupts absolutely,\\" but the most remarkable lesson of the \\"Meditations\\" is that Marcus Aurelius did not believe that he HAD absolute power. He had been chosen and groomed for a role he had been taught to accept as a duty, and regarded it as both an obligation and an imposition. For Marcus was a Stoic -- not in the commonplace sense of someone who repressed his feelings or endured pain without expression, but in the original sense of a follower of philosophy that offered a quasi-religious approach to life. Hays usefully points out (with helpful bibliography) that Marcus was, in the manner of his time, eclectic, but grants that, if asked, he would have identified himself with Stocism.The movement was founded by Zeno of Citium (or Kition), born on Cyprus (about 336 B.C.E.) in a family said to be part Phoenician, who taught in the Stoa Poikile, or \\"Painted Walkway,\\" in Athens, from some point after 313 to his death about 261 B.C.E. It was one of the key movements of Hellenistic times, and found a ready reception among upper class Romans as well. Teaching calm in the face of stress, and endorsing acceptance of public obligations, including religion, it is traditionally paired with, and contrasted to, Epicureanism, which taught avoidance of excessive pain and pleasure, withdrawal into private life, and the pointlessness of traditional religion. (Not hedonism, as popularly imagined; nor did it deny the existence of gods, only that they had any interest in anything so trivial and base as human concerns.)For those who find the \\"Meditations\\" intriguing but unsatisfying, works by other Stoics may be more fulfilling; there are some excellent recent volumes translating and interpreting Marcus' older contemporary, Epictetus, a slave who set an example to the rulers of the western world -- but that would be another review."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Here is a great book of meditations for both believers and atheists. Marcus Aurelius was emperor of Rome with an unfaithful wife, a worthless son, and the duties of leading an army for 13 years in what is now Germany. Trying to cheer and console himself in the middle of a desolate area, he wrote down what he remembered of the Stoic philosophy which he had studied. His thoughts are inspiring and provoking. This is the book you want with you when life becomes tough. As Marcus' view of god is a pantheistic one, anyone can profit from his thoughts, whether atheist or believer. A book to read ever few years. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"The Meditations are terse statements, aphorisms, notes, even reminders. Some are like fragmented dialogues, which I find fascinated. Some are very hard to get a hold of. Others remarkably clear. Summarizing them is hard, and surely misleading, but they seem frequently to stand against illusions and mistaken judgments, especially in the face of frustration, desire, fear, and anger. The positive dimension of this is harder to describe (maybe because I have yet to know it firsthand): calmness, purpose, self-control, and a true reckoning of what will matter in the end, as understood in terms of the harmony and essential order of all things. He can be difficult in places, but at other times it is as though he sees into your soul.I think Marcus Aurelius will strike readers very differently based on where they are coming from. Some readers will resonate with his insistence on self-awareness, equanimity, and responsibility for one's own mental state and reactions. Other readers will be attracted by his ethical standards, commitment to the common good, and sense of divine harmony in all events. Others will simply enjoy his sobering reflection and insightful commentary on human nature. Historians will be fascinated with a look into the mind of a Roman emperor, seemingly untouched by the affairs of state (they are hardly mentioned in the text). Philosophers will enjoy learning about Stoic thought in praxis and how he's picked up the thought of other Greek thinkers (Epictetus, Chrysippus, Heraclitus, etc). Perhaps one of the most amazing things is how he might appeal equally to readers from very different backgrounds, a testament to the complexity of his thinking.This particular edition comes with a very good introduction that answers questions of history, religion, philosophy, and thematic ideas. I highly recommend it to those interested in Marcus Aurelius and his philosophical thought. In addition, Gregory Hays is a masterful translator who, I think, has taken care to convey the meaning of the original Greek in appropriate English counterparts.The first chapter is a beautiful one that describes Marcus Aurelius' gratitude to the many people that have positively influenced him, in each case telling what it is that he gained from them. Might we do the same someday ourselves? Though it is highly selective for me to do so (leaving out big chunks of what the book is like, especially the more obviously Stoic in form and content--such as the fleeting transience of life), below are just a few of my favorite quotes.&quot;The best revenge is not to be like that.&quot;&quot;You can hold your breath until you turn blue, but they'll still go on doing it.&quot;&quot;It was for the best. So nature had no choice but to do it.&quot;&quot;Forget the future. When and if it comes, you'll have the same resources to draw on--the same Logos.&quot;&quot;Remember that our efforts are subject to circumstances; you weren't aiming to do the impossible. --aiming to do what then? --To try. And you succeeded. What you set out to do is accomplished.&quot;&quot;Think of yourself as dead. You've lived your life. Now take what's left and live it properly.&quot;&quot;...people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own--not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him...&quot;"},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"This is not the excellent Modern Library edition translated and with a detailed Introduction by Gregory Hays.

He is considered the last of the five \\"good emperors,\\" and he ruled around the time of empire's greatest extent. However, even in his own time many cracks that were later to undermine the entire political and social structure of the empire were becoming visible. The Roman world was experiencing constant turmoil, from triumphant victories on the battlefield to internal strife and constant civil disturbances. Many citizens of the empire sought some semblance of stability and meaningfulness amidst all these uncertainties, resorting to various new religious movements or to philosophical schools of thought. One of these schools of philosophy - Stoicism - enjoyed a significant following with the Roman elite. Marcus Aurelius was probably the most prominent example of this trend, and comes closest to a Platonic ideal of philosopher-king.\\"Meditations\\" were written in Greek (the language of learning and education at the time) during several military campaigns between 170 AD and 180 AD. They were intended as personal reflections on various aspects of one's life, the values that one has espoused, and the way that these have played out in the real world situations. These are quintessentially personal musings that don't aim to establish or further the Stoic school of thought, even thought they are firmly based in this philosophical tradition. Nonetheless, it is this straightforward genuineness coupled with an easy and accessible style that has made \\"Meditations\\" into a classic. By reflecting on them we can appreciate the timelessness of some fundamental human concerns and gain a greater insight into the human condition that transcends even our own metaphysical outlooks. At the very least we realize that we have much more in common with the 2nd century Roman emperor than we had ever thought to be the case."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"This is NOT the Hays 2002 translation and edition.

Unlike the sickly and often gloomy modern counterparts referenced, however, Marcus Aurelius was a general of Rome, and thus his attitude towards the nothingness he recognizes is not defeatist but upright, not rebellious but dignified, not scathing but almost tender, not condescending but humble. The meditations of Marcus Aurelius anticipate existentialism, but rather than invite the individual to define particular values, the Roman recommends justice, discipline, efficiency, simplicity, elegance, courage, as absolute virtues, despite (or because of) his acceptance of the emptiness all around, even of such noble absolutes."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Marcus' notes of his mindset on a challenging life appeared (to me at least) to be far from being gloomy or defeatist... The everyday triumphs of dealing well, gladly and constructively with that which others would whine, moan and perhaps cry about is much greater a joy than observing the regular course of nature recycling all seemingly positive things of the present into different, new things is any form of tragedy.It is indeed, in my experience over a couple years now, like having a wise, kindly old grandfather sharing relentlessly honest, mercilessly level-headed advice on how to gladly and properly socially deal with a world otherwise often seemingly made largely of chaos. He very clearly conveys the value of accurately, with remarkably scientific discipline, seeing the true nature of things and of concerning oneself utterly clearly and well with the present. This burns efficiently through popular illusions of being able to persue happiness via, say, an endless stream of mere purchases and then often attempting to persue further happiness by gloating/boasting to others of those purchases et cetera or other like self-defeating acts of desperation. The resultant peace of mind from even some success at such discipline carries its own indestructible happiness, especially in an age when one appears at least partly measured by how much time one spends gabbing into a tiny shiny thing with lots of buttons and expensive monthly charges.There are many, many books dispensing a wise inspiration of the day and such, but it is paramount to understand the reasoning that creates those daily inspirational sayings so that those sayings do not simply become something else externally created to be regularly consumed such as are, say, milk, bagels and fruit. Do not wonder at the possible thoughts of someone you look up to, but have such thoughts yourself as Marcus put it. Marcus has done well in managing to pass down in a set of personal notes a taste of the discipline that formed classical Greek philosophy, that philosophy that formed the foundation for modern psychology and other science.How does reading it (or having my computer read it back to me in my time-restricted case) compare with, say, listening to good music? The thoughts expressed seem as carefully and fluently expressed as the content of most any good music, and at least as beautiful and timeless. I have also found it to have a rather uncanny way of leading to a following day of greater real value than the preceding day, especially following a day containing difficulty in dealing with those we may otherwise consider frustating or impossible."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"This book is more of a bullet list of ideas.

They are well worth it."},{"Title":"Meditations (Little blue book)","review":"Marcus Aurelius was an emperor of Rome. He was bought up in the stoic philosophical tradition of many of the Roman upper classes. However, for Marcus philosophy in all its forms was a life-long passion.What we have here are essentially note books written by Marcus on lessons he has learnt from life, drawn from his background as an emperor, general and relatively unknown person when he was younger. They are the result of a life time of thought on the human condition and mortality. He often goes over similar themes, refining what he has to say, which means at times the book can be a bit gloomy, but that does not invalidate the value of his observations.Gregory Hays has provided us with a new translation of Marcus's books taken from the preserved ancient Greek manuscripts. We have been given a colloquial and unpretentious translation which falls in well with what Marcus has to say. Having read this it is easy to see how these manuscripts have stood the test of time, and that what Marcus has to say is still of relevance today.To see how little human nature has changed in over 2 thousand years, this book is an eye opener and should be part of any collection of classic titles."},{"Title":"Crucible of Time: Deathlands","review":"I have been an avid Deathlands reader for many years and for James Axler to go out this way for his last book was a bit typical deathlands read.

Too bad from someone who brought this series to the top of post-holocaust reading. Ryan and the group are just too darn trusting which in this world - will get you killed!

I hate to say it, but it was filled with all the typical cleches that we have grown used to. Example. The baron that had a history with Ryan and the others, wanted to kill them but ends up forgiving them. Another ville where they are forced to participate in 'tests'. If they pass, they become members of the community, if they fail, they die. Of course we nearly lost one of the characters and when Ryan went for his nightly relief in the woods he was attacked. There were a few suprises though that made up for the usual. The biggest was the meal that they ended up sharing. That suprised me more than you can imagine. Overall the book was average.

The story is true to the game, but at some points there are plot holes where unless you have played the game you'd have no clue what was going on. The artist did a good job of rendering the characters much like the game art. This is a worthy purchase alone for the price, even though it's not as long as most manga.

Benvenuto Cellini tells the story of his life in a vivid tale of kings and prostitutes, artists and dukes, soldiers and necromancers, all the while proclaiming himself the absolute protagonist of his world. Cellini's autobiography is filled to capacity with egotism, but this only makes the story more interesting. In a good piece of literature of this type, a person wants to see a main character with absolute confidence in himself; a superhero if you will. Benvenuto may not be a superhero, but he tells his life story as if he was the greatest of all such legendary folk heroes. If children read this book or were read this book during their childhood, perhaps on the playground at recess, kindergartners would say: &quot;Hey let's play superheroes, I get to be Superman, I get to be Benvenuto Cellini.&quot; With the master goldsmith's stories about fending off six armed men with a single dagger, without a thought of fear in his mind, who wouldn't be solidly entertained?"},{"Title":"The Roads of Home: Lanes and Legends of New Jersey","review":"Henry Charlton Beck has done historians, folklorists, and folks who love New Jersey a great service with The Roads of Home and the rest of his series of books on old-time New Jersey, told by the folks who lived it.

Since students are only in my class for a few hours a week, they need a book that explains ideas in detail. This book allows me to spend time on other things in class.Covered in this book are the entire writing process, from idea generation to revision; various kinds of essays; and research. This also has a section on decisions for collaborative writing, which I find very useful.Some of the best examples in the book show how to make sentences more concise. Avoiding \\"there\\" and \\"it\\" sentence openers, weak verbs, excessive prepositions, and nominalizations are some of them. For each one, the author shows you examples of what is wordy and what is concise. Students find this very helpful.I would recommend using this book for an English class or if you just need something to improve your writing skills."},{"Title":"Art Nouveau Frames and Borders (Dover Pictorial Archive)","review":"This book was well worth the money.

Even with the color limits of the scanned illustrations, I have used this book so much that it's wearing out!

After a while, your new identity became second nature, as if you'd always been like you were now.\\"The difficult part was managing and keeping apart all the different people you had to become.\\"INVENTING ELLIOT is a smart psychological YA thriller set in a private high school in which Elliot, a scarred victim of bullying at his previous schools, is given the chance to start over in a place where nobody knows him, and then finds that his careful efforts at creating himself a new image lead to his being adopted into the heart of the students' secret power structure where he is offered the opportunity to mete out the kind of arbitrary, sadistic punishment to vulnerable classmates that he himself had been subjected to in his previous life. Elliot's constant fear is that any reluctance to play the game will lead to his once again becoming a victim himself.As most of us can imagine, being in his position means that Elliot will merely be trading one living hell for another. Elliot's deep fears, artfully hidden behind his newly minted veneer, are infectious. I was thoroughly on edge as I followed Elliot page by page.\\"When I'm in the showerI'm afraid to wash my hair'Cause I might open my eyesAnd find someone standing there\\"--Rockwell, \\"Somebody's Watching Me\\"Not having read 1984 since well back on the other side of that year, I was intrigued by the prominent role that Orwell's book plays in this story, with two schoolmates presenting their radically contrasting impressions of the book to Elliot. Through those contrasting visions put forth by his characters, the author provides additional fuel for Elliot's internal struggle, as well as tools for the reader to begin considering why the dynamics of bullying exist in schools and possibly why people in the larger society forever crap on each other as if it's an inherent part of being human.INVENTING ELLIOT asks more questions than it answers. This exceptionally well-crafted tale will grab readers in its ever-tightening snare and leave them wrestling with their own beliefs about power and how it is used."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"What if you found yourself fitting in with your peers to the point where you were singled out and prized for the qualities that helped you do this in the first place? What if you camouflaged your insecurity and fears so well, that you were taken for someone entirely different than who you were or wanted to be? Such is the dilemma of the 14-year-old protagonist of \\"Inventing Elliott.\\" Formerly bullied at his old school, Elliott becomes first a bystander to the same type of violence at his new school, and then chosen by the leader of a secret society to become one of the behind-the-scenes orchetrators of the bullying. It isn't until this begins to jeopardize his relationship with his first girlfriend, that Elliott stops simply reacting to the events around him and begins to make his own decisions.What distinguish this book from other similar novels that deal with the impact a powerful secret society has on a school, is the dimension of Elliott's family life. His father is recuperating (poorly) from a mugging, and this gives Elliott's reaction to being bullied a somewhat different angle.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"Don't get me wrong. I think this is a very good book. The final confrontation/conversation between Elliot and his mother should be required reading for every teenager and his/her parents. And I think the exploration of how fear and power play into each other is a powerful one, even if it doesn't quite achieve the depths of classics like 1984 or Lord of the Flies.I can only give the book 3 stars, however, because there were several problems with the setting. First, I could not help feeling that the voices and mannerisms and social interactions sounded much more British than American. Yet the story seemed to be taking place in America. Second of all, if it was taking place in America, the author didn't seem to know much about American schools. Most public schools do not have uniforms, and if the schools Elliot was attending were private, how could his family possibly afford them? Also, it's pretty rare to play TACKLE football in gym class (flag or touch is the norm), and even more rare for kids to put on team uniforms for gym class.Other readers will say these are minor issues, but I disagree. They distracted me from the story, made me question the author's knowledge of the setting, and kept me wondering why the book was set in America when nothing seemed American? Was it the author's decision? If so, the editor should have talked him out of it. If it was the editor's idea (maybe because a lot of publishers are convinced American kids can't deal with any other culture), the author should find a new editor.Having griped about all that, let me repeat that I think this is a phenomenal book. I would truly recommend it to anyone. I just wish the author and editor had made a better choice on the setting. Then I could have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"Inventing Elliot by Graham Gardner is a riveting book, althoughobvious at times.

Here he meets the Guardians, a group ofstudents that rule the school; Ben, an intelligent boy that isn'texcepted by other people; and Louise, a nice girl that Elliot fallsin love with. This story is told in Elliot's perspective and can go slow at times, but still keeps you wondering what will happen next.I thought this book was an emotional book that truly shows how cruel life can be sometimes. Through most of the book, I didn't like Elliot because of some of the choices he made and the way he was always so moody. Graham Gardner has many jobs such as a writer, an academic researcher, and a musician. Inventing Elliot is his first novel and was shortlisted for the Branford Boase Award.

When someone is not a part of the group his or her life can be fraught with misery. This is the situation 14-year-old Elliot Sutton finds himself in when he is the target of hurtful teasing by his classmates.However, there's hope as Elliot is going to a new school, Holminster High, and he is determined to be different, to change himself so that he won't be bullied again. To this end, he adopts a facade, a tough exterior, an emotional armor to protect himself.British actor Dominic Taylor presents a compelling reading as he segues from a cowed young man to a hardened teenager and, finally, to the voice of Elliot's conscience.You see, it seems that there is actually no escape for Elliot as Holminster High has its bullies, too. Only, they're a bit more evil than the ones Elliot has known before. This is a group called the Guardians, no one knows exactly who they are but everyone knows enough to fear them. They're upperclass students who rule for the sake of ruling, and, of all things, they want Elliot to join them.Can Elliot, a boy who was once a victim become a victimizer? It's often a struggle to grow, and this young man faces some difficult tests in order to do so.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"First, it's quite good about the kid's emotional state.But the story is unbelievable. We are asked to believe that there is a conspiracy of older kids to punish and torture others that has lasted since the 19th century, that all the kids know about,and NO ONE has spoken up about it, so that in fact Elliot can end the whole thing just by banging on the Principal's door on the last page? Come off it. In fact, the book is quite a bad influence in that students are too prone to believe in conspiracy theories such as this in fact is.Elliot tries to avoid notice. Nothing surprising in that. But when the Games Coach asks him to explain a piece of torture, he says 'Just fooling around,' and for this very standard answer the Guardians think he's so wonderful they want to co-opt him? Again, he's played at being a complete nobody, and the Principal compliments him on his work and says 'You mix well socially.' Come on. And the English teacher (the English teacher is always the nice one in this sort of book) says his essays are 'superb'.My copy at least suffers from this weird American transcribing. The mention of school uniform has led many American readers to assume Elliot goes to a private school - but how, then, can his parents be so poor? In fact this is in Britain, where all students wear school uniform. It is clear that his school is an old English grammar school that became comprehensive in the 60s."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"I used this book as a read aloud for eighth graders and it was a good discussion starter on bullying.

He wants to make sure that he doesn't get noticed in the wrong way ever again. As a result, he wears the right clothes, changes his hairstyle and acts very cool. Much to his surprise, his plan succeeds.Elliot is noticed by the Guardians, a secret society of students who run the school by terrorizing and bullying students. Their organization is loosely based on George Orwell's book 1984. The Guardians would like Elliot to join them. Not wanting to get hurt again, Elliot goes along with them but soon finds out that he will have to pay a terrible price for his new position of power.Gardner made me feel Elliot's pain, both physically and emotionally. Most of his actions are driven by fear. There are several touching scenes in the book. Elliot befriends a boy named Ben who is one of the Guardians' favorite targets. Elliot and Ben spend several enjoyable Saturdays together, but ultimately their friendship dies because Elliot is afraid to associate with Ben. Elliot risks losing another friendship because he is hesitant to reveal who he really is. He is crazy about a girl named Louise, but he does not want her to find out about his secret life. Will he reveal his true self to her?In the end, this novel is about choices. Elliot has to decide how to use his new power. Ultimately he must listen to his inner voice and find his true self.If you are looking for a light, funny novel, INVENTING ELLIOT is not the book for you.

It is about 14 year old boy named Elliot, who goes to a new school, Holminster High. He meets a bunch of bullies, and the Guardians, the men that secretly run the school. Well, he gets chosen by Richard, one of the Guardians, to be one of them. Now, he has to pick: Either be a regular school kid, or be a bully.The Main Character is Elliot. Elliot is always curious, because he does not know what will happen. Such as when High School student Ben, a nerd that does photography (and has his own dark room), leads him to his house, he was curious because he did not know if one of the Guardians would see him. One of the other students that got picked on a lot is the raw nosed kid. He is always getting picked on. One part is when a big bully, Stewart Masters, made the raw nosed kid take a cold shower in the locker room in front of everyone.The problem of the story is when Elliot is changed to the new school. This is the problem because there are more bullies and more violence. He will get picked on more and more things will happen to him.My favorite part in this story is when Elliot has all this new stuff happening to him. One of those parts is when he joins the swim team. Also he is one of the Guardians and he met Louise.I would give this book 4 stars because it is my type of book, which is kind of violent, action, and suspense of what happens to the characters, and I found a lot of that in this book."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"Inventing Elliot by: Graham GardenerInventing Elliot is about a boy named Elliot (of course). He's 14 years old and goes to a horrible school. He is bullied and beat up every day.It's surviving in his prospective. He has a mother and a stepfather. His other father was killed by some kind of muggers. His mother is caring and wishes for a better life and hopes she wont loose her husband again. While his stepfather is a slob and watches the TV all the time.Through all the torment and misery at school he decides to transfer to a new school called \\"Holminster high\\". He meets countless friends and types of bullies that don't hurt kids without meaning or so it seams. He tries to invent a new Elliot (an Elliot that wont be bullied, beat up, and will have some cool friends).I liked this book and would recommend it. It's a fast read yet very strong. My favorite part of the book was when Elliot met a girl and became really good friends. If I could rate this book on 1-5 I would give it a 3. That is my review of Inventing Elliot."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"I read a book titled Inventing Elliot by Graham Gardener. It is an ok book, yet it was confusing at parts but I still enjoyed it. The book was set in Holminster High school, when Elliot Sutton arrives and I think it is around the 2000's.The main characters in this story were Elliot, the main character who just moved in. He was a nerd at his old school that got beaten up more than he could handle, so (as his English teacher said it) he put on a mask for the new Elliot. The second was probably Richard who is a guardian of the school, he says he keeps order by punishing people for any reason he can find I guess. He accepts Elliot's mask and thinks he would be great new blood for the Guardians. The third is Ben, a friend he meets, he is punished by the club but Elliot ends up liking him, this could be a danger for Elliot because if the guardians found out he was with a person being punished, he would become a target again, like at his old school. The last one might be Louis, she didn't appear too much, but Elliot really likes her and he doesn't really know how to ask (or what mask he should put on for her). He really likes her, but Richard persuades him to act differently, like a Guardian! He basically ends the relationship with his idiotic influences and Louis doesn't want Elliot to be putting on a mask because some friend told him to.The main problem occurs when he is invited into the Guardians, but first he must find a punisher, punishment, and a victim to be punished. This would be the stickiest mask he would have to put on to stand out the right way. Would he let the new Elliot take control and be like Kevin Cunningham, the old Elliot's bully, or would he take off the dumb masks and live life the way he should have it?My favorite part was when Richard asked him to be a Guardian. It seemed so realistic when he approached Elliot and he came and told Elliot about the Guardian's favorite book. He was so scared that they got power for power's sake. He stood out in the right way and got some friends. But to keep them he would have to superglue the mask on as good as he could.I liked this because it was so descriptive about how close he got and how Elliot felt. It would be so scary to have him get that close to his mask. If Elliot hadn't stuck together then he would be punished.I gave this book 3 stars because it was worth reading; it really gave me a perspective of how some high school can get to be as cruel as Holminster. I would recommend this book because it is a good read and you learn lot from a kid who goes to high school and I think the author put great work into it."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"I read an okay book (for lack of a better word) titled Inventing Elliot by Graham Gardner. It is a realistic fiction book set in the early 21st century.The main character in this story is Elliot Sutton, a ninth-grader at Holminster High, a seemingly nice high school, but then Elliot finds out that the school is being ruled by the guardians, a group of fanatics obsessed with George Orwell's book 1984. Soon school becomes a fearful experience, and Elliot's can't ever find a break from his terror, but then he meets Louise, and his life looks up a bit, but when she stops being his friend, Elliot doesn't know where to go. Finally, at the end of the book, he feels calm and realizes what he must do.The main problem of this book occurs when Elliot is brought to the guardians and meets them face to face, not to be punished, though, but to join them. Elliot can't decide what to do. Will his future look up with the power he could gain, or will he become his own enemy?I didn't have a favorite part because the book was all about Elliot, and he wasn't a good character. I thought that he was mean and selfish, and only cared about his own life. The only characters that I would have had a favorite part about were Louise and Ben, his other friend, but nothing good really happened to them, even when Elliot talked to Louise when he first met her. Nothing good happened in this book. It was just one long string of sad events, never any happiness. Elliot, it seemed, was the antagonist, and I've never had a favorite part about the antagonist, except when he/she was thwarted.I really did not enjoy this book because it was too sad, too much description of terror and true evil.I would not recommend this book to anyone who liked happy, full, good books because this book was very sad and ended abruptly and surprisingly, leaving the reader wondering what would happen next, leaving a \\"big empty hole\\" in the story.

Elliot though he was going to get bullied but he didn't. The Guardians actually accepted him to be in the Guardians.

He had his friends, a stable family, and pretty good grades. When his father is violently attacked and left a mental invalid, Elliot's family is forced to move and transplant Elliot into a new middle school. Now, Elliot is noticed...in the wrong way. He becomes a loner, targeted by the school's worst bullies. Elliot's narrative of these events and his struggle to keep them hidden from his suffering mother is painful to read in its accurate portrayal of bullying.At last, Elliot's mom saves up enough to move the family to a new school and a new start for them all. This is when Elliot begins to reinvent himself following the motto, \\"If you are noticied in the wrong way, you are dead.\\" At first, Elliot seems to be successful - noticed in the right way. Then, the wrong people notice Elliot. A secret fraternity that controls the school (who gets punished, how they get punished, and who does the punishing)wants Elliot to join them. He now is faced with the dillemma of whether to become the victim again or to become the thing he hates most - the ultimate bully.As Elliot struggles with his reinvention, he is constantly switching masks. With each new person he meets, he is forced to invent a new mask. Elliot fears the day he will don the wrong mask and his carefully constructed reality will come crashing down. Here, Elliot struggles with the idea of real freedom. This struggle is highlighted through the allusion to Orwell's 1984.This is a well written book. The first person narrative and flashbacks to painful school experiences are sure to strike a connection with most readers. The social heirarchy of schools is painfully realistic, even if you personally have not been the vicitim in one of these situations. As a middle school teacher, I've seen too many of these things really happen.I definately reccommend this book for parents and students alike."},{"Title":"Inventing Elliot (New Windmills)","review":"This book is a wonderful story about a kid that is going though things that kids like me go through evey day.

However, I found that some of the dishes in this book has missing ingredients that is essential to the dish. I am a Filipino who grew up in a household in Manila where my mother cooked for our family every night so when I discovered that there are missing ingredients to some of the most popular Filipino dishes, I found this book very disappointed. For example, the dishes called \\"pinakbet\\" and \\"kare-kare\\" does not include eggplants primarily japanese-style eggplants. The dish \\"menudo\\" does not include chickpeas and raisins, and the dish \\"kaldereta\\" did not include pimientos.Also, some of the tagalog translation in the book seems to be off. For example, if you look at the introduction under sausages, the author translated this to \\"chorizo\\" which is a Spanish-style sausage. The correct tagalog translation to the word sausages is longanisa, which is Filipino-syle sausage. If you go to the market in the Philippines, chorizo and longanisa are two very different sausages, though both are available. By the way, the dish called \\"Fritada\\" (one of the tomato-based stews in the book) the correct name for it is \\"Afritada\\".I also agree with another review when it mentioned that it does not include other popular Filipino dishes especially in the dessert section such as puto and bibingka - caked both made with rice flour, \\"champorado\\" (chocolate rice pudding), and \\"turon\\" which is fried and sweetened banana plantains wrapped in lumpia wrapper.

And within a few years he transformed university governance. John MacDonald's influence far transcended that of his peers. And still does.This memoir, \\"Chances and Choices\\", reveals how a young Canadian scientist emerged from comparative obscurity to become successively: director of one of the world's most prestigious dental schools (the Forsyth Dental Infirmary) and a full professor in Harvard's Department of Bacteriology; president of a large Canadian university (the University of British Columbia); chairman of the commission on university government, which had a profound influence on Canadian higher education; director and subsequent chairman of the Ontario Addiction Research Foundation. Incidentally, he did not apply for any of these appointments--he was invited.Jack MacDonald demonstrated throughout his illustrious career an outstanding flair for identifying critical issues and devising viable and novel solutions. His passion for research and his concomitant ability to attract outstanding scholars and scientists to his various enterprises was his hallmark.But what makes his career so dramatic was not only his pioneering research in oral microbiology (a sorely neglected discipline at the time) at Forsyth, but his unique style in handling crisis situations, especially at University of British Columbia. When the provincial government repeatedly rejected the university's pleas for additional funds MacDonald rallied the whole community--students, faculty, governors and citizenry--to protest. Indeed the student protest, manifest in a march (the largest in the history of Canadian universities) resplendent with \\"Back Mac\\" banners, probably convinced the government that the president was relentless in pursuit of his goals. Intellectual freedom would not be compromised.On subsequent occasions, notably when confronted with an intransigent board of governors and an uncooperative faculty association, the author displayed extraordinary courage by adamantly refusing to accept majority opinions. Perhaps the most moving moment of his presidency arose when, against the advice of board and senior officers of the university, he addressed a rebellious faculty meeting. At the conclusion he received a standing ovation!Restless and relentless in his pursuit of excellence in research and university government, MacDonald has left an indelible stamp on higher education, especially in Canada.Complementing the account of his academic and professional life is a beautifully written narrative in which his passionate devotion to his parents and family is manifest. Candor and humour abound!"},{"Title":"Chances and Choices: A Memoir","review":"CHANCES AND CHOICES: A Memoir by JOHN B. MACDONALDMacdonald, in a career that spanned some fifty years, has made outstanding contributions to Canadian higher education and research, health policy, and to the field of drug abuse. He has a good story to relate and he tells it well. It would be no exaggeration to say that through Dr. Macdonald's vision and leadership as President, UBC emerged in the 1960s from being primarily a provincial university emphasizing undergraduate studies to become one of the leading universities in North America with outstanding research capabilities in almost every discipline. These were exciting years in which there seemed to be a crisis at every turn: in university-government relations, funding, academic freedom, student activism and university governance. Dr. Macdonald faced these with courage and diplomacy, and in a way that few university presidents could or would today. His account makes fascinating reading.Dr. Macdonald's imprint on higher education in Ontario was no less important than that in British Columbia. As Executive Director of the Council of Ontario Universities he worked effectively to promote cooperation among the universities and between them and the provincial government. The account of his efforts to protect the autonomy of the universities against intrusion by politicians and the government bureaucracy makes interesting reading, especially in light of recent developments in university-government relations in the province. The weakening of the university system in Ontario over the past several decades as a result of chronic under funding and the gradual assumption by government of decision-making related to university priorities makes a depressing story but one that needs to be told. Dr. Macdonald has done so very effectively.For the general reader the most salient section of the book may be that covering Dr. Macdonald's work as President of the Addiction Research Foundation. His experience provides important insights on issues of prevention and treatment of drug addiction and raises questions and doubts about the effectiveness of current approaches to this problem.Not only does this memoir provide the reader with an interesting account of a remarkable career encompassing diverse areas of health and higher education, but it also offers important insights and views on some of the most pressing issues of public concern. What should be the role of universities in this age of high technology? Is it, as Premier Harris has stated, primarily to provide training for the workplace? What is the appropriate role of government in establishing priorities for higher education? What do we mean by academic freedom and how important is it for our society? How can we most effectively meet medical manpower needs? What policies should we put in place to combat substance abuse? On these and other issues Dr. Macdonald holds strong opinions and he expresses them vigorously. We may not always agree with his views but they can be certain to stimulate debate.The text moves at a lively pace, it shows lightness of touch when needed and it rarely burdens the reader with uninteresting detail. Even the descriptions of scientific research can be followed without difficulty by the general reader. Dr. Macdonald has given us a book that both entertains and instructs.

His true story is certainly more incredible and indeed astonishing than anything fiction could dream up. Even in his own lifetime he was feted for his incredible abilities.Boone's abilities were apparent from his earliest childhood in mid-eighteenth century pioneer America. He had an uncanny sense of direction and ability to find his way around. He kept moving west through Kentucky to Missouri and even went as far as Yellowstone Lake on one trip. Yet despite opening up vast new territories for new settlers he died without owning an acre of land. In that time he had worked with and fought against the Indians, served with the American's in the War of Independence, narrowly missing being captured, and seen at least two of his children killed before their time.I loved this biography by Elliot. I felt he really stripped back the layers of myth, carefully weighing up different accounts and the veracity of them while telling his story. The result is a small insight into the private life of a private man as well as his amazing public acts. I often wondered if Diana Gabaldon read this biography when working on her Outlander series, or maybe she had a Daniel Boone-ish sort of character in mind to base her character of Jamie on when he reached America."},{"Title":"Complete Audio Holy Bible: King James Version","review":"I really love to read although I do not have a lot of time to do so presently.

The subtile was \\"The Values of Pre-Industrial Japan.\\" Apart from the different subtitle and new introduction by the author, the 1985 and 1957 books seem exactly the same.Sociologist Bellah follows the foot steps of Max Weber, a German sociologist who explained, several generations before, that Northern European capitalism was strongly influenced by Protestantism (the religion of N. Europe for the last 500 years). Bellah similarly makes a strong argument that the industrialization of Japan had its roots in a very special religious ans pre-religious configuration. Though he comments about more ancient and more recent Japan, his focus period is the so-called \\"Tokugawa Period\\": 1600-1868. He feels that in this period Japan's religion and values had greatly stabilized compared to the upheavals of past centuries. The religion and values continued to evolve in the T period, but they were steadily leading to a concentration of politcal power in the person of the emperor.Japan's case is very different from N. Europe in may ways. Let me just mention one: for more than a 1,000 years before the T period, what is called Japanese religion had been a blend of Shinto, Confucianism, and Buddhism (and some Taoism). That blend always remained close to real life, through codes of ethics that were taken seriouly in day to day living. Bellah makes illuminating comparisons to China, and a couple of key comparisons to Europe that are also very illuminating.Why did I give such an important book 4 rather than 5 stars? First because I coudn't give it 4.5 stars. The half star I take off is to live some room for other books that are as important but also better written. The book is clear enough to be very well understood. Although I know a few authors that organize their material better and put more emphasis on concise sentences, one has to excuse Bellah for 1) dealing with a complex material often written in Japanese and 2) extracting a politco-econo-religious connection which too few social scientists have attempted. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tokugawa religion : the values of pre-industrial Japan.","review":"The Thesis is important. The idea that the religious beliefs of the Japanese, a mix of Zen, Buddhism, Shinto, and a bit of Confucianism, created a Protestant like Work ethic in Japan. It is intriguing. The Weber thesis of Western Europe and the North American states that the Protestant religion ground in many a pull yourself up by the bootstraps mentality is a good one. Look at the economic and industrial success of majority Protestant countries vs. majority Catholic countries. Bellah carries this type of idea to the Japanese. The vocabulary of this book is tought. It is not an easy read, but it is informative and it is thought provoking."},{"Title":"Tokugawa religion : the values of pre-industrial Japan.","review":"Bellah begins by defining religion as \\"a set of symbolic forms and acts that relate man to the ultimate conditions of his existence.\\" He argues that beginning with the single cosmos of the undifferentiated primitive religious worldview in which life is a \\"one possibility thing,\\" evolution in the religious sphere is toward the increasing differentiation and complexity of symbol systems. His evolutionary religious taxonomy specifies five stages: primitive (e.g., Australian Aborigines), archaic (e.g., Native American), historic (e.g., ancient Judaism, Confucianism, Buddhism, Islam, early Palestinian Christianity), early modern (e.g., Protestant Christianity), and modern (religious individualism). In the modern stage of religious evolution, the hierarchic dualistic religious symbol system that emerged in the historic epoch is collapsed and the symbol system that results is \\"infinitely multiplex.\\" In this posttraditional situation, the individual confronts life as an \\"infinite possibility thing,\\" and is \\"capable, within limits, of continual self-transformation and capable, again within limits, of remaking the world, including the very symbolic forms with which he deals with it, even the forms that state the unalterable conditions of his own existence.\\"read more: http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/bellah.htmAn interesting perspective on Protestant Work Ethic applied / tested in other cultural setting."},{"Title":"Tokugawa religion : the values of pre-industrial Japan.","review":"Upon reading Tokugawa Religion after its publication in 1957, Maruyama Masao wrote the following: \\"There are not many books lying around which can shake us out of our inertia. Of the many American research works on Japan which are constantly coming out, Bellah's book, more than any in a long time, has aroused my appetite and my fighting spirit.\\" By this, one of postwar Japan's most influential critics was endorsing the work of a young and yet unknown social scientist freshly out of Harvard with a joint doctoral degree in sociology and Far Eastern studies.Maruyama's lengthy review underscored the theoretical ambition of the book, which purported to do to Tokugawa religion and Japan what Max Weber had done for the Protestant ethic and the West. But he questioned whether the particularism of Japan, its tendency to concentrate loyalty on particular groups and their leaders, from the emperor and the nation down to the family and the firm, could really be, as Bellah had argued, an adequate substitute for ethical universalism. Maruyama pointed out that economic development did not necessarily correlate with political democratization or the prevalence of universal principles and human rights. He argued that economic development, unaccompanied by certain other changes, could even undermine the conditions of its own continuation.By arguing so, Maruyama, perhaps unwittingly, was being faithful to a different Max Weber: not the theoretician of rationalization and the bureaucratic order that Talcott Parsons had adapted to derive his theory of social structure, but a more somber and pessimistic Weber, who felt that magic had gone out of this world and that mankind had locked itself into an iron cage. This is this last Weber that Robert Bellah echoes in his 1985 preface to the paperback edition of the book, pointing towards the limits of the modernization theory embraced by the original essay, and noting with much foresight, in an allusion to Ezra Vogel's recently published bestseller: \\"the position of Number One in the world seems to be uncomfortable, and no one holds it long.\\"More than fifty years after its publications, can Tokugawa Religion still shake us out of our inertia and arouse our fighting spirit? The world the early twenty-first century seems very different from the world of the mid-1950s, or even from the mid-1980s when the preface was written. The passage of time has eroded the book's angles and softened its impact. We no longer believe in the modernization theory espoused by Bellah's teacher Talcott Parsons, the idea that all societies would converge towards a unique model of modernity along a uniform path of economic and social development. Most would doubt the claim that the United States represents the direction in which all other societies are moving, or indeed whether any society adequately exemplifies a model that other should follow.We have lost appetite for the theoretical constructs by which sociology was staking its claim of scientific rigor. We no longer believe that a complex society can be summarized into a four quadrant, two dimensional chart, as the one Bellah uses to plot the conceptual model that underpins his analysis of Japan's social structure. We don't feel the need to look into the teachings of the Jdo Shinsh sect to find equivalent of Protestant \\"inner worldly asceticism\\", or to propose the notion of shokubun as an analogue to the concept of the calling (\\"Beruf\\") through which labor becomes a sacred obligation.We don't need to explain Japan's exceptionalism, because Japan is no longer an exception: the whole region of East Asia has followed Japan in its successful pursuit of economic development, and one can no longer claim, as was the case in the 1950s, that Japan represents the only non-Western nation to have transformed itself into a modern industrial state. In addition, Japan has lost its magic: already in 1985, Bellah deplored the loss of traditional values and lifestyle, and he wondered how long the vaunted work ethic ad social discipline of the Japanese salaryman would survive. The original edition of the the book found a general readership yearning to learn about Japan; now Tokugawa religion remains a subject only for scholars, and no one would find in it lessons that would apply for today. In addition, as the author acknowledges in his preface, \\"scholarship has advanced so rapidly in the last thirty years that it would require rewriting the whole book to take account of it.\\"Reading Tokugawa Religion with the hindsight of accumulated knowledge, one can only be struck by the many limits, biases and defects that the book accumulates. First, despite the claim that it remains one of the few attempts to apply Max Weber's framework to a religion other than Protestantism, it makes only a limited contribution to the field of Weberian studies. As already mentioned, it considers only an optimistic and sanitized Weber, the one Talcott Parsons imported into US academia as a founding father of the branch of sociology he was developing. Anchored in functionalism, it makes excessive use of the concept of rationalization, which explains the direction taken in the areas of economic values, political control, cultural integration, and institutional building.The book ostensibly refers to The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism and draws parallels based on this short essay, but it makes little use of Weber's sociology of religion, which at the time of Bellah's writing was only partly accessible in English. Max Weber provides many tools and concepts to the study of religion that could have been put to good use: the notions of charisma and of legitimacy, the processes of secularization and institutionalization, the figures of the prophet and the priest... Applying these concepts to the study of Tokugawa religious movements, and in particular to his case study of Ishida Baigan and Shingaku, would have provided a much richer material. In any case, it would have been interesting to put Weber's writings on oriental religions into perspective, and to discuss his claim that Confucianism was inimical to the development of capitalism.As a second limitation, Bellah's essay suffers from the dearth of bibliographical references. It is a reminder to a time when Japanese studies in the West were still at their infant stage, and when one could still quote Lafcadio Hearn or George Sansom as authorities in the field. The evidence that Bellah produces is patchy: sometimes he is forced to draw inference on Tokugawa Japan by observing social aspects in modern Japanese society, such as child socialization or women's status. Bellah acknowledges his debt to Ruth Benedict, who wrote The Chrysanthemum and the Sword without having set foot in Japan. He uses all the sources in English he could get, but is often obliged to confess his ignorance and limitations.Bellah's translations of classical texts offered as quotes are not his own, and may have carried forth the load of misconceptions and approximations inherent from past interpretations of Japanese culture. The few Japanese sources that he refers to--almost exclusively on Ishida Baigan and Shingaku--all predate 1945 and must have conveyed the statist and hierarchical outlook that so much influenced Japanese scholars and their Western interpreters. It didn't occur to Bellah that these accounts may have been biased by the ideology of the time, and that the supremacy of the political over the economic that he thought characterized Japan during the Edo period may have been superimposed on that period at a later stage.Scholarship has certainly progressed since the time Tokugawa Religion was published (for any evidence, it would strongly recommend to the interested reader the two books published in English by Eiko Ikegami, The Taming of the Samurai and Bonds of Civility). And yet, are we so sure we are free of the same biases and errors we detect in past works? A book is always a product of its time, and the role of a classic study is to provide a bridge between present and past interpretations. We can read past essays in a new light. The argument of particularism that so much stimulated Maruyama is now advanced by those who advocate a return to the ethic of Ohmi merchants to find a distinctly Japanese conception of corporate social responsibility. And the whole debate on Asian values and their role in capitalist development reproduces Bellah's interpretation of Weber on a larger scale. To know where these debates originate, it is always better to prefer the original to the copy, and to defer to the opinions of scholars. For all these reasons, Tokugawa Religion remains a landmark study."},{"Title":"Tokugawa religion : the values of pre-industrial Japan.","review":"This text has become a classic in the fields of religion, history, and the social sciences.

In Crate Lake, Ryan Cawdor's band of travelers encounter two very different but equally nightmarish societies in what used to be northern Oregon. As with the other two books the band just seems to be passing through and exploring what is at each redoubt that they come across. The town of Ginsburg Falls that they encounter is surprisingly clean and orderly on the surface but as one can expect this just hides crazier than average Deathlands dysfunction as the group soon find out along with why there don't seem to be very many women around . . . .But as it turns out Ginsberg Falls is only the beginning of the mayhem as they go on to visit the Wizard Island Center for Scientific Advancement. Such and peaceful sounding name that is VERY deceiving! This place seems to be beyond the pale for even the main characters who slowly begin to unravel the secrets \\"research\\" that the scientists at Wizard Island are doing. And you can bet its not to cure global hunger!This is a very entertaining book and the best part is that it fills in a lot of the back story for Doc Tanner who is easily one of the most interesting characters in the series so far if I have one complaint it would be that like so many of the Gold Eagle series books the authors seem to rush through the last 20 pages or so as if they are about to his their work limit and need to go ahead and finish.

Wilson have blazed a trail in editing this book. Mostly well-known Americans, but also some hidden gems, share with the reader what the Johnson brothers' song means to them.And it means a lot to a cross section of Americans. One friend noted that if you read the book in one setting, as she did, you get a clear sense of how African American families taught their children to be revolutionaries. These children were taught about their history, and they were given the tools to dream and do something about their future. They had no choice; they had to march on until victory was won! And they did, from shacks in Mississippi, middle-class homes in Chicago and upper-class environments in Hollywood (where they often still could not get a decent meal in a restaurant), they were taught to fight for their freedom. They marched on--on buses, at &quot;white only&quot; lunch counters, over bridges with dogs and police daring them to cross,down lonely country roads with the KKK looking on--and though hundreds of marches, they fulfilled the dreams of their ancestors.One of the real treasures of the book, besides the wonderful essays, is that one gets the sense, through exquisite historical photos, of how broad the African American experience is and continues to be. There are poor black women chopping cotton, and black men being killed. But there are also photograpshs of young black women on horseback in the 1950s, muslim women at a mosque, photographs of Muhammad Ali, James Weldon Johnson and his wife looking lovingly at each other, proud black women on their way to church and young children all dressed up to perform in some special show for their parents. These photos give you a sense that despite the hardship, we might be making some progress--that the race is okay and might survive.I would like to thank Bond and Wilson for sharing with us the best of our culture.

Rosamond Johnson, wrote a song for a chorus of five hundred black school children, in Jacksonville, Florida, to sing in celebration of Lincoln's birthday. The song was originally published by mimeograph, and intended only for that year's remembrance of President Lincoln. Yet, the black school children of Jacksonville kept singing. ...and because the song reflected the truth of the black experience in America, the chorus swelled from five hundred to millions of voices. Today &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot; is alternately referred to as the &quot;Black National Anthem&quot;Deeply patriotic, and clinging to a vision of an America healed of the scourge of racism, the brothers Johnson answered Francis Scott Key's anthem with realism, pathos, and hope. Whereas Key's song speaks of the external, military enemy, the Johnsons' chorus speaks of the more insidious internal enemy of racism. Whereas Key wrote of liberty already won and now demanding defense, the Johnsons wrote of liberty delayed, eventually promised, seen, but not yet fully acheived.In this anthology, the editors give us an history of this deeply moving piece of music, and a chronology of its authors. They also give us one hundred short reponses to the song -- almost meditations -- by Americans of every skin hue. Finally, the text includes a pictoral display of the 20th century, American, black experience which is a treasure in and of itself.This is more than a coffee table book.

Before Heyer, the best known and most highly regarded fictional account of the Battle of Waterloo was in Thackeray's classic _Vanity Fair_. (Victor Hugo wrote about the battle, too, in _Les Mis&eacute;rables_, but he was writing from the French viewpoint.) More recently, Bernard Cornwell, justifiably famous for his rousing and highly accurate battle scenes, did a marvelous grunt's-eye view of the battle in _Sharpe's Waterloo_. So how does this novel fare, compared to those? Heyer's approach focuses much more on the tension-filled events of the previous three or four months leading up to the climax at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. Brussels was filled with high-ranking English civilians and officers' families who were taking the opportunity of Napoleon's exile to Elba to travel to the Continent for the first time in a generation. The Peace Conference was under way down in Vienna and the victors were celebrating. When the Emperor re-entered France and proclaimed his return to the throne, gathering his old subordinates around him and being cheered by most of the French people, the Allies were caught unprepared (the best and most experienced English regiments had been sent across the Atlantic to fight the Americans). But the frenzy of balls and society picnics in Brussels foreshadowed a similar mood in Paris in 1940, as the Germans were tooling up to invade. It's that atmosphere, alternating between complacent boredom and near panic, that Heyer captures so well.There are two stories here, actually. The first, we observe from afar, in a sense: The arrival of the Duke of Wellington, the filtering into town of his subordinate senior officers, and the gradual acceleration of the preparations to confront Napoleon. Nearly everyone in this plot-line is a real historical figure and Heyer does an excellent job of describing their personalities and styles and the often touchy ways they interact -- especially the English, Dutch, and Prussians. The other story, which we see close-up, is the awkward and often painful off-again-on-again romance between Col. Charles Audley, the eldest and most experienced of Wellington's aides -- the Duke's \\"family\\" -- and the young widow, Lady Barbara Childe, who was raised badly by her father (her mother having died when she was small) and has become an unbridled and ungovernable \\"wild child.\\" Charles falls irretrievably in love with the beautiful and lethally sexy Lady Barbara almost at first sight -- a notion which has always seemed improbable to me, but I suppose it happens -- and proposes to her within hours of meeting her. And Barbara accepts, for reasons she doesn't really understand herself, because she's certainly not going to stop flirting or deliberately shocking people or behaving with complete lack of propriety. Charles says he doesn't want a tame, dutiful, obedient wife, but Barbara, who seems to live for scandal, is more than even he can handle and things, naturally, go awry. The story of their relationship is complex and multilayered and Heyer's examination of their competing personalities is first-rate -- and far more interesting than in most of her lighter romances. The supporting cast here, in the form of Col. Audley's brother, the Earl of Worth, and his sister-in-law, Lady Judith Worth, n&eacute;e Taverner, and Judith's brother, Sir Peregrine Taverner and his young wife (all of whom first appeared in Regency Buck), are also very well done.In fact, there is a great deal of very good writing everywhere in this book. But most notable is Chapter 17, which describes the Duchess of Richmond's famous ball on the night before Napoleon's approach, with its descriptions of the Highlander infantrymen, accompnaied by their pipers, dancing reels for the attendees (most of them would be dead the next day), the news being brought in by mud-stained young gallopers, the more junior officers immediately hurrying off to rejoin their regiments, the Duke of Wellington determinedly showing a cheerful countenance and then asking for a map, and finally the regiments called from their billets and sorting themselves out in the center of town, forming up, and marching off in the dawn to leave Brussels empty and silent. All this provides some of the most moving and affecting descriptive writing I have ever read. Equally mesmerizing is the picture she paints of high-born ladies of fashion forgetting their complexions and their intramural jealousies and intrigues and getting down in the dirt and the blood to care for the wounded who manage to stagger back to Brussels, \\"toiling as their scullery-maids had never done.\\" Beautiful stuff. In fact, the only section of the book that isn't quite up to scratch is the detailed order of battle in which the author indulges between Quatre Bras and Waterloo itself; it's a result, I'm sure, of her insistence on meticulous research, but it could have been considerably shortened and summarized with no loss whatever to the story. My recommendation is to go to Cornwell's Sharpe for the strategy and tactics, the blood and guts, of one of the most important military engagements in Western history -- but read this marvelous book for the psychology and the personalities on the Allied side of the battle and of the period leading up to it."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Georgette Heyer was the master of historical fiction, particularly in the Regency era. 'An Infamous Army' focuses rather more on historical events than the romance than most of her other novels, its central theme being the description of the Battle of Waterloo and the events leading up to it.The main characters in this story are Colonel Charles Audley and Lady Barbara Childe; Charles Audley appeared as the younger brother of Lord Worth in \\"Regency Buck\\" and Barbara Childe is the grandaughter of Dominic and Mary from \\"Devil's Cub\\". There has been a slight fudging of historical dates to fit these characters in but it is interesting to read more of Lord Worth and Judith's marriage in this story as parts of the book are told from Judith's point of view. Many readers may find Barbara Childe a rather unsympathetic character, her wild behaviour and rather cavalier treatment of Charles Audley can be hard to stomach; however, as the book continues and the battle takes place she shows more depth to her character, despite her faults. Charles's instant attraction to her isn't always understandable but in some ways the love story in this book feels very much as a hook upon which to pin the main thrust of the book, the battle itself.The romance in the story is definitely subsidiary to the historical events which are described with an excellent attention to detail. The way that society in Brussels continued its usual round of Balls and Soir&eacute;es as the French troops drew nearer was fascinating, as were the portrayals of several historical characters, not least the Duke of Wellington, the horror and agony of war and the real possibility that Napoleon's troops might have prevailed.Although an excellent book the heavy emphasis on the fighting of the battle of Waterloo means that it isn't particularly easy reading. It's also quite a long book and with the usual Heyer writing style which is full of cant phrases that can be hard to understand for a first-time Heyer reader. Still she is many people's favourite historical novelist for good reasons and this book does not disappoint with the quality of the writing, the historical detail and the author's excellent storytelling ability.Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book, www.curledup.com.

I have always hesitated about starting this book. I knew it would feel a little sad, like visiting with very dear old friends for the very last time before each goes their own way...I have always loved Charles in Regency Buck, in this book he was his usual merry, good humoured self, a little more mature but just as amusing as ever. Barbara had her great-grandma Leonie's hair and eyes, and she is a true scandal-creating,arrogant, spoiled Alastair that you can't help but like. Judith had turned a little more prudish that I would have thought for someone who used to take snuff and have a curricle race on the way to Brighton ( Regency Buck). Julian the quiet strength and as always a wonderful brother. Mary (Duchesse of Avon) her usual no-nonsense, practical self. Dominic is still my favorite Alastair. The tumultuous courtship between Barbara and Charles was what I would expect of an Alastair and an Audley...A note of warning: this is one of the sadder Heyer books. The second half of the book is poignant with a very realistic portrait of a society living in the middle of a war: partying in the middle of chaos, loosing dear friends to the senselessness of war, and finally the bitter-sweet end. I cried my eyes out in the last few chapters... a rarity when reading a Heyer!!!!I loved this book.

I was surprised that some people didn't even see the romance between Charles and Barbara. Let me say one thing I grew up in a war (Beirut-Lebanon)and every emotion that people experience in this book is for real. Giving parties, dancing, falling in love from the first sight, horrors of war, people without limbs etc.........It's all real. I just couldn't put the book down. Thanks God I have been living in USA for the past 17 years, but you never forget those crazy days. I give 5 stars although the book deserves million stars.

Ms. Heyer uses characters from previous books, \\"The Devil's Cub,\\" \\"Regency Buck,\\" and refers to characters from \\"These Old Shades\\" to build this enthralling romance that has no happy ending.Reading the four (her only series) is a visit with old friends, when you need a fix for good writing, strong characters, good dialogue, and a firm sense of a historical period.Nash Black, author of \\"Taxes, Stumbling Blocks and Pitfalls for Authors 2007\\" and \\"Qualifying Laps.\\""},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"The events surrounding the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 are so accurately researched and well presented that this book has been used in many history classrooms. The love story between &quot;Bad Bab&quot; Childe and Charles Audley is moving, but you get the feeling this is one Heyer couple that's not headed for &quot;happily ever after&quot;. Lady Barbara is an unusual heroine who shines during the darkest moments of war, but her capacity for self-absorption and cruelty when she is bored or offended would make her a mighty uncomfortable wife for the gallant and kind-hearted Colonel Audley."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I. Love. Georgette. Heyer. She rules. She rocks. Insert your soon-to-be-timeworn accolade here.No one else can capture the meeting of spirits and minds that constitutes the beginning of true love the way Heyer can. In (almost all of) her romances, when hero and heroine first speak to each other, you know, immediately, that these two people -- no matter how unalike they appear -- are two of a kind. Their love is inevitable.I've said all this, clumsily, because in \\"An Infamous Army,\\" Heyer makes almost every mistake in the romance writer's book. Let's count 'em.1. The heroine is too gorgeous to be true. Lesser writers commit this sin, but (normally) not Heyer. Every man wants her, and I do mean EVERY man. Yawn. In one scene, the heroine merely smiles at a man and he leaves the side of his pregnant wife to spend the evening in her company. Riiiiiiight.2. The hero falls in love with her instantly ... because she's beautiful, and ONLY because she's beautiful. Did I mention he's 35 and universally described as sensible? I guess he fooled them!3. The heroine is, for approximately 400 pages, selfish, capricious, ill-tempered and cruel. Yet we're supposed to root for her.4. The hero is, for more than 400 pages, content to stand by the heroine's selfishness and cruelty and, at times, even defend her. He iz stoopid.5. Most of the scenes that drive the romance plot are seen through the eyes of, not the hero, not the heroine, but the hero's sister-in-law ... who's already had her own book.6. Did I mention how mean the heroine is? When it comes time to throw the reader a bone -- c'mon, don't hate the heroine! -- the best defense a character can come up with is to TELL (not show) us that occasionally the heroine has visited a sick soldier, rather than go to a ball. Given the number of balls we do see her attend, she must have cloned herself back in 1815 to accomplish the sickroom vigils. We never see her being kind, or courteous, or considerate, or even rueful. Ever.7. Eventually, the hero has a falling out with the heroine. Go, hero! At this point you pray that Heyer will do something completely unexpected and find another heroine for Mr. Hero. And yet.8. The heroine has a moment of redemption, in which she nurses injured soldiers with little complaint. This is admirable. If she were halfway likable, you could buy this experience as being enough to mature her. But. Heyer even has a character observe, drily, that the heroine's redemption might well wear off, once the drama of the battle is over. Word. I mean: WORD! But then the hero comes back from battle, wounded, and goodgawdalmighty, he takes the beeeeyatch back.That was the sound of a book hitting Sheetrock.9. There's a subplot that is mishandled, too, not only in being so confusing you need a chart to name the players, but also in forcing several characters to behave nastily ... just when you really need them to not be nasty. Yes, the heroine is one of them.So. Heyer, the ultimate historical romance writer, really laid an egg with this love story.But the story of Waterloo, of Wellington and his staff and the battle itself, is very well-done, if you like that sort of thing."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This book is ASTONISHING! Both historically and as a novel. But do yourself a huge favour and go to this link and use it to refer to the battle plans as you read through the action of the battle.[I can't give you the link. It must be against the rules. Go to greatmilitarybattles.com and find the waterloo page and the battle plans.]You will not be sorry. Doing this, not only clarified exactly what was going on in the battle but it gives it a setting. It increased both my understanding and enjoyment of an incredible book.I actually printed off the first plan and kept it in my hand to refer to as I went. If they ever reissue this, I think they should add a print in the the inside cover.But don't just see this novel as a war book or think its just about a battle. There's so much to it than than that. I was put off reading it for years because of the subject, which is a shame. It deserves to be read. I thought it was an absolutely stunning piece of work, underpinned with a lovely relationship. I hope you won't miss it."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Georgette Heyer wrote a terrific history of Waterloo - so well done, in fact, that both Sandhurst (in the UK) and West Point (in the US) have used this book in their military classes. However, her popularity was largely for romances, and she inserts one here, which doesn't completely meld. If you like history, you may want to skip the fiction. If you like romance, you may want to skim past the battle details. If you like both, however, you will really enjoy this. A better work of Heyer's is \\"The Spanish Bride\\", which combines a true romance with the true military details of the Peninsular War. She has less difficulty joining the threads of that book, since the characters were real, and she took most of her information from their memoirs. As an aside, it is a mild pleasure to see the descendants or relatives of characters from other Heyer novels."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"A wonderful and accurate account of the Battle of Waterloo and evoking brilliantly the atmosphere in Brussels before, during and after the event. Heyer reintroduces characters from Regency Buck and Devil's Cub in a very realistic romantic story. The charming brother of the Earl of Worth, Charles Audley, falls heavily for Lady Barbara Childe, spoilt and headstrong grand-daughter of the Duke of Avon (Devil's Cub). Their story is anything but straightforward and is intertwined that of other characters both fictional and real. As usual Heyer's research is immaculate and the historical facts are seamlessly woven into the story. Like the Spanish Bride its really more of a history lesson than any of her other books but wonderfully done."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Since I read \\"These Old Shades\\" last year I have loved Heyer completely and have spent a small fortune acquiring her books. This, I have to say, was one of the rare disappointments. I suppose one could enjoy this book very much if one were interested in Wellington and the war. The book is very well researched and absolutely perfect in the war aspect. But for someone who picks up a Heyer to immerse herself in heady romance, it is bound to be a disappointment."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This is different from most of Georgette Heyer's novels. It's very heavy on historical details, historical people, battle scenes, etc. And, when a book gets into battle accounts, and troop movements, and strategic planning, my eyes start to glaze over, and I start skimming heavily. However, those details are such a huge part of the book, that I ended up skipping over much of it.And the relationships aspect of the book wasn't particularly strong. I enjoyed the character of Lady Worth, but I didn't find the romance between Lady Barbara and Colonel Audley that believable. They both fall for each other in relatively short order, despite the fact that they are very different people. The behavior Barbara engages in is often the type that Audley would find appalling, but somehow he sees that she's really good underneath, despite having had only a few minutes with her. I also had no real attachment to Lady Barbara with her general recklessness, selfishness, playing men off of each other, etc. I thought Colonel Audley deserved better. There were, however, some nice scenes and bits of dialogue, a strength of Heyer's.Still, unless you're a fan of battle descriptions, I wouldn't recommend this book. After you skip over those sorts of details, the romance left is only of so-so quality."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This is my first read by Georgette Heyer. I've heard a lot about her, and I mean a lot, both from the historical fiction and the historical romance readers I know. She is the favorite of many, many readers. I was expecting a lot, and the book didn't disappoint. It is, in fact, a pleasing mix of romance and historical fiction.Lady Barbara Childe is the female equivalent of a rake. She flirts with many men, but refuses to get married after her first atrocious attempt. Colonel Charles Audley, however, is determined, patient, understanding, and in love with Barbara. They quickly get engaged, but that isn't the end of the story, although it had me confused for a bit, wondering where they would go next. On the other hand, there is the lead up to the Battle of Waterloo. As one of the Duke's personal staff, Charles is bound to go to the fighting and a great deal of the book deals with the looming conflict and the battle itself.I definitely was immersed in the period while reading this book. The beginning was a little slow because it takes time to get used to a whole different world. Heyer never slips out of it, and while the book was written a good 70 years ago, I still think that's impressive. The characters surprised me and jumped out of the page; especially Barbara, who is incredibly compelling and understandable by the end, despite the fact that she is about as different from me as possible.The best part, however, was definitely Waterloo. The book alternates between Charles' family and the battle itself, giving us two viewpoints. Heyer does a brilliant job getting across the tension, the distress, and the complete alienation from the world that the patient loved ones are feeling. The battle scenes are astounding and even upsetting because the author puts you right into the army's shoes. This is historical fiction at its best, showing us what the past may have been like.So now I begin to understand why Georgette Heyer is so popular. I've got another of hers waiting in my TBR pile and I'll be on the lookout for more. Her books are being reissued, so this may not be too difficult. The lovely cover above is the result of this reissue."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"An Infamous Army is the story of General Wellington's successful routing of Napoleon Bonaparte in the battle of Waterloo. As Napoleon's troops make their way towards Brussels, General Wellington is having trouble obtaining solid and trained soldiers and enough ammunition and artillery to fight the battle successfully. Beloved by his forces, Wellington must direct and marshal the tactical forces over the countryside in order to overtake the French forces. In addition to those problems, he is working with various other military leaders and troops not under his command, and the effort to create a unified front is one of the major problems in this battle. The mood in Brussels, however, is one of excitement and merriment, as many of the English gentry are visiting Brussels, and fete's and dinners are the order of the day. Of the party going set, the most illustrious is the Lady Barbara Childe. Barbara, a young widow, is flamboyantly fashionable and out to take the city by storm. Both glamorous and ostentatious, Lady Barbara has her pick of men among the crowd, and is never without an admirer. Her bold behavior and extravagant flirting keep her name constantly on the lips of those around her. But Lady Barbara is not prepared for her unexpected feelings for Colonel Charles Audley, whom she meets at a party. Audley too is quite smitten with Barbara, and instantly proposes marriage, a situation which shocks and stuns their social set. Can Barabara put away her coquettish ways for Audley and make herself a true and devoted wife? As these questions loom, Napoleon advances, and the battle begins in all it's bloody glory. When all is said and done, many will be lost and injured, and all must look to the future in their newly changed circumstances, including Audley and Lady Barbara.Normally, I love historical fiction. I enjoy the enlightenment of discovering little known details surrounding historical events, and the glimpse into the lives of characters who have changed the course of history, even when they are slightly embellished. However, this book was not very enjoyable. The amount of detail, while impressive, was overwhelming. Some of the military tactical information and battle scenes seemed to go on forever, and the jump back to the events surrounding Barbara and Audley seemed too few and far between. I also disliked the minutia of the details. For example, there was a lot of information on the various colors and styles of the uniforms of the soldiers, which divisions had been deployed, and who was leading them. It was almost like reading a roster of names... very dry and lackluster. While I appreciate the amount of research that went into this account of Waterloo, it was very uninteresting and leaden. Perhaps if one were reading this as a history book, it would have been different, but I believe that the inclusion of the story of Barbara and Audley failed at the attempt to elevate this book into the realms of historical fiction. They seemed an afterthought, something pushed in to give the story some flavor to a rather dull military procedural. The book's tone was one of instruction, and rather than being interesting, it was instead informative.I also disliked Lady Barbara. I don't believe that in order to be a complex character you have to be cruel, but that's exactly what Lady Barbara was. She was very spoiled and recalcitrant, always pushing the boundaries of propriety just because she liked to make a spectacle of herself. Many times in the book she admitted to being an intolerable vixen, yet she shrugged it off and claimed that her behavior was something she enjoyed and would continue. If she had not made other's so uncomfortable and ill at ease I could have accepted that. However, she seemed to enjoy playing one man off another and disappointing her friends and family. In one scene she specifically begins to take interest in a man in order to take revenge on his wife for a small social slight. I found this to be repulsive and ill-bred. It was almost unbelievable that Colonel Audley felt so strongly for her, because he was the most gentlemanly and kind person in the book. I found them to be a bad match, and an implausible one as well. Barbara spent the book flitting off from one flirtation to the next, dropping each one as her interest waned. I did not believe that her behavior would change after circumstances were altered. She seemed flighty and her serious emotions were not believable, and I had no patience for her or her antics by the end of the book. I lost a little respect for Audley's character for being so blind to her shenanigans, and felt this portion of the book to be highly vexing.Although I didn't enjoy this book very much, I can see that it has its importance. Looking at it from a historical perspective, it is quite an accomplishment. The stellar research and the author's ability to keep all the specific information clear and well paced might be more appreciated by some who are fond of military history. Had the story been less focused on the battle and more focused on the periphery I would have enjoyed it more, and been better able to recommend it. As it was, this book was not really to my taste."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Great history, in its way a marvelous anti-war novel and, of course, the great Georgette Heyer romance at its best."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This book seemed to bog down. I know waterloo was a horrible battle and I learned some from this book, but for some reason the book dragged."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Heyer is the role model for Anya Seton and Philippa Gregory. and in that tradition, her characters are so well described that the reader can easily visualize them and feel empathy, disdain, or dislike as the author intended. The historical backgroud is rich and accurate. The only drawback might be that the language and dialogue might be a big awkward for readers not used to the speech patterns of the upper classes during this time period. I do encourage readers who find it so to persevere and perhaps reread a page or paragraph until the flow becomes more comfortable. I believe that after the war with Napoleon, this book was required reading for British military men as an example of how not to run an army or a campaign."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Very interesting book but a little hard going with all the Battle of Waterloo detail, which was certainly thorough and I learned a lot more than I previously knew"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Fictional and historical figures together to describe the Battle of Waterloo both from the military and civilian perspective. Readers of Georgette Heyer's other works will recognise some old friends as well.An excellent read!"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This is one of the best of Heyer's books in my opinion. I became so interested in the Battle of Waterloo that I searched and read several other essays on this topic. Heyer uses several quotes of Wellington's in the book. It is a very accurate account of the battle. It brings to life the human tragedy and the horrific toll taken on all that are caught up in the unfolding horrors of war. The first two books in the trilogy should be read first to develop an understanding for the Alastair family."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"A sweeping romance of Lady Barbara, fiery tempered grand-daughter of theDuke of Avon and one of Wellington's Aide-de-camp's, Charles Audley. Set against Napoleon's Hundred Days. A mere three months in Brussells which culminated in the battle of Waterloo.For confirmed Heyer fans this novel is the conclusion of two series. It winds up the affairs of the Dukes of Avon who we have read about through The Black Moth, These Old Shades, and Devil's Cub. And the affairs of the Earl of Worth's younger brother, first introduced to us in Regency Buck. An Infamous Army is the last time Heyer wrote a sequel. The book is immaculately researched and comes with a formidable bibliography of sources used. As Heyer was also best friends with Carola Oman, whose father Charles wrote one of the seminal works of the Peninsular War and Waterloo, she had impeccable sources at hand for this book.Many people might be put off by the long battle descriptions of Waterloo towards the end of thestory, if you aren't interested in military history then much of the detail can be fast forwarded through - although bear in mind that Sandhurst, that most British of officer training instituions has used Heyer's book as a study piece for this battle. This is no light-weight rehashing of the facts.I find myself torn by the this book. It is very good, and the story of Charles and Lady Barbara gripping - but the mix of the two styles - Historical battle description and fictional romance just doesn't work well for me. I find that I compare this book with MM Kaye's novel, The Far Pavillion's in which there is a long description of the seige at Kabul . I skim over that section whenever I re-read it - but you can't skim them completely, you see both books have two of the saddest events tucked away in the middle of the battle scence. Scenes which make me howl with tears each time I read them. In Kaye it is the death of Wally, in An Infamous Army there is an equally gut-wrenching death - but I won't tell you because it might spoil the book for you. Heyer deals with the event so well, it is stripped of pathos and false emotion.An Infamous Army was written in 1937, and shows all the strengths and weaknesses of Heyer's style. Her incredible attention to detail, her ability to blend various sources into a gripping story, and yet while the book is very good, it struggles between its desire to be a serious attempt to represent the battle of Waterloo, and its need to be a romantic novel.I find this conflict apparent in most of Heyer's Historic novels (Spanish Bride, Great Roxhythe, The Conqueror) It was really only her second to last attempt at a Historical novel, the following year, 1938, that I think she finally cracked the code. Royal escape sticks closely to the detail, and doesn't try to interweave too many fictional elements into it. In Spanish Bride, her last historical, a story of Harry and Juana Smith on the Peninsular, again I feel she suffers from historical detail overwhelming the story.Finally, I have always assumed that the character of Charles Audley is based on John Kincaid whose two memoirs - Adventures in the Rifle Brigade and Random Shots, Heyer used as sources for this book. Their natures, good-humour and general character are so similar. It is interesting that in An Infamous Army she has the two characters meeting up.If you do enjoy this book, then John Kincaid's two books have been republished and are available through Amazon - they are well worth reading and I think he is the best author to start reading - he is such good fun"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"but oh my gosh, it demands twice as many again! An Infamous Army is an incredible book. On one level, it is considered by Waterloo historians to be one of the most important texts ever written about the Battle of Waterloo and its aftermath; and actually used to be - I don't know if it still is - a compulsory read for all Army cadets and students of military history. And on another level, it features a passionate, outrageous romance between the lovely, scandalous Lady Barbara Childe - the ultimate of all Heyer's Bad Women - and Charles Audley, the handsome and dashing soldier. She is the descendant of the hero and heroine of Heyer's great 18th century melodrama, &quot;These Old Shades&quot;. He is related to the Earl of Worth in &quot;Regency Buck&quot;. Their blazing and passionate courtship sets this book almost on fire. Babs, brazen as her red hair, is definitely the most shocking of all Heyer's heroines. The book is full of character development set against a practically flawless reconstruction of the events surrounding 1815. Heyer handles tragedy, humour (ranging from the decorous to the deliciously vulgar), high emotion, dislike and distrust, arguments, and pathos, and a dozen other elements without the smallest suggestion of sentimentality. The only problem is that, if you are not a military buff, you may find the description of Waterloo hard to follow. But I just allow this wonderful book to flow past me, and have re-read it many times. Many critics consider this Heyer's greatest achievement, and I must agree. It blends her two main features - her humour and her historical accuracy - so that both stand on their own, yet complement one another. Along with Cotillion, a witty subversion of Heyer's own traditional Regency plots (I've also reviewed this book on Amazon); and The Grand Sophy, which was voted one of the top 400 Novels of the Millennimum recently; An Infamous Army shows Georgette Heyer at her best. If only all set books could be this enjoyable!"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I cannot believe that when I read reader reviews of Miss Heyer's work that I see numerous comparisons to Barbara Cartland! What an insult to one of the great writers of the 20th century. Cartland produced nothing but badly written attempts to rip off Georgette Heyer's work. I hope that during her lifetime Miss Heyer's sense of humor allowed her to bear it.\\"An Infamous Army\\",an account of Waterloo from the perspective of numerous old & beloved characters,along with some new ones, is,as always,true literature and highly recommended to anyone who appreciates fine historical writing. The accompanying love story is both tragic and joyous. You will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"This book is a must for anyone who likes both history and romance- and neither clean and neat. It's the story of of a difficult woman who's had a difficult life and a soldier who's had everything- but is not a wimp. An Infamous Army is still required reading at Sandhurst (the military school the English Royal family attend) and I infer at many other schools. It is an epic tale and pulls no punches. Some readers have problems with it because the protaganists seem so ill-suited; I think that that is worked out in the \\"third act.\\" I'll admit that the love story is secondary to the battle of Waterloo, but if you have any desire to understand that battle on a large scale as well as on the microscopic scale of the people involved, I, and Sandhurst apparently, can recommend nothing better. I think the romance works out well as a mature acceptance of eachother. Barabara is shocked into accepting life as is Charles- both accept and appreciate the other with warts and all. I didn't like this novel as a young girl nearly as I appreaciate it as an appreciatively older girl- and I think that makes the point."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I have read this book several times, and just finished another re-reading. For many years, I only read the romance, but gradually phased in more of the history. Generally I love historical fiction. Unfortunately (or fortunately), Heyer was such a meticulous historian that she had had trouble blending it with fiction. Parts of the book can be quite dry unless you are a Waterloo historian.I have mixed feelings about the romance. I agree with the other reviewer that it's hard to see Charles and Barbara living happily ever after. They are both vital, interesting people but so different in type. Partly, this is because their basis for falling in love is never well established. They meet at a ball, and suddenly the capricious Barbara and the seasoned Charles have found true love? They have little in common; no meeting of minds or common values to build on. It's hard to agonize over their love affair. I join Charles' friends in believing he'd be happier with Lucy.In the real world of the Regency, they'd probably have had an affair instead. Barbara being a widow would have made it acceptable, if they were discreet. But in Heyer's 1930's world it was not possible to explore that in romantic fiction.This brings me to a few plot points that always bother me. There is the quarrel that separates them, involving Harriet and Perry. Charles says he'd already asked Barbara to sheath her sword where Harriet was concerned. True, but he ignores the additional provocation Barbara was given. It seems he wants to marry a spoiled, strong willed, hot tempered woman, but expects her to change completely the moment they become engaged. How realistic is that? It always makes Charles seem slightly priggish, in that final quarrel, and I feel that Barbara gets more blame than she deserves.The other thing I dislike is the attitude of Judith and Barbara towards Lucy once her secret is revealed. They are both so superior and contemptuous, though Barbara has done things far more scandalous.Good points of the book include following the further story of the Alastairs and the Worths, both improved from their original stories. I particularly enjoy the Duke and Duchess of Avon. It is this, plus the vividness of the characters and story, that makes it re-readable, even if you have to suspend disbelief over the romance."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Red-haired, green-eyed, tempestuous Lady Barbara Childe was a devastatingly beautiful widow. Her reputation, well deserved, was scandalous. For her, one man was enough. Or two. Or three. She was the talk of every dazzling party, ball, and concert. On the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, Lady Barbara shocked everyone in Brussels by promising marriage to dashing young Colonel Audley. But Charles Audley was not like her other admirers. He was a man of considerable strength. And he was not about to tolerate Lady Bab's outrageous, seductive games. Bab, to her amazement suddenly found herself in love-and indanger of losing the one man who had ever touched her heart...Georgette Heyer is the Queen of Regency Romance and as with the rest of her books this one is wonderful.

I would also recomend her other book Spanish Bride for readers interested in this book."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I discovered this author only recently (mentionned in a book by my favourite author Susan Elisabeth Phillips). I love all the books that I have already read, though the \\"Grand Sophy\\" is my favourite. \\"An Infamous Army\\" is the last book of the Alastair Trilogy and a sequel of \\"Regency Buck\\" and I really enjoyed reconnecting with many characters from these previous books. I love the romance side of this more serious and historic novel, and though, as many readers have already mentionned, the historic details of the battle of Waterloo can be quite overwhelming and confusing for a non military buff like me, I was very drawn by the atmosphere that I felt from the description of the battle and the personnality and behavior of the different groups of soldiers mentionned. Also for anybody who has visited or lived in Brussels, it was quite interesting to read the descriptions and mentions of places that are now parts or suburbs of this big city.Because of some reviews, I nearly did not read this book, but I am very happy that I did and will be reading it again sometimes in the future."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Of the several historical romances by Heyer that I read prior to Infamous Army, I very much appreciated Heyer's attention to detail in accurately portraying language, manner and custom and in avoiding anachronisms. Her scholarship was evident in the quality of her work without her work feeling scholarly. Infamous Army, on the other hand, feels like a text book. Frankly, I think I skimmed well over half the book in order to get past the biographical presentation of Wellington and the historical presentation of the Battle of Waterloo. I suppose I should have paid better attention to the subtitle, for it accurately foretold what the novel principally contains: Wellington, Waterloo and war. It was not my favorite."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"An absorbing story of two families that Heyer has written about in earlier books, and the story of the battle of Waterloo. It seems incredible that so many of the characters were at a fancy ball that evening before, but Wikipedia has the list: see Duchess of Richmond's Ball.I also find the format of Sourcebooks publications, with larger type and better paper than the usual paperbacks, to be a pleasure to read. I will be ordering more of their books."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"I love this book, but if you're looking for a typical Regency romance, or even what most of her readers might expect from Georgette Heyer, you might want to look elsewhere. This is very heavy on the military history of the Battle of Waterloo, crowding out to some extent the humor and romance you might be looking for. This is a more serious book than many of her Regencies, although if you've read \\"The Spanish Bride\\" and enjoyed it, you'll probably like \\"An Infamous Army,\\" in that it has a similar approach to intertwining military history with romance. Also, if you've read \\"Regency Buck,\\" you'll run into some familiar characters from that novel."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"It's clear from this story that Georgette Heyer did her research. I've seen it written that the description of the battle of Waterloo was in fact used for teaching purposes as it's accuracy was that exact. It's interesting to see the characters before, during and after the war and how events change them.The pivotal characters, including Babs, are in Brussels at the start and really it's a home away from home for them, whiling their way through time with balls and dinners. The threat from Napoleon is there in the background but it's a vague threat, nothing that really impinges on life until it does. It's then that the characters discover more about their strengths and weaknesses and the brutality that is war.I would recommend this to anyone who dismisses Georgette Heyer, there is so much detail and interesting events in this that it's hard to know where to start praising it enough. The contrast between the frivolity of before the battle and the slaughter of the battle is well drawn. It's not my favourite of hers but it's almost a 5* story."},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"Spring and summer, 1815. It has been reported that Napoleon Bonaparte has left the isle of Elba and is marching down to France from the north. The Duke of Wellington and other commanders are gathering their armies to prepare for any potential attack, though most people think it will lead to nothing. The Duke describes his troops as an \\"infamous Army, very weak, and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced staff.\\" You can cut the tension with a knife. As Europe prepares for battle, Colonel Charles Audley, during his stay in Brussels, falls for Lady Barbara Childe, a beautiful widow with a questionable reputation. She is a flirt, has broken many hearts, which is why everyone is shocked when she accepts the colonel's marriage proposal. Audley is a penniless soldier, and everyone thought that she would go for a wealthy gentleman. As the Battle of Waterloo looms and the people begin to flee the premises, the lady and her brave colonel embark upon a journey of self-discovery all their own...I read this book about the same time as I reread Jane Austen's Emma, and I must say that it is difficult to pinpoint which one of the two I enjoyed reading the most. This is one of the best historical novels I have read in a very long time. Georgette Heyer describes Waterloo in such a way that you feel like you are there. She even describes the passage that Bonaparte takes in his effort to invade France. There is a main romantic plot centered on Lady Barbara and the Colonel, but the chapters that concentrate on the Duke of Wellington and the political affairs are much more fascinating. Put together, however, makes for a fascinating read. Georgette Heyer doesn't get enough credit for her novels. She -- like English contemporaries Daphne du Maurier, Mary Stewart and Anya Seton -- don't get the sort of praise that older novelists like Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte get. Yet they deserve it, including Heyer, whose work includes some funny Regency romances, some of which I've read, but had also written intelligent historical fiction and dark mysteries. An Infamous Army, first published in 1937, is the perfect novel for those who love the Napoleonic era. Cannot recommend this enough!"},{"Title":"An Infamous Army","review":"When I'm in the mood for light reading, I pick up a Heyer novel. However, this one took me a while to get into due to the need to establish historic figures.

Of course I've read and re-read all the prequals to this book so I know where the threads are from the previous works. But this is a stand alone work of glorious historical sweep.

It was hard to understand all the military planning and battle action. I needed to see diagrams and pictures. It was also hard to follow the various officers' names by listening as opposed to reading. I understand the author did a lot of research in order to be accurate about the \\"Battle of Waterloo.\\" The narrator spoke too fast for me which did not help.I may be off on my percentages but it feels like half the book is about a relationship between an army officer and a widow. The other half is about military planning and fighting the Battle of Waterloo. This is NOT for someone wanting interesting and fully developed romantic relationships. I never understood what they saw in each other. It was just instant attraction at first sight.Two characters in this story (Barbara and George) are the grandchildren of characters in Devil's Cub. You do NOT need to read that book in advance. This is definitely a stand-alone book.There is a mystery about Lucy and her love interest (a minor third story). I can't remember how that was resolved or even if it was. It needed more explanation - or it could be my own bad memory.STORY BRIEF:Colonel Audley sees Barbara at a ball and falls in love at first sight. Barbara is a notorious widow who is unlikeable, mean, vain, and spoiled. She is beautiful and loves to flirt. She falls for the Colonel as well, but her bad behavior causes problems. Lucy is sad and we don't know why until much later in the book. The Battle of Waterloo is the second story. Colonel Audley is part of the action.DATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 14 hours.

I had never heard of this movie but I had read Brownlow's amazing The Parade's Gone By and figured I could spend a few minutes flipping through the pages. The minutes turned into hours and I forfeited my studies to concentrate entirely on this book.Not only is it a very intersting and exciting account of two teenagers growing up as they try against all odds to make a historically accurate film for no money, but it also addresses issues such as the artist's responsibility to be honest to his subject and what lengths are neccessary to acheive it.A great autobiographical account, I would highly suggest this book for other film students planning their own films, as well as those interested in film history or the work of Kevin Brownlow.

It's a sweet moniker, but misleading to those who may not have yet read Bennett. Insightful and compassionate with a wit so sharp it effectively amputates sentimentality, this is a Teddy Bear with laser eyes and sharp claws that are only just retracted.Bennett's character sketches in Talking Heads are devastating. The grown man whose safe little existence begins to unravel as he discovers his dear old mum has taken a lover, the vigilent, upright busybody who ends up in prison for invading her neighbor's privacy, the widow of &quot;Soldiering On&quot; whose emptiness of purpose is revealed through her inability to grieve--each uncomprehending character Bennett has created in these astonishing soliloquies is undone by his or her brave and steadfast unwillingness to acknowledge the bare-knuckled truth of human emotion.Bennett is not cruel in revealing the weaknesses of his characters, but he is uncompromising in revealing those weaknesses. This is the Teddy Bear who brings to the picnic the sharp knives that cut through the bread and fat prepared and packaged by his companions.Also recommended are Bennett's Writing Home, The Clothes They Stood Up In, and any and all of his other plays, particularly The Old Country; and, for those who just must have the soft and fuzzy version of the Teddy Bear, listen to Bennett's reading of Winnie the Pooh, or go see his stageplay of The Wind in the Willows."},{"Title":"Complete Talking Heads (Radio Collection)","review":"I suppose I am a bit biased because I grew up in the same town as Alan Bennett (Leeds, Yorkshire) but this book is truly remarkable. The characters are a mixture of people we all know. A chip in the sugar is the man who lives down the street, A lady of Letters is always in the post office (usually in front of me !). All these people exist, what Alan Bennett does is drag them out of their lives and our heads and put them there in front of us. We may read about them and dismiss them as characters in fiction but they all exist and in most cases there's bits of them inside each of us. Thanks Alan Bennett for entertaining us and teaching us at the same time."},{"Title":"Complete Talking Heads (Radio Collection)","review":"I can't believe I'm the first person to review this masterpiece! Maybe it's because Bennett seems so very British, English even, that he's not appealled to American readers. I'm sure you're missing something worth having.Bennett is a masterful observer of character and the six monologues gathered in this collection all display strong characters revealled with a sharp eye and a compassionate heart. Bennett is witty and controlled in his approach, allowing his characters to reveal themselves and their foibles subtley. I find these little tales deeply moving as well as funny, despite the apparently mundane subjects he's dealing with.I can't think of a comparison to make to illuminate his style, especially since monologue is very rarely seen these days. I can see an affinity to A. Maupin and R.Rodi in terms of waspish observations of people and their social milieu. Bennett's characters aren't blatantly queer like Maupin's or Rodi's, they're not young and tre! ndy things either, but Bennet's own sensibilites and sensitivities give queer readers pause for thought, especially about the older, isolated members of society.He takes us right inside the heads of six very ordinary people and lays bare their lives, their self-delusions and their petty snobberies in their own words. The texts were originally written as television plays and were broadcast on the radio by the BBC too, however, they work perfectly well on the page, rather like short stories. Why not try it and see for yourselves!"},{"Title":"Complete Talking Heads (Radio Collection)","review":"(This review refers to The Complete Talking Heads in the Kindle edition available when reviewed. It is possible that corrections have since been made.)Bennett's little character studies are wonderful. The best way to enjoy them is through the recordings of the original broadcasts, performed by topnotch actors. They are also now available complete in a single paperback. The Kindle edition is a slightly cheaper alternative but it is, sadly, a case of getting less than you pay for.It's a mystery to me how, in this age of digital files, the text of a work can become mangled in its progress from one format to another. The Kindle edition contains hundreds of typos, most of them missing spaces between sentences. Clearly the text was run through software to change straight quotes to curly quotes, and the missing spaces have confused the algorithm so that many of the quotes are curling the wrong way. Also \\"Go to Beginning\\" takes you to a point in the middle of the book, and the navigation marks are incomplete.One gets used to this sort of thing in free public-domain e-books, but it's very disappointing to see it in a commercial product, especially when it costs almost as much as the printed version.I'm aware, by the way, that I'm sounding a bit like the Lady of Letters as I write this. ;-)"},{"Title":"Complete Talking Heads (Radio Collection)","review":"There are few things that are more enjoyable than a rainy afternoon and this collection of character sketches on the IP. It is very easy to draw a picture of a person in crisis in the context of a two hour play; it is another thing entirely to carry out the same within the space of 30 minutes. These radio programs feature, for the most part soliloquies by people facing any number of personal crises from ill relations (in both senses of the word), trouble with the law and realization that their spouses were not quite what they might have been on first inspection.I have to confess to a few favorites. \\"Bed Among the Lentils\\" is the story of a bored vicar's wife who finds the satisfaction that her life with a man of God has not provided in dry sherry and an the Indian owner of the off license. God is a business much like anything else. Ultimately she is disappointed by both and has to go through life as a prop in her husband's rise in the clerical hierarchy as he shamelessly exploits his wife's problems to show he has the compassion he clearly lacks. God is a business, just like agricultural machinery.\\"Soldiering On\\" is the story of an upper-class woman whose husband dies and by inches her world dissolves. Curiously she manages to keep up a brave front, finding solace in television and a walkman. This ultimately makes her story far more compelling than had Bennett allowed her to dissolve into histrionics\\"Her Big Chance\\" is the story of an actress who, as the reader gradually learns, has taken work in a soft core pornographic film. The fact that she insists on maintaining a certain air of professionalism and dedication to her \\"craft\\" makes this all the more hilarious.These stories are, like most of Bennett's work, inspired compositions. One can only look forward to future efforts from this quarter."},{"Title":"Complete Talking Heads (Radio Collection)","review":"I was lucky enough to see the original broadcasts of these mini-plays in the UK in early 1989, and I found a copy of the telescripts at Foyle's and snapped if up. For the uninitiated, these pieces aren't just monologues, they're little separate worlds, each peopled by one character who tells his/her story. In \\"Her Big Chance\\", Leslie (a sparklingly ditzy, yet deeply innocent Julie Walters) tells us how exciting and \\"really interesting\\" it's been, working on a big film (as \\"Topless Girl #2, it turns out). \\"Are we on cans, Roger, I said, because if we are, I'd just like some direction...\\" Deluded but optomistic, she sits, all dolled up and thrilled, waiting for the call to stardom that will never come, while the crew is out on the bay filming \\"establishing shots\\".In \\"A Cream Cracker Under the Setee\\", an elderly woman who's fallen and can't get up, muses on her now-dead husband, and conceives of the notion--as plain to us as her predicament--that she tidied herself out of a marriage.My favorite, \\"Soldiering On\\", is told in the jaunty, bucked-up words of a comfortable Home Counties matron whose husband's just died, and whose son, Giles, has kindly taken over the finances: \\"No can do, mummy, we must tighten our belts!\\" A year later, in a boarding house, she admits, sheepishly, that \\"I suppose Giles has been a bit of a scamp--\\". Meanwhile Margaret, her lumpish, virtually catatonic daughter, has for some reason blossomed after her father's death. Then the other shoe drops...\\"How do I feel? Sorry for her, of course. Sorry for HIM, too, come to that...\\"And then, holding up a Walkman: \\"This is my new toy! I get tapes from the lending library in the High Street. And I'll listen to anything. No fear....Fan!\\"And then: \\"I wouldn't want you to thing I'm a tragic woman. I'm not the type...\\"Maybe I've quoted Bennett wrong--my copy's still packed away from the last move. There are several other \\"stories\\"--some funny, some apalling, but all laced through with gentle pathos, and a very BRITISH knowledge of some very universal foibles.

The series was first written for television, I believe for a BBC series; in each episode, a single character, placed in a small variety of settings, speaks directly to the camera. Each story consists of one character discussing an episode or series of related episodes in his or her life; the interesting part (and the part that makes this so great for teaching) is that we hear only one character's perspective, and so need to evaluate his or her credibility and level of self-awareness; often, we also need to attend to small cues to figure out the whole story.

Tolstoy is of course a great and complicated figure whose two masterpieces ' War and Peace' and 'Anna Karenina ' stand at the summit of world - fiction. Gifford tells the story of the landowner, patriarch Tolstoy whose vision of a better world was somehow rooted in the social thought of the eighteenth century. He tells of how Tolstoy made at the center of his vision of community, the ideal of the family. He reads 'War and Peace' in his brief chapter on the subject as a work in which personal connections and relations are always made in terms of family connections. He underlines the uniqueness of Tolstoy's social vision, and his great loneliness in pursuing it. He does not however really begin to explain the miracle of Tolstoy's powerful presentation of reality, his incomparable capacity to make the physical and social worlds come to life.

For some reason, for example, the authors feel compelled to follow the elegant and simple statement that \\"gross income means all income from whatever sources derived\\" with endless, often monotonous exceptions.Significant parts of this work are relevant only to those with special interests, while other parts are likely to be universally appreciated (or depreciated, as the case may be). While often eminently practical, there are times when the authors become incredibly vague (they never seem to define \\"ordinary and necessary\\", for example, yet insist on using the phrase an inordinant number of times) and other times when they become downright mystical (for example, they spend some time, particularly in the accompanying regulations, talking about \\"disregarded entities\\").Still, despite its flaws, I'd recommend that everyone read this book.

But what I got was an extremely flexible campaign saver. Are your villains more stupid than evil? Are the suspense parts not really suspense, but boredom? Use these great examples in this book. They can be adjusted perfectly for your camapaign and setting (some seamlessly, some... eh... not quite) Every villain has an &quot;alternate-setting&quot; version, and a couple of adventures that could spawn off him. This book includes everything, since the &quot;low-key&quot; thug that appears in every adventure to &quot;evil syndicates&quot; that span all over the globe. Very handy.The illustrations in this book are one of the greatest in any RPG book you'll ever find. There are many variations, and it has to be seen to be believed. Every chapter has it's own mini-covers with various photographs in it. They really add to the theme of the book. Great job. I look forward to seeing this style in more Gurps books.However, the only flaw I could find here is that there aren't enough tips on how to make your OWN villain. Sure, there are two pages or so every chapter, but quite honestly, that's not enough. And there are some worlds that aren't covered either by the &quot;alternate-setting&quot; section or the main settings. Sure, some of the more &quot;obscure&quot; settings are covered (Bunnies and burrows, etc...) but many rather interesting books aren't (Russia, Aztecs, etc...)So all that I want to say is that if there is one thing would radically improve this book, is increasing it's size, putting more villains and more details into making your very own.Highly reccomended.

Kim Kyung-hyun's The Remasculinization of Korean Cinema is the most theoretically sophisticated to appear so far, and is must reading for all crit-theory heads wondering what the hell has been going on in South Korean society in the past few decades--especially on the big screen, which has been dominated by brooding, raging men for quite some time now.Kim's focus is on the works of directors of the New Korean Cinema such as Park Kwang-su, Jang Sun-woo, Hong Sang-soo, Lee Chang-dong and Im Kwon-taek. The book's central argument is that the &quot;master narrative&quot; of the New Korean Cinema as it evolved from the start of the 1980s to the new millennium has been to trace a shift from portrayals of ineffectual males defined by phallic lack and a penchant for masochism to &quot;post-traumatic males&quot; struggling to recuperate a resplendent, emerging subjectivity who are often violent and sadistic. In layman's terms, I guess this means that if you're a Kim Ki-dok protagonist, beating the crap out of your woman is a way of finding or own inner Iron John, or whatever.Overall, I liked this book and found it provocative. It is something of a cliche by now to complain about the misogyny of Korean cinema; it's almost like complaining that the sky is blue. This book offers a close and quite sympathetic examination of WHY so many of these men are misogynistic in the first place, which is a productive, positive approach to a very unproductive, negative problem.Kim often deploys psychoanalytic theory and concepts in tackling these issues, which I have no problem with, except to say that I wonder if the Western concepts developed by Freud, Lacan et al are so universal, and so neatly applied to Eastern societies; this is not a question that Kim cares to ask, nor one that I can answer myself, either.My problem with Kim's approach is that the use of psychoanalytic terms and concepts is often rushed and cursory. Too many times, statements like &quot;this is an example of fetishistic disavowal&quot; or &quot;this is an instance of a desire for a return to the preoedipal stage&quot; are made, without saying more clearly WHY or HOW it is an example of fetishistic disavowal, etc. One wants more lucid clarification and application of the theory, lest the text begin to appear gratuitous in its use of jargon and complex terminology. Not everyone reading this book will have completed graduate seminars on Lacan, and even if they have there is no excuse for laziness here.I also have to question Kim's overly selective approach in presenting and analyzing the &quot;master narrative&quot; of the New Korean Cinema. It often seems that films were left out that might undermine the overarching thesis. According to Kim, there is no space in New Korean Cinema for female subjectivity to explore and represent itself outside of a subsidiary relation to males, but this is just not true. A film like Girls' Night Out (1999), for instance, explores the sexual subjectivity of three modern Korean women from their own perspectives. I also found a certain high-brow disdain for popular or overly commercial films in the book, which is also limiting. A film like My Wife is a Gangster (2001), while indeed &quot;crassly commercial,&quot; offered a fresh, original way of presenting one modern, independent woman's struggle to balance life in the public world of work with the demands of the private world of home. Indeed, most of the films discussed in this book are art-house auterurist works; a more complex analysis of the state of Korean film in the '80s and '90s might have been less condescending towards and dismissive of such &quot;low-brow&quot; fare.Then there are the more curious omissions, like the films of Kim Ki-dok or Jang Sun-woo's Lies, which offer rich material for the subject at hand. On closer reflection, though, Jang's Lies perhaps undermines Kim's overall argument. After all, if the male protagonist in the film displays overt masochistic tendencies, is this a regression to the male masochism of the early '80s that supposedly had been overcome by the late '90s, or is Jang offering an alternate view: liberating the male protagonist from his own domineering male subjectivity entirely--at the hands of an 18-year-old woman, no less?The exclusion of the films of Kim Ki-dok and others is explained by the fact that they were made too recently to be included. How can crucial films made in 1999 or 2001 not be included in a book published in 2004? Is academia really that slow? I might also note that a book that complains about the lack of female directors in South Korea has no right to do so when it ignores a film like Yim Soon-rye's Three Friends (1996), an early notable exception to the rule of male directors in the New Korean Cinema. But again, a closer look at Three Friends may have undermined the book's argument further, since the three male protagonists are also quite ineffectual and reminiscent of the &quot;weak&quot; male characters of the early '80s. Yet in Three Friends, this is viewed as positive and liberating, rather than a denial of full male subjectivity; indeed, one of the characters enters a gay relationship at the end, which offers a subversive contrast to the dominant (and male-dominated) heterosexuality of the extremely patriarchal New Korean Cinema.In others words, this is a heady book that falls just short by complaining of a lack of sexual and gendered diversity in Korean cinema, yet is guilty of suppressing such diversity somewhat itself. Even now, Korean cinema is undergoing profound, radical changes in its representations of gender and sexuality. I look forward to a sequel to The Remasculinization of Korean Cinema that examines all these current diverse changes as provocatively and intensely as it has done here."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Above all books The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, by C.S. Lewis has been the most breath taking book I've ever read. Although this book is at a 5th grade level in my opinion it is enjoyable for all ages! There are many unusual characters. The key characters are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who are brothers and sisters, Aslan, and many more. Peter is the oldest and happens to be bossy to his younger siblings. Susan is ladylike and Edmund is rude and mean. You will find in this book Edmund lies to many people. Lucy, on the other hand, is kind and thoughtful. The king of Narina, whose known as Aslan, is powerful and kind to people who are kind to him. Many, many more characters are included.In the beginning of this book the setting is in England and then it wanders off to Narina. The adventure starts when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy move in with Professor. Lucy soon discovers Narina in a wardrobe during her attempt to hide while playing Hide-and-seek. Lucy tells her siblings about her discovery but no one believes her. Finally they go in the wardrobe and find out that Lucy is telling the truth. Then they meet extraordinary beavers who are husband and wife. These beavers built an amazing house in the kingdom of Narina. What's so different special about them? You'll have to read the book or see the movie to find out the truth. Something tragic happens to Aslan! Also something amazing happens to Lucy and her siblings. In this story the White Witch wants to keep the humans so she can be the Queen of Narina. Do you want to know who the White Witch is? Too bad you'll have to read the book.The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was a fast read. This is so because I got so interested in it that it took me two days to read. I loved it. Not everyone like fantsay but this tale is not like Harry Potter, not at all. Even my teacher likes it. Not everyone likes Harry Potter but maybe everyone will like The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Although this tale was rather long, it would only be an to the story to make it have a longer and add more details, because I want it to take me more than two days to read it. In my opinion The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a great book and is easy to get interested in. Read or you will be sorry that you didn't."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Two thumbs way up for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe! I see a lion! I see a witch! I see a fawn! It's cold and snowy, animals are talking. Where am I? Narnia of course! The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a thrilling fairytale. Edmond, Peter, Lucy and Susan travel into a wardrobe, hiding from the professor. While in the wardrobe they suddenly are in a world of wonderful beauty, from crystal white snow and strange creatures to centaurs and talking beavers. This thrilling book takes you away to a new land not yet discovered my mankind. The daughters and sons of Adam and Eve will face trials, hardships, and fight the all time battle against the White Witch.This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is adventurous. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe keeps you reading and makes you say, \\"What will happen next?\\" This book is one book that will leave an impression of dreams in your mind. If you read this book you will want to read the whole series."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I usually greatly dislike fantasy but I really thought that this novel, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" was interesting. The introduction of this novel was also one of the parts I thought it was interesting because of how the main character enters another part of the world and found that she had a gift. This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has. Instead of using magic like the White Witch does in Narnia, the teenager in, \\"Hatchet\\" gets his resources manually, not magically. Like all fantasy books and adventure books, the protagonists usually find that the have a specialty or a gift. I recommend this book, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" to people who likes magical places, and magical powers. People who read this novel should also like the genre, fantasy with characters that do not exist in real life. I do not recommend this book to people who are not into magical powers, or magical places."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis, the author, calls the book I have read The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. This book is about 4 young children whose names are Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy who stumbles into a mysterious world called Narnia. This world is found in an old wardrobe in their house. How they discovered this pace was when Lucy and her other brothers and sisters were playing hide and go seek and Lucy decided to hide in this old wardrobe they had found. She stared to move back into it and she noticed that there was no back to it. She kept on moving farther and farther into the wardrobe and still she could not find the wall. She started to feel weird about this until she saw a light. She ran towards the light and it was actually a lamppost. She had also noticed that there was snow on the ground and that she was in the middle of a forest! She could not believe her own eyes. Then a creature that had a body of a man and a goat came up to her and it started to talk to her. It invited her to his home. His house was a cave but it had a fireplace and candles and stuff like that. The creature told Lucy all about Narnia. Then after the creature was done she had decided to return home. When she got back home threw the wardrobe she told her brothers and sisters. They did not believe her. She got upset because they all thought she was lying. Then Edmund went into the wardrobe to see if she was telling the truth. What did Edmund see? Was Narnia really there? Was Lucy making all this up? Here are just some questions that the book gives you and the only way to find out more about it is that you will just have to read it!I liked The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe a lot. I think this book was exciting to read because of how everything was so unique of what any other stuff I have read. I also liked it because there were fights in it. I could not really feel like I was in the book because some of the descriptions were not very clear as some other books I have read. Also the characters were not really that well detailed. The main conflict did interest me, even if I could not feel like I was not in the book, because I liked the idea of how some one was trying to take back his kingdom and I also liked it because there was a couple of really cool battles in it. I thought the characters did not seem that realistic because the author did not describe the characters as well because he pretty much just gave basic information about each one of them. I thought the books' ending was satisfying but the author seemed to me like he was trying to rush the ending. The ending didn't really make sense but besides that I think the book was good though.I think the author had a voice in a more little childish sort of voice. Like he would not give away the cool parts like heads being chopped off. The author did use a very large vocabulary but he did include monsters that I have never heard of like something called a wraith. I thought the author had absolutely no uniqueness to his writing but I think he made a very unique plot. Some unique characteristics of his writing is that he would say stuff like \\" I can not tell you any more of how these creatures looked like because they would be to hideous for the readers.\\" I thought the dialogue in this book was okay compared to other books I have read. I think this book was more set to younger people, so that's why the dialogue is not very good to me because its it kind of immature to me. I think this author did a really good job with the plot but needs to work on more description, but over all I thought the book was very unique.I think this book is an all right book. I think this book is more for younger people around 12 and younger. This book is a very easy read. Also this book is good for boys and girls. Finally I would rate this book an 8 out of 10.The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is a a pretty good book. I admit that I have read better books but this is a good book if you are looking for a easy and a pretty fast read. I personally think this book is more set for younger kids maybe around the age of 10. I liked this book because of how unique it was. It was unique because of all the different types of monsters it had like trolls, wraiths, goblins, centaurs, and much more. I also liked this book because it was really easy to understand. Finally I liked this book because it did have a few good fighting scenes like the battle with Peter against a wolf captain. This book deserves an 8 out of 10 because of how its really unique but it is also set for younger kids."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"It thought this book was a very good book.

The four kids have wonderful adventures, and learn about themselves and their siblings.I think that C.S. Lewis did an excellent job with this book. He made this story his own, not elaborating off anybody else's. He used imagery, symbolism, and personification to make the book interesting. The plot and story line is like none other I've read.

It wasn't the first, and it certainly wasn't the last, but it was the best. It just pulls you in, and you can't get out. Once you start, you will probably end up reading half of it in one sitting. From the first page, you are totaly envelloped in Narnia. You forget completely about the outside world. Once you read it, it becomes the book by which all others will be judged for the rest of your days. And trust me, its very hard to beat. I would reccomend it to ANYONE, whether they like fantasy or not, it is truly a study in good writing (the understatement of the 21st century). The religious undertones and the author's subtlty of sugestion leave the upmost room for interpretation. Getting others to read it will undoubtedly lead to endless discussions about the significance of Aslan an a god-like leader, or of the so obvious, yet hidden play between good and evil. Be warned.

I agree with those people who say the series should be read with &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot; as book 6 - luckily for me, even though they'd rearranged the books by the time I read them (how idiotic) I ended up reading them in the right order cos I couldn't find a copy of &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot; until after I read &quot;Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;! I think there is a lot more feeling of things being explained at the right times if the books are read in the order C S Lewis intended them to be read in, but whatever order they're in, they all still give an incredible feeling of magic waiting just round the corner. Even though I'm old enough now to see the the religious allegory in the book, I'd really rather not.It's a clever way of explaining Christianity to children, but for me seeing it as a religious allegory takes a little of the wonder away from it.

Will they follow the mighty and wise Aslan or fall into temptation from the White Witch?The book is a fantasy/adventure, set in England around the 1950's. One thing the author did in this book that I liked was he used forshadowing toward the beginning which really maked the book more interesting along the way. He also used outstanding detail to describe the look and feel of Narnia: so realistic that even though you know it's a fantasy, it feels real, as if you're there with the kids. He also uses a very 'real' tone, like the author is having a conversation with you about the story. This book is the second book of a seven book series.I particularly didn't enjoy the book, simply because it isn't \\"my type of book\\", but if you are someone who loves fantasy, adventure, suspense and some action, you'll be hooked!

These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", to be quite honest, is my least favorite of the Narnia books. While it is the most well known book in the Narnia series and seems to receive the most adaptations, for this reader it is also the weakest. While my personal prejudice against the book may seem unjustified, I will go into detail on why it is this book does the least of all the books for me. However, do not think that I despise the book. Some of the individual scenes are my favorite in the series, including the meeting of Tumnas and Lucy and much of the actual world of Narnia. The scene with the professor stands out as well, as do others, including Edmond and the scene with the White Witch and her devilish Turkish Delight.The chief fault I have with this is the overly explicit Christianity in this book. The Chronicles represent very fundamental Christian faerie tales, and generally Lewis embodies Christianity with a very good story. For me, however, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" ceases to be good story and just mere allegory. I think of the Chronicles as something of magic themselves, and the spell of the series are the excellent stories that also have great Christian truths. The death of Aslan for the sake of Edmond totally ruins this spell for me. Again, this is personal taste.To best describe what I'm talking about, I will give you my personal view on why the series itself is good. Lewis, while always writing from the Christian standpoint, keeps first and foremost the story in mind. Christianity underlies it all, but the most important element is the story itself. Readers do not like to be preached at. If you tell a good story that has exhibits various elements of Christianity as its theme but keep the story original, that is a good faerie tale. Here, Lewis starts that and then stops that at the end and has Aslan die for Edmond. It would have been fine had the parallel not been so blatantly obvious. For me, it makes me lose focus of the story and concentrate on the Christianity solely. Still, it's like Lewis decides to make it very explicit what he is talking about instead of sticking to the less obvious.Another element that alienates this book from me is the inclusion of Father Christmas. I cannot specifically put my finger on it, but for some reason he does not sit well with me. We have this beautiful new world of Narnia, and here it's always winter and never Christmas. Why would they have Christmas in the first place? Again, I understand Father Christmas can represent the Holy Spirit, etc, and put it on the level that children will definitely relate too, but even when I was little I had an immediate dislike to this inclusion in the story.While the slain god myth is an essential archetype, it just does not work for me in this story. I would have rather Lewis come up with a more ingenuity and have a different way for Aslan to redeem him. How is the ultimate question. But he did do this with Eustace in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\". While that may seem to be a rather harsh reaction to the opening book of the Narnia series, it was my initial reaction, and when rereading it, I am still of this opinion. Again, I recognize this is personal taste, and \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is certainly deserving of its acclaim.For myself, the explicit Christianity ruins the otherwise flawless faerie tale atmosphere Lewis creates in this tale. Lewis does not violate my own personal aesthetics of endowing a story with Christianity without making the story seem bogged down with Christian elements in the series again with the exception of \\"Dawn Treader:. Every other story in the series the Christian themes but does not, in the end, breaking the spell of the faerie tale. It just feels like in LWW he starts preaching at us. But what do I know. It is probably the most popular of the seven books.\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", a book I very dearly love, only breaks the spell at the very end and only as part of a comment from Aslan to the children. While certainly Christianity (i.e., a relationship with God) is the most important thing, for myself it brings down the story when Lewis has Aslan say that he brought the children to Narnia so that they may know him better in their own world. I guess it is meant to give hope to the children reading it that they will one day know Aslan, and it is certainly a worthy inclusion for the book, but I still feel, when I read it, that that is a little to explicit for me. The story ceases to be story and becomes just regular Christian doctrine, and while certainly we need Christian doctrine a story should be, first and foremost, a story. However, Lewis's intent besides the story was to win souls to Christ, and if Narnia help does that, then ultimately that is more important than trivial literary concerns.You can tell this is the first one he wrote and that originally there was no thought of a series. There are several contradictions in between this and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", which include the ancestry of the White Witch and the belief that there have been no human beings in this world. Originally Lewis tried to stay true to this premise but Roger Lancelyn Green told him cut this long scene between a ploughman and his wife in another world and Lewis took his advice and instead went with this concepts. Another case of this not being originally intended as a series is when asked about the story from Coriakin's book, Lucy is spoken of in the present tense, indicating she is still alive. Even Prince Caspian adheres to the original concept of the idea that there were no humans in Narnia at the beginning. Another element that, although working in the self-contained book that Lewis originally meant LWW to be, seems rather awkward to this reader is the professor. He is never named in LWW, but is so in MN. Father Christmas doesn't seem to fit either.This passage from \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" where White Witch is demanding the life of Edmund because he has betrayed the children and Aslan to the White Witch is one of Lewis's most overt allusions to Christianity in the series. Aslan makes the sacrifice. This also illustrates the fact that evil was not there in the beginning. The White Witch did not know the great magic from before the world's foundation. There were rules and ordinances that were not made known to the angels. Pride also blinds, because when Satan fell, he thought the crucifixition would truly solve the problem with Christ and his ministries. Jadis also thought this as well, that she would triumph in the end. Both were proud and glorified in their evil. Their belief is placed in the wrong deity.Lewis uses the colour white in the cold, wintery sense rather than white symbolising purity. The White Witch has put Narnia in a spell, freezing Aslan's land into a continuos winter than cannot be broken until two kings and two queens from the human race come to seat at Cair Paravel. The white is sickening and represents the cruelty. Ironically, Lewis reckons her colour as that of salt, which precisely what she is not. Salt is a natural preservative and adds flavour to the food, but the White Witch only ruins and destroys and perverts. Jadis, who also appears in \\"The Silver Chair\\", uses the natural colour perverts it into the evil. Green often has been associated with the spring time. In \\"The Silver Chair\\", we find her as the Green Lady. She directs the children and Puddleglum to the giants of Harfang. Here, she appears to be a rather mysterious woman, but she shows her true colours in the Underworld. Jadis, just as she used the white as a perverted colour, here she uses green in her underground kingdom, because here that colour will never come. Spring cannot come to the Underworld, and if her plans would go through, she, like she did in Charn, would destory the world. Green, that vibrant colour of life, is chosen by her to mock spring.Although the winter is an unnatural one, the attitude the characters show for it is part of the pathetic fallacy. From Wikipedia: \\"The pathetic fallacy is the treatment of inanimate objects as if they had human feelings, thought, or sensations. The word 'pathetic' in this use is related to 'pathos' or 'empathy' (capability of feeling), and is not pejorative. In the discussion of literature, the pathetic fallacy is similar to personification.\\" When spring comes to Narnia, they all rejoice for the characters feel so much happier now that the winter is lifting. This also occurs in The Silver Chair with Scrubb and Pole. Jill thinks of the edge as being horrible simply because it is high, which is quite an odd attitude to take. If, by your very nature, you are skilled in mathematics and another person is not and they say. You are black or white or yellow or whatever, this colour has nothing to do with what you are like as a person. If the water is cold and someone says they love water when it is cold because it is so good, but it is bad when it is hot, that is pathetic fallacy. Cliffs are not bad or good - they're just cliffs and that is all.Although a worthwhile book, as I've explained I like the other Narnia novels much better than this one. Tolkien likewise did not like this book for many of the same reasons. He once wrote to a correspondent George Sayer, saying \\"It is sad that 'Narnia' and all that part of C.S.L.'s work should remain outside the range of my sympathy, as much of my work was outside his.\\" Tolkien thought the mixture of various fairy tale motifs quite absurd. Obviously the reading public has adored these books, and they are established literary classics, so if you haven't read LWW, give it a chance. You may have a completely different view than myself and just love the work. For myself, the other Narnia novels are so much better...------------------------------[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The five works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complications if you do not do it his way.Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomaly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\"."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"this book is awesome.i just finished reading it and i'm very proud of myself.i hpe you read this book. the only thing is that it isn't as good as the movie.i saw it the other day when it was on \\"stars\\".well i got to go to my next class. smell ya later aligator!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is quite an enjoyable book, which is considered a classic by most fantasy connoisseurs. Being that I began my journey into the world of fantasy with reading the Harry Potter books, I did not grow up with The Chronicles of Narnia like many of us have.After seeing the movie version of this book, I decided to read these books in chronological order (starting with \\"The Magicians Nephew\\"), and my first journey in Narnia was a pleasant one. When I picked up the second issue of The Chronicles of Narnia, the renowned classic \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" I was interested to see if it lived up to the constant praise it received.Again I insist, this book is very enjoyable-- it is not, in my mind, worthy of being called a classic. Narnia is a refreshing world that is beautifully described... when Lewis takes the time TO describe it, that is. This book could have easily spanned 300 or more pages, but instead it is crammed into 189 pages, which do not have enough room for the words needed to thoroughly describe the beautiful world of Narnia. The characters suffer as well, for we hardly get to know any of them or their motivations, and the climatic battle of Aslan's army against the White Witch's lasts for only about one page! This may be the only time this sentence will ever apply, but the MOVIE has a great amount more detail then the book, and allows you to get to know the characters much better.However, I am not saying this is a bad book. While Lewis's use of the word \\"presently\\" becomes so often that it grows to be annoying, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and I plan to keep reading The Chronicles of Narnia in hopes to one day have the whole collection. I definitely do recommend this book, but I also warn the readers not to expect a classic like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.While I don't enjoy Lord of the Rings as much as Harry Potter, I see why it is a classic, from the beautifully descriptive writing to the twisting plot, but \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" falls short of this. One last time, I will restate that while this book doesn't live up to the hype, it is ENJOYABLE and makes the reader smile often.PS: It is a great story to be read aloud!!6/10"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a wonderfull adventure story, but also a sad story .

Though the wrapping paper of the gift that Lewis gave us in \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is itself quite nice (an approach fully and wonderfully informed by early to mid twentieth century British life), it is the gift inside of the wrapping that is the true source of the book's power. Neither unnecessarily subtle nor offensively overbearing, the Christian allegory that Lewis unfolds is strong enough to be apparent to one accustomed to Christian narrative and imagery while not so blunt as to take away from the reading experience of one without such a frame of reference.

I found this book was a great fantasy and a book I could read with ease. I felt that C.S. Lewis came up with a very interesting plot that most readers can enjoy. I loved the setting descriptions, the characters, and overall plot. However, I feel this book suits a younger audience. The simple diction and context made the book seem of lower level reading, certainly not of my age group.There is a definite religious theme throughout the book that C.S. Lewis is trying to get across to his readers. He uses the Christian faith and Jesus Christ constantly throughout the book. He uses the main characters to represent religious figures in the bible. Aslan represents Jesus Christ in which Aslan dies and rises from the dead. The White Witch symbolizes Satan with her evil ways and treatment of the animals and people. The children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy represent Jesus' disciples as the follow and love Aslan who represents Jesus Christ. Some might find this use of religion as an annoyance, but being a Christ follower, I actually liked these references and loved the connection that was portrayed between the characters in the book and the biblical figures of the bible.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book, despite it being a little too young for my liking. The religious symbolism added extra substance to the book and made the reader think. This was a great book to read."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"It is alsome.

They were sent to an old professor's house because of the air raids in London. On one cold, rainy day, the children decided to explore the house. The came into a rather empty room, only filled with a very large wardrobe. They saw that nothing of interest was there, so they left, except for Lucy. She wanted to open the door to the wardrobe and stepped inside. What she found inside was not just the back of the wardrobe but an entire wood all covered in snow. While walking a little through the forest, she met a faun named Mr. Tumnus. He brought her to a den in which he was about to turn her in to the white which, who was making all of Narnia, the world Lucy had came in, winter with no Christmas. Mr. Tumnus realized he had to let her go and help her escape. When she returned to the wardrobe, it wasn't even a second after she had left. One other day, the children decided to play hide-and-seek. Lucy went almost directly to the wardrobe room. Just as she stepped in, Edmund saw her go in and decided to follow and tease her, when he found himself also in Narnia. There he met the White Witch. He gave him some food and drink and told him to bring his siblings to her house. When the White Witch left, Lucy found Edmund and they both went back to the wardrobe room. When Lucy told Peter and Susan that Edmund had gotten in too, Edmund said that he had been playing and pretending with Lucy. The house in which the professor lives in, is one of those houses in which many sightseers came to look at. One day, a whole group of them were there with Mrs. Macready. So all the children went into the wardrobe room and hid in the wardrobe and backed up until all the children ended up in Narnia. They had decided to go visit Mr. Tumnus when they found his house had been destroyed and Mr. Tumnus pulled off to prison. Outside, they saw Mr. Beaver who led them to his home on a frozen river. There Mrs. Beaver and Mr. Beaver told the four children the entire prophecy, when suddenly they had realized that Edmund had gone. Mr. Beaver said they had to leave right away for Aslan at the stone table because the White Witch had gotten Edmund to betray them. At the Stone Table, Aslan and his entire army had gotten ready for a great war. Aslan sent a party of centaurs to chase after a wolf at their camp. This wolf lead them to the White Witch's camp and they were able to bring back Edmund. A couple of days later, their armies clashed. Aslan had went to the White Witch's Castle to revive all those that she had turned to stone. With those extra reinforcements they were able to win the battle. Peter was crowned high king, and Susan, Edmund, and Lucy became king and queens.I really enjoyed this book because it was almost impossible to put down. The description made it feel like you were actually there and could feel what they were feeling and experience what they were experiencing. For example, this sentence made me feel like a picture was elaborately painted in my mind,\\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry)you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That made me feel probably just as those Pevensie children felt when they saw it.There was nothing in general about this book that I didn't enjoy. Nothing except in one moment when Edmund lied that he hadn't been in Narnia. I felt extremely sorry for Lucy. If I were her I probably would have shouted at Edmund for lying and being beastly. Despite that one moment, the story was really great. The best moment was probably when Aslan revived the lion. The description was just beautiful. \\"Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back-then the color seemed to lick all over him as the flame lick all over a bit of paper-then, while his hindquearters were still obviously stone, the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds ripple into living hair.\\" Reading that description was just impossible to describe with words."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY ADVENTURES WHEN FOUR KIDS PETER,EDMUND,SUSAN,AND LUCY FIND THE MAGICAL LAND OF NARNIA.ESPESILY WHEN ASLAN {GOD} CAME AND THEN EVERY GOOD PERSON FELT CONFIDENT OF DEFETING THE WHITE WHITCH.LUCY WAS AMAZED TO FIND MR.TUMNUS.THEN EDMUND FOUND THE WHITE WHITCH AND HAD ENCHANTED TURKISH DELIGHT WHICH HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO HAVE SOME MORE.THEN THE WHITE WHITCH TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE SOME MORE AFTER HE BRINGS HER HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO HER.AFTER HUGE BATTLES THEY FINALY KILL HER AND ARE NAMED KING AND QUEEN OF NARNIA."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Although I have only read two NARNIA books, (LION &amp; MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW), I am sure LION is (one of?)

Either way, enjoy LION and the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this in three days. The fastest I've ever read a book I think. Of course, I didn't have much else to do though, so that might be a factor.Still, the book was very enjoyable, especially since I'm not into all of this mythological stuff. I especially like the lamp-post at the end of the world concept.This book is very descriptive, which I guess is an essential element to the success of a book. It gives you a sense that the author is actually there and just reporting what happens. He mentions everything, even how one of the kids during a long journey watches a beaver's feet plod along through the snow, as if in a trance. Minor details like that seem to confirm the author was really there. Great for fiction. I think the Harry Potter books are like that too.I hope this isn't a spoiler, but this book has Santa Claus in it, which I personally thought was kind of lame, but oh well.This isn't my favorite book ever, but it's fun to read. I don't think I'll get the other Narnia books, but I've got nothing against them. They're good stuff. I only got this book because I recognized the book cover. I believe I saw it when I was a little kid. These books must have been popular for the past 50 years. I think Mel Gibson is due to make this particular book into a movie this Christmas, but I'm not sure.I used to think books were always better than movies, because seeing a movie every week cost a lot more than reading books for a hobby. Now I'm not so sure. This one cost me seven bucks, and I finished it in less than a week. Now I think good books are good, and good movies are good, but neither books or movies are better overall.I've noticed that my reviews have been getting poor ratings as of late, so I don't think I'll write as many now. I'll have to find something more productive. Like reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland again. That's a great book to read by the way. Buy it with its sequel."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is the best book ever!This book is about 4 kids named Lucy, Edmund, Suzan,and Peter.

This adventure of the children and how each one handled their own personal struglles brought a smile to my face and a warmth in my heart. We all can learn so much from how each child entered this land called Narnia and how they grew with each new encounter that they made. I also enjoyed the fact that not everone is perfect, yet forgiveness and love can get you through hard times. My nephew and I read it at the same time. I enjoyed so much hearing his thoughts also. A must read."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The lion the witch and the wardrobe is an out standing book written by an amazing author. The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) who take a tremendous journey into a mystical country called Narnia.After stumbling into a wardrobe in an old professor's house (where they were sent because of a war) they came upon the snowy country of Narnia. While in Narnia they come across a talking beaver, in fact every animal in Narnia can talk. The beaver invites the children to his house for dinner.During the dinner the beaver talks to them about the White Witch and how she makes it always winter but never Christmas. He also talks to them about how evil she is and how she thinks she's queen but really isn't. One of the other things that he talked about was that she turned everyone that disagreed with her to stone.One of the most interesting things that the beaver talked about was Aslan. Aslan is a powerful lion that is rightfully king and he had just returned from a very long journey. He also talked about the prophecy. The prophecy states that when four humans sit in the four thrones peace will be restored.It turned out that Edmund had been in Narnia before and had met the White Witch. It also turned out that the White Witch had him under a spell. Because he was under a spell he left the beaver's house when nobody was looking and set off for the witch's house.After many days the three other children met Aslan and told him that Edmund was missing. Aslan went to go get Edmund but the only way he could was to sacrifice his life. Aslan knew that the only way to restore peace to Narnia so he was killed. The next day was a huge war, good against evil.If you want o know what happens in the war, to Edmund, and to Aslan, you're going to half to read the book yourself. This book I would rate 4 out of a 5. I strongly suggest you read it.(...)"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I'm 5 years old. My mom read this book to me and my sister.

The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel. This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up. And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The lion the witch and the warcrobe is a wonderful book.

It is like Lord of the Rings meets Alison and Wanderland.The book begins with four borhters and sisters. who leave london in World War 2 to go and stay with an old perfessor. While exploring the house they found a magical wordrobe. They wander into the magical place called Narnia. while in Narnia the met weird charecters that could talk. The stange things helped them get away from the evil witch. then a lion comes named Aslan who is the only one who can defeet the evil witch. Aslan was my favorite charecter because he was good,nice,and,when he fights he uses his mind not his strenght. With the help of Aslan the kids defeet the witch and become the kings and queens of Narnia. IU like this book because the author made it feel like the charercters come alive and I could see it in my head, for example my favorite scene was when Aslan turned all the statues back in to animals. It describes the process like a paper catching on fire,and I could see the process in my head.While the book starts out slow,it is worth the effert to keep on reading.

Although I personally didn't enjoy The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe as much as I enjoyed the Magician's Nephew,it was still a high quality read. The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe starts with the now grown up Digory Kirke,who has become Professor Kirke,taking 4 siblings into his house in a time of war. One of the siblings first discovers way into Narnia through the wardrobe Professor Kirke made out of Narnian wood at the end of the Magician's Nephew. Eventually,all 4 of the siblings find their way into Narnia and the story really begins. The plot is graver and the tone grimmer than the Magician's Nephew. In this book the 4 siblings find Narnia an unhappy land annd will also find themselves in real danger. The adventure is about how the siblings,with the help of Aslan,put things right in the land of Narnia. There are two things I particulary like about the Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe. 1st,The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe makes the Magician's Nephew an even stronger story than it was to begib with because of connections between the stories. There were many times while reading The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe that I found myself saying \\"Oh,yeah,because in the Magician's Nephew................. Much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows made Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince a stronger story,so too The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe made the Magician's Nephew a stronger story. Now we've got a strong series going. I also loved the fact that the people that got into Narnia from \\"our world\\" in The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe were different humans than the ones in the Magician's Nephew. I love how Lewis expanded his base of characters with this book. One last thing is that I LOVED the \\"gifts\\" part. (Can't say more than gifts,it'd require a big spoiler.) The biggest waekness of The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is that the physical appearance of Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy is never described so you have to guess. (I now think of the characters from the movie when I think about what they would look like.) The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is a masterfully crafted tale about the adventures of the Pevinse children in Narnia and is surely 5 star material."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a good read for adults and children alike. C. S. Lewis goes into great detail to make Narnia seem so real. you can really get lost in the reading and picture yourself there."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Although I didn't read this edition, I would have to imagine that from a previous review, this would sum it up in aThis book was one that paralleled with Christian beliefs from a fictional perspective. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were sent away to a professor's house in England during a time of war. One day a simple game of hide and go seek found them in an adventure in a world called Narnia where through an evil queen (Satan like) made it always winter. However through the union of the children (Sons and Daughters of Eve) and Aslan (a portrayal of GOD and Jesus), they have the ability to conquer evil,and restore peace to Narnia. To find out more, read to see what trials and tribulations the children face throughout their journey to save Narnia and restore peace."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"One of my most cherished childhood school memories was having our teacher read to us from the Narnia books. I'll never forget being caught up by the magical land in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe which was read to us FIRST! I know there's a lot of arguments concerning what order the books should be read in: chronological order or as they were published. Well, I have to say that C.S. Lewis published them in the order he meant for us to read the books so start with LWW. What a wonderful imagination this man had and how fortunate for us readers that he put his creativity to good use and put his thoughts down on paper. It's a wonderful and magical trip that any parent should share with their child, they will never forget it. I know I never will."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"...It's pretty obvious that these books are allegorical. Even if you don't know who C.S. Lewis is, I think it probably doesn't take a genius to figure out the religious representation throughout this book (and the others). I don't follow a Judeo-Christian path, personally, and I have no problem reading this; it's not at all preachy, or so obviously Christian that it reads like a rewritten Bible story or something. So, regardless of your own religious affiliation (or if you aren't religious at all), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent choice if you want to sit down for a couple of hours for a fun, light story of magic and adventure...\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion,The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a very exciting book in which four children step into the land of Narnia through a wardrobe by magic. Narnia is enslaved by the White Witch,a witch who can produce endless winters with no Christmas,turn things into stone,make things look like what they aren't,and do a few other tricks. Just when almost all hope is lost, Aslan, the lion, returns to Narnia and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch's army in a war that will decide the fate of Narnia.My two favorite charactars are Aslan and the White Witch because they're the rulers of Narnia and bitter enemies. I like the book because of the highly detailed story and pictures. I love it,and you will probably like it too. If you like mystery books,it's not a mystery book.

LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming. Giving away the plot of the book is spoiling the pleasure of reading. And this book is definitely worth reading.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

Loved it even more when I read it as a fourth-grader, delightfully unconcerned with the Christian symbolism, not that it really mattered. My best friend Mark introduced them to me; he truly believed Narnia existed, and come to think of it, how do we know it doesn't? Even now in my 40s, I just don't think the overt symbolism matters much. For me and many others, these books represent a time in our lives when we could willingly suspend our disbelief easily, readily, wholeheartedly.

This book is even read by many adults, because of the magic that C.S Lewis's pencil wrote. They might not be thick books. But that doesnt make a book good at any means.

Well, ok, I read it in high school, actually all of the Narnia books. But it has deeper layers of meaning. The 4 children are the 4 directions, and the four alchemical elements, and Jung's 4 archetypes, from which we get Meyers Briggs. It's a good story, with good characters.

Everyone got to be one of the charchters in the story. I was Edmund (although I'm a girl). While reading this book I kept pretending that my family was in the story. I was able to say to my siblings \\"That's you,\\" or \\"You're that one,\\" I enjoyed connecting to this book since it was quite similar to my family.The thing I didn't like about this book was the lack of connection between this book and the Magician's Nephew. The tree that Jadis was afraid of, wasn't in the book. However, the lamp post was. I think Aslan should have said something about the beginning of Narnia, Digory, or Polly from the other book.Overall, I wasn't able to give this book five stars because it didn't appeal to me as much as other books like Harry Potter did.

It's not the best, but really is the most memorable. Here you are introduced to the four Pevensie children- Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Lucy, the youngest, ventures into a wardrobe at her eccentric relative's house and finds herself in a different world- Narnia, home of the evil White Witch and the mythical Lion Aslan.Nowadays you could dismiss this book as one-dimensional and predictable- yes, good triumphs over evil, there's a bit of forgiven betrayal, and a child's dream comes true. But Narnia is completely unique, because it was CS Lewis that came up with this other world idea, and it was from his Narnia books that all the others were spun off of.Narnia reads like a fairytale. Lucy is sweet, Susan is mature, Peter is a warrior, Edmund is an oddball that goes through random personalities changes. Aslan is faultless, the Witch is cruel. But all that is where the magic comes from. Somehow these characters all work and are believable and readable. You are surprised and hooked till the end.Despite Lewis's awkward dialogue, his obvious love for the word \\"presently\\" and dragging descriptions, these books are classics, to be read over and over.

It was written by C.S. Lewis, who has written many great books.The book is mainly about four kids who live in England at the time of World War II. Their mother sends them off to an estate to live with someone while the war is going on. Since the day they got there was raining, they went to go and play hide-and-go seek. Lucy, who was the youngest, went to this secret room with a magical wardrobe in it. She went inside it and kept going back until she found she was in a forest. This magical place was called Narnia. Then she saw a light post and met a faun, which was a mixture of two animals. The faun took her back to his place to have tea and to kidnap her. But this faun was good so instead of kidnapping her, he took her back to the light post so she could get home. Then Edmund, who was her brother, followed her into the forest. But he went the wrong way and met up with the evil White Witch. He told them about his family and went back home. One time they were playing and they heard footsteps so they went to the wardrobe room. they went in and found themselves in a snowy forest. When they saw talking beavers, they went to the beaver's house for dinner. When they were talking, Edmund snuck out and went to the White Witches house. She took him prisoner because he didn't bring his family with him. So the rest of the book is about them finding Edmund and getting into a big war against the White Witch. And of course they win the war.The four main characters are Peter who is the oldest, Susan who is the second oldest, Edmund who is the third oldest, and Lucy who is the youngest. Peter is a smart guy and despises his brother because of his attitude toward all of them. Susan is very smart knows how to solve problems between her family. Edmund you can almost say is very bad. He acts like that because he is afraid that his dad will die in the war. Lucy is a person with many freckles and a nice personality.I think the theme of this book is good vs. evil. In the war it is the axis powers who are evil vs. the allied powers who were the good. The when they reach Narnia, it is the White Witch who is evil and Aslan the mighty lion and his side that is good.I really liked this book for many reasons. One it is filled with adventure and is just a great book. Two it has many different characters that seem very cool. Three the good guys win and the four children become the kings and queens of Narnia. I think you should read this book too."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"A world of fantasy that leads the reader to the victory of good over evil, C.S. Lewis has written an enjoyable children's story that allures to the Christian religion. Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with a professor in a huge old house. Inside a wardrobe in one of the many rooms is a passageway to the world of Narnia where mythical creatures live alongside the mundane animals. However, in Narnia the White Witch has placed a spell on the land so that it is \\"always winter and never Christmas.\\" The four children travel with friendly beavers to meet Aslan, the great lion who can defeat the White Witch. He leads them to fight the Witch's allies to restore the beauty and goodness of Narnia.The events and characters in the novel take everyone back to childhood dreams of unicorns, talking animals, and glorious victories. The reader becomes captivated by the plight of the four children and their quest to save Narnia. The children are alluring because of their innocence. The clear line between good and evil aids the flow and understanding of the story. The imagery describing Aslan captivates the reader, creating a mysterious character who is kind yet fearsome and who cares for all the people. This imagery draws the reader to love Aslan just as much as the children love him. The clear distinction between the awesome goodness of Aslan and the evil treachery of the Witch fuels the reader's desire to learn of Narnia's fate. The fate of the creatures the White Witch has turned to stone also keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat. The reader wishes to keep reading because of the foreshadowing of a great battle and the prophecy that the children will ascend to the throne of the Castle Paravel and defeat the Witch.The sentences seem awkward at time, but this is due to Lewis' writing style. He writes as if he is talking, relaying the story to a group of children. The wording is simplistic and there are quite a few moments where he recaps the story or explains mundane actions. This style is ideal for children because the explanatory comments help children to better understand the story, and it helps adults to remember what occurred earlier in the novel. C.S. Lewis switches between a narrative of the Witch's actions and Aslan's actions throughout the middle section of the novel. Lewis will break one story at a climax point and return to the other which causes the reader to continue in order to discover the answers to the questions in the last chapter.C.S. Lewis continuously alludes to the Bible, making the story a great study for Christian groups. The name Peter connects the apostle, the head of the Church, to the boy whom Aslan trusts to head the battle against the evil White Witch. Edmund, the youngest boy is related to Judas. Edmund meets the White Witch and is taken in by her magic. Just as Judas was enchanted by the allure of money, Edmund betrays the whereabouts of his siblings and Aslan while under the spell of the White Witch. However, Aslan frees Edmund. Edmund repents and is forgiven, just as Judas would have been had he not killed himself. Also, the many prophesies throughout the novel allure to the prophesies in the Old Testament about Jesus' life and death. The connections continue, but would give away the rest of the story.Lewis' novel is a great read for all people because of its adventure and mystery. The courageous children's fight to save Narnia is a childhood dream come true. All will fall in love with this novel. It is not just a book for Christians, but it is a book for all longing for adventure in mystical lands."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"My book talk is on a book called Narnia the lion,the witch,and the wardrobe.It was written by c.s lewis and it was eventually made into a movie it is about these 4 kids Lucy,Susan,Edmund,and Peter,Anyway they all go through this wardrobe and land in a magical world called Narnia.They meet an evil witch and a very good hearted lion called aslan.It is one of the best adventure books I have ever read,it also has alot of fantasy with alot of magical animals that can,like talk!.If you like alot of adventure and fantasy this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S.

In the beginning, the four children come to the professor's house to stay until the war is over. They are exploring the house one day, and Lucy goes into a wardrobe, thus into Narnia. In Narnia, she meets Mr. Tumnus, a friendly faun who wants a free Narnia. He explains the White Witch making ever-lasting winter in Narnia. In the middle of the book, the rest of them enter Narnia, war breaks, they meet Aslan, the lion, who saves Edmund, who had gone to the White Witch, who \\"killed\\" Aslan on the Stone Table. Near the end, Aslan kills the White Witch, and the children are Kings and Queens in Narnia, when they accidentally leave back through the wardrobe.People who like fantasies such as talking animals would like this book because it has a lot of them.From this book, I learned that dictators do not always use power wisely, so you can not trust anyone completely, even if they do seem kind and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I read The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis and I enjoyed it very much. In the begging the kids (Lucy, Peter, Susan, and Edmund) live with their mom but they moved to live with the professer because of air-rids. At the professers house Lucy finds a wardrobe witch takes you to a place called Naira. When all the kids get there they meet the Beavers. In the middle the Beavers tell the four about Asland, a powerful lion who is on their side, and the horrible witch who is not on their side and who wants to take over Naira. Then Edmund sunk out over to the witch's house. Then the Beavers take the kids over to meet Asland, and he saves Edmund. In the end Asland dies for Edmund and the war begins. Then Asland comes alive again and Naira wins the war. After the four are crowned kings and queens they finally go back through the wardrobe to the professers house they are kids again.The themes for this book is always believe in your family. Two ways that they showed this in the book is that Susan, Peter, and Edmund, at first do not bevible Lucy when she first finds the wardrobe, and when they are hiding from the house keeper they go in the wardrobe they all find Naria.The second theme is that you should bevble even if others do not. In the book they show this because when Lucy first comes out of the wardrobe the others do not beveled her, and Susan, peter, and Edmund do not bevible Lucy about the wardrobe.The recommendion for this book is for people who like fantasy stories, or made up creatures and figure.

It is a great story and a meaningful Christian allegory. Having said that, the non-religious will love this regardless of the allegory.C.S. Lewis was a genius and wrote many powerful, thoughtful books. I am just thankful that he set out to try his hand at children's books, because in Narnia we have been left with something that is truly special."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is a fantasy about a land called Narnia. Four English school children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of hide and go seek. The four children are in this magical land to help the golden lion, Aslan, to defeat the White Witch. The White Witch has used her magic and cursed the land of Narnia with everlasting winter without Christmas. Throughout the book, the children meet many magical characters and animals. The children are forced to fight a war against the Witch and defeat her, which changes the land back to its original beauty and removes all curses she had on Narnia. The children became the Kings and Queens of Narnia for many years in Narnia time. However when they went on a hunt for a white stag, the children stumble upon the lamppost that they had found the first time they entered Narnia. The children wander in the forest near the lamppost and they fall out of the wardrobe that they had entered many years ago. On the other hand, the children were no longer adults as they were in Narnia, it was the same time, same day, and the children were in their same clothes that they were wearing when they wandered through the wardrobe and found Narnia.This is a high quality book in the fantasy genre. Most of the characters are fictional, yet the heroes of the story are children. There is more than one set of literary elements within this story. Each adventure in this book has its own problem, yet there is always one main problem. The language and style of this book is of English literature and some of the wording is different than the English used today. This book also has a different style. The children embark on an adventure to a magical land and find that they are the children of Adam and Eve. To them that is not important, however to the Narnians it means a great battle is to be had. There are a few illustrations through this book in black and white, however they do not tell a story within themselves. The story is told through the printed words. The illustrations are to give a glimpse of the Narnians or land in which the chapters are focusing on. The strength of this book is the high level of fantasy and adventure. The only concern for this book with lower readers is the names and the old English language used throughout the story. The reading level for this book is middle grades starting in fourth to eighth. In the classroom this book can be used as a beautiful example of fantasy. In the classroom, a way to see what the students are visualizing while reading is have the students complete a ten minute quick draw (Yopp & Yopp, 2006). The students can also predict the ending of the story, or even the ending to a chapter. The students can also journal about which character they would like to be use examples in the book to support why they choose that character. Also, the students could journal on the last quote from the professor, \\"But the professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia\\" in which the students could extend what they think this predicts for readers (Lewis, 1950, p.206). Lastly, the students could create a comparison chart and compare the fantasy in the story and reality (Harvey & Goudvis, 2007). The only concern for this book is the violence during the war and the fighting being discussed in the classroom."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"First book printed, second book chronologically.I began re-reading the Narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels. Mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when I was young, and I was interested to see how they held up as adults. I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.This is, of course, the most recognisable title of the series as well as being the first written/published. Most readers will pick up the book hoping for a written account of the events in the recent film, or perhaps the BBC drama series if your memory goes back that far! For the most part the events are the same, although elements are extracted and expanded upon in the films making the novel a little pale in comparison.It is not however lacking in terms of character or charm, and is an alluring tale that sucks the reader in instantly despite the intrusion of the narrator at times. The protagonists, places and events are described straight-forwardly with insightful touches that enhances the specific element that brings the scenes to life. Even as a \\"grown up\\" who was only mildly interested in the story to begin with, I found the story absorbing and even inspirational.8.5/10"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"It's been years since I was assigned this book for a book report. I didn't read it but I did pass the test. Four and a half years now, I decided to read this book. I did know what to expect, but I didn't care. This book was a page-turner. It took me two nights to read this. Combined to about four hours. I enjoyed this book.Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are moving into a professor's home during the war because of air raids. During a time of explorer, Lucy discovered a world in a wardrobe called Narnia. At first, her siblings thought they were just foolish lies. Soon, they will figure out how foolish they were to not believe and how this will be one heck of an adventure in Narnia. Unicorns, fauns, battles, an evil witch, Aslan the lion..The rating for this book is 4/5 for a reason. This being that I disliked how C.S. Lewis gave us very long and pointless descriptions and often renamed every single creature in the world of Narnia. I constantly had to skip through those just to continue my story. Some might find it better for you to read this, but I didn't.Overall, I think you will find this book very pleasing to read. It's a warm and freezing cold story to read. You will laugh, cry, or even fear for what's to come next for the kids."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Mr. Lewis' whimsical style creates a fast paced, fast read fairy tale. Woven throughout the book are Christian themes, however, I believe you can still thoroughly enjoy this book even if you are not a Christian. I believe it can be enjoyed by all ages and would be a wonderful book to read to young children. I look forward to reading the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series.The story is about four siblings that are sent away from London during the Nazi Germany bombing campaigns during WWII. They go to live with a professor at his large and strange house in the country. During a rainy day it is discovered that a wardrobe in an empty room leads to the new and strange land of Narnia. The four siblings then go on the adventure of their lives.I'm a 35 years old male and I don't know why, but I had never read any of The Chronicles of Narnia books by Mr. C.S. Lewis. After reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe what a shame it has been to not have read them before. My wife and I saw a trailer for the upcoming \`Chronicles' movie by Disney, Prince Caspian. We both thought it looked interesting and decided we should watch the first movie being The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe before seeing Prince Caspian. After reading some of the reviews of the book I decided it would be worth the time to actually read each of the books before seeing the corresponding movie which brings me to the place of reading The Lion... this weekend. Books are almost always better than their corresponding movies and I think it's important, if possible, to read the books first so your imagination can take over and you are not placing the faces and voices of the movie characters into the reading realm. I highly recommend this book and will be reading the rest Mr. Lewis' Chronicles series."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Although I read the story as a child, I recently listened to the audio book during my commute to work.

This book is worth the read at any age. The story is compelling and dramatic. The characters are rich and possess real human dignity. The subtlety and suspense make the book an easy and fast read, yet impossible to forget.Unlike most children's literature, The Chronicles of Narnia--and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in particular--treat both the children and adults with respect and grace. The children are young and sometimes impatient, but brave and decent. The adults are respectful and thoughtful, not dismissive or clueless.Lewis' Christianity is clear from start to finish, but this book is not preaching; neither is the content forced. Lewis artfully weaves his plot and characters into the larger narrative of the Christian story. This is book is fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, and Gospel.I urge all readers (of any age) to enjoy these books! You will not regret it!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"chose this book called The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe for a school project and this book was a good book. My favorite part of this book was when Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Mrs. & Mr. Beaver entered the Stone Table and met Aslan, a lion that is the King of Narnia. I think the characters are believable because they all had a special part in the story's plot. Father Chrismas's part was to give Peter, Susan, and Lucy their tools. Lucy helped the wounded with her cordial that was made by the fire flowers on the top of the mountain, Peter and Edmund were knights that had a sword and a shield to protect them in battle, and Susan had the ability to use a bow and arrows for protection and a horn. The horn was used for thinking about something good to help her when she blows it and that thing she thinks about comes or appears. The ending was happy: the kids helped Narnia by defeating the Witch and her army that was trying to take over the magical place. I recommend you to read this book that is full of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"At the time of the publication of C.S. Lewis's The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe the world was still in the early stages of recovery from the largest, most devastating, and most costly known war to mankind at the time, 1950. WWII was truly a battle of good verses evil, and good prevails. What exactly C.S. Lewis's experiences were during the war are unknown to me however, I venture to say that he knew about the evils mankind was capable of and also knew of the good man was capable of. He lived in Europe at this time and had first hand experience in the dealings of daily life during war. It appears that in this book Lewis is clearly writing about his experiences, but to the extent that his allegories are based on direct or indirect experiences aren't completely clear to me. What is clear is he wrote of his beliefs, his own faith, and how they came to be questioned and ultimately restored through the writing of this story.These themes of good versus evil, loyalty, prudence and faith become evident as the story unfolds. Truth be told there are numerous themes that apply to this story. The theme of maturation could be applied; you see the children are dependant on adults in the beginning of the story for their well-being. Then they pass though the stage of trust versus mistrust, questioning the very existence of Narnia, and arrive at the stage of innovation versus guilt. During this stage they figure out how to solve problems and over come difficulties on their own. You see them take control over their destiny, as they become the rulers of Narnia. This can be applied to the people of Germany, who so susceptible and dependent on their government after World War I that they crave a solution, that is then brought to them in the form of a new charismatic leader who promises them not only a rebuilt life, but that they, the people of Germany, will be come the rulers of the world. This is similar to Edmond's plight in the story. Themes of unselfishness and selflessness are all throughout the story and example of this is the role of Mr. Tunnis who knows that he will be stoned if the witch finds out that he did not do as she wished, which was to notify her that a daughter of Eve had entered Narnia. He still decided to go against her wishes and sacrificed himself for the safety of the Lucy. This selflessness is also seen in the beginnings of the Third Reich by those who were willing to give up their new found sustained lives, their comfortable economic conditions that their leader had provided, to grow, expand, and protect the safety of their country. These citizens, these soldiers also conformed to the requirements of their government out of fear, much like Mr. Tunnis. They too wanted their lives to change realizing that their world was becoming increasingly irrational. They continued to support their government despite of this, out of fear, out of conformity, and out of a sense of obligation.While undoubtedly there is a strong undertone of the religious beliefs of the author, as a student and of history and sociology I found myself continually drawn to the similarities of Narnia and the German town of Dachau. The people who lived in this town did not support the Third Reich and were proud to not be active participants in the dealings of the government, having heard rumors of the deeds that went against their own beliefs of humanity and dignity. Like the children who heard Lucy's description of Narnia, they did not believe that this was happening in their back yard. They instead chose to believe the reassurances of the government they did not support. Their understanding, their belief system did not support the stories that they were being told, just as the other children could not comprehend the stories that Lucy was telling them. Instead they chose to believe the lie they were told by the very government they did not support, because it was more in line with their understanding of human nature. Lucy was said to have never had lied, and therefore is someone they should believe, leaving the reader to assume that Edmund's character is a little more questionable, yet they more readily accepted his response over hers.As the battle of good versus evil ravaged the world in the 1940s, it also ravaged Narnia. The fight over the existence of Utopia, and whether it could exist in the simultaneous presence of pure evil and pure good, played out as much in the minds of the citizens of Dachau and as it did in the world of the characters in the story, as the conflicting stories of reality blended together so that truth and fiction could not be defined.At the end of World War II the citizens of the town of Dachau were first told, then shown what had been going on in their own backyard, allowing them to see first hand what their acceptance allowed. They had readily accepted the assurances of people they knew and believed to be untrustworthy, and as a result not only allowed, but played an active role in supporting the evil that they had tried to not be part of. They had not actively stopped evil, and instead, through their own complacency, played a crucial role in sustaining it. This realization led many of them to collapse, and unable to return to the place they had been proud to call home. The journey they had been on during the time of the war gave them prosperity, but at the end, the realization of the horror in what they had done, made it clear that they had come full circle, back to the devastation and self-defeat they had prior to the rise of the Third Reich. They had chosen to follow the White Queen. It was as if time had not passed, that any success they had enjoyed during that time period was gone, yet they held the memories and awareness of the years in between. Only now those good memories were all tainted.Similarly, as the children in Narnia began to grow and reach levels of success and accomplishment, they soon returned to the beginning. They recognized the signs that they were getting back to where they started, as they chased the stag, saw the familiar lamppost, but instead of stopping and remembering, they continued forward, ignoring the signs they were given. Soon after they too found themselves back at the beginning, as if time had not moved forward. They were back at the school, back through the wardrobe, back as children. But they returned with the memories of the time they spent in Narnia, where pure good lived side by side with pure evil, and how these powers initially fought for them. Having accepted the protection of Aslan to watch over them, protecting them as they maneuvered the balance of good and evil, they now had a deeper sense of understanding of themselves, a deeper sense of faith and awareness of their purpose in life."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The wardrobe made from the wood of the Narnian apple tree planted in a garden on earth and brought down in its old age by some storm is going to be the door to Narnia in the old and magnificent mansion or maybe castle where four kids, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, have taken refuge away from the bombing of London by the Germans in 1940.Lucy first goes through the door and spends a few hours there having tea with the faun Tumnus. Her brothers and sister make fun of her. Edmund will be second and he meets the Witch, Queen Jadis, who has taken over the country. She charms him with Turkish Delight and makes him promise to come back with his brother and sisters.One day, when the children are trying to fly away and hide from a group of visiting tourists in the mansion, they hide in the wardrobe and find themselves in Narnia. They all discover that Mr. Tumnus has been captured and his house ransacked due to the blabbering Edmund had done with the witch.They are all taken into their homes by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and it is then that Edmund escapes and goes back to Queen Jadis. He will have there the strongest and most interesting surprise in his life.That leads to the confrontation of Aslan and his human and Narnian supporters on one hand, and Queen Jadis and her own supporters on the other hand. The real stake is Edmund, the traitor Queen Jadis used to get the information she needed. The Queen demands from Aslan that the old tradition of the execution of the traitor be implemented. Aslan negotiates and takes Edmund's place.He's sacrificed but an older tradition resurrects him and he recovers his power because he himself had done no mischief. Then the battle is a victory because Edmund gets his vengeance and destroys the Queen's magic wand. She is then powerless.The four kids are crowned kings and queens of Narnia till one day a White Stagn, like the Celtic messenger from the other world or the Arthurian quest-announcing messenger, leads them back to the lamp post and they come back to this side of the wardrobe door. But though once a king of Narnia always a king of Narnia, they can't go back the same way. That rule seems to have been broken though since three passages took place, Lucy first, Edmund second, and the four children third, and what's more they all ended up in the same world in the same time period.The most interesting aspect of this book is the secularizing of religious - deeply Christian, though not only - elements in the legend. The origin of Queen Jadis is Adam and his \\"other\\" wife Lilith, a Jinn, and then later taking some giant blood in her stock.We have to think of the Beast when dealing with Jadis, but she is a female witch whereas the Beast of the Apocalypse is a male monster devouring pregnant women, and its number is 666. We also have to think of the French meaning of Jadis which is \\"once upon a time\\", the past in fairy tales. The future is in the hands of Aslan and the kids.Aslan has to be sacrificed to be resurrected to save Narnia. A common vision from the Gospels as much as from Saint John's Apocalypse. This motif of the savior being a resurrected sacrificed person is quasi universal in many religious traditions, and C.S. Lewis uses many of them. The sacrificial altar is found in many cultures, among others the Celtic culture, or the Roman or Greek cultures, and even the Jewish tradition, to remain within the Eurasian geographical zone.The resurrected savior is well known in many mythologies and religions, the Christian for one example. The traitor is more Christian and yet there are traitors in Sumerian and Mesopotamian traditions. C.S. Lewis regenerates the motif by making the traitor the hero who will save the day by destroying the magic of the witch.We must also think that the four kids around the Lion are reminiscent of the four animals or living creatures around the altar, a lion, a bull, a human-faced animal and an eagle, hence of the four Evangelists in Saint John's Apocalypse.

Her brothers and sister make fun of her. Edmund will be second and he meets the Witch, Queen Jadis, who has taken over the country. She charms him with Turkish Delight and makes him promise to come back with his brother and sisters.One day, when the children are trying to fly away and hide from a group of visiting tourists in the mansion, they hide in the wardrobe and find themselves in Narnia. They all discover that Mr. Tumnus has been captured and his house ransacked due to the blabbering Edmund had done with the witch.They are all taken into their homes by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and it is then that Edmund escapes and goes back to Queen Jadis. He will have there the strongest and most interesting surprise in his life.That leads to the confrontation of Aslan and his human and Narnian supporters on one hand, and Queen Jadis and her own supporters on the other hand. The real stake is Edmund, the traitor Queen Jadis used to get the information she needed. The Queen demands from Aslan that the old tradition of the execution of the traitor be implemented. Aslan negotiates and takes Edmund's place.He's sacrificed but an older tradition resurrects him and he recovers his power because he himself had done no mischief. Then the battle is a victory because Edmund gets his vengeance and destroys the Queen's magic wand. She is then powerless.The four kids are crowned kings and queens of Narnia till one day a White Stagn, like the Celtic messenger from the other world or the Arthurian quest-announcing messenger, leads them back to the lamp post and they come back to this side of the wardrobe door. But though once a king of Narnia always a king of Narnia, they can't go back the same way. That rule seems to have been broken though since three passages took place, Lucy first, Edmund second, and the four children third, and what's more they all ended up in the same world in the same time period.The most interesting aspect of this book is the secularizing of religious - deeply Christian, though not only - elements in the legend. The origin of Queen Jadis is Adam and his \\"other\\" wife Lilith, a Jinn, and then later taking some giant blood in her stock.We have to think of the Beast when dealing with Jadis, but she is a female witch whereas the Beast of the Apocalypse is a male monster devouring pregnant women, and its number is 666. We also have to think of the French meaning of Jadis which is \\"once upon a time\\", the past in fairy tales. The future is in the hands of Aslan and the kids.Aslan has to be sacrificed to be resurrected to save Narnia. A common vision from the Gospels as much as from Saint John's Apocalypse. This motif of the savior being a resurrected sacrificed person is quasi universal in many religious traditions, and C.S. Lewis uses many of them. The sacrificial altar is found in many cultures, among others the Celtic culture, or the Roman or Greek cultures, and even the Jewish tradition, to remain within the Eurasian geographical zone.The resurrected savior is well known in many mythologies and religions, the Christian for one example. The traitor is more Christian and yet there are traitors in Sumerian and Mesopotamian traditions. C.S. Lewis regenerates the motif by making the traitor the hero who will save the day by destroying the magic of the witch.We must also think that the four kids around the Lion are reminiscent of the four animals or living creatures around the altar, a lion, a bull, a human-faced animal and an eagle, hence of the four Evangelists in Saint John's Apocalypse. That number four is crucial in the writing and style as opposed to three that seems to represent disorder. Four is like order re-established beyond disorder when the traitor or stray sheep comes back to the fold.The charm of the book is of course the transmuting of that more or less religious magic into a secular marvelous sorcery that can also be magical, white or black, in a way.Finally the Queen/Witch with her secret police is of course a political discourse to children and it exposes tyrannical means and situations as unacceptable because inhumane.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Michael Hague once again captures the images of a classic story. One of my favorite illustrators, by far. I grew up with my mother's collection of Hague illustrated books, and I will always associate his pictures with my mental image of Narnia."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, even if it is a children's book. It is very good and it will keep your interest. A young girl finds a magical wardrobe that takes that little girl to a place called Narnia. Later, her brothers and sister finds out about that mysterious place and then the story goes on to an adventure that just never stops."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is probably one of the most popular fantasy books out there, especially for the younger set. When the movie came out (which I also loved) it just furthered the popularity of this series. While it can be read as a stand alone, I recommend reading the complete series for the full richness and history that is contained for the world of Narnia.When Lucky, Edmund, Peter, and Susan have to go to the countryside to escape the air raids and war, they stay with a kindly professor at his rather large house. There is plenty to explore, and it is on a rainy day that Lucy finds a magical doorway to another world, inside the wardrobe in a spare room. She quickly makes a friend in a faun and learns of the evil White Witch who fancies herself Queen of Narnia. The other children don't believe her about her adventures though, and this is even worse for her when Edmund comes through too but lies about it to the other children. Finally and quite by accident they all make it to Narnia and learn that they have been expected. Aslan, the great lion, wants to see them and they set out to meet him and help him with his fight against the White Witch. However, they experience a setback when Edmund defects to the witch's side and they feel sure that he is lost to them.The characters, despite this being a short book, are very well done. I love Lucy and think she is charming and sweet. Peter is rather noble and distant, and Edmund of course is a complete brat in the beginning of the book without hardly any redeeming qualities. The other characters are quite nice as well and it is easy to see that Aslan has a regal bearing.The writing is great and definitely the most appropriate for kids (adults might find the story a little rushed) and while there are battles there is not extreme violence in this book. In fact, the only thing I found offensive was Father Christmas saying women shouldn't fight in wars, but that could just be the small bit of feminist in me. There are Christian tones, but they aren't strong in voice and are rather just a background to the story itself. It is read more as a fantasy novel, and highly appropriate that way.I love the series and especially this book and read it over and over. I don't think I could ever tire of it. With all the fantasy novels out there, this is definitely one that should be read.The Lion The Witch and The WardrobeCopyright 1950206 pages (and my edition had black and white pictures as well)Review by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I grew up attending a private, Christian school and I was convinced that I had heard this story, and read it, enough times. I finally picked the book back up and was surprised how much I had forgotten and how many things I never picked up on before.This is a great book for all ages. For children, the story of Christ is presented in such a way that is easy to relate with and understand. For adults, C.S. Lewis has insights about who God is and how He relates to the world that will open your mind and heart. Using metaphor as a means to describe who God really is has fallen out of use, but it is a tool that can sneak around the most guarded defenses and penetrate souls better than any other.As I started the series again this time, I realized that the death and resurrection story would start the series. Many fantasy series contain this element, but normally as the climax to the series. Lewis includes it at the beginning. I don't know why he wrote the series this way, but I suspect it is because it reflects our own lives. The first thing we must learn about is Christ and his death and resurrection and saving power. Then we learn how God moved in the world before Christ, after Christ, and how He is moving now in our own lives. For that reason, even though I'm not done with the series yet, I like how Lewis starts with this story.One of my favorite quotes is from this book, and it was great to read it in the full context again.\\"He'll be coming and going. One day you'll see him and another you won't. He doesn't like being tied down-and of course he has other countries to attend to. It's quite all right. He'll often drop in. Only you mustn't press him. He's wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\\"This is well worth reading again if you have not read it recently, no matter your age. It is a short, quick read and won't take you long at all to finish, but will stay with you long after you are done."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a wonderful, symbolizing story by C.S. Lewis. It deserves five stars with its greatly written story that keeps you turning pages one after another. The book can be classified as a wonderful fiction classic. The story is told by a narrator and without him/her telling the story, then we wouldn't get the full effect of the book that draws us into the characters. Lewisshows enthusiasm even through a narrator. He shows how other universes may exist a little bit closer than we may think.An entire story starts with one simple action: the turn of a wardrobe handle. When Lucy Pevensie opens a wardrobe door all she expects to find is a few hangers with coats, little did she know that she was totally wrong. She finds herself entering the world of Narnia: a world of magic and talking animals. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is set in Narnia; a world where a witch rules over the entire world, making it always winter and never Christmas. This is all because of the White Witch who will rule over Narnia until four children sit in the thrones at Cair Paravel. Most of the story happens because Lucy's brother Edmund betrays the family. Without this betrayal, the whole journey throughout Narnia would have been an easy and quick one. You should definitely read this book, no matter how old you are."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"One day Lucy Pevensie, accidentally, discovers a magic wardrobe-like portal into the magical land of Narnia. She meets a faun named Tumnus who kindly lets Lucy go after he tells her he intended on capturing her and giving her to the White Witch. Lucy then takes Edmund into Narnia with her where she loses Edmund who is put in a trance by the White Witch with magic Turkish delight. It makes him do anything to get another Turkish delight from her so he promises he'll bring his siblings: Peter, Lucy, and Susan to see her. Lucy and Edmund then meet up and leave Narnia. Then one day when the siblings are hiding from the housekeeper all four children enter Narnia together and decide to Tumnuse's house but find that the White Witch has arrested him from Mr. Beaver. They then join with Mr. Beaver to meet Aslan at the Stone Table the next day, but notice Edmund is gone. This is because Edmund has left to warn the White Witch about Aslan and Mr. Beaver's plan. Soon the Witch finds where Susan, Aslan, his followers, Peter, and Lucy are hiding, Aslan warns them in time so they see Aslan get tortured to death and stay with his dead body \`til morning where they see it is gone. Also they find the Stone Table broken in half. Then they see him and know he has risen from the dead. They all then fly to the Witch's castle. Peter's army is exhausted, but Aslan makes quick work of the Witch and Peter and his army finish off the followers of the Witch. Then everyone forgives Edmund and they become kings and Queens of Narnia for years. Finally they promise to return and leave through the wardrobe.One thing I liked about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that things are not always going well for the heroes. For instance, until the end Edmund is a follower of the Witch because he ate the Turkish delight. Another example at a point the only two together is Susan and Lucy. Peter took an army with him to go to fight the Witch and again Edmund was with the Witch. Even though he rises from the dead, Susan and Lucy watch Aslan get tortured to death. From this you can tell that the heroes' journey wasn't easy.Another interesting thing about this book was that there were a variety of characters. Like Tumnus the generous villain or the Witch the straight up villain.Edmund plays the good guy gone bad. Peter is the chosen one because he happens to be the oldest and the one Santa Claus gives the mystic sword. Aslan is the god-like character that is immortal never beaten or dead. As you can see there are characters of every kind in this story.I liked the whole setting, Narnia. I thought it was the perfect portrayal of a fantasy like world. You got talking beavers, flying lions, and an ice witch with a wand that turns things into stone and enchanted Turkish delights. Not to mention the way you travel to Narnia is through a magical wardrobe. Sounds as fantasy as it gets to me.Overall I think C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a very good book because I like to read books where the impossible happen. This book is definitely impossible in the world we know and reality. I recommend this book to all fantasy readers because you won't know what could happen on the next page."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This book was great and it had a good theme. It made me feel good inside and made me feel like I could relate myself to the story and I could picture myself in the kids positions.

It seemed a bit too childish for me. I am familiar with some of Lewis's other work, but this is my first trip to Narnia. In preparation for the upcoming movie, I decided to make my first visit to Narnia.Four Children staying in a mostly empty house can give rise to numerous potential adventures. When a passage in a wardrobe closet leads to another world, a strange adventure is available to the children. Narnia, where it is always been winter since the white witch became queen, has been awaiting the fulfillment of a prophecy. When the four children arrive in fulfillment of the prophecy, they meet the mighty lion Aslan. The great strength of this lion can only originate from one source than allows the witch to ultimately be conquered and the four children to reign as kings and queens of Narnia.While this book is short and simplistic, the adventure has more than enough depth to capture the adult reader's attention. While books with fauns and talking animals are normally not on my reading list, I have a great appreciation for this book. There is certainly a reason this book has been treasured for more than fifty years and across generations of families."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"That is all I can say about thiis book.

Read the book to find out"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is undoubtedly one of the most influential works in the history of juvenile literature - timeless and delightful for all ages.There is, however, no small amount of confusion about the literary type of the book. Time and again, it is referred to as a \\"Christian allegory,\\" a tag with which C.S. Lewis would not have been happy. As he explains in some of his essays and letters, an allegory is a work in which immaterial realities are represented by imaginary physical objects. For example, the immaterial faculty of Reason may be allegorically represented by someone we call Lady Reason. This Lady - because Reason is clear, undefiled, swift, cold, hard, and sharp like a sword - we could picture as a \\"sun-bright virgin clad in complete steel,\\" riding on a horse \\"with a sword naked in her hand.\\" This, C.S. Lewis has actually done in his only allegorical work, \\"The Pigrim's Regress,\\" from which the example of Lady Reason is taken.Is \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" then, an allegory? After all, C.S. Lewis loved allegorical literature, and it is obvious that elements of his Christianity flowed into the Narnian storyline, such as the concepts of Incarnation and Redemption.Were C.S. Lewis alive, I think he would be very glad if I could transfer to the readers his view that the book is NOT an allegory. C.S. Lewis did not say to himself, \\"Let us represent Jesus as He really is in our world by a Lion in Narnia.\\" His original inspiration was much less theological than that - nothing more than a mental picture. Long before he became a Christian, he had a picture in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. Decades went past, until one day he said to himself, \\"Let's try to make a story about it.\\" At first he had very little idea how the story would go. \\"But then suddenly,\\" he later wrote, \\"Aslan came bounding into it,\\" and \\"once he was there he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\\"I believe I am right that some people will now think, \\"But aren't the Chronicles of Narnia Christian at all? Doesn't Aslan die and rise again like Jesus did? Isn't that a representation of the Christian faith? If that isn't an allegory, what on earth is it?\\"Well, C.S. Lewis called the Chronicles a \\"supposition.\\" He wrote the books by saying, \\"Let us suppose such and such were true and then imagine what would happen.\\" At first this supposition did not even contain a Christian element, but after Aslan had \\"bounded into\\" Narnia, Lewis said, \\"Let us suppose that reality contained different parallel worlds, and that in one of them the Son of God, as He became Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen.\\"Now this supposition has a definite Christian element in it; the Christian element is in fact essential to it. But that does not make it an allegory. As we have seen, an allegory is trying to describe a (mostly immaterial) fact in our world by means of a picture, such as Reason being pictured as a sun-bright virgin clad in steel. Aslan, however, does not represent the immaterial God in the same way in which Lady Reason represents Reason. He is the result of a supposition. Granted the supposition, he and all the characters and events in Narnia would have been a physical reality no less than Jesus' death in first-century Palestine. Narnia is thus an imaginary world existing in its own right, having grown out of a Christian supposition, but not being an allegory of Christianity. To put it differently, Aslan is Jesus in another world; he is not an allegory of Jesus in our world.I would encourage those who still cannot see the difference to read Lewis's \\"Pilgrim's Regress.\\" Putting it side-by-side with the Chronicles of Narnia should make the distinction plain.But no matter whether you agree with Lewis's view on the question of allegory, no book shelf is complete without \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\"--or the other Narnian books, for that matter. One can read them again, and again, and again.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofThe Crack Beneath the Worldsand Other Books"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The first book in the famous allegorical Chronicles of Narnia fantasy series for children.

They assist the golden lion Aslan to defeat the White Witch who has cursed Narnia with eternal winter: the classic conflict of good vs. evil. This is the first in the Chronicles to be published. However, &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot; relates events that take place before the events in this book and many, including the publisher, suggest that individuals read that book first. I disagree. I think the series flows much better when read in the order of their publication. As one reads the series, particularly with the last volume, one become more attuned to the spiritual aspects of the tales.

LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming. Giving away the plot of the book is spoiling the pleasure of reading. And this book is definitely worth reading.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

Here each &quot;person&quot; has a vivid personality, and the listener can easily picture them in his or her mind.We've enjoyed the Focus on the Family dramatization, as well as the BBC version, in the past, but I'd prefer to hear the unabridged text of this C.S. Lewis classic fantasy, with its spiritual and allegorical undertones. We've read this story aloud several times in our family over the years, but I believe that, from now on, we'll let Michael York read it to us.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"A long time ago, four children found a magical world beyond (what they thought was) an ordinary wardrobe. This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia. I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than three hours because it was so interesting and captivating. this is now my favorite book. After I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I bought the other books in the series. I recommend that others do too. I enjoyed reading this book and then the Magician's Nephew. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is a lion that comes to save Narnia from the White Witch. Aslan is very courageous. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She made Narnia always winter but never Christmas. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were crowned Kings and Queens. Peter was crowned King Peter the Magnificent. Susan was crowned Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was crowned King Edmund the Just, and Lucy was crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch.

Tolkien, Lewis's model McDonald, and a few others achieve some variation of it, but none quite like Lewis.The story unfolds with the four Pevensie children being sent to live with an eccentric old professor in the country, in order to be out of London during the bombing. The house turns out to be as interesting as the professor, and soon the kids find their way to an alternate world where some of the animals can talk and fairy-tales come to life. Not just the fun characters, either, but witches as well, in fact one has the land of Narnia under a spell where it's \\"always winter but never Christmas\\". The kids become the focal point for a classic good versus evil struggle, but with heavy though never pedantic theological lessons. And the king of Narnia, the lion who is the son of the Emperor-over-the-Sea, is just fantastic. Highly, highly recommended for kids and adults."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"In my humble opinion, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is the finest children's story of the past century. The story contains both enormously imaginative touches combined with childlike simplicity, and the solid yet uncomplex prose belies a story of great sophistication. It also is a story intended for children, yet so respectful of their intelligence that adults can read it with equal appreciation.There should be absolutely no controversy about where this novel should come in the seven-novel sequence that comprises The Chronicle of Narnia: it is the first, and it is required to be the first both by the quality of the novel and by the way it fits into the overall structure of the series. Shifting it from the first spot in the series to the second is quite possibly the worst publishing decision of which I am aware. The justification for the change is exceedingly weak. A child wrote Lewis saying that in their opinion the series should be read beginning with THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which tells, among other things, of the creation of Narnia. Therefore, they felt that THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW should be the first and THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE second, with a subsequent reordering of the other books to reflect the chronology of Narnia instead of the kids that discover Narnia. Lewis replied that he agreed, and this agreement is used as the excuse to reorder the books. I have two huge problems with this. First, my guess is that Lewis was, as a wise adult will often do, affirming the child rather than stating his conviction that the books should be reordered. Second, even if Lewis did think the books should be reordered, it is not clear that he actually would have authorized it actually being done, nor that he would have resisted the efforts of any decent publisher to point out to him that reordering was a dreadful idea. Why? Because what is so magical about the original ordering of the series is that it focuses on the extremely subjective experience of the discovery of Narnia by children. The original order maintains a chronology based on its exploration and discovery by children and in reading the books that is going to be the concern of any child or childlike adult in reading the story. Who cares about the narrative from the standpoint of Narnia when the far greater concern is the narrative from the standpoint of children? A lesser but still pertinent criticism of the reordering is that it places one of the weakest novels in the sequence in the first position. When I first read the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEWPHEW was, along with THE SILVER CHAIR and A HORSE AND HIS BOY, the weakest stories in the sequence. Why put your worst foot forward? The Narnia books are about to be made into a series of feature films by the Disney studios, and they have quite correctly decided to film the books in the original and correct order.As noted initially, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a nearly perfect story. The manner in which the children first discover Narnia, by entering it through the back of an ordinary wardrobe, is the most exciting entrance into a magical land at least since THE WIZARD OF OZ and probably ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. What they discover is a land under the worst of all possible curses: it is always winter, but never gets to be Christmas. The land is temporarily ruled by a beautiful but evil witch who entices children with Turkish Delight. As literature it is all so delightfully perfect, and one marvels that an enormously literate Oxford don could have written it, though perhaps not so surprising when remembering that another Oxford professor, the mathematician and logician Rev. Charles L. Dodgson, wrote ALICE IN WONDERLAND under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll.Of course, Narnia isn't really ruled by the witch, but by a magnificent, enormous lion by the name of Aslan, who, as we are often reminded, is not a tame lion. Anyone reading Narnia will instant recognize a host of parallels between Aslan and Jesus, known as the Lion of Judah, but Lewis cautioned that no one should imagine Aslan a mere Christ figure: he is Lewis's conception of what Christ would have been like had he been incarnated into a magical land called Narnia as a great lion. During the course of the book Lewis retells the story of the death and resurrection of Christ through the character of Aslan, yet he ever gets to the point of preaching or dogmatism. A very close friend of mine, raised Jewish, was aware of the Christ overtones of the story, yet still declared that it was her favorite book as a child.This is also one of the books with the largest potential audience of which I know. I first read and loved it in college, but elementary school children can delight in reading it, and even younger children can love having it read to them. And it would take a pretty somber and sober adult to not be seduced by its beautiful simplicity. Absolutely no one should deny themselves the joys of exploring Narnia, but make sure you start your tour with this book and not another."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Because it is so spectacular, I'm choosing The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe to be the first book I review here at Amazon. I first fell in love with this story (and the subsequent volumes in the series) when my fifth-grade teacher read it to our class. Though it has been more than a decade since, this book has remained one of my all-time favorite works of literature, and I try to reread it once a year. It has an enchanting effect on the heart, mind and soul that never diminishes.The novel features four British children: Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy (Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) who discover a magical world hidden behind fur coats in a wardrobe. In &quot;Narnia&quot;, they encounter an endless parade of fantastic characters and events that aid them in their quest to free the land of Narnia from the spell of the White Witch. She makes winter a permanent season and turns those who oppose her into stone. The most prominent Narnians are the talking animals, but especially the lion Aslan who, with the children's help, must return spring and benevolent rule to the land.On a more analytical note, I find it fascinating how C.S. Lewis uses allegory to loosely bridge his fictional world with well-known themes and stories from the Bible. You can most easily recognize this in the ever-present battle between good and evil and the symbolic representation of Christ's Resurrection in the guise of Aslan's death and revival on the Stone Table. Which fulfills an &quot;even deeper magic from before the dawn of time.&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a modern classic that should be included in EVERYONE'S library. It will leave you completely satisfied, but at the same time craving more (which can be found in the other six volumes of the Chronicles of Narnia series). Oh, to sit and rule at Cair Paravel while munching on Turkish Delight!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The first of C.S. Lewis' beloved Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is an exciting, emotionally-charged, truly magical story. Filled with beautiful imagery, exciting battles, and heroic sacrifice, the story is a truly mesmerizing work of fiction. Most people have read it when they were very young. However, I didn't read it until recently, at the age of 21. But for me, and possibly others, it took me back to my childhood, when you believed in the magical, and the unseen. That's where the book's power lies. For the young, it is fantastical and new, while for the adults, it takes us back to our younger days.This is a fantastic story that is rightfully called one of the greatest fantasty stories of all time.Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I usually greatly dislike fantasy but I really thought that this novel, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" was interesting. The introduction of this novel was also one of the parts I thought it was interesting because of how the main character enters another part of the world and found that she had a gift. This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has. Instead of using magic like the White Witch does in Narnia, the teenager in, \\"Hatchet\\" gets his resources manually, not magically. Like all fantasy books and adventure books, the protagonists usually find that the have a specialty or a gift. I recommend this book, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" to people who likes magical places, and magical powers. People who read this novel should also like the genre, fantasy with characters that do not exist in real life. I do not recommend this book to people who are not into magical powers, or magical places."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I first encountered C.S.Lewis when 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was read aloud to my class, over the period of a term, by our teacher in 1969 when I was eight years old. Of course I, like millions of other children over the past fifty years, did not recognise the Christian parable. To us it was just a story. But now, as a forty-four year old man and a C.S.Lewis devotee, I am of course aware of it's intended 'other meaning'.However, that aside, I think back to 1969, and can clearly remember as a child, how I and my classmates received it as 'just a story'. We were absolutely enchanted. Whenever the weekly lesson started during which our teacher would read a chapter or two from the book, I remember, as she began, having butterflies in my stomach. Throughout my childhood no other literary work ever came so close to literally giving me a glimpse of magic. Although we were unaware of it's christian meaning I believe, in hindsight, that what so captivated us was indeed it's deep spirituality which reached out, through the storyline and the characters involved, and entered our very souls. I do not think it is inappropriate of me to suggest (even accounting for my partisan leanings of being a huge Lewis fan) that, whilst such literature is available, a childhood that is allowed to pass without being given a similar such glimpse of something so fundamentally enchanting, has been deprived of something very important."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This c.d. was a complete life saver on our summer driving/camping holiday. Our six year old son was completely enraptured by the characters and the plot. There were moral lessons to learn but of course fabulous evil characters, good guys and battle scenes as well. The narrator, Michael York, did a great job of giving each character a unique voice. When we paused in our listening we had plenty of fodder for some unique discussions. Infact this c.d. stood up to two rounds of listening over a two week driving trip."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and The Wardrobe is about four children whose names are Peter,Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They were sent away from their home in London to live with an old professor because of the air-raids in the war. The professor had strict rules about the house such as what not to do and where you shouldn't go. While they were at his house they decided to play hide and go seek in the house. When the youngest child Lucy decided to hide in one of the forbidden rooms, which had nothing but a large figure with a sheet over it. Lucy wanted to see what it was so she took off the sheet to find a beautiful wardrobe laying there in front of her. She decided to hide inside of it and when she opened it she found something amazing inside of the wardrobe.Which is what leads to the whole adventure of the four children.The Lion, The Witch, and The wardrobe is a great book for people who love fantasy or Lord of The Rings. This book has made me want to read more fantasy books then I ever have. If you have already read this book and you loved it they're going to make a movie out of it soon."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I'm a third grade teacher in a rural district in New York State. Each year there are books that are on my \`must read to the kids' list and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is high on that list.C.S. has done an incredible job in creating a timeless journey to an amazing fantasy land that kids just love! The struggle between good and evil has prompted many discussions after reading the book. I'm a fan, and each year the series prompts many of my students to go find the box set.

I had no idea what I was missing until I read this story several months ago. Better late than never. I can't wait to share this wonderful book with my grandchildren. From an adult's perspective the symbolism is profound. I'm so glad I took the time to read this classic. I look forward to reading the other tales of Narnia."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children, is written in a style accessible to children, or that has a narrative voice that is speaking as to children a &quot;children's book&quot;, and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults. When they do so, they often miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available. This book, and the others in this series, fall into that category, just as do &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkein, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, by James Barrie, and &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot; by Lewis Carroll, among others.This book is a delightful story, even if as a non-Christian I did find the Christian symbolism a bit heavy-handed. (The blood-sacrifice and ressurrection of the character intended as a Christ-figure was a bit much.) But even so, and in spite of a couple of minor quibbles, this book still was unquestionably a five-star delight. For those who don't have my level of discomfort with Christian symbology, it should be even more enjoyable. Certainly, if you have children, they should enjoy this story, but even if you don't, don't fail to read it for yourself. It's well worth the attention of an adult."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"When C.S.Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia, this was the first tale that he produced and not \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". There is a problem with ordering the books other than in the way that Lewis published them primarily due to the fact that the mystery of Narnia is better revealed when you read the books in this way. The reader is meant to \\"discover\\" Narnia as the children in Lewis' classic tales do.What makes these books so powerful is not necessarily the message of Christian Dogma that Lewis spent his life analyzing and lecturing on, but the incredible gift of story telling that Lewis possessed. Lewis had the ability to make the people, places, and things that he wrote about come alive and leap off the page. While reading about the fine feast served at the last stop before reaching the end of the world (in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader)one can almost taste it. One can almost see the heavy smoke curling down out of Puddleglum's pipe in \\"The Silver Chair\\", or feel as if you are actually taking tea with Tumnus in \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".I view the Chronicles of Narnia as classics of Children's Literature and something that should be apart of the reading list of any child as they reach the fourth or fifth grade. Even adults will find them to be facinating reading. Of all the works that Lewis produced fiction or non-fiction, I feel that these are the works that he will be best remembered for."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardobe is a very good book.

This book is second in a series called &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, which happens to be one of the only children's stories written by C.S. Lewis. Lewis was famous for his Christian writings, which holds evident is this book for he relates to the story of Jesus Christ throughout it's entire theme. This is done through the symbolism of many of the characters (Alsan to Jesus; the White Witch to Satan) and themes (good vs. evil). These observations may not be evident to children, but it makes an excellent reading for them and adults alike. Aside from the symbolism, the story is timeless and magical as it lets a child's imagination wander and sparks the child within us."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this book when I was about six and I have loved it so much that I have read it about eight times.

Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I never read them as a child, but then again I stem from the third world, where these occurrences are not unusual. After watching the movie, I decided to give the book a try. At first I was unsure where to start the series, as there is still a debate as to which order the books should be read in, but I went with the first book in the series that was published, as this made the most sense to me.I am so very glad that I picked up \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\"! The book is actually tiny - less than 200 pages, with illustrations - but packed full of adventure. Most people are familiar with plot, but for those fellow \\"third-world-ers\\" I will rehash some of it. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are four siblings in the WWII England, who get sent to a kindly professor's house in the country to be safe from the German air-raids. They are amazed by the size of the house, and decide to explore it on rainy days. During one of those days Lucy, the youngest sibling, entered a room that contained only a wardrobe. Upon entering the wardrobe, behind the coats, Lucy encountered a different world, with snow and woods and a lamp post.Lucy ended up meeting a Faun called Mr. Tumnus - a half man, half goat, who introduced Lucy to Narnia, the world that she entered, a world ruled by a White Witch, who called herself the Queen of Narnia. Of course, the one true King is Aslan, the giant talking Lion, who is planning on returning to Narnia and bring Christmas and then spring and summer back with him. In order to do this, Aslan needs to fill the four thrones in the castle currently occupied by the White Witch. The four thrones can only be occupied by humans, as foretold by a prophecy.Lucy returned to her world via the same wardrobe. On a different day, while trying to escape the grumpy housekeeper and a group of tourists going around the professor's house, all four siblings hide in the wardrobe. Not believing Lucy's Narnia story before, the siblings are surprised and apologetic when they, too, end up in Narnia. Deferring to Lucy as a way of apology, all the siblings go with Lucy to meet Mr. Tumnus. They are all surprised to see Mr. Tumnus missing and his place raided, as they find out that Mr. Tumnus was arrested by the White Witch for abetting humans.The White Witch found out about Mr. Tumnus' nefarious activities through Edmund, who entered Narnia on his own while one day looking for Lucy. Edmund met the White Witch, who gave him Turkish Delight. The food was enchanted, and Edmund wanted more of it. The White Witch promised Edmund rooms full of Turkish Delight if he brought his siblings with him the next time he was in Narnia.This is just the beginning. The children end up meeting Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them go to Aslan, while Edmund (believing the White Witch was not that bad), escaped to the castle, where he got imprisoned by the White Witch, who then took Edmund on a harrowing journey of looking for Peter, Susan and Lucy. But the snow is already melting, and the spring is coming, so the Witch needs to hurry, as the prophecy is about to be fulfilled, which would mean the death of the Witch.Ah, this book was such a pleasure to read! Lewis wrote this book as a story for his god-daughter Lucy, and at first intended the story to be just that - a story and not a series. The book is written very simply - one can easily imagine the author telling it to a bunch of kids, adding asides for dramatic effect or as a way of explanation. Although the book is written in a very simple language, its plot is actually quite complicated and covers amazingly well developed characters in such a short span.Lewis, who was a good friend of Tolkien, was truly a master of the genre, as this children's book is so well loved by adults, as it has themes that can translate to any age. \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is also the simplest of all the books in the series, as far as language is concerned, as it was obviously originally intended for a very specific and small audience. I am very glad that the book found a larger audience than that. The book is wonderful in that it teaches courage, loyalty, forgiveness, strength, endurance and sacrifice, among other things, while immersing the reader in a plot in which they cheer and sit at the edge of their seat. The illustrations propel the reader into the world of Narnia, and illuminate all that our adult imagination might have forgotten.All in all, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a fantastic children's fantasy book, that would be very hard to match, and that, one can safely say, serves as a basis and a starting point for all fantasy writers of today. And well it should, as Lewis was one of the masters, and \\"The Lion...\\" was just one taste. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S.

Brought to a mysteriously large mansion, the children wander throught it finding an enormous wardrobe in which they enter to find a lamp post in the middle of the frozen Narnia. Lucy befriends a faun named Mr. Tumnus who saves Lucy's life, but is captured by the Queen. Edmund betrays the party when the witch offers him sweets and tells all his secrets that could endanger his family. Discovering the truth that the witch is not the true queen of Narnia, the children try to find Aslan and be taken to the throne to become the kings and queens. Aslan later saves Edmund ,but the witch claims that according to the \\"Deep Magic,\\" every traitor belongs to her and everything that belongs to her, she has a right to kill. Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund and is brought back to life according to the \\"Deeper Magic,\\" saying that if someone else is killed in place of a traitor,he is brought back. The witch is defeated by Aslan and the children grow up as Kings and queens of Narnia. When they return to the lamp post, the find their way back through the wardrobe and return to the mansion as children again.What I liked about the book was that it was creative and full of hooks that pull you in. Narnia is locked up in winter, but the story is so intriguing that it pulls you all the way to the key. You journy with Aslan. \\"Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for he remembered as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.\\" The book keeps on repeating this line in the begining and even though it isn't very important, it somehow hooks you in and then you really start enjoying what happens in Narnia and how it makes you want to be in the adventure with them. The land is magical in the human world as it is in Narnia because it had the wardrobe in it and it seem as though something magical was driveing the children into Narnia.Lucy is my favorite character because she is pure and innocent. She plays fair and is always honest and when Mr.Tumnus was captured, she tried her best to try to help him because he saved her life. \\"We can't just go home, not after this. It is on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble...We simply must rescue him.\\" All of this showed Lucy's kind nature and caring heart.My favorite part of the book is when the four children are at the Beaver's house/dam to eat dinner. The description of the food makes my mouth water. I love the food and it always makes me hungry. The author does a long description of the dinner and how it smells, taste, and what they eat. Potatoes, fish, bread, and butter just made me feel weak and the loving detail didn't help. It isn't a very important part but it was my favorite part out of the book."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I grew up reading The Chronicles of Narnia and these books are a part of who I am.

They are fascinated with the mansion that they move in to, and decide to do some exploring inside. In one of the rooms, they notice an old Wardrobe, and everyone except Lucy move on to the other rooms. Lucy, being most inquisitive, decides to open the wardrobe and step inside, not knowing that she is entering another world. Seeing all the wonderment of the mew world and meeting a new friend, she comes back to tell the others. Initially, they don't believe her, but once day, they all enter the wardrobe and into the World of Narnia. However, Mr. Tumnus, Lucy's friend has been made a prisoner by the evil witch of Narnia and it is up to the children to save Mr. Tumnus and make the land a happy place again.This was a delightful book to read. The simple language will make both adults and children enjoy the story. You get to meet interesting characters like Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, Mr. Tumnus, the witch, and of course Aslan, the all-powerful lion and protector of Narnia. You meet the good and the bad, and get to see who wins the final battle between the two.This book has comedy, adventure, battles, sorcery and much more that will keep you interested throughout! A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"My fourth grade class has recently read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe(The Chronicles of Narnia) by C.S.Lewis. It is a fantasy book about two brothers and two sisters who find another world call Narnia through the back of their wardrobe.Edmund, one of the children, is an evil and greedy character. Peter is a brave and courageous boy. Susan is also brave. Lucy is the main character. She does cry a lot but is also courageous.The main characters of Narnia are Aslan, the King of Narnia, who is also a lion, the White Witch of Narnia who thinks she is the Queen of Narnia, and Maugrim, the White Witch's secret, chief of police. Mr. Tumnus, the fawn, helps the good characters on their journey.The beginning of the book takes place in the home of the children. When they find that the wardrobe lets them through to another place, they stay in Narnia for most of the rest of the book, Edmund is an evil double crosser who goes back and forth between the bad and good. He spies for the Witch. Peter is a strong fighter in the battles against the Witch. Even though Susan is a girl, she still fights. Lucy, with her dagger, fights too. The fight is to get Narnia back from the evil, White Witch.Aslan was banished from Narnia by the White Witch. He comes back to Narnia to get his rightful place and meets the children. Together they fight the Witch.If you like fantasy stories and books that have a lot of description and similes, I think you should read \\"The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". Just a warning, it might have a little too much dialogue but it is still a great book."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"According to Amazon, this is the 335th review posted on CS Lewis's first book in the Chronicles of Narnia series, so I would only make one observation. My son, not quite five years old, listened to the story of how Aslan the Lion allowed himself to be killed in the place of others and then rose from the dead. I then asked him, 'Who else did that?' My son then smiled and said, quite of his own accord, 'Jesus.' That is the power and the value of C.S. Lewis's storytelling. We can't wait to read the other six Narnia books!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Even if you have read this as a kid, you should take the time to read or listen to it again. You will have an entirely new perspective on it, and the writing style is still engaging. I plan to keep these CDs around for my kids."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Ok so I'm one of those people that saw the movie first. I've tried to read this book 2 times now. Although short, I just had trouble staying interested in it. I thought the movie was excellent. Normally the books are better than the movie, but in my case I don't think so. I know it's a children's book but it reads very childish to me. This is the main reason I just couldn't stick with it.My reason for 4 stars and not less, it was a great movie and it takes a great book to make a great movie. I'd suggest this to all readers, it's fast and was fairly easy to read. But don't watch the movie first."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I had no idea this was a prequel to a series until my senior year of high school. One of these days I'll have the time to read the rest of them, but I read this one in high school, being familiar with the 1979 cartoon version.This was a fantastic book written in a colorful way. It doesn't have illustrations and doesn't need them. Those with good imaginations can easily picture the world of Narnia and get a real feel for all the wonderful characters inside."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I put the series in my TBR pile when it dawned on me that I'd never read them. My kids have, and I'd read this one aloud to them several times, but it seemed like a cultural thing I was missing out on, so in they went. The Lemony Snicket books are in there, too.I have no idea what to say about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe that hasn't been said. I don't even know how I feel about it, because the story's so very familiar. There's the heavy-handed Christian allegory, I suppose, which doesn't take much to uncover. And there's really not a lot of depth to it, nor are the characters all that well-developed.But it is, after all, a children's story, a fast-moving tale of adventure and imagination, and Good vs. Evil. Hopefully, I'll have more to say on the subsequent books, which are new to me.One aside: reading this always brings to mind my daughter's kindergarten best friend, who maintained that she did have a doorway to Narnia in her bedroom closet. This frustrated my realist daughter no end, because she couldn't convince her friend that it was just a story."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Few reading experiences are richer and more delightful than taking another trip into Narnia, especially when doing so via the mysterious wardrobe. C.S. Lewis's enchanting fairy tale is warm, beautiful, and inspiring with every read. I have personally read it four times in my adult life. (I never read it as a child.) And I could probably read it at least forty more times.In this story Lewis enables the reader to step into the shoes of Peter, Edmund, Susan, or Lucy -- whichever character you find is most like you, or whichever one has the tightest grip on you. Things like childhood fancy and fun, sibling rivalry, betrayal, sacrifice, and redemption all play crucial roles in this tale. And it's presented in such a way that a child and adult alike can both learn and understand.Many readers intrigued by the Gospel allegory the book is so famous for will not be disappointed. But many may be disappointed by the allusion to Adam having a wife before Eve named Lilith. This may be a turn-off to some, and I will not defend Mr. Lewis in this area. But I will say that it is a story and should never take the place of the Word of God. Parents and educators would do well to keep this in mind should the matter come up.In other words, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is not a book about theology or a commentary on the Bible. But it is a fantastic example of what happens when the major themes of the Scriptures are mixed with classic fairy-tale telling and quality children's literature."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of four children that stumble into a wardrobe... the magical door to another world.

After good conquers evil they grow up there and become kings and queens of the land until one day they stumble back into the magic wardrobe to find themselves back on the same day they left many years before.

It is very well written, never short of any details, and I couldn't wait to see what happened each time. It kept my interest throughout the enitre book.It is quite easy to imagine Aslan, the four children, the beavers, the white witch, and all the characters. And each character has a distinct personality. You learn to adore Lucy and Susan, and you learn how brave Peter is, and you can't help but to dislike Edmund. And I kind of wish Edmund wouldn't have gone to the witch, but every detail of the book is important. There is a lesson to be learned about sacrifice, understanding, and love. Aslan is the forefront of those lessons in this book.In my opinion, the book was written perfectly. It got all kinds of feelings and emotions from me. I do recommend this book for yourself and your young reader.And if you haven't seen the movie yet, definitely read the book first.Thanks."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I never encountered Lewis's books as a child in the 50s and was glad to be spurred to read this one recently for a children's book discussion group. I was a little disappointed with it, after hearing about it for so many years. The language isn't great, and the boy/girl roles seemed so conventional--dated anyway. One scene in the book is fantastic, however; it's the one of Aslan's crucifixion and resurrection, metaphorically disguised.Take Me With You When You Go"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a wonderful novel. CS Lewis tells a tale of love and redemption in the land of Narnia. The four Pevensie children wander through a wardrobe into the winterland of Narnia, and discover that the curse of the Witch has made for perpetual winter. And younger brother Edmund is seduced by the power of the witch.But the Pevensie children, along with their faithful friends, turn to Aslan, Lord of the Wood for help. Aslan ends up dying for Edmund's sin of betrayal, but he comes back to life to conquer the evil witch and her army.For the most part, if you've seen the film, you'll see that it did a pretty good job of following the novel, with a few exceptions.

When I was a child, I enjoyed it for the action and story, but as I got older, really started to grasp between the lines. CS Lewis is definitely an amazing author and his entire Narnia set is a classic and a must for anyone's collection."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Out of all the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" books, the first published is also one of the strongest of the series; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is a fantasy book, about a land called Narnia, where all sorts of imaginary creatures live; mythological creatures, magical beasts, talking animals and so forth. Four children enter it through a magical door in a wardrobe, and are soon drawn into a sort of power play between the supernatural lion Aslan, and the White Witch Jadis, who's been claiming the right to rule Narnia for many years; turning dissenters to stone. By the numbers, it's clear that Aslan is more powerful, but the Witch is clever, and knows many tricks. It's the type of story we've heard a number of times before, and if you don't care for allegory, you can skip to the last two paragraphs now.In the past, I've said that Narnia is mainly more protestant than Catholic, but I may need to re-evaluate that, because the symbolism in this book is positively sacramental in nature at many points. When mice nibble ropes off of Aslan as he lies on a stone table, there's a eucharistic image to be seen there, of eating the body of Christ on an altar (since Aslan is clearly Jesus in lion form.) On top of this, the sacrament of confession is nearly mentioned. After being rescued, Edmund spends time talking to Aslan in private, and afterwards, everyone is told that there's no need to \\"talk about what is past.\\" A discussion with the savior in a private place, and the forgiveness of sins? What else could it be, but reconciliation?I also think it's interesting that the oldest boy, and the one who's clearly the group's leader, is named Peter. This aspect of the bible; the primacy of Saint Peter among the apostles, is only rarely admitted outside of the Catholic Church, and their king and queenship would seem to be an allegory for both heaven, and the church.Apart from this, the book's storyline seems to be a clear allegory of the passion and death of Our Lord, with Aslan as Jesus, and the White Witch standing in for Satan. Lucy and Susan are the holy women. Still, some of the roles aren't as easy to fit in as all that. Edmund seems to have aspects of both Saint Peter (betraying and being forgiven) and Judas (selling people out for a promised reward.) However, neither role is really precise, which may be for the best. It gives the story a flavor of originality, which it might not have had otherwise.In particular, this book's main premise; of a \\"Deep Magic,\\" which even Aslan must never break is perhaps the clearest allegory of all; representing something that most modern people want to ignore; Natural Law. Too many people want to just wander off and do their own thing, and forget that even if the law allows them to do certain things, the natural law, and the final judge are still there, and they can still run afowl of them. Even God's will for our salvation only has so much leeway when it comes to transgressions of the natural law, and that's one thing that Lewis gets absolutely right.However, there's also one point near the very end, where I sort of winced as well. It's a few pages into the last chapter, when everyone is seated on thrones. Aslan uses the words \\"Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen.\\"Not only does this prove to be false later in the series, but the phrase itself sounds dangerously like \\"once saved, always saved,\\" a belief held by many protestant denominations, but not by the Catholic Church. Still, it would have been worse if it had got beyond just being a simple phrase.As a book of fiction, it's entertaining, but more if you know your myths. It's good for children, and unlike most books in the series, has a strong, frightening villain, with a major role in the plot, which only makes the rest of the story that much more exciting. It has some weak points with respect to pure storytelling style, but not much more so than most children's books.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe may be the best fictional storybook out there for Christian children. It's fun, exciting and packed with the sentiments of the faith. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is very fascinating.

This is the first \\"real book\\" -- i.e., a book that couldn't be read easily in one sitting -- that my daughter and I have shared. It was a really great first.I never read The Chronicles of Narnia as a child, nor had them read to me. While the first few chapters held my daughter's attention, I wasn't exactly impressed. I thought the writing was a bit clumsy, a little too heavy on 1940s British vernacular. I also thought the characters -- the children at this point -- were poorly developed. However, once the kids are in Narnia \\"for good,\\" the entire tone of the book changes, as does the writing quality. Particularly, the scenes near the end are very well-written, exciting, and evoke a lot of emotion. My daughter would always want two chapters before bedtime, and as the book drew to a close, I'd want to read her a third or fourth!We are now reading Prince Caspian, which I'm told is really the second book in the series (although the books have been reordered after the fact, so that even The Lion, The Witch and, the Wardrobe is no longer Book 1), and we plan to go through the whole series. Many people consider the Chronicles series to be some of the greatest books ever written -- adults, I'm talking about. I don't think I agree with that at all, as I don't think I'd really care to read them on my own.

The story's about a family of four young Londoners being sent away by their parents to the countryside mansion of a professor to escape the German bombing of London. Soon after arriving at the mansion,Lucy (one of the children) discovers a magical wardrobe that leads to a place called Narnia. She convinces the other three (Edmund, Susan, and Peter) to come with her, and from there their adventures start. The story begins at the Professor's mansion. While exploring the mansion during a Hide-and Seek game, Lucy finds a spare room with a wardrobe in it.

Then, a couple of days later, Edmund goes into the wardrobe and he runs into the White Witch. She bribes him to come with her back to her palace. She asks him if he has any other brothers or sisters and he says yes. So then she sends him back to get them. When he comes back without them, she gets very angered. Read the rest of this great book to see what happens next."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis are great children's books. They are easy to read and interesting. In The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, it starts out with Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter having to go live with their uncle because of the war and air raids from Germany. One day while playing hide and seek in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and finds herself in another world; Narnia. She meets a fawn and becomes friends with him. He warns Lucy of the White Witch warning her of her power. When Lucy returns to her world, her siblings don't believe her but later on all hide in the wardrobe and walk into Narnia. Edmund betrays his siblings and sides with the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. They run around, following Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, trying to hide from the White Witch while trying to meet Aslan, the lion at the Stone Table. Aslan talks to Edmund and settles for him to never betray them again. The queen does not want the children to be in Narnia because of the prophecy that says that four people will take over Narnia and overthrow the queen. There is a battle over Narnia between the children and the Witch. The children win and become the rulers of Narnia.Unlike most books it is interesting from the beginning, and keeps you interested. I usually don't like fantasy fiction books, but this is a good one. There are adventures involved, which can get children into a book. I didn't get the characters mixed up as I usually do in a book. The story is descriptive enough to get a picture in your head but doesn't go on for three pages about the scenery.I read this book when I was in about 6th grade, and honestly I enjoyed it more now as a teenager because I understood more of it. I would not usually pick up a book for fun and read it, but I would recommend this book to readers because it is simple and to the point, and interesting. I have the sequels and may read those to find out what happens next in Narnia."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Set early in World War II, four children are evacuated from their home in London, which is being bombed by the German airforce and rockets. They are sent to the country residence of a wise old professor. There Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund find that they have \`fallen on their feet' as the house and its grounds are delightful. Most amazing of all (of all the things they discover, that is), one room contains a wardrobe which may allow entry to a land called Narnia, a land of myth made alive, full of creatures of legend, and ruled by a wicked queen whose magic makes it always winter. The talking beasts have taken sides, fearful or greedy ones like the wolves have turned bad and sided with the witch. But many who seem weaker remain loyal to the memory of before the witch's rule and to the true ruler of Narnia who is Aslan the great lion. And now the coming of the four children sets in motion the fulfilment of an old prophecy which gives hope to the true Narnians, and puts fear into the heart of the witch. If the four children take all four thrones that wait empty in the castle of Cair Paravel, they will become the kings and queens of Narnia, and the witch will be thrown down. So there will be war in Narnia too.How can four children who have escaped from one terror hope to win against a clever and cruel witch of such power? All their courage and all their strength is required, and the help of all are willing to aid them. They will need weapons magical and weapons plain. Even the sheer power of Aslan cannot be used to simply destroy the witch as it becomes clear that the magic by which he made Narnia follows the laws of deep magic, which are part of the nature of Aslan himself. Even he must obey his own nature, which in Narnia governs everything as the laws are a part of the existence of the land itself. Now the witch, for all her cleverness, does not understand magic as well as she imagines, and in her haste to capture and kill Edmund and prevent the prophecy coming true, she makes a bargain of which no-one can see where it will lead except Aslan himself.This was written first of the seven in the Narnia series and overall it is best read first. It is the easiest to read, and a five-year old can understand the story quite well if read out by an adult. It is probably best to read \`Prince Caspian' next in the series as it was written second, and all four children appear in this story. \`The Magician's Nephew' was written sixth in the series, and it explains how Narnia was created, and is a superb story. But none of Peter, Susan, Lucy, or Edmund appear in it as it is before their time. Also, the language in it is somewhat harder than that in \`Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe'.The Narnia books are not allegories, this is the wrong word for them. In an allegory, each character, and often each place, stands for one other thing. The names of these characters almost always give away what they stand for. A good (in fact the best) example of an allegory is \`The Pilgrim's Progress' by John Bunyan, where there are characters called \`Christian' and \`Hope' and \`Mr Worldly Wise', and places names like \`Vanity Fair' and \`The Slough of Despond'. There are many others, the Greek legends, Aesop's Fables, and fairy stories often work like this. Narnia stories are magical, mythical, parallel world stories but not allegory. The characters are living characters in their own right, they do not stand \`one-for-one' as things or symbols. The stories do contain symbols and meanings, but then so do all stories, or they would not be called stories. The other thing you cannot call the characters is metaphors, they live and breath and develop in their own world. All language is metaphorical. The sentence \`I see what you mean', is metaphorical. A blind man can \`see what you mean', it does not take eyes to \`see' meaning. So, what are the Narnia books? They are a \`thought experiment' in a magical world. All stories are thought experiments, or they would not be called stories. The only question is, what type?C.S. Lewis was a Christian, was converted around the age of thirty, and he knew what stories appealed to the non-Christian as well as the Christian. He was exceptionally clever, even for an Oxford don and Cambridge professor. He knew how to appeal to \`hearts and minds'. That is why these stories are so popular, they ring so true. It is easy to be attracted to the goodness of the good characters in them whoever you are and whenever you are in life's journey. The \`good dreams' which the ancient Greeks captured in their myths and legends attracted him, and that is why they reappear here. The things they did not understand well are all overshadowed in the light of a greater myth, the myth of Narnia. What the Greeks saw, in part and broken up, is seen here - brighter and more full of life. More of the good, better woven together. Because we have greater light, it does not mean that they did not do as well as they could with the light they had.It is hard to create really exciting good characters in books, often the bad characters are more exciting--many books of magical tales have dynamic villians and wishy-washy cardboard good guys (it is not so hard to think of some). C. S. Lewis is one of the greats, and the mark of it is that his good characters really are."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I didn't read this book when I was younger, but I enjoyed it very much!

LewisReviewed by:R.AjocPeriod: 1The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best book that Clive Staples Lewis has created. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is about Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund in their guardians home because of war in thier homeland. One day as their playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a giant wardrobe and stumbles into a mysterious land that her friend, Mr. Tumnus calls Narnia. Lucy is very astonished that she has found this new fantasy world inside of her guardian, Professor Kirke. Lucy tries to tell everyone yet no one believes anything that lucy says. Then Edmund, the bratty one in the family happens to also find Narnia, Edmund being the brat that he is tells everyone, and no one believes him. Then all of them go into the wardrobe for the first time and nothing happenes, then tries later thier in the snowy world of Narnia, and they all see Mr. Tumnus, as sneaky Edmund runs off with the white witch. Now the others Lucy, Susan, and Peter must find the White Witch and defeat her with the mighty lion, Aslan.The whole plot of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is to start of the real beggining of The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book. C.S. Lewis starts off the great fantasy world, Narnia with a great hit. Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe has already been created into a movie. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book because it features many scenes while you read where you can just sink into and get lost in, especially the part during the war.This book is a very good book, although I am not a very big fan of fantasy books but Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best fantasy book I have ever read and probably the one and only best book in the series. This book is special because of the way you feel as you read it, it is as if your actually in the fantasy world of Narnia as your reading, like your running right behind Aslan as you run, or like your on flying on a dragon, such as on Dragon Rider. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is one of the best fantasy books to have hit book shelves.My favorite part of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is during the end when there is a big battle for who will win the land of Narnia The White Witch or Aslan, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This part took alot of imagination, and it really helps you picture the war in your head. As Aslan revivies from the brutal killing ceremony from The White Witch Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund are surprised to see that Aslan is still alive. This part of the story showed that you can never die, your body may die but your soul lives on. Aslan's role in this part of the story is very strong, you can feel that C.S. Lewis is trying to send you messages in a fantasy book, while your using your imagination and thinking of how the story is going on in your head."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I liked reading The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe.

Lewis wrote in the Chronicles of Narnia series in the early 1950's. The story is of the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. The children are sent into the country during the bombing raids on London in World War II. The children arrive at the estate of the eccentric Professor Kirke. On a rainy day with nothing to do the children decide to play a game of hide and seek. As the children are hiding Lucy stumbles upon a room whose only contents are a blueglass bottle and and old wardrobe. Lucy chooses the wardrobe for a hiding place however as she manuevers through it she is magically transported to the land of Narnia, where it is always winter but never Christmas. In Narnia she meets the faun, Mr. Tumnus who tells her of the White Witches magical enchantment over Narnia and of the prophecy of Cair Parivel/Aslan's return which will bring the reign of the White Witch to its end. This is as far as I am going to go in giving away the plot of the book. This book is Number 2 in the series the Chronicles of Narnia. I would suggest when reading the books to read them in the order which Lewis wrote them. This story will delight both young and old alike.

But not one of the four children could have ever imagined that they would be transported to a strange, faraway land known as Narnia. Lucy is the first to discover the strange place, when she looks into a wardrobe, and is quickly walking through ankle-deep snow, and cavorting with a Faun named Tumnus. When she returns from her journey, she is shocked to find that her older siblings think she is making up lies, and even more shocked to find that Edmund - who discovers Narnia and the White Witch at a later time - lies when his siblings question about his journey there. But when all four children find their way to the strange land, and find that Lucy's friend, Tumnus, has been seized by the White Witch, the four children believe that it is their duty to rescue him, and quickly find themselves immersed in adventure, statues, talking animals, a great lion, and a battle.I have heard about THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA for years, and while I saw the BBC version of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE years ago, I never read the book. That is, until I heard about the new Disney film being created from this book. I found that from page one I was deeply immersed in this story, and interested to find what would happen to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - all very enjoyable characters, by the way. C.S. Lewis weaves an enchanting story that will keep readers enamored for hours, as they accompany the four youngsters on their adventures through the mystical land of Narnia. A fascinating story that will enchant readers of all ages - especially those who accompanied Alice through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll's ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"After reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time at age 31, I sat and asked myself what I really thought of it. I think one of the main things that I felt was disappointment. Not in the book itself, but mainly with myself for not reading it when I was much younger. I truly enjoyed the tale that Lewis has woven, but I think that a lot of the magic is lost by reading it for the first time as an adult.The story itself is solid and I enjoy the narrative tone of it and the references back to the reader by the author as he tells his tale. As an adult, I did notice a fair amount of simplicity in the writing (I'm used to reading novels with much more detail) but not in a negative way. Overly wordy and descriptive narrative can sometimes undermine the smooth flow of a simple story line, and that might have been the case here had Lewis gotten too detailed.I am looking forward to continuing my maiden voyage into Narnia and am eagerly waiting to see what adventures lie ahead."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones. This time we started with the first book, which I think is named \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than \\"Wardrobe.\\" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.But returning to \\"Wardrobe\\" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from \\"Nephew,\\" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the \\"Narnia\\" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,\\" and from me that is saying worlds.J.

This printing uses the original text from the British edition of the book, rather than include the changes that C.S. Lewis made prior to the publication of the American edition.In 1950, C. S. Lewis's first book of The Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was published. This book would later be considered the 2nd in the series' internal chronology. If you are coming to this book after seeing the movie version as I did, you will find that it is aimed at a younger audience. This book serves well as an introduction to the fantasy genre for young readers. At a little under 200 pages, it is a fairly quick read. In 2001, it was nominated for the Retro Hugo for novels published in the year 1950.The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie) who are sent out of London during World War II to the English midlands to keep them safe. There they stay in a Professor's large house. While exploring the house, they find a room with just a single Wardrobe in it, which Lucy soon finds sometimes acts as a doorway to Narnia.The other children don't believe her at first, but later when trying to hide from the housekeeper they are all find themselves in the mystical land of Narnia. They find that Narnia is in a perpetual winter without Christmas, caused by the White Witch who claims to be the Queen of Narnia. They soon learn that they are prophesized to bring an end to the evil of the White Witch, and they learn of Aslan, a great lion and leader who has returned to the land and who is the true King of Narnia.Much has been written of the use of Christian themes which run through the story. Some of them are quite obvious, such as the references to the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, and the winters without Christmas. Others are a bit more subtle such as the betrayal, death, and resurrection stories. Lewis also drew on other mythology though, such as Norse and Greek in some of the creatures which inhabit Narnia. In any event, the Christian themes are not too heavy handed, and the book can easily be enjoyed by readers of any faith for what it is, a fantasy.The overall result is a fun light read for young readers. As the age of the reader goes up, the amount of enjoyment will undoubtedly go down, as this story lacks the detail and texture which can be found in Lewis's contemporary's work \\"The Hobbit\\" by J. R. R. Tolkien. There are also some rather odd passages in the book, such as references to problems with Edmund which had never been discussed earlier and an inconsistency with regards to repeated travels to Narnia. These flaws are minor though, and this work is deservedly considered a classic."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.

Peter, the oldest, Susan, the second oldest, Edmund, the second youngest, and Lucy, the youngest were all sent to a country house to live with professor Kirke, during the war.They went to live in a humongous old mansion, where only an old professor and his maid, Mrs. Macready. One day, they were playing hide and seek, when Lucy, the youngest, found a spare room, empty like many other rooms in the house. The only difference was that this was not a completely empty room, but there was a wardrobe in it, and as soon as she entered the room, she was astonished with the wardrobe, there was something different about it. It was an old wardrobe with many drawings on it, and she thought it was a very beautiful wardrobe. They were still playing hide and seek, so, she hid inside the wardrobe, and she kept on going further in, until she thought to herself, \\"this must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\\" She had been walking through coats which didnt let her see what was in front of her, but she felt something cold under her feet, and wet. Soon, there were no more coats, instead, there were branches of trees on her face. She was shocked when she saw that she was in the middle of a wood and it was winter. She had entered the world of Narnia, and there she had incredible adventures and she even met Mr. Tumnus, a faun.When she came back to Earth, what seemed to heve lasted many hours in Narnia, didnt take any time at all, here on Earth.

A vast war, a hideous queen, talking animals, a never-ending winter, and a mysterious prophecy. That is what C.S Lewis brings to life in his masterpiece, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe. He winds all of these supernatural events into one captivating tale, which is absolutely unbelievable.The magic all begins when four young children, Peter, Susan, Lucy, and their mischievous brother Edmund, discover a thrilling new land inside of a wardrobe called Narnia! Yet, the only problem is the White Witch is attempting to take over Narnia, by casting a spell over the entire land, and she plans to kill Aslan (the real king) in the process. It may sound like a short, typical story, but there are many, many more details. For instance, how Lucy meets a friendly faun (half goat, half man) and quickly befriends him. As soon as the other siblings enter the world of Narnia, they learn that the faun was taken captive (along with Edmund, but that appears later on). Oh, and when the children discover some talking beavers, they also discover a mystifying prophecy. And then how the White Witch's wolves (lead by the wolf Maugrim) soon find the beavers and the children, but luckily they do overcome the wolves. And did I mention a harsh, epic battle comes up between the Queen's Minotaurs and trolls, and Aslan's fauns and centaurs? Well, that happens too! Join the four children on their glorious adventure in the world on the other side of the wardrobe.However, sometimes a book's moral is more important than its events, and the moral in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that if you stay positive, cheerful, and if you forgive those who disobeyed you, you will always succeed. For example, Edmund ran away to the White Witches abode, and she took him captive, yet when he returned his brother and sisters forgave him.All in all, this book was a numinous fairy tale, which has every thing to do with family, loyalty, and absolute excellence. C.S. Lewis did it again, with his work of art, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. But, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was not his only masterpiece. He also wrote more books, all part of the series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" including The Magician's Nephew, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, and many more!!Read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and discover the magical land of Narnia!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The lion, the witch, and the wardrobeI'd like to introduce this book to you!

In this book the theme is pretty much the same. It's magical. It's magical because Lucy finds Narnia in a wardrobe. The witch can make hot coco and Turkish delight with a flick. She can also freeze people. But the lion can unfreeze people with a blow of his breath. Now don't you think that's magical? Well I do.Now let's talk about the characters. First of all you would do the same thing as them. Well Lucy explores Narnia and talks to strange animals. Edmond talks to the witch and takes hot coco and Turkish delight from her. Peter not believing in Narnia but later becomes a king of the magical world. Then you have Susan who becomes a Queen of Narnia, but also helps the lion live. Now wouldn't you have done the same thing as them? Well I would have.Well now let's talk about what Narnia looks like. Well Narnia is a very wintry place. It has a lot of snow and it's very cold. It's also very icy. Well that's because there is a big river between Narnia and Aslam. Aslam is where the lion lives. That place is a very springy place. It's grassy and very warm. And it's very beautiful there just like Narnia.Well that's about it, one more thing though. Over all I hope you enjoy and like this book as much as I did.

The Narnia they find is locked in winter,under the spell of the White Witch. Edmund is captured, so the children, along withAslan, must save him, and the whole of Narnia. I would recommend this book to anyone.This book, along with the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series teaches verygood morals (the book was written by a Sunday school teacher). One of the morals itteaches is forgiveness. Peter and the others could have given up on Edmund forbetraying them, but they forgive him. And, the book teaches bravery, as was displayedthroughout the entire book, especially by Aslan.The religion implied in this book is very obvious. In the book, Lewis has madeAslan their god. In the book, Aslan came back to save Narnia, as the Christian \\"god\\" issaid will do. And, Aslan is very powerful, as we might expect a god to be.The Aslan character in this book is very interesting. As stated above, it is obviousthat Lewis has made him the god of Narnia. But, though he rises back, he dies forEdmund, who had betrayed the others.This book is good for anyone looking to read a good fiction. It was very exciting,and kept me reading. Also, many Christians would enjoy reading this book, to see all ofthe religion that is in the book. This was a very good book, along with the rest of theChronicles of Narnia series.-Bill L"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I think The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was an exciting book about four English children who find a secret door into Narnia.

Lewis is an excellent but easy, read chapter book. I recommend this book to people of all ages because they can either read it by themselves or get it read to them. People who like adventure type books and chapters that leave you thinking, then this book is the book for you. Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter, the main characters, get sent to a far away home because of the London war. Later Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads to a secret place. In this secret place there is a White Witch that makes it always winter. Lucy, Susan, and Peter have to get to the Stone Table to meet Aslan to fight the White Witch, to try and get their brother back.Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan made the Chronicles of Narnia very interesting because the characters were detailed by the author and he told a lot about them. Peter is the oldest and he tries to keep everybody together and try to help them. Susan is the second oldest. She helps Peter take care of Lucy and Edmund too. Lucy is the youngest. She is very cute and funny. Edmund is the next youngest. He tends to boss Lucy around. The characters all turn out to help each other in the end.Next, the theme of the book helped bring the characters together to fight the White Witch. The characters went through a lot of change of the different worlds, seasons, and the people who the characters had to live with. The book was terrific because of the theme of the book.The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a different type of book which made the setting tell a lot about what happened where. The book is in a different world so it makes you think in a different way. The wardrobe is wooden and filled with fur coats. The woods were filled with animals that are mostly in a fantasy book. The time frame is the present and in about one to two days. The author describes the book so much and well that it looks like the time frame is in weeks.Therefore I believe that this book is all about change. The characters go through different changes during the book. The characters are different then other characters in other books because all of the animals in the book talk. The setting describes where they are all of the time very well. Every one of those things helps make this novel very splended."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the WardrobeIn the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S.

Which is called Narnia and along the way one meats a lady that has strange powers. The kids have to save Narnia the Lady doesn't want them too so she try's to kill them. I recommend the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe for all ages because it has adventure, action pack, and funny.The four main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. One statement about the characters is. Peter is the oldest and he is trying to be the leader but he finds out it is hard work. Susan is the seconded oldest she is trying to be the smartest and trying to keep the family together. Edmund is trouble but he wants to do good. Lucy is showing faith, Loyalty, trust to her friends and family.The theme of the book was based on power. The main power was between Aslan and the White Witch. Alsan was the true ruler of Narnia. The White Witch was the flase Queen of Narnia. The main struggle was who was going to rule Narnia.The setting started in London and was almost destroyed by war. When thet moved to the country and was untouched by war. When they were in Narnia it was beautiful but was going to be soon toched by war.In conclusion, I feel like I Was there. It made me think about how the kids felt when they were gone from home. Every page you turn has some sort of adventure in it.

But this book does not go on with everyone believing that Narnia exists but Lucy's elder siblings espcially find it most peculiar but the Professor ,believed, to be more logical believes that Narnia may exists due to certain factors that is the time journey and Lucy's truthfulness.

But hearing this dramatic and well-produced reading adds a wholly new dimension to the overall experience. The inspired choice of Michael York allows the story to unfold before your very eyes, as he paces his voice comfortably enough to make you follow along and be excited at the same time. The reading may take a long time, but York never sinks into a monotonous tone, and he also gives each character personality and depth. Particularly tellig is his satanic characterisation of the White Witch. He also avoids the tendency to make the children sound too cue or whiney. To sum everything up, this reading will be sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of anyone who listens to it, and will surely be prized highly in any Narnia lover's collection and also by those who have never heard of the Narnia stories."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a story by C.S. Lewis, and it is the second book in a series of seven books. I feel this book is good to read for any age level from third grade to adult.Narnia is a fantasy about four children of various ages who must leave their home because of air raids. The four children have to go live in a large house with a professor in the country to keep them safe from the war. While the four children are exploring the large house they find a wardrobe in an empty room. When the children look inside the wardrobe they discover a passageway into a magical land called Narnia. In Narnia the four children are swept into one adventure after another while they try to destroy the evil White Witch so that spring will return to Narnia.Narnia is a wonderful, imaginative story that I highly recommend to children and adults of all ages. I loved all the adventure in this book and the magical creatures that they meet. I thought the children were vivid, believable characters, and I think you will find yourself cheering them on throughout their adventures. I feel that anyone who takes the time to read this book will find the ending extremely satisfying and will probably want to jump right into the third book of the Narnia series.In conclusion I give this book four stars. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars was because it was slowly paced near the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the beginning of theland of Narnia for readers here in our world. The name itself evokessymbols that mean almost as much in our culture as Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow.Reading this book is a lovely gift to make to your children, or to yourself. Lewis draws powerfully on our childhood desire to find ourselves in a fantasy land. The story of Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund being transported into Narnia makes all of think of our own childhoods in a powerful way.And from that power, Lewis can draw on the naivite and newness of children to approach faith and love and the values that accompany them. We see the very basic sin of Edmund as he betrays his siblings for just one more piece of Turkish Delight. And, so movingly, we witness his forgiveness and the love of the Lion for this one boy.Lewis disagreed with the term &quot;allegory&quot; being applied to his Narnia tales. He felt that an allegory provides tangibility to intangible values and he felt his Narnia stories deal with things that are real in our world already. He wanted to show how people might come to God if they didn't have all the baggage and preconception that &quot;our world&quot; loads on top of religious feeling.No matter how much you're reading into this book, it's a piece of magic and not to be missed. Reading it to a child will give it an even stronger place in the life of that person. Not many things mean as much to me as thoughts of the Lantern, Mr. Tumnus, the Stone Table and Lucy. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was read to me as a child and it will always be a dear, dear book to me."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Having a story that is as well rounded and deeply plotted as this, especially when we're talking about a children's story, is a feat indeed. In this respect, and in many others, C.S. Lewis as done a remarkably excellent job. The Christian morals and principles that it teaches are an excellent addition to the story, and reflect greatly off of the man who wove this story into being. Aside from being very good literature, children should also read it for the lessons that it teaches. Perseverance in the face of fear, trust in God, and love for those around you.Sadly, as so many have pointed out, few children get to experience the emotional vividness, and compelling plot line of this fairytale now a days. In addition to &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, there are six other books in the &quot;Tales of Narnia&quot; series. My advice to parents is to read all of these to your children, or, if your kids are old enough, have them read them on their own. Everybody should read the series at least one time, and if you haven't, your missing a great piece of American literature.It's still amazing to me that all of these thoughts and concepts came from one man's head, and that through the God given gift of words, C.S. Lewis changed the lives of millions."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"*The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* begins the enchanting series of Narnia books as, in a game of hide and seek, intrepid Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and into Narnia -- a delightful world of dryads and fauns and dwarves and animals that talk. Lucy finds, however, that as things stand, Narnia is a land of perpetual winter ruled over by an evil witch. Worse, even though it's always winter, it's never Christmas (note allegorical material beginning to rise to the surface). Lucy must return to her house, convince her brothers (especially the aptly named Peter) and sister that Narnia actually exists, and, with the help of Aslan, the great lion, defeat the witch and bring spring back to the land. She has her work cut out for her.As readers, so do many of us. For in this most delicate and charming and gemlike of books, C.S. Lewis has planted as heavy-handed an allegory as anything Edmund Spenser wrote in *The Faerie Queene*. Lucy, as her name denotes, brings &quot;light&quot; to Narnia and England. Aslan is Christ. Narnia is the postlapsarian world. Aslan (Christ) must, according to the rules of the Emperor-over-the-sea (God), die so that Lucy's brother, Edmund, (the sinner) can be saved (Saved). After his death, Aslan comes back to life (is resurrected) and defeats the witch (temptation/the devil). Through the spilling of his blood (Blood) all of Narnia is renewed (finds grace). If your religious beliefs compell you to point this not-so-deep meaning out to your own children, then do so, but please don't spread the word. When teaching this book in a college-level course on Children's Literature, I have too many times seen the years of joy this book has given my students quenched by my Outing Of The Allegory. This quenching is nondenominational.What I write now would not bring joy to C.S. Lewis, but the true miracle of the Narnia series, to this reviewer, lies in its astonishing ability to survive its own allegory. On the literal level, these books are marvelous: they are invigorating, heady, filled with heroism and magic, great deeds and quests. They should not be missed by children of any faith. My two sons love the series, and, frankly, as far as the hidden meaning is concerned, I dread the day that they are finally old enough to ask about it, and I am weak enough to tell."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have been sent to live with a professor in the country during the London air-raids. While exploring the large house, Lucy finds that the wardrobe in the spare room transports her to the magical land of Narnia. The country is under the spell of a terrible witch who has made it always winter but never Christmas. At first, her siblings don't believe her, but soon they, too, find themselves in this new country. With danger around every turn, they must survive treachery to join Aslan the lion in the fight to free Narnia and break the spell.I read this book for the first time in third grade, and it holds up just as well today. The pace of the writing is a bit slow, but the adventure is sure to hook readers. Lewis creates a wonderful fanciful world that is lots of fun to visit. This is the first I read and still my favorite. There's something about this book that captures the wonder of finding a new, magical world that the other books don't have.Lewis also created just the right spell for his land to horrify kids and to a lesser extend adults. The idea of always having winter and all it brings but never getting to celebrate Christmas is too awful to mention.A brief word about book order. When I read this book, it was considered the first in the series. Now, some people have put the books in chronological order, making it the second. While I fell that reading them in the original order is the best approach, it really doesn't matter that much. Nothing about the other books is spoiled here since this was the first one written, but not much about this book is spoiled if you read them in the order events occur.Narnia is one of several classic kids' series about mythical countries and is still my favorite. It's perfect for anyone wanting to leave our world behind for a touch of fantasy."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"HarperCollins' renumbering of the Chronicles of Narnia is a disgusting desecration of a great work of literature. As far as I can tell, Lewis never instructed his publisher to reorder the series, he merely mentioned casually in a letter that it would be okay to read them chronologically. That hardly constitutes a statement of \\"the original wishes of the author,\\" as HarperCollins claims.The editors at HarperCollins seem to think that the children for whom these books were intended are so unintelligent that they would get too confused if they were to read them in the order in which Lewis wrote them. Never mind the fact that millions of children have thoroughly enjoyed them in the their original order for half a century.Next thing you know, HarperCollins will be reordering the chapters in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey because modern readers must be too stupid to follow them as they have been read for over two thousand years.If you are new to the Chronicles of Narnia, do yourself a favor: get a permanent marker, blackout the numbers on your books, and re-renumber them back to their original order:1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe2) Prince Caspian3) The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4) The Silver Chair5) The Horse and His Boy6) The Magician's Nephew7) The Last Battle"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the supreme treasures of all English literature--a wonder in childhood, at coming of age, in adulthood, and in old age. It is also a bringer of hope and a force for good in a world where despair and evil are present and need resisting. It is one of the best gifts you can give a child, a friend, or yourself.You should definitely note, however, that the publisher of this and some other recent editions has made a moronic and despicable decision to change the order in which Lewis intended the books in the series to be read. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" is the first book in The Chronicles, and the way Lewis intended his readers to first encounter Narnia. \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" the next-to-last book in the series as Lewis wrote it, is a sort of flashback in Narnia's history, and the events related in it take place earlier than those in \\"LWW\\" in a chronological sense. IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ \\"THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE\\" FIRST, AND TO READ \\"THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW\\" SIXTH, AS LEWIS INTENDED. CHANGING THE ORDER CHANGES THE WHOLE TONE AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE STORY FOR THE WORSE. Don't let the delusion of the publisher's staff that they somehow outrank C.S. Lewis in literary and artistic judgment rob you of the best possible experiencing of this masterpiece--READ LWW FIRST!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"How much do I love this book. I recently revisited it and had the experience of reading it out loud to my nephew (7) and niece (5). I hadn't read it for quite a few years and, although I still know the story well, there were parts of the book that had faded with the passing of time and were brought back to life with the re-reading of the book, as tends to happen.For instance - I'd completely forgotten the feeling of complete joy and wonder when Aslan bounds over the wall of the Queen's courtyard and begins to breathe life back into the statues there. I'd forgotten good old Rumblebuffin and how much he made me laugh. I'd forgotten that, in spite of what the movies do, the battle scene was fleeting and over so quickly because the focus of this book is not on the grim trials of war but rather on the redemption of the living creatures spoken of.While reading through the story and watching my niece and nephew sink into despair at Aslan's death I felt again the pang of sorrow I felt as a child. After we'd finished the chapter my nephew looked at the title of the next, being \\"The Triumph of the Witch\\" and he gasped in shock. \\"But, she doesn't win.. does she, Aunt?\\" he asked.He learned quickly that in spite of her best efforts.. in this beautiful, wonderful story.. of course evil does not win. If you haven't read this book in a while I invite you to re-visit it. Reading it out loud, savoring it chapter by chapter was one of the most amazing parts of each of my days."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"One of the books that should be on \\"books to read before I die\\" list.

There are of course other scene I would love to tell you all about but that would ruin the story. so I tell you go and read it because this is one of the best books I have ever read.[and I'm really not kidding.] So what are you waiting for GO AND READ!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Four children are sent to live away from home during a war, and stumble upon much more than they had anticipated.While playing a game of hide-and-seek, the youngest girl, Lucy, hides in a wardrobe. What seems like the perfect hiding place eventually turns into a wonderful, mythical land filled with all sorts of strange beasts and talking animals. There are centaurs, giants, and fauns; some animals I can't even really imagine.Upon her return from the fantasy world, nobody believes her story. In fact, nobody noticed she was gone. In the alternate world of Narnia, time is not related to time as we know it.Eventually, her brother Edmund (who I hated from nearly the first mention of his name) follows her through the wardrobe. The plot thickens when Ed meets up with the White Witch. She befriends him because of her fear for a prophecy that four children of Adam and Eve leading to her downfall.From there, the story seamlessly follows the four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they travel through Narnia. They learn that Lucy's friend, a faun named Mr. Tumnus, has been taken captive by the White Witch. While Lucy feels compelled to help, the others are not all that interested; except Edmund, who is interested because of the pact he made with the White Witch to deliver all four children to her castle.Edmund betrays his family and goes the Witch. What follows is an epic tale of the struggle between good and evil, ubiquitous Christian allegory, and the inevitable happy ending.There are shocks, surprises, twists, and laughs. Perhaps the most important aspect of the story is the great leader Aslan, who is pure, and represents all that is wonderful (a not-so-subtle representation of Jesus). It's not overbearing as some would assume, but it's definitely there. Aslan teaches, nurtures, chastises, and leads. He gives selflessly, and fights for all that is pure and just.The story is easy to read, allowing the reader to imagine, to become involved with the story. You'll immediately love certain characters and take sides.I highly recommend this book to fans of fiction, and anyone who wants to read a great story. It's a wonderful book that transcends age and genre."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"When we read this in for our Book Group it was difficult to find a good list of discussion questions. Here is the list I compiled from questions I found on the internet. I hope this helps your book group!1) Many of Narnia's fantastical creatures are personified; name some of them. Which human qualities are most celebrated? Which are not?2) Elements of fantasy and real life are intermingled in the worlds of Narnia and \\"reality\\". What makes these worlds different from each other?3) Although they are children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have very distinct personalities. By portraying them the way he did, what messages might Lewis have been sending to children about human behavior.4) Each of the children undergoes some changes throughout the course of the novel. Discuss how these changes impact their characters.5) Symbolism is quite prevalent in this book. Discuss what Narnia and Aslan symbolize and how their portrayals shape Lewis's message. Who or what else is symbolic? How?6) In agreeing to sacrifice himself in Edmund's place without divulging to the White Witch theat he could return, Aslan might be considered somewhat deceitful. What other variances are there on the traditional definitions of good and evil?10) Aslan sternly reminds Peter to cleand his sword after he kills Maugrim. Why was cleaning his sword so important?7) When Lucy tries to minister to her wounded brother, Aslan hurries her along to tend to others. Does the theme of the greater food vs. the individual arise elsewhere in the story? What other themes arise?8) The Pevensie children leave London during World War II because the city they live in is being bombed. Yet Narnia they fought in a war. Do you find this ironic? -Talk about this.11) In Chapter 10 the children meet Father Christmas. How is he like the traditional image of Santa Clause? How is he different? What does he seem to represent?9) Notice the titles of Mr. Timnus' books. Do any of them strike you as strange or humorous? Why?12) The children are each given a gift by Father Christmas. Whose gift would you most like to have? Which do you think is most useful? Elaborate.13) In Chapter 7 the children hear about Aslan for the first time. Describe how each of them feels when they first hear about him. Why do you suppose they react so differently?14) Some readers think that there are parallels to the liberation of the stone statues in Chapter 16. They point to passages like Matt. 27: 52-54; Eph. 4:7-10. Do you see any similarities?15) In Chapter 17 the children (as adults) go after the White Stag. What do you think it represents in the story?16) Do you think it's an accident that the children return to England when they do? Why, or why not?17) Discuss the relationship of time in Narnia to the time in the children's world. How does it work for the children to grow into adults in Narnia, then returned to children in England?18) In the beginning the children have trouble with Lucy's claims that she has been to Narnia. What does the Professor say about this? How does he apply logic to this situation?19) Throughout the book there is a paradox about Aslan, which the Beavers describe as \\"good and terrible\\". Compare what they say about Aslan with what is said about God in the Bible.20) Aslan tells Mr. Beaver (p.137) \\"All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about noises. Speculate on what he might mean by this.21) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, was written as a children's book.

Not really, really it is not! I am sending it back."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"So that's the main point. Yes, Aslan is Jesus. And this book has an agenda. Actually, all of Lewis's books have an agenda. It is a religious agenda, and the story does kind of get bogged down in it. So this book is actually perfect if you yourself are religious and are looking to share it with your kid, but I was not looking for religion and when I found it I was sort of disappointed. Why couldn't Aslan just be Aslan? Why did Lewis have to go and bring Jesus into the picture?That being said, this story is lovely minus all the religious stuff. It tells the story of four children who walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a fantastical new land, filled with fauns and witches and whispering trees. Aslan, by the way, is the lion who is the mysterious ruler of this place called Narnia. He has not been seen for many years, and subsequently, the evil witch has imposed winter on the Narnians for one hundred years. The story ran through my head nicely, and it was actually a good fantasy book. The metaphor behind it was just slightly disconcerting in its blatantness.If you're an adult and you loved the Chronicles of Narnia, read The Magician by Lev Grossman. It's an adult fantasy, and it is GREAT."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I've read this book two times and it hasn't gotten old at all. The more times you read it the better it gets. This is an all time classic. Its a must read."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"great book you just imagine yourself in and get lost in with all the discriptions by c.s lewis"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Jeffrey ShanghaiA fascinating book...The book I chose to read for this assignment is \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\", and the reason I chose it was because I have already read it's previous book in the series (The Magician's Nephew), therefore I chose to carry on with the series, as I find reading sequels one after another is a lot easier than reading independent books that I have no connection of. The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel. This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up. And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"When I first read this in the late 60's it was relatively newin America. I was astonished that the moralist Christianwho wrote such bad ( Luddist) sci fi wrote such excellent fantasyfor children.

The story begins when Lucy discovers the Land of Narnia. Lucy tells everyone about the Wardrobe but no one believes her. Edmund discovers Narnia and meets Lucy there. When Lucy and Edmund came out of Narnia, Lucy told Edmund to tell the others about Narnia, but he said that Lucy was making it up. So, Lucy gets mad at him. One day a lady came to the house to show people the huge house. When the kids hide from the lady they hide in the wardrobe and then walk into the land of Narnia. When they are in Narnia they find two beavers and they invite the children over to have tea. All the sudden they realize that Edmund was missing! They go out looking for him. They all know that he went to find the White Witch because that's where he went the first time he was in the wardrobe. While the kids were looking for him they went to the stone table and meet Aslan (the lion). When Aslan came everything turned into spring. Then Aslan helped the kids find Edmund and get him back from the Witch. But in order to do that Aslan had to sacrifice his life and the Witch kills him. But Aslan came back to life and let out a big ROAR! Lucy and Susan hopped on his back and road all the way back to town. If you want to find out if Aslan and Narnia win the war or the White Witch and her evil crew wins you are going to have to check this book out and read it. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The title of this book is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. The authors name is C.S. Lewis. I give it 4 stars.I gave it this amount of stars because the book is packed with very many details such as: Aslan was a big lion with a large gold main and huge paws. I also enjoyed how Aslan was raised from the dead and the stone table breaks. That is just like the bible. Aslan was sacrificed to save Edmond and Jesus died to save everyone. They were both then raised from the dead. They conquered the bad guy and good prevailed. They then went away. It really had me on the edge of my seat when the White Witch took over Edmond and tried to kill all of the other \\"Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve\\". She also turned all of the people or animals that crossed her into stone. She thought that she was the queen of Narnia but she was really and evil dictator that wanted to take over Narnia.My favorite part of the book is the battle. I thought it was very cool how Susan (one of the four kids, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy) shot an arrow at a pheonix and it lit on fire and made a wall of fire to prevent the Witch from getting to them. It really stunned me that the polar bears swung their heads and it took out the entire wall of fire! Then Aslan showed up with an entire new part of their army. They went to the witches house and \\"destoned\\" them all. In the end....I would also recommend any other books writen by this author because he is an amazing writer.

But what the children didn't know is that there were many adventures ahead of them to be explored in this white winter land.As I read this book, it kept my interest because the writing is fluent and intriguing. The book includes vivid verbs such as, vanishing, stooped, and swish. As well, C. S. Lewis uses great adjectives, like filthy, sulkily, and dreadful. C.S. writes so descriptively that it paints a picture in your mind. The book is also packed with excitement and adventure. There are suspenseful parts where you just can't put down the book. There are battles, there are creatures being turned into stones, and there are kidnappings.Over all, this is a very intriguing book that keeps you involved in exhilarating adventure.

LewisReviewed By: J. ZhuPeriod: 6The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is about four siblings. Their names from youngest to oldest are Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter. They live with their mother, but their hometown is under siege in a war. The sibling's mom is scared that they might be killed and so they are sent on a train to go to the Professor's house. When they get to the Professor's house, his maid Mrs. Macready shows the kids around the house and sets some ground rules. Lucy, the youngest child wanders off for a while and sees the wardrobe. After a while the kids become bored and they decide to play hide-and-seek. Lucy remembers about the wardrobe and then goes back to hide there. When Lucy gets inside the wardrobe she trips and falls into this white fluffy stuff. It's snow! Lucy wanders around for a while in this \\"wardrobe\\" and she meets a fawn named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Tumnus then invites Lucy over to his house and gives her some tea. After they talk for a while and get to know each other, Mr. Tumnus plays this instrument and it makes Lucy sleepy. Before Lucy is fully asleep, Mr. Tumnus stops playing and cries over what he has just done. Then Mr. Tumnus tells what he was about to do and Lucy finds out all about where she is (land of Narnia) and that the queen (Jadis or White Witch) is making it winter forever and never Christmas. There was a prophecy that states when two of Adam's sons and two of Eves' daughters come to Narnia the Queen will be out of power and Narnia will be a happy place once again. Then Mr. Tumnus thinks that the queen might already know that a daughter of Eve is in Narnia and he shows Lucy the way back to the Professor's house. When Lucy comes out however, she tells her siblings what had happened, but no time has gone by. At first no one believes her, but Edmund decides to go check the wardrobe anyways. When Edmund gets into the land of Narnia he meets the White Witch and she gives him magical Turkish delight that makes him want more and more. The queen promises that if he brings his other siblings then he will get as much Turkish delight he desires. After many times not believing Lucy the siblings decide to try to look in the wardrobe again. This time on the other hand, the land of Narnia is there! They all decide to go to Mr. Tumnus, the fawn's house. When they reach his house they find out that he was captured and thrown in jail for fraternizing with humans (Lucy). After they get out of the house the children see a little beaver and it tells them to follow him. The beaver ends up bringing them to a small dam. The beaver then tells the children the story about The White Witch and Narnia. Before the story of Narnia and The White Witch was over, Edmund had already gone to The White Witch's house and told her the story about Azlan coming back. When the other siblings find out that Edmund is gone, they realized that he must have betrayed them and they left the dam with the Beavers. The Beavers found out that Azlan is already in Narnia and he is waiting for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy at the Stone Table. When they reach the Stone Table they see Azlan, but they went without Edmund. Azlan then told the children that the prophecy could not be fulfilled unless they had Edmund too. So, the children and Azlan's army go to where they were holding Edmund and freed him. After Edmund realized what he has done he is back on the good side. Then the children and Azlan's army prepared for one of the fiercest battles ever. Then Azlan called his army and he started one of the greatest wars ever. In the end, Azlan won and The White Witch was killed. Then Edmund, Peter, Lucy, and Susan all became queens and kings of Narnia.I liked this book because of many things. One reason that made me like this book is that C.S. Lewis has a magical ability to give you a marvelous description of what is happening and where the characters are. There is one sentence that I really thought made me feel as if I was one of the characters and I was actually there and that is, \\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That really made me picture a thought of a beaver dam with a marvelous food fragrance coming out of a small chimney. I also enjoyed the book because C.S. Lewis just knows how to hook you into the book.My favorite part of the book was when the kids were in the Beavers' house. This was my favorite part of the story because C.S. Lewis gives a description about the food that the Beavers' had prepared for dinner. When C.S. Lewis wrote about fish I just wanted to get my hands on some fish. Usually I do not like fish, but C.S. Lewis' description made it sound very tasty and mouth-watering."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I LOVE this book.

When I opened that book and started reading I couldn't put it down. It was just so facinating. My teacher said there was so many symbolic things in the book relating to the authors Chrisianity. For the people who don't know what I'm talking about. The Lion, Aslan, is represented as God.I thought this book was really good. Better than good. It was just like one of those books that you wished you were in.

Aslan, the Lion who created and has protected Narnia since it's beginning must come once again and free the land from evil. The classic tale of Fantasy, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is indeed C.S. Lewis' most imaginative pieces of work. A popular book that has been around for decades, anyone can enjoy it. It leads you into a land you will never want to leave and tells a wonderful story. It starts the Chronicles of Narnia but stands alone as possibly the very best of all of them. It starts the whole adventure through Narnia. This is one of those books that you really can't put down once you start reading it.

The evil, foul-minded people who are publishing these works (The Chronicles of Narnia) have profaned the fantastic writing of C.S. Lewis by rearranging the order of the seven books so as to confuse the reader and steal away some of the magic and wonder by imposing it in a chronological order rather than the artistic one in which it was rendered. Is the horrible time witch at play again or it could be that rascal Screwtape at work? I shake my head sadly at the poor folk who will read these books in the wrong order, actually thinking that perhaps the author meant for them to read Volume Six first. Yes, of course these books come highly recommended but I think it is most important to stress that they should be read in the proper order, which is as follows: 1. The Lion, The Witch &amp; The Wardrobe 2. Prince Caspian 3. The Voyage of the Dawn Treader 4. The Silver Chair 5. The Horse and His Boy 6. The Magician's Nephew 7. The Last Battle Please, do yourself a favor, if you are reading these books for the first time, read them in the right order."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I somehow managed to make it through my childhood without ever coming across C.S. Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia. I had heard of the series but never read it, and it's only now as an adult that I have picked up \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". I knew a little going in; there was a magical land known as Narnia, it featured a lion, and somehow a wardrobe was invovled.The book centers around four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They have been sent away from London to escape the air raids of World War II and are staying at a professor's house in the country. While exploring the mansion one day, the youngest, Lucy, comes across an old cupboard that houses coats. Opening it up to hide in, she discovers that, rather than being an ordinary wardrobe, it is a gateway to a magical land called Narnia. There are many interesting creatures, from unicorns to giants, centaurs and dwarves. Sadly, Narnia has been put under a spell by an evil witch who has made it winter all the time - but never Christmas. The land is waiting to be freed, and freedom can only happen with a war against the witch and those on her side.Lucy eventually makes it back to the professor's house and quickly tells her siblings what she has seen. They don't believe her, even when Edmund accompanies her into the wardrobe on another adventure in the land. There, he is met and falls under the witch's spell. Eventually, all four siblings enter the magical land, where they participate in a battle to rid Narnia of the witch and restore Aslan as ruler of all.I've read commentary that the Chronicles of Narnia is a very religious series, and coming from a Christian perspective, I can agree. Aslan is definitely representative of Jesus Christ, and aspects of the story mimic biblical events. But this is something I was looking for as I was reading; if I hadn't been aware of it, I may not have made the connection. And, while this book isn't as vivid as, say, Harry Potter, it is still a great tale.Overall, while I was less than thrilled with \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", I can see the appeal to children. I am going to delve into the rest of the series to see what it's about; after all, it's a fast read and an interesting one at that."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The chronicles of Narnia is a book written by C.S. Lewis. The genre of this book is an adventure book. The name of the book comes from four young children's lives in a somewhat parallel universe as ours. I would say that the theme of the book is loyalty to your family. I enjoyed this story very much. It was a constant page turner for me. Every new page was sort of a new adventure for me and the characters alike. The story is written in a 3rd person point of view where the author not only tells of the story but talks to the reader as well. I enjoy this much more than a regular third person point of view. The authors voice to me sounds like an older man sitting by a fireplace telling you of this story that he came up with the previous night and was energetic to tell us. \\" There shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane ( for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\\" This is a quote from the book in which the author adds his own little thoughts, as if he were really telling us what was happening.The setting of the story takes place in a fictional world called Narnia. It is world filled with magic and mystical beings and talking animals. It is very much like the world we live in today with exception technology and regular humans. The writer makes you feel like your in the story. He does not use a lot of the seeing sense but much more of the others such as cold, harsh. hard, and pale. Narnia is mostly covered in snow and ice due to the Witch's rule. However there are parts of the land that are not affected. The parts that have not been affected by the cold is where her evil power has not yet reached.The main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy; going from oldest to youngest. Then there is of course the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch; the Queen of Narnia. You also have Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and a faun named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Lewis put a good deal of detail into each of his characters, even the non important ones. As I said in the first paragraph the theme is about loyalty to your family, Edmund, the second youngest of the four, dishonored his siblings and almost got them killed by a the Witch's police wolves.The story is essentially about the four children going into a magical wardrobe and ending up in a world called Narnia ruled by the Evil Witch. The kids are in danger and a very powerful lion comes and saves all of Narnia with the children from the Queen and restores balance among the Narnian world."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" illustrates the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ in assuming our penalty for our sins. Even though fanciful, it becomes a very moving account of giving of one's self for the benefit of others. C.S Lewis is a master author in the Christian faith."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia children's series is an excellent read not only for children and young adults, but for anyone who is fascinated with adventure, magic, mystery, friendship, and action. The first book in the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a wonderful tale of four siblings who live during WWII. The four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves living with their Uncle whom they have never met. While playing an innocent game of hide and seek, Lucy, the youngest of the four stumbles into a magical wardrobe. The wardrobe enters into a place called Narnia where it is never Christmas and always winter, animals talk, and an evil witch rules over the land. Lucy, her older sister and her two older brothers will enter Narnia and be known to the animals and magical people as the \\"sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve. The four learn that they have entered a world where evil has thrived and good has been forgotten. Until, they hear of a savior, a king, a lion named Aslan. The four must save the kingdom, fight evil and restore good.This first book is only the beginning of many adventures the four children will have in the land of Narnia. My promise is that if you read the first book, you will be hooked! C.S. Lewis again, has done a fantastic job in capturing magic, spiritual undertones and morals into a classic children's book series. You will NOT be disappointed! Enjoy:)"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I remember reading stories by C.S. Lewis when I was a kid and loving them. I started reading the series with my grandson and am just as enthralled today as I was back then. Every child should read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's a classic that never gets old!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I love how C.S. Lewis posits the trilemma of Mere Christianity, perhaps C.S. Lewis's most famous apologetic work, to also support the idea that Narnia exists.Lucy must either be a liar, mad, or telling the truth that Narnia is real in the same way that in Mere Christianity Lewis posits that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic. Clearly, there are more possibilities than these with regard to Jesus, lest we believe every fantasy our children tell us.This writing is very much secretly evangelistic, but probably not in a way most people would expect. I feel when an evangelist presents me with the Jesus story, and declares something like that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic, it is not Jesus whom I am passing judgment upon, but the witness of a fairytale presented to me. It is thus not Jesus that must be Lord, liar or lunatic, but the person or author that presents Jesus to me that is probably liar, lunatic or telling the truth. But, as I believe happens in the case of the Jesus story, most people that believe in fairy tales are just honestly mistaken about their tale. That is, they are neither telling the truth, lying, or insane, but that they are just plain honestly mistaken. When someone tells me that if I don't believe in a fairytale, such that my soul depends on it in order to escape eternal punishment, I won't sell my soul to believe in Jesus anymore than I would subscribe to the idea that Narnia is a real place. Strangely, C.S. Lewis seems to support that idea as upright, such that entering the fantastic world of Jesus and Christianity, even if it be lies, is still ideal to the alternative of denying Christian religious fantasies.Of course, Jesus was a real person, but anything beyond that is anyone's guess, and as mysterious as Narnia itself. Three major religions have three stories about Jesus that are very much in conflict. Christianity says that Jesus is Lord. Judaism says that Jesus was the antichrist. And, Islam says that Jesus was the humblest prophet, but not as great as Mohammed. Therefore, what is to be made of this man's story is anybody's guess. Absurdly, most Christians say that this decision is central going to either heaven or hell in the afterlife. That much I am unable to accept."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Throughout my teenage years, I was thoroughly entranced by J.R.R. Tolkein's masterful LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and Terry Brooks' exciting SHANNARA series and the brilliant works of Stephen R. Lawhead. But, for some reason, I missed out on C.S. Lewis. I had been told this was a children's book.And then, when I was 17 and going on Summer vacation, I picked up THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE on a lark and began to read it. I couldn't put it down. I literally read it in one sitting, one night. The next day, I rushed out and bought as many of the rest of the NARNIA series as I could find. Sadly, the bookstore in the resort town where I was staying did not have the last two titles. I was desperate! I ordered those titles and put a rush on it. Over the next four days, I read the next four books in the series and kept calling the bookstore to see if my order had come in. At the last second, as I finished book 5 in the series, the final two books arrived, and I devoured them.Since then, I've read THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE many times. Recently, I re-discovered this handsome new edition and enjoyed the story all over again. Is it a children's book? Yes. But it is so much more than that. Many adults and scholars with great learning have had their lives profoundly affected by reading this book. Why?Of course, it is beautifully written by one of the true masters of English literature. The story is captivating--the magical land of Narnia and its mysterious inhabitants are portrayed vividly for us by Lewis. The characters, both the main children and the Narnian creatures, are colorful and entertaining. The \\"good guys\\" are sympathetic and brave, if flawed. There is tremendous humor. And pathos.Aslan the Lion is majestic and awe-inspiring. And the villians here are really villians...the icy witch and her evil minions are truly hateful.Beyond all of that is a powerful and subtle allegory about some of the deeper truths of life that are amazingly compelling and moving. Perhaps more than one reader has had to dab a few tears from their eyes at certain points.It may sound like hype, but I truly believe that everyone should read this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This superb adaptation by Amanda Benjamin of the C. S. Lewis children's classic is available as stand alone book (hardback and paperback) and book and cassette recording read by Nickolas Grace. Birmingham's true-to-life illustrations complement the narrative magnificently and, dare I say it, will stand the test of time equally as well as have the beloved original illustrations by Pauline Baynes. Amanda Benjamin's adaptation of the original story is faithful to the narrative of C. S. Lewis' story. It neither avoids nor sugar-coats the treachery of Edmund, nor the grim event of Aslan's sacrifice. Though not an abrigement, the narrative maintains the joy and thrills and mysterious wonder of the cherished Lewis story.I've 'road tested' this lovely book with my own young niece and nephew (aged 8 and 10) and have had as much enjoyment seeing their excitement and happiness as I got when I first read the story at 11.A first class Christmas or birthday present for any child who enjoys reading, listening to a good story or appreciates beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is the second volume (chronologically) in The Chronicles of Narnia (after The Magician's Nephew, before The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Last Battle).This book takes place during World War II, many years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, and tells the story of four young siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They are exploring the big house of an old Professor (which I'm guessig is Digory from the first book) where they've been sent during the air-raids, when Lucy enters the old wardrobe in en empty room upstairs to hide in it.Only this wardrobe is actually a direct passage to the world of Narnia, and Lucy finds herself in a forest on a snowy night, the only light that of a lamppost. There she meets a Faun named Tumnus, who is indeed very amazed to meet a legendary Human, an invites her to tea. In the cozy warmth of his home, he tells her of the evil White Witch, who is turning everyone who opposes her to stone, and whose spell on Narnia makes it always winter and never Christmas.When Lucy finally gets out of the wood and then out of the wardrobe again, no time has actually passed, and of course, when she tells her story to her brothers and sister, none of them believes her. Edmund in particular likes to make fun of her.On another, rainy day, when they're all playing hide-and-seek in the huge mansion, Edmund decides to hide in the wardrobe and he too finds himself in Narnia. But instead of the Faun, he meets the White Witch, who lures him with Turkish Delight (his favourite sweets) and by making him believe that he can become King if he brings her his brother and sisters.The book then tells the adventures of the four kids in Narnia, meeting a friendly couple of talking badgers and all kinds of other fantastic animals and creatures, among then the powerful Lion King Aslan, and helping them save the world from the evil usurper Queen.Reading the series in the chronological order rather than in the publication order, I found that The Magician's Nephew was actually a kind of spoiler for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I think that I would have been more enchanted, amazed and curious about the world of Narnia if I hadn't read all about its creation in the first book. I would have wondered about the lamppost, for example (and it would have been nice to read about the Lion's song later). Knowing about it in advance, I'm sure I found it a tad duller, because I wasn't discovering it at the same time as the kids. This is a nice story, and I know it's a Classic, but I must say it's not as captivating as I thought it would be.I advise you read it in the publication order: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magicians Nephew; The Last Battle."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The dearly loved chronicles of Narnia has always held a wonderful place in my heart, from the time it was read to me by my first grade teacher. Each time I pass a wardrobe, I often wonder what mysteries are on the other side. Will a faun lead me to a new and great adventure? And when I see I lion I think of the magnificence of Aslan with his piercing eyes and mighty roar.For those who have not read this book, you must be ready for something that is more than just a beautiful story about children, the magical land of Narnia, a wicked witch, and an &quot;untamed Lion&quot; named Aslan, whose very name brings joy to the heart of all who hear it. It is also an allegory of Christ and His Love for all, the Great Lion of Judah who is kind, loving, but, indeed, never a tame God!I have spoken to people who have read this book as a child and did not know that this level was present in the books; that's ok, because you can read it again as an adult and see how Lewis, in his inimitable way, can beautifully weave a story of suffering and grace, loss and celebration.For children, it is a book that will give them a love of reading, of imagination and joy. For adults, it can teach us simple faith in our always-complex world.Read and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I actually haven't read any of the Narnia books until the summer of 2005. I knew that a movie version of this book was coming out and I wanted to see it. My brother, a big, big fan of Chronicles of Narnia, made me read the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before seeing the movie. I read it grudgingly because I was in the middle of reading another book but I figured it was a short book so it wouldn't take long. By the second chapter, I fell in love with the book! It's so good and very well written. The Pevensie children are very likeable and you really do care for them. You feel bad for Edmund when he's being mistreated by the White Witch. Speaking of the White Witch, this book has one of the best villains of all time. It's a refreshing break from the very cliche persona of a villain; having black clothes, black hair, dark face, being mean right off the bat, and those kinds of things. This villain had white clothes (hence the name WHITE Witch), had a light face, and starting off being \\"nice\\". Aslan is also a great character. This book really started me on a Narnia craze. I now have all seven books, the movie, and I can't wait for the next movie to come out.

Lewis has conjured a world that millions have adored with incredible creatures(far more than the Lord of the Rings has). The one thing that I'm fed up with is people comparing this to Christian beliefs. It's not that I'm unchristian but I think that this makes people believe that only christians can read the book. Anyone can read the books because though it can be viewed as a tale that instills christian faith its really just a fantasy story at heart. Even C.S. Lewis himself said that Narnia was not supposed to be a direct comparison with christianity. So please enjoy the book or go see the new movie and please don't get religion involved with it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I can't even begin to say how many times I've read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" or the other books in the Narnia series. I grew up reading these books time and again, and each journey into this imaginary land is as fresh and exciting as the first journey there.\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a very simple fairy story at first glance: four children who have been squired to the English countryside to escape the London bombings during WWII find an entrance into a magical world through a wardrobe door. Yet underneath the surface, much is at work, as Lewis weaves myths and faith into a spellbinding adventure. When Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy enter Narnia, it is under the spell of the evil White Witch who can only be defeated when Aslan returns and the prophecy (which involves them) is fulfilled.For those only familiar with the writings that C.S. Lewis has done on religion and Christian apologetics, the notion of him writing a children's book must seem strange. Yet Lewis' first love was the myths and fairy stories that he devoured as a child, and Narnia is full of those creatures that sprang to life in his dreams. Lewis and his friend J.R.R. Tolkien were once under the impression that if they wanted to read the sort of stories that they liked, they would have to be the ones to write them. How many adventures they have taken readers on, and will continue to do so for generations to come."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Having been a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings for a long time, I picked up a book by J.R.R. Tolkien's friend, C.S. Lewis. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read LWW first, as it was the first published, or to begin with The Magician's Nephew, as Lewis himself had said he preferred as the opening novel in the Chronicles. Although this is the only Chronicle I've read so far, I'm glad I started with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.From the moment Lucy explores the back of her makeshift hiding place and begins to find trees and snow on the ground and the famous lamppost, being completely free of the knowledge of how Narnia originated lets the reader experience the same wonder and amazement that the characters feel. I was entranced by the mystery of the land and its inhabitants. I don't think I would've felt the same way if I had prior knowledge of Aslan, Jadis, or the history of Narnia.The story itself reads very quickly and is sparse with details in areas, such as the battle at the end, but it allows the reader to fill in with their own imaginations whatever is not outright told to them by the author. Anyone who loves visiting fantastic worlds, such as Middle-Earth or Hogwarts, I heartily recommmend this book."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a book I read a number of years ago and I still pick it up every now and then. Lewis' story is a classic tale that transports the reader into its pages. I can clearly remember the days when I would climb into my own wardrobe hoping to hear the crunching of snow under my feet, or see the faint glow of a lamp-post in the distance. [admittedly this was only ten years ago!] I recommend the 'Narnia' series to anyone of any age group. 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was one of my very favourites, as was 'The Voyage of the Dawntreader'. I hope others who buy this book will get as much enjoyment from it and the rest of the series as I did."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I have read this book a few times before, but this time, I have come to notice new things that I had never seen before, which truly showed the brilliance of Lewis in weaving the reality of life in a fantasy story. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe continues from The Magician's Nephew where the wardrobe that Digory (who became the Professor) made a wardrobe out of the tree he had planted from the core of the Apple (which was used to heal Digory's mother) from Narnia. Aslan, the Lion, is the parallel of Jesus Christ, and the With parallels Satan. In this, shows the epic struggle to save the life of Edmund who had become a traitor.One area that jumped out was the parallels between sin and the Turkish Delight that Edmund ate. When the witch asked what Edmund wanted, he told her that he wanted Turkish Delight, and that desire for Turkish Delight was already in Edmund, just like the sinful nature of human beings. The Witch just fed the sinful nature, and it was written of the enchanted Turkish Delight that \\"anyone who had tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go one eating it till they killed themselves.\\" When we feed our sinful nature, we would keep craving for more, even though we feel the ill effects of it (like Edmund did), and soon become enslaved to it that we could even consume it till it kills us. This is one of the profound truths that Lewis was communicating through the story.Also, the way Edmund reacted is so much like that of one who did not know the Savior, like how he had reasoned that the Witch was not so bad and the others may actually be the enemy, but all the time being enslaved to the need to have more Turkish Delight. The bondage was so strong that the taste of a good and decent meal was not satisfactory, as his mind kept thinking of the Turkish Delight. Also, when the 4 children were told of Aslan, Peter, Susan and Lucy felt positive things, but Edmund felt \\"a sensation of mysterious horror.\\" In light of the sin that Edmund had committed, being in the presence of Aslan would send a fear because of the reality of judgment for one's sin.Another area that was brilliant reveals our mind set towards the spiritual (for this case the world of Narnia) where Peter and Susan did not belive Lucy even though she was the honest one. The discourse with the Professor was a similar logic that can be applied to Jesus Christ, that if Jesus is telling the truth, then He is God, and if not, He is either a lunatic or a liar. Historically, He was not called a lunatic or a liar, so Jesus has to be God!This is a story brilliantly written, and I would likely pick it up some years from now to have a read again and see what gems Lewis had hidden in his writings."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Hi. ...I am here to talk about The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is the beginning of the book to start you off. It is about Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edmund. They all have to move because of World War II to their grandpa&#65533;s house. He is a professor. When they get there, they decide to look around and they come across a wardrobe. Lucy decides to go in, and when she reaches her arm through, she feels a pine tree. She goes through and enters Narnia. She meets Mr. Tumnus, a fawn. He brings her back to his house and cozies her up and she falls asleep. When she wakes up, Mr. Tumnus is crying because he was working for the bad white witch. That&#65533;s all I will tell you about the beginning of the book.You meet lots of other characters like Aslam, the lion. He is practically the main character and he almost dies. At the end there is a big war, but I can&#65533;t tell you who wins. You&#65533;ll have to read it for yourself. The book is so adventurous and exciting.Now I am going to tell you how good this book is. I would grade this book a nine out of ten stars. Twelve out of twelve people I asked said it was an awesome book. Matt (my friend) says that the war that takes place at the end of the book was the best part. It is a fabulous book so read it and I guarantee you will like it. I would also recommend reading the first book called The Magician&#65533;s Nephew because it goes along with the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.So I told you a little about the book. So long and I hope you will read this book and if you do, I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this book when I was a small boy just discovering the wonder of books, it is one of the reasons why i still read books today. As such it has special meaning to me and I could not resist reviewing it. The story is about a group of children who discover a secret magical land where they can be heroes, accessable through a wardrobe. Some people may be a bit put off by the references to the religious undertones of these books, It would be a tragedy if some where put off reading these because of this. I for one was completely unaware of the christian undertones and just read it for the great story it is. The book has stood the test of time and to me is a classic. The one thing I regret is that I do not have children (so far!) to give books like this to, so if you do, don't miss the chance."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a kid, and still reads just as good now that I'm an adult."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is the edition that I read at 5, and I just read the same copy with my 6-year old son.

This series of books are a wonderful collection for a young person to get involved in and have no ill effects."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is something every adult and child should read. I know people are always weary to pick up a book that has a religious theme to it but C.S. Lewis is enjoyable no matter what you choose to believe.During WWII, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy Pevensie have to leave London and their mother as they seek refuge in the English countryside with Digory Kirke. The children amuse themselves by exploring and playing games; one day, Lucy steps into a wardrobe and into Narnia, a magical land where she meets Tumnus, a friendly faun, who invites her to him home and tells her about the evil White Witch.When she returns to the real world, Peter, Edmund, and Susan believe she's lying; Edmund, however, goes into the wardrobe and enters Narnia. He has the misfortune of meeting the White Witch who bribes him with Turkish Delight and encourages him to bring Peter and his sisters back with him.While trying to hide from a group of visitors, the four Pevensie children pile into the wardrobe and step back into Narnia; Lucy leads them to Tumnus' house but finds that he has been taken by the White Witch. From then on, the children meet friends, battle the power of evil temptation, and search for the true King of Narnia: Aslan.This story is unlike anything I've ever read before. I couldn't help but admire the brilliant way Lewis wove together so many stories yet made it uniquely his own. Making a trip into Narnia is something everyone should do and your first step is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Like JACK AND THE BEANSTALK, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, HARRY POTTER, THE WIZARD OF OZ and so many other children's stories that have entered the realm of literature classics, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE begins with the discovery of an obscure gateway into another land. Peter, Susan, and Edmund Pevensie, children living with their uncle in a sprawling country house in the English countryside believe their youngest sister's stories of her visit to an enchanted winterbound land ruled by an evil white witch to be the product of an overheated imagination. For no other reason than to humour her and to prove her story wrong, they skeptically follow her into a dark, musty wardrobe. To their great surprise, they find they have all walked through a magical portal into the country known as Narnia.On the surface, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is a simple children's allegory with characters drawn from a deep well of literary predecessors including English folk tales and Norse and Greek mythology - talking animals, Mr and Mrs Beaver, Father Christmas, dwarves and giants, fauns, unicorns and centaurs, dryads, sentient trees, a snarling, frightful wolf who is the henchman of the evil white queen, black magic, and a great lion called Aslan who mysteriously returns from an extended absence to help Narnia's beleaguered subjects release the magical grip of a never-ending bleak, icy winter and allow the return of the much longed for beauty and warmth of spring and summer.But, at a deeper level, CS Lewis is well known for his Christian references and this story is no exception. Virtually any adult reader will recognize Aslan's heroic self-sacrifice to save Edmund's life and his return from death atop the witch's Stone Table as a clear symbolic allusion to Christ's crucifixion for the redemption of earth's sinners and his resurrection from the dead. While some readers may disagree, I found the allusions considerably less than subtle. While they were entirely obvious, almost painfully so, they were also, perhaps paradoxically, unobtusive and neither pedantic nor sermonizing. As a result, readers of any faith (or lack thereof) will be able to accept and enjoy the symbolism or simply ignore it and focus on the charm of the story as it might be seen from a child's point of view.The obvious overriding theme is good versus evil and, as is the case with most children's stories, good will out. The ending, not unexpectedly, is a suitably happy one that will satisfy a child reader or perhaps a youngster who is happily listening to a parent reading the story over several nights before bedtime. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"\\"Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. I was there when it was written\\"The four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - have come into the countryside to live with The Professor, away from the war. While there, Lucy discovers an old wardrobe that leads to a magical world.I Liked:I find myself at a loss figuring out what I want to say about this book. I've never been as fond of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as I've been of \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", but it certainly isn't a bad book.The story is clever and unique. At the time, not many fantasy stories existed for children, and this book definitely transports you to a world much different than ours. I love how it is populated with mythological creatures like fauns, nymphs and centaurs, but also has talking animals (which Disney almost owns exclusive rights to), and not just your \\"typical\\" talking animals, like cats and dogs, but animals like beavers (beavers?! That wouldn't have been my first choice) and lions.Another clever addition was the treachery of Edmund. Children in books tend to come off as almost insanely perfect and unable to err, and even this book doesn't avoid it 100% as Lucy, Peter, and Susan do have near-perfect attributes. But Edmund's deception, greed, and subsequent guilt do make things more realistic and show redemption. Plus, it keeps our bad guys from being painfully bad.I Didn't Like:What's always bugged me about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was the heavy-handed Christian allegory/symbolism/whatever-you-call-it. I consider myself a religious person, and yet the message is still too heavy-handed to me and makes me feel I am being bludgeoned with a brick. There were some things that weren't bad (Edmund's redemption), but the obvious parallels to Christian ideology, again, made me cringe.Similarly, I found a lot of the characters to be very simplistic and easily drawn out. I realize this is a children's novel, but still, it would have been nice had Lucy not been so obviously perfect (it could have made the \\"Who is lying?\\" bit between Lucy and Edmund's stories of Narnia more interesting) and had Peter and Susan had more character beyond \\"caring, older siblings\\".I also wasn't fond at all of the lack of participation of the girls in particular and the children in general. Lucy finds the land of Narnia, so she gets some brownie points, but after that, her purpose is nothing. Peter fights a battle and that is it. Susan is the worst as she does nothing that couldn't have been done by one of her other siblings. Honestly, the only person that does anything in the course of the novel is Edmund, and even that is only mess things up. The children themselves do nothing; only their presence in Narnia dictates any action, and that is because of a painfully written poem/prophecy. I understand that Lewis was going for an allegory of sorts between Narnia and our world in Christian terms and that our characters are children and can't be miniature Rambos and Rocky's, but when none of our characters really do much, it makes the whole story feel a little pointless.Also, I know this book was published in 1952, but I hated how Susan and Lucy were purposefully cut out of the fight (\\"Wars aren't for girls\\" - but they aren't for little boys, either) and the prejudice to non-humans (Mr. Beaver says that the White Witch is bad because she isn't human but is pretending to be human and those kinds of people can't be trusted...WTF?!). Maybe if Susan and Lucy had more of a role, then I wouldn't complain.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Absolutely nothing.While no where near as creepy as Uncle Andrew towards Polly in The Magician's Nephew, the White Witch does act pretty cozy to Edmund.There is an epic battle; a major character dies.Overall:While enjoyable to read, I did find myself growing bored, irritated, or embarrassed while reading this book. I would have preferred a book less overt about its theme and message, and one that spent more time building characters and making them important. However, this book does ignite a spark of imagination and creativity, and I think children would enjoy it worlds more than a jaded adult like me.Brought to you by:*C.S.

This book is delivers just that. The movie was okay but the way Lewis writes makes you imagine scenes that cannot be duplicated with technology.While reading this book you will feel that you are entering a new world. As you come back to the pages again and again, you will develop a fondness for a place that exists only in your mind. As the story draws to a close you may experience a kind of home sickness and feel somewhat silly because it's just a book...right?This is great bedtime reading to children."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"A must-have for all Lewis fans.

Then, the youngest brother named Edmund found the wardrobe and met an evil witch. He practically traded his brothers and sisters for Turkish Delight!

In this book, that is not so bad."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Allegory, fantasy, fairy tale--THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE works on the audience of children as a story, and extends its reach into the adult crowd with its unmistakable parallels to the story of Jesus Christ. C.S. Lewis wrote this--second chronologically in the series but the first written--for kids, but embedded within the tale is an allegory rich enough for the hardened academic, or theologian.The story of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and (especially) Lucy begins as the youngest of these children finds a gateway to Narnia, a magical world imperiled and imprisoned by a terrible witch. Only by fulfilling a prophecy and through the sacrifice of the great lion Aslan can the world be saved. Along the way, the reader will meet magical creatures, fight epic battles, endure unbearable betrayal, and witness the rebirth of a world. Returning through the other side of the wardrobe is like waking up from a dream (or, in the words of Tolkien's Frodo, \\"like falling asleep again\\").Along the way, Lewis also throws in a cameo appearance by Father Christmas--a real mistake, as this seems to allow trappings, or mythology, from the real world to shatter the whole invention of his own. It's a quibble, but it's also the reason why I can't give the book five stars.(This review posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"If you've never read a 'Chronicles of Narnia' book, you'll be surprised at what a quick read this is! Despite all the talk about 'Christian allegory' and other 'symbolism' that adults have tried to inject into Lewis' writing, the Narnia series, particularly this volume, is intended for kids above all else. The influences on 'Harry Potter' and other modern fantasy series are apparent. While Lewis' writing may lack a certain amount of polish in his descriptions, he manages to convey a lot of information in a relatively brief space, while leaving a lot to the reader's imagination. The four children are instantly likable(well, most of them are), and the various fantasy characters actually add something to the story than just comic relief.I'd never read this book til now, and wish I'd picked it up years earlier!Having read a bit about the other books in the series, I'm not sure if I'll continue. I found that 'Lion...' reached a logical ending point, and Lewis took the characters about as far as they could go. But 'Lion...' is best enjoyed as it was originally written; a nice fantasy story that will capture the attention of kids and grown-ups!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Four siblings--Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are staying clear of the war in England by staying in a huge old house in the country with an old professor. As they are left alone most of the time, the children are free to wander and explore the huge house. One day while exploring, Lucy steps into a wardrobe, and walks into another world, the world of Narnia. There she finds that she is not in the wardrobe anymore but is instead in a forest of trees, covered in snow. She meets a faun and spends the afternoon having tea with him. The faun confides that a wicked queen rules the land, making it always wintertime and never Christmas, and that he has sworn to bring any humans he finds directly to her. There is a prophesy that someday four humans will come to sit in the thrones of the castle and that the queen will be defeated. Lucy convinces the faun to let her go, though.When Lucy returns to her sister and brothers, none of them believes that she has really been anywhere, and she is very upset. Soon afterward, Edmund follows her into the wardrobe and is shocked to discover that his sister was telling the truth. Unable to find her in Narnia, though, he meets the wicked queen who charms him and makes him promise to bring her his brother and sisters.Soon afterward, all four children find themselves caught in Narnia. Peter and Susan and Lucy are eager to meet Aslan, the great lion who is said to be coming near to end the eternal winter. But Edmund sneaks off to announce the presence of his siblings to the queen. Peter, Susan and Lucy are now in trouble. Will they be able to avoid being taken by the queen? Will they help their brother come over to the side of good?I liked the descriptions of Narnia and the way things worked there. It's a great mythology. I also liked Aslan's character and the ways he handled problems that came up. I thought that Edmund's turnaround seemed too easy, though. He semed to slip from one side to the other with no effort. I also didn't like that the story of the children growing up happened too quickly, without incident. The end of the book went by much too quickly."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of the top ten best books I have ever read.

His books are so exciting. I stood up late reading it sometimes. I felt as if I was apart of the story. With all the action and excitement the story grabbed me like a mother does to her child. If mom had not sent me to bed I would have most likely read the whole book in one night.There were so many exciting scenes that barley any of them were boring. The scenes were so realistic that you could almost see a movie when you read. One of my favorite scenes was when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy spoke medieval, it was funny.Reading this book made me think. It made me think that even fake characters could seem real.

So do you want to read a great adventurous book? If you do then The Chronicles of Narnia is the right book for you. There are four kids [peter (oldest), Susan, Edmond, and Lucy (youngest)] who have to leave their home in London because there are air raids. So they have to get on a train and go to a place far away from their home. They go to a house in the country where a professor lives and the professor has a house keeper. When the kid's get there the house keeper makes many rules for them and the most important rule that the house keeper made sure they heard was \\"don't bother the professor!\\" While they were playing one day they find a magical wardrobe that leads to a mystery land called Narnia, while in Narnia siblings have to learn to trust and believe in them selves and in others in order to get through Narnia. Ultimately Edmond is tricked by the white witch and leaves his brother and sisters. They must rescue him, but how can three kids defeat a powerful and mystical witch?The Chronicles of Narnia is a book for everyone. It has a great adventure and once you start reading it you're hooked. The whole book is basically a rising action as each page gets better. It also has some action and a little magic. It has a lot of different creatures. With a very creative story, this book is fiction and fantasy.The Chronicles of Narnia is really similar to the movie version of The Chronicles of Narnia. The book just has a lot more description than the movie. For example: in the book they tell the setting everywhere and when they get to the beavers house they describe everything and in the movie they just show the house while they are walking into it. They both make a good picture in your mind. They both have the same characters.There are no weaknesses and nothing I didn't like about the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book makes you wonder what is going to happen next, example there is never a slow boring part. The book is always moving and it feels like you are moving with it or in it. It is great all the way to the end. In conclusion this book will blow your mind. A never ending adventure that takes you with it.

My first grade teacher Ms. Enderlin read the book aloud to my class. Each day she had a reading time after the noon recess. Ms. Enderlin opened the book, Lucy opened the wardrobe, and I opened my eyes to a whole new type of story. That was over twenty years ago.A young girl named Lucy attempts to hide in an old wardrobe and inadvertently discovers a portal to an entirely different world -- the land of Narnia. After her initial visit to this land of speaking beasts and a tyrannical witch, Lucy decides to return with her three siblings Edmund, Susan, and Peter. In Narnia, Edmund falls to the seductive beauty of evil. Lucy, Susan, and Peter strive to save their corrupted brother and defeat the White Witch who has enslaved the talking beasts.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" offers a fantastic opportunity to expose young readers to fantasy literature. Parents who are looking for something to read with their children will especially enjoy this book and the others in the series. Lewis writes with a distinctly conversational tone that lends itself to being read aloud. Though geared primarily for children (grade school age), the Narnia books will be equally appreciated by adult readers."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"It has been several years since I last read this book. I recall having to read this book as an assignment in Elementary school. C.S. Lewis has an amazing ability to bring back childhood memories. This is an age old struggle of good versus bad. A great buy!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is interesting yet very confusing. Don't get me wrong it was a VERY good book but it had confusing parts. It had many different settings and they described the settings well. But on the other hand, it had so many characters it was bound to get confusing. You can see how it was confusing, the characters are: Lucy, Susan, Edward, Peter, The Beavers, The Professor, The raun, The witch, Aslan, and many others. I would definetly recommend this book to others it is quite interesting. If I had to rate this book i would give it 4 stars not 5 because like i said, \\"confusing\\"!

He was able to follow it when we read one chapter per day. Older kids will get more out of it.The story brings up interesting discussion. One of which is how do we know what is true? How do we know who to believe? What is redemption? Can people change? What is real love?Young kids may not think about these questions.

Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fantastic book that combines great story telling and charming style while engrossing readers in an intriguing mythical world. Though it is numbered as book two in The Chronicles of Narnia series, C.S. Lewis wrote it first and therefore meant it to be read before book one, for it introduces the world of Narnia and launches readers on the beginning of an exciting journey leaving you wanting more. Though the style of writing and almost non-existent use of difficult vocabulary ostensibly targets the book toward a younger audience, fans of all ages can enjoy this timeless classic, and perhaps older audiences will grasp the deeper underlying message.The book begins with the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, being sent to live in a mansion with a fabulously rich, mysterious, and old professor because of the German air raids in London during World War II. While the four kids explore the house, Lucy, the youngest, first stumbles upon the doorway to the world of Narnia-an ancient and gigantic wardrobe. Eventually, all the children go through the wardrobe together, and they begin their adventures in Narnia. It is there we see two distinct sides of good and evil: the White Witch and her minions and those for Aslan the lion. The White Witch has spread an ethereal winter that has lasted for over one hundred years, and it is only the coming of Aslan that this winter spell can be broken and the White Witch defeated.C.S. Lewis brings a wealth of intriguing and interesting characters into his book. Upon meeting the characters of Narnia-mostly various animals-you become automatically attached to them. There are by no means \\"fuzzy little cute things\\" you would expect a children's book to have, but noble, smart, wise, and humanlike. Animal lovers of all sorts will enjoy this book that much more, as will mythical creature buffs. C.S. Lewis also brings in centaurs, unicorns, dryads, and naiads among others into the story, along with numerous evil creatures such as wraiths, ogres, and many other things that I will not mention here.The plot of the book is engaging and relentless. I found it almost impossible to put down the novel at the end of each chapter, a cruel but effective ploy to grasp the reader's attention throughout the book. The first initial peeks into Narnia leaves you wanting more, and upon permanently entering there, you are just as eager as the four children to explore and find out more about the strange, mysterious, but beautiful new world.I highly recommend this book to any fan of fiction. Readers will never forget the magic of entering into the world of Narnia for the first time and the wonder that it instills. This book incorporates everything that an epic novel should have. It successfully pulls you into a magical world that is totally believable, provides engaging characters and events, and captivates big and small audiences from start to finish. There is no doubt that children and adults alike will enjoy this book, and just like the Pevensie children, will leave Narnia hoping only to come back again."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion the Witch and the wardrobe is a book about four kids in the 1940's. The youngest sibling, Lucy, finds a wardrobe that houses a magical land that was cast under a spell by the Evil White Witch. With the help of Aslan the lion and Lucy's 3 brothers and sisters, Peter, Mary, and Edmund they must return the magical land of Narnia to the way it originally was.The most exciting part of the book was during the climax. During the climax there are fights and celebrations. During the fighting Aslan leads his magical army into battle with the four children by his side. Mary and Peter are able to fight with their gifts from St. Nick, Peter had recieved a sword and sheild while Mary had a bow and quiver. Lucy acted as a nurse for all the wounded soldiers. Towards the end of the book Aslan prevails and the four children are crowned Kings and Queens. Finally, after many years later they find the wardrobe and return to their house they were at in the 1940's a few seconds from which the originally left that house to go to Narnia.The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is an amasing book, that is why I recommend it. The action through the climax is enough to get any action lover to read it. Even people who like fairy tales will love the ending. The book will also help younger children know that not everyone is as good as they think they are. It can also help other people think that their might be other livible worlds out there"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"A PR man recently lamented that the movie of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was not being sold with the pitch, \\"See the Bible come alive!\\" But while Christian elements appear in various guises throughout C. S. Lewis's \\"Chronicles\\" you may search both Testaments, the Apocrypha, and the wealth of extracanonical writings BC and AD and find nothing about Narnia.This first installment was published in 1950 with the subtitle \\"A Story for Children,\\" and in his dedication Lewis calls it a \\"fairy tale\\": it is set during World War II, when many London children were sent away in hopes of finding safe in the countryside. In addition to the usual fairy tale contingent of a wicked witch of great powers, trolls and ogres and werewolves, Lewis has added the naiads and dryads, fauns and centaurs from Greek and Latin myth, as befits a classics professor, plus Father Christmas. When Aslan, the great Lion, is first mentioned one-third of the way through, his status as a Christ figure will be unmistakable---to any adult. But how many children of eight or ten---the premium age to enter Narnia---will recognize allusions to the Agony in the Garden, or interpret the sacrifice of Aslan at the Stone Table by the White Witch as the Crucifixion, or his return as the Resurrection? (The \\"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\\" plus \\"Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time\\" are tough doctrinal nuts to crack at a young age; I never understood them at the time, and now their arbitrary nature---to provide a rationale for the plot---rather sticks out.) Aslan's trials and triumphs are much sweeter than the Passion Story, which is shot through with a larger sadder view of human nature and destiny.The vivid pacing and emotional charge of Lewis's narrative bears all before it: one is swept along. What one recalls in after-years are images from high fantasy: the lamppost visible from the depths of the wardrobe, which shows one is leaving this world for Narnia; the Dwarf handing Edward the Witch's steaming tempting brew; her castleful of stone creatures being turned back to flesh by Aslan's breath. This is due in no small part to Pauline Baynes's witty, elegant, endearing illustrations, which are as much a part of Narnia as Tenniel's are of Wonderland and the Looking-Glass World, or Louise Fitzhugh's of Harriet the Spy's beat.\\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" bear the imprint of the time when they were written, and the author who wrote them, as every book does; but where Harry Potter finds most of his adherents in readers near his own age, and Tolkien's Middle Earth calls out to young and middle-aged and old alike, for what they can bring to it, Lewis was right---these are stories for children. As I reread them today, I see the boy I was when I first read them; for as an adult one can revisit, reappraise, and criticize, but one cannot recapture Narnia."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is probably my favorite book in the Narnia series, because I did read it first in the series as a child and it stuck with me. What always gets me, for some reason, is when the character Edmund indulges in some enchanted Turkish Delight. One of my favorite parts in the book, maybe because of my sweet tooth.This novel features Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they go through a magic wardrobe and enter Narnia, caught in an eternal frost. The children in turn encounter fauns, a witch as icy as the environment she has created, and a golden lion, not to mention talking beavers, giants, and Father Christmas. Edmund learns important lessons in the ethics of betrayal, or lack thereof, so to speak. Peter, Susan, and Lucy all find courage within themselves through battle and the wise words of Aslan, the golden lion.The Christian allegory in this book is somewhat stronger than in the others, due to the death and resurrection of Aslan, but as a semi-Kabbalist/former Christian/former semi-Wiccan, I have to say I do know about religion and this scence is more magic at work than the power of a god or gods. So, whatever religion you are, just be open-minded while reading this novel, and I think you will be able to see it for the extraordinarily crafted fantasy it truly is.See you after I read the next novel, for those following my review trail !"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Four kids find a magical world called Narnia.

My favorite character is Lucy because she is the most caring and honest one in my opinion.The scene that meant something to me was the scene with the witch, the lion and the witch's friends at the Stone table, I can't tell you why or it will spoil the book.This book is adventurous and a great book to read at anytime."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are siblings who have been sent to the country to escape the air raids of World War II. They stay with Professor Kirke, a kind old man. On their first day in the country it rains, so the kids decide to explore the house. They discover a spare room that is completely empty with a large wardrobe. Peter, Susan, and Edmund leave the room, but Lucy stays behind to look inside the wardrobe. Lucy steps inside the enormous closet to find a snowy wood at the back of it. Eventually she meets a faun, a creature that is half goat and half man. The faun, Tamnus lives in a strange land, Narnia where the White Witch has cast a spell so that it is always winter. He asks Lucy if she is a Daughter of Eve, if she is a human girl. Lucy is confused. Tumnus invites her for tea and plays his flute. Lucy feels like she is in a dream. The faun tells her that she cannot go home, but she begs him. Tumnus walks Lucy back to the lamppost at the border between Narnia and the wardrobe door, and they say farewell.On the next rainy day, the children play a game of hide and seek. Lucy wants to check and see if the wardrobe really is empty. Edmund sees Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He follows her into the wardrobe, but once inside he finds himself in Narnia.

Full of fun and fantasty, the book is an exciting romp through the mystical land of Narnia. With a devious power-stricken witch and an awe-inspiring lion, the story shows the classic battle between good and evil. However, the book's characters are symbols for those in biblical stories. For example, Aslan, the lion, is Jesus, and the Witch is Satan. The story is perfect for children because through the course of the novel, the character Edmund discovers that being on the side of good is better than turning to evil. He learns, through selfish reasons, that being on the side of good is more benifical. This young children to turn to God without seeming &quot;preachy&quot;.

Lewis, a Christian philosopher and literatus. It was the first one I read, and is a delightful story. Both children and adults who enjoy the fantasy genre should enjoy this book. It is centered around four children who, while staying as guests at an old mansion, walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a completely different world. There, they have many adventures and get involved in a great conflict between an evil witch, who is oppressing the land with an eternal winter, and the good king Aslan, who comes back to his country after a long absence to fight the witch's evil works. Anyone with a church or Sunday-school background should quickly recognize the Christian elements in this story, and I think it is safe for young children to read.

Now that I think about it, it was decades ago, and those were the days of punch cards. I hated computers because of that; what a lousy interface that was; but I didn't hate the punch card operators ... I presumed they were all attractive young women working their way through college and I wanted to meet all of them. Bemoan the hormones. One of the things I hated most then was that there was no debug code. Every time I made a mistake, all I got back from the computer was a whole-page goofy-faced image of Alfred E. Newman with the phrase printed below saying \\"What Me Wonder\\". I'm supposed to fix my code and that's the only clue I get? But I digress.Why do I mention all of this? Because some stupid Alfred E. Newman computer programmer type at Amazon.com decided I should review an audio book CD that I obviously didn't buy for myself (because they took my credit card number and I'm pretty sure that young kids who are interested in these stories don't have credit cards) -- I bought it for a grandchild for Pete's sake.

Besides, if she does, and by the time she does, Amazon.com's hour glass will have run out and I wont be allowed to review the CD. So ... I think the CD is probably great, and I sort of presented it as a birthday gift while winking at the mother because she should make sure that her husband (my son) should spend some of his personal time with her every night listening to part of it (dispensed gradually over a period of days). He doesn't spend reading time with her now because all she has is printed matter to read and that's a little fatiguing for my son. To give him a break, that's not because it's difficult for him to read; rather, it's because he reads at a level far exceeding the level most people are accustomed to, and especially what children are accustomed to. So this CD is a win-win for everybody: my son isn't fatigued; my granddaughter gets exposed to great literature; and the two of them spend some quality time with each other.Now if you want more than 4 stars, you're going go have to ask my granddaughter. I gave it four because I imagined it's great. Only her imagination will know for sure, and I wont know until I speak with her at Christmas time. If it gets my son to spend more time with his daughter then the CD is great no matter whatever other measure is applied. In due time I'll know that also."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"... but only if you like so called 'timeless classics' that don't have any action!

But these spiritual truths are conveyed more by Biblical allusions than by rigid allegory.\\"This statement is absolutely correct. While I was reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, it sounded like I was reading the bible. Aslan, symbolizes God, and the White Witch symbolizes Satin. When Aslan gets stabbed at the Stone Table, it is symbolizing Jesus dying on the cross, and when the lion comes back to life, it is symbolizing the Resurrection.C.S Lewis' use of symbolism does not make The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe a better story. Some people may think that symbolism makes it good, I think it makes it worse. If a person wanted to read about that, they could just read the bible. C.S Lewis should have incorporated more of his own ideas into the storyline.There are a lot of good things going for this book. There are interesting characters, good conflicts, and good detail about the scenery. I just think that C.S. got carried away with symbolism."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Although this was the first Narnia book published, it is the second in the series. It is about four siblings who get sent to a big house in the country during the war. Their names are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This house was owned by an old professer. One day they were playing hide-and-seek and Lucy decides to hide in a wardrobe. She finds that the wardrobe has no back. She walks through and finds herself in the land of Narnia where it is always Winter and never Christmas. She befriends a fawn an he tells her that Narnia was taken over by the White Witch Jadis, and that it is she who turned Narnia into winter. It is she who turns those who do not follow her into stone. The White Witch is completely evil. Lucy finds her way back and tells her siblings. They don't believe her but soon all four find themselves in Narnia, waging a war against the White Witch with Aslan the Lion by their side.As is true for all the Narnia books, this book is straight-forward with excellent characters and plot. It is a quick read, but you will want to read it over and over again.

I remember searching through all the cupboards in the house looking for a Narnia and being severely disappointed when I was unsuccessful. I decided that the only place where wonderful, magical things happened was in England. Only in England could characters like the White Witch, Aslan and Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund have exciting, magical adventures. Even now at 27, I still have this child-like fantasy that England is a magical place filled with the possibility of adventure and excitement. This wonderful book is enjoyable for all ages.

It is an absolutely gorgeous book--imaginative and beautiful, with a very moral center. It is a Christian allegory. I'm not a Christian, but I can appreciate the skill and the depth of feeling Lewis has for his subject. Aslan the lion is a wonderful character. He is gentle and kind, but can also be fierce and fatal when the situation calls for it. The children are believable--they are basically good at heart, but are certainly not perfect, and Edmund is extremely trying. I'm so glad I re-read this! The first time I heard the story was in fourth grade. Every child in my class was rapt with attention when our teacher read this to us. There is one part of the book where everyone in class put their heads down and cried. Then, the next day, when we heard the next chapter, everyone in class laughed and smiled with relief and joy (everyone who has read this book will know what part I'm writing about!)

Thus, I went into this series wondering whether this series, purportedly written for children, would appeal to my supposedly &quot;adult&quot; sensibilities. I needn't have worried. As most of the rest of the world seems to know already, the books are absolutely charming for readers of any age group...at least, for readers who still have a sense of wonder about them. I am writing this mini-review in &quot;The Lion&quot; section of Amazon rather than the &quot;Magician's Nephew&quot; section because I absolutely agree with the other readers who maintain that the original order of the books is the right and proper order in which to read them. The surprises that come and are explained in &quot;The Magician's Nephew,&quot; for example, are absolutely delightful when read as Book 6; as Book 1, they have little resonance or meaning. By all means ignore the new a! nd &quot;improved&quot; order that the dolts at Harper Collins have imposed. These are some of the best fantasy works that I've ever read, and it's a little embarrassing that I waited so long to discover them. I think my personal favorite of the series is &quot;The Voyage of the Dawntreader,&quot; but each book has so many exciting and memorable events and characters.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"It's a pleasure to read such an entertaining story. I have first watched the movie and liked it, but the book gave me an entirely different view of CS Lewis' World."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"As a teacher at a Christian school using this book has been wonderful in my Literature classes. Going into the Christian symbolism has been interesting and my students love it. This is a great book to show children there is deeper meaning behind surface story!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is the first book C. S. Lewis wrote in his Chronicles of Narnia series. Even though \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" occurs first chronologically (and is now listed as #1 in most sets), this book is a much better introduction to the land of talking animals and, more importantly, to Aslan. Though children from our world are the main characters in this (and other) Narnia stories, the true hero is Aslan, The Great Lion and Son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea.Though this is written as a fairytale for children it follows C. S. Lewis's philosophy that, \\"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.\\" Aslan is clearly a Christ character and each book, besides being a fun fantasy story, explores a different aspect of His character. This book reveals Aslan as Redeemer."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is a wonderful audio edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, perfect for car trips. However, if you are planning to read along with in the book, this is not the audio cd to purchase."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"You know, I can't help but question whether a book like this would be published today. There's a lot of telling, not so much showing, a lot of action is skimmed over and it's very obviously a religious allegory (not that that would make it ineligible for publication). I couldn't help but think that as I read it but at the same time I couldn't help but think just how magical the story actually is.Compare the circumstances to other works now and you don't have all that much that is original but then, back in 1950, this was the epitome of original. There was nothing else like this story except for facetious fairy tales that carried very little depth. This was the basis for portals and other worlds and magical creatures that authors today either consciously or subconsciously pull from for their own stories. So no, it's not original today but it is the very reason it's not original today, because it was so original and magical then that it was bound to spurn derivatives.This is a classic fairy tale despite the obvious Jesus references (if I could find that YouTube video, I'll post it, with Aslan as Jesus). It's light and airy and the kind that, obviously without me saying it, will stand the test of time for many more years to come. The children are eternally relatable , their wishes are forever there in the reader, to escape to a magic land and become king or queen. There's nothing in there that couldn't appeal to anyone, at any time, reading it.When comparing this book to something like Stardust by Neil Gaiman, I think the voice of Narnia just stands out. This was Lewis's voice. He was born to write these types of fantastical stories in the style of an age-old fairy tale. While Gaiman's idea for Stardust was on the level of awesome, the voice just wasn't right. There was a sort of force there, a trying too hard. I use Gaiman as an example because (aside from the fact that I can't think of any other authors that have tried to write like this) he's a magnificent writer and writes amazing stories. Stardust was an experiment for him, not his usual voice so it's not chalked up to him not being able to write. That old timey style voice of fairy story telling is bestowed only on a select few. Lewis was one of those few.These stories are capable of transcending time with ease and are written in such a way that they'll never go out of style. Sure, you'd have to be either really damn good or someone of Gaiman's status in the publishing industry to get something like this published now, and even then there's no guarantee of equivalence, but it doesn't erase the fact that Narnia was published, does exist and will continue to exist for generations. There is a classicism about these stories that just can't be erased and just can't be mimicked unless you've been bestowed with the voice to do it.Yes, there is so much that could be expanded on in Narnia but what's already there on the pages is amazing. Perhaps it is because it's the epitome of a fairy tale and someone who's much more critical than I can might be able to see how empty of a plate it might be but to me, there's just enough there to trust the reader. It's not bogged down in worldbuilding infodumping or unimportant backstory or research masturbation on the part of the author. All that's there is what's important to the story at hand, and nothing else. It goes from point to point seamlessly and with little to no fat and, for me anyway, makes the experience of the read that much more enjoyable.The world misses fairy tales like this, in all their simplicity but I don't think there can be much more than what there is now without an inundation which would only devalue what's already available. Let's hope the world never has to know what it's like to live without Narnia."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Okay, I finally got around to reading one of the most famous children's fantasies series ever done. Depending on who you talk to, this is actually the second book in the series if you read it by topic, but Lewis wrote this one first, dedicating it to his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. While perusing the Large Print editions of fiction in my local library, I was very pleased to discover this entire series by Lewis, and it is the illustrated version to boot! (Illustrations are b&w; line sketches by Pauline Baynes, much like the illustrated edition of the classic Wind in the Willows). The text of the book runs about 44,000 words so it is not a lengthy or deep read. It is intended for young children, possibly to be read to them. But this entire series is also an allegorical tale of Christianity, not just a simple fairy tale.In the first book of the series (thematically speaking), Lewis tells of creation, when he relates how The Magician's Nephew plays a part in the creation of the world of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is therefore a children's tale about triumph over evil, about the Christ and his redemption and the kingdom of God restored back to faithful believers, and the defeat of Satan. The gospel in a juvenile nutshell, to be exact. In the subsequent books of the series, Lewis deals with fulfilling our destiny with God's plan for our life (The Horse and His Boy); joy in the midst of tempest, with Christ as our conqueror (Prince Caspian); how we can be influenced by a future eternity if our hearts are set toward heaven (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader); a victorious hope against death with our resurrection (The Silver Chair); and the coming Armageddon and return of Jesus Christ and the new heaven and earth (The Last Battle). This all makes compelling reading, when you consider the hopelessness and misdirected avenues taken in sagas such as the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, which are sword and sorcery without any redeeming values.The story is very simple. Four children, Peter, Lucy, Susan and Edmund, all brothers and sisters, are sent away to a safe house in the English countryside to avoid the WW2 blitz in London. A friendly Professor takes them in. they explore the huge and strange house they are in and accidentally discover a magical passageway into a frozen world full of odd creatures. Lucy first falls through the doors of a wardrobe in one of the rooms, and discovers the world of Narnia. The others follow soon thereafter, and are soon involved in the mystery of this place. They get to meet Aslan, the lion king of Narnia, who has returned to reclaim his kingdom from the wicked White Witch. A sacrifice is made and a battle or two is fought, and Narnia is saved. This is plainly the good vs evil of the gospel accounts of the Christian Bible.Aslan (surely the original \`lion king') is a type of Christ, right up to his sacrificial death at the hands of the witch (Satan). Lewis wastes no time about fine details but carries his young characters right along briskly from scene to scene. I was a bit put off by the appearance of the character of Father Christmas and his reindeer and sleigh and gifts (a type of Santa) but at least Lewis had the courtesy to have this jolly guy praise the king (Aslan) as the real power of giving and love and joy. The entire story is chock-block full of Christian typology, in spite of many critics thinking otherwise. Lewis was perhaps the last century's best and most loved Christian apologist, and he has given the world of youth something very moralistic and divine to sink their teeth into here.I have no doubt that I will read the others sometime. I was prompted to read this one now because there is a very recent movie release based on this particular book, and I want to see it as well. The movie versions of the world of Narnia which were done before were effective in their day, including an animated TV series. The British are experts at this sort of thing. There are even Bible study courses using the characters in this enduring book series. The website ChristianityToday.com offers a lot of help in that direction. Walden Media, a division of Walt Disney Pictures, has produced the latest version of this story in full feature mode, and it is directed by Andrew Adamson, who also directed the previously successful and popular movies Shrek and Shrek II. While the movie audiences of the world seem to be on a quest for mythological escapism at the theaters, there isn't a great deal there of intelligent design or of upright moral teachings. This is a refreshing difference, and the old saying that \\"the book is usually better\\" is still very true in this age of computer-generated images and highly paid actors.I have never been a fan of science fantasy or any of the plethora of sword & sorcery literature out there - I've rarely seen the sense of it all. But if good themes and morals can be portrayed in an entertaining and different way, I will pay attention. While Tolkein's Lord of the Ring series bored me to no end (movies included) and while Harry Potter or the Wizard of Oz or the uncounted TV series which barf out those constant and stilted tales of witches and ghosts and phantom warriors and occultic happenstances, a series like this, composed by someone I personally consider to be the most capable writer in the English languange of the past century, is a treat in every way. An older child-centered adventure that is slow but more appealing is The Princess and the Goblin by George Macdonald, who was an important influence on Lewis."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a great book for people of all ages. The adventure begins when Lucy finds a magical wardrobe that takes her, her two brothers and sister into Narnia, a land full of magic, fun, and adventure."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeA good book is the type of book that will keep the reader's attention and keep them wanting to read more of that book or author. The story in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very interesting story. It's interesting because it's a story about this magic land inside of a coat closet, so it get you think about how Narnia got in a closet. The story is age-appropriate, and it would appeal to the kids because it is a Fantasy and Adventure story. That type of age group loves stories that have adventure. The book is very well written and easy to understand; C.S. Lewis is a good author. It is easy to conclude from the title and formation of the book that it has something to do with a lion, a witch and a wardrobe.The theme of the story is that good will triumph over evil and that you have got to have trust in people. Yes the theme is worth conveying to children to let them know that good will overpower evil with the right tools and attitude. The theme is moralistic and it may be a little overly moralistic to some people because of the religious connection. In my opinion the theme is not overly moralistic.The plot of the story is very well constructed. It introduces you to the land of Narnia, and sets each piece of the story in the right spot at the right time. It's not a confusing plot, it's a very easy plot to follow. The plot of the story is original and fresh, but the believable part is a little hard. You have to try and really work to believe kids have the power to save a whole magical land. All the characters, especially Lucy, seem really convincing and credible. They all grow from the experience in different ways, some grow in imagination and some in trust, and all four kids are changed by going to the land of Narnia.This is a very good story for all ages to read; it has the important elements of a great story, the laughter and the tears. You learn from this book really fast who is good and who is not. It has symbolism to reading that is really subtle, but if you pay attention, you will pick up on it. I like the book because of the air of mystery with what is in the wardrobe and at first only one of the kids, Lucy, believes in Narnia. It is a really good book that all kids need to read. You will like it; it is one of my favorites.Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia S.)"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"How can you not love The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe? This book is just tremendous. I listened to it on audiobook recently and fell in love with it all over again. This is one of those books that you could read or listen to once a year and never get sick of it. Love it!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"*The Chronicles of Narnia* is perhaps the best-loved series of all time. It is loved by not just children, but men and women of all ages. I have grown up since I was eleven years old with these beloved stories, and they, along with CS Lewis' other writings that I discovered as an adult, have had an immeasurable impact on my life.Indeed, I feel almost shy about writing a review of any of these books, but I will try to do so. We will start with the first review about the first book, *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*. I am going to be reviewing these in publishing order, not chronological order.Most everyone knows the base story. Probably many know it better than their own country's history. Many children are sent into the English countryside to escape the air raids over London by the German *Luftwaffe* during World War II. Among these are four siblings, the Pevensies. They are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They are extremely fortunate to end up in the house of a wealthy Professor.Once at the house, first Lucy, then Edmund, and eventually all four of the children, wind up in the enchanted land of Narnia. Really, (as shall be revealed in later books) it is a completely other dimension/universe from our own. The country of Narnia in this other world is ruled by a tyrant, the White Witch Jadis, who is determined to kill the children to thwart a prophecy that states that when four humans, two boys and two girls, sit on the thrones in the castle of Cair Paravel, it will mean the end of her tyranny and her life.Along the way, many adventures are had, and many lessons are learned. Edmund betrays them, and is repentant later on. He is redeemed from his stain of betrayal by Aslan the Lion, Who leads the children and the Narnians to triumph over the Witch and her forces.The novel is not just an example of superb storytelling, but also of wit, description, and wonderful use of the English language. The subtle jokes and historical references are enjoyable, and lead to the audience actually *thinking* about what they are reading. The descriptions and elegant use of language is absolutely captivating. The audience is transported directly into the story, and can almost see and smell what the characters do, and eat the foods along with them. What I mean by the masterful use of the English language is how Lewis was not overly \\"high-minded\\" in his words and descriptions. He was elegant without seeming snooty. This is not always easy to do, and Lewis did it quite well.All of these ideas are well-known about the book, but there is even more to glean from the work. To be sure, the most important element in the story is the symbolic truth of Christ, and His atoning death on the Cross for our sins via the story of Aslan giving His life in place of Edmund the traitor. Lewis once stated how culture in the West has become too comfortable and familiar with the Scriptures, and thus they have lost much of their impact on us. When we are moved by the story of Aslan dying for Edmund (and rising in the end), or even of any sacrificial character in other stories (whether they rise like Gandalf, or stay dead), it is really the truth of the Scriptures touching our hearts.There are many other areas that I could examine, but I will focus on one more that I think reviewers do not focus on enough. This area deals with heroism and the modern definition and view (a very *Christian* view), that would have been familiar to Lewis given his studies of literature and various periods of history, including the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\".I do not know for certain what Lewis thought beyond what he has said, and I heartily disdain putting words in an author's mouth. I have always hated that people say what an author thinks, especially if they don't know what the author thinks, or if their statements of the author's intents actually *contradicts* the author's beliefs.The above disclaimer is to serve as a notice that I can not guarantee what I am venturing is correct about CS Lewis' intentions. But I will try to gauge his idea of a hero, because it is important for us to consider how even in this area, the Bible impacted our culture and Lewis' story. In the history of the West and of America in particular, there is a falsehood that many erroneously believe. This is that the culture we all embrace comes from the Greco-Roman heritage of the West. This is pure bunk. To be sure, the love of learning and the importance of the Law were gleaned from the Greco-Roman history, but the moral and philosophical underpinnings that have made the West more vibrant, and more ready to use knowledge to better ourselves and others, than any other civilization in history are the result of the Christian Faith.What this has to do with the idea of heroism is that the gods and heroes in Greek mythology were vile and cruel creatures. They were murderous and petty, and took obscene delight in hurting and torturing people. The idea of the hero as the strongest one who exerts his will on others is the Greco-Roman idea of the hero. The idea was changed and altered as Christianity became the dominant force in the West.Really, the early concept embraced by the Church is identical, except that the obvious change had started in the morality of the hero. The hero was called on to do good in honor of God. This was due to the Church taking the knightly orders under it's control, in order to put an end to indiscriminate killings for \\"glory\\" that many of the supposed \\"heroes\\" pursued.Eventually, a Reformation and Enlightenment came and went, and the \\"hero\\" changed. Now the hero was expected to act as the Lord Jesus Christ acted. Sacrifice for the sake of others is what marks a true hero. This is what is special about Aslan the Lion, and even Edmund as well. Aslan sacrifices his life for Edmund, and via the prophecy, *all of Narnia itself*. Edmund sacrifices himself to save his fellow Narnians and his family when he destroys the Witch's wand, leaving himself open to attack.This sacrificial hero is important to our history, and it is one we are fast losing. Lewis has helped us to revive this great ideal and this great Truth. Indeed, many other concepts and Truths are buried in LWW, as in they are in the rest of the Narnia books. For helping to teach, and ingrain them in the minds of many men and women for nearly sixty years, we owe a massive debt to Lewis.This book inaugurates a series that has many \\"hidden\\" nuggets of wisdom and moral ideals that we would all do well to notice and embrace. It is also a frollicking good story. Please pick up this book and the others, you will *NOT* regret it.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Here are two meanings I got out of the first book. The first meaning i saw was an awesome and well detailed magical story. I saw this to be fun to read. A great story, and that I had something to look forward to, because it is a series. Then I found a out the movie was coming out. My brother mentioned something to me about the meaning behind the book. This is to share Jesus Christ, and show what he did in many different ways. Aslan is supposed to represent Jesus Christ as some might know. Then other people are supposed to represent different things. It shows Aslan dying for the sins the prince made, then raising from the dead. Sound familiar to someone? There were also tons more metaphors relating to christianity. Like the evil witch representing the devil in some parts. First of all, the which is always taunting the lion(Jesus Christ). Also the queen tempting the prince into things like turkish delite, over the love for eachother. Those are just some of the ways i believe the book relates. There are many other things you can get out of the book. If you didn't know some of this, then don't hold back from reading your child the book, because of some of the relations. It is another great title from C.S. Lewis. I hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I have read this story several times in my life however i never wrote a review. I recently read the book again because the movie was coming out and i wanted to see how well the movie tied into the book.This is simply a wonderful book and a very quick and easy read. Please do not be discouraged from reading this book because of the possible Christian references. Whether you are a believer or not you can fully enjoy this fictional tale.The book is full of fantasy creatures, heros and enemies that will leave you smiling at the pure genius of how it all comes together. I have always enjoyed this book and will probably read this book a few more times over the course of my lifetime.Take some time and read this book before seeing the movie, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"My father read this story to me as a child. I was only lucky enough to get a chapter each night. I remember wanting more. Wanting the story to be read faster. Reading it now, years later, I'm impressed with how it still captivates me. This story is about four children who move into a large house away from their family. While playing hide-and-seek one rainy day they find a wardrobe that takes them to a magical land, Narnia. In Narnia they learn of an evil White Witch that has caused it to be winter all the time. The children, work with the lion king to try and restore some order to Narnia. This is a perfect story for adults and children alike!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I'm 28 and, sadly, this is the first time I have read this book. I am ashamed myself. But with the movie coming out,I wanted to read it before I saw the movie. It was an extremely quick read...a couple hours is all it took and well worth the time. I am not a fan of fantasy but this book was a cute book...CS Lewis has yet to let me down."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Any child or adult would sit up straight to hear the story of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from start to finish. Mr. Lewis had the talent of capturing readers' attention especially children's then grasping their interest throughout a whole story. This tale is drolly told right through the entire book. It is a gripping adventure taken by four siblings who are actually eagerly anticipated by beings in another world. There are entities of rivalry, greed, betray, merriment, kindness, magic, and triumph for each person's enjoyment. Although the end is too fantastic that amnesia or giddiness might have been the cause for the four children's forgetfulness of their origin, the immensely entertaining technique of narration overcomes the poor conclusion."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The story, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, features four children displaced from their home in London due to violence of WWII to a remote country cottage. Upon arriving to their caretaker's cottage they explored the odd rooms and furniture. To eliminate their boredom, they decided to play hide-and-go-seed. This is when the youngest, Lucy, hides in the wardrobe and stumbles across the land called Narnia. The snowy land of Narnia is filled with all types of little creatures like fauns, dwarfs, and beavers, but the land of Narnia also has one White Witch, who calls herself the Queen of Narnia.The four children don't realize that they are the ones who can stop the White Witch and save Narnia from the Winter Wonderland that the witch has cast upon it. With the help of a lion named Aslan they over throw the witch and Narnia has all different seasons all over again. All of the animals live in peace and harmony after the reign of the White Witch is over.This story is written for one who enjoys adventure and likes to have fun. On a scale from 1-5 I would rate it a 4 because it's one of those books that you can't put down once you start to read it. It's a children's book even though some adults enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"If you are familiar with Lewis' non-fiction writings (Mere Christianity, etc.) were all that Lewis had written he would have left a wonderful legacy. However, Lewis has a large library of fictional works as well.'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is my only my second piece of Lewis fiction (the other being 'The Screwtape Letters') and I found it to be a quick, enjoyable read. The characters are likeable but sketchy, but that is understandable considering that he intended it to be a fairy tale. How much character development is there in a fairy tale?Christian themes are very strong throughout the book, but the story can be read without any previous study into Christianity. If you are unsure of the themes or want to make sure that you are not missing any, I would recommend that you pick up any of the half-dozen or more companion study guides that Amazon offers."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Lewis is amazing in many respects, one of the reasons is his ability to adapt to his audience that he is writing to. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an amazing extension of who Lewis was. The book itself is seamless and flows from beginning to end. Lewis creates characters that are real and fun, leaving you able to become involved with the story.Aslan is a great hero, evoking a strong and protective, just and right lion who is the people's champion. Throw in the evil white witch and some naive Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve and you have a tale worth reading. The ending is very clever (especially since Lewis foreshadowed it) as Aslan brings an army to the battlefield.Don't get me wrong. Lewis says it in his opening acknowledgment. This is a fairy tale meant for children, or for an adult willing to sit down and enjoy a fairy tale, for that is what it is. Don't mistake this for a full blown fantasy series and book. The descriptions are short and concise, the characters are black and white, and the outcome is fun. That being said, there is no reason why this book, or series, cannot be enjoyed by an adult. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially to be read before the movie."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis really did a great job in creating a world known as Narnia. A little background on Narnia: Narnia is a place stuck in a winter that is never ending, it is \\"ruled\\" by the White Witch. There is only winter and no Christmas. There are many, many creatures in the land of Narnia.The book starts when 4 kids are shipped to a professors mansion during the times of WWII. They are told not to disturb the professor. They pretty much have the huge house to themselves, so there is much mischief that they can get into. Well Lucy, the youngest of the 4 one day stumbles upon a wardrobe. She enters into it, but there is not a back to the wardrobe and it leads to Narnia. She meets a creature called a Faun. He is actually a creature that is supposed to be telling the White Witch that a human entered Narnia.She gets back and her brothers and sisters don't believe her. Nevertheless later in the book they all end up in Narnia, and are stunned that Lucy had been telling the truth the whole time.The meet many creatures along the way. They meet with a Beaver and his wife and they are told of the White Witch, Aslan (a lion who the White Witch fears), and the prophecy that they would be fulfilling.Well one of the four, Edmund takes off after the White Witches palace, because they had meet before and she gave him something to eat.Aslan ends up putting down his life for Edmund after he supposedly betrays the White Witch. This is a parallel to Jesus Christ. Many other Christian thems take place after this, and I don't want to reveal them for they are amazing.Note that this book is highly recommended by me. It has a ton of Christian themes, and it takes you to a fantasy land that is amazing to me. You should definitely get this book, it's for all ages!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This magical story has amazing mythical creatures.

But Ive never seen a son of Adam or a doughter of Eve befor.&quot; This quote kind of lets you know that there are not many humans in Narnia. They refered to humans as sons and, doughters of Adam and, Eve. this book also shows you that even though they are animals they can still talk in english.

I really enjoyed reading this book because everything was perfectly arranged in this book. This book has a queen that ruled Narnia, and she was evil. No one liked her, her name is White Witch. She has no respect for anyone but herself, she say bad things to people, for an example on page 29.

Lewis popular children's fantasy series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". It is not the first of the series chronologically, but the second, and although there is much debate over whether one should read the books in the order that they were written or the order in which they take place, I cast my vote for order of writing or publication, with \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" first. The books refer to one another, which makes reading them in order of publication seem more natural -and more desirable, as it also prevents too much from being revealed too soon. The mysteries of the back-story help sustain readers' interests, which might otherwise wane, for the duration of 7 books.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is a fairy tale about brave and honorable children in a magical land. Four siblings -Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy- are sent to the country home of a kindly old Professor to escape the London air raids during World War II. One day Lucy, the youngest, steps into a big old wardrobe, lured by the cuddly fur coats hanging inside. Stepping farther and farther into the wardrobe, past where the back of it should be, Lucy finds herself in a snow-covered forest in a strange land called Narnia, where human children are a rarity. She returns to the house full of excitement, but her brothers and sister don't believer her incredible story. But when all 4 youngsters pile into the wardrobe, trying to evade the housekeeper Mrs. Macready, they are transported to Narnia and find themselves key figures in a fight to free Narnia from the oppressive reign of the White Witch.When I read \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as a child, I found it too simplistic. Reading the book again as an adult, I realize that the problem was that I was too old. I discovered \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" when I was about 10 years old and already captivated by the more sophisticated Tolkien fantasy books. \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are written in a rudimentary style with two-dimensional characters. \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" seems hastily constructed with awkward dialogue and long passages dedicated to insignificant scenes while major events are made incidental. (Lewis' writing style improved in subsequent books.) These books are fairy tales intended for young children. The difficulty is that they are probably too young to read them. But if your kids like to be read to, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are an good choice. I've never met a child who didn't like to hear stories of children who are important, independent, and take control of their own lives. Biblical allegory and morality plays notwithstanding, I think that is why Narnia appeals to children."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This Item was described as hard back It was not. I sent it back. I got a full refund. The book is good reading. I would recommend it. If you don't mind paperback buy it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This had more charm than I remember from 4th grade, but I still take issue with a few plot points. \\"Ha ha, I win because of deep magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" \\"Oh, yeah, well, ha ha, I win because of even deeper magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" It's almost like Aslan and the White Witch are playing Calvinball. I realize Lewis needed these kinds of plot devices to make the allegory work, but would it have killed Lewis to throw in a little foreshadowing? He foreshadowed other things. It was within his power.The saddest thing about this for me is that there's a nice little adventure story buried under the deus ex machina plot mechanisms. At least there could have been. Perhaps a different author would have sent the characters to find their accoutrement (Peter's sword, Lucy's cordial, Susan's bow--which she never used, I'd like to point out). But Lewis decided to play the Santa Clause card, because... well... I have no idea. I had to keep reminding myself that this was only a children's book, and perhaps it would have been more dramatic if it had been written with an older audience in mind. The moments of narrative tension evaporate quickly. Most of the crucial battle takes place off-screen. The only characters with any development at all are Lucy and Edmund. Peter's supposed to be the hero, but he barely has any screen time. And I realize it was written in the 50's, but is it necessary to constantly break the 4th wall?Oh, and can I take a moment to complain about the professor? I can only assume that he's a Mary Sue for Lewis, and yet he's this jolly, one-dimensional deified beacon of anti-intellectualism. GRR!!!Okay, I've griped. LWW is at least fun and imaginative. And while the main machinations of the plot are transparent allegories for Christianity, they're at least not oppressive. The story is allowed to breathe a little underneath them and develop its own personality. I rather liked that the book has a sense of awe and wonder about itself, and while I can criticize it for being far too brief for its scope, I can just as easily criticize J.R.R. Tolkien for the pointless ramble that is the first six chapters or so of The Fellowship of the Ring. It was a different time and new genre, nobody knew what they were doing. LWW is mercifully short, colorful, engaging, and very accessible, for all its foibles. I guess that makes Lewis the anti-Tolkien, now that I think about it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I'm 21 years old and I picked this book up because I had never read it as a child and wanted to read it before I saw the movie. It is a very short book and I am pretty sure I read the book in less time then it took me to watch the movie. Most younger readers will not have a problem with this one and it is entertaining enough to keep them reading until the end.The story seemed kind choppy to me and there was very little character development. However, this is only the first of the chronicles of narnia and I've heard the the other books are better and since they involve the same characters there is bound to be more development. I think I might have just been to old when I read this book.If you're looking to get your young reader into novels then this might be a good introduction. Then they can continue with the rest of the series. If you're looking for something entertaining for your 14+ year old, this isn't it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeBy C.S. LewisHarperTrophyIn a room of the Professor's house stands a wardrobe of coats and something more, something that was destined to be discovered by teh youngest of four children, Lucy Pevensie, while exploring the house. Lucy and her siblings, Peter, Susan, and Edmund, explore the land inside the wardrobe; the land of Narnia, frozen in eternal winter by the White Witch, a land that is waiting to be set free as the prophecy says. However, after over 100 years of winter, the creatures have lost almost all hope, but the return of the Great Lion, Aslan, and the appearence of the four children causes a great change, a betrayal, a great sacrifice, and a great war thast will decide the future of Narnia and all of its creatures.The four Pevensies are very curious children. Little did they know, they had a huge part in the freedom of Narnia. Their arrival signaled the return of Aslan, the end of winter, and the beginning of spring. Peter is the oldest of the four, then Susan, Edmund, and at last Lucy. Peter tries to act like their father (who was probably sent out to war) while Susan tries to act like their mother (who is back at their home in London). Edmund is greedy and even betrayed his siblings to the witch for power that wasn't real. Lucy is very curious and truthful. She has never told a lie. Although the first impression of Aslan is terrifying, this lion is quite gentle, kind, caring, and brave. He is greater that any other lion in Narnia. He has a lovely golden mane and great, royal, solemn, overwhlming eyes. Aslan was there before the dawn of time (this is a fact that will save his life). The Great Lion is the enemy of Jadis, the White Witch. The White Witch is the last Queen of Charn. Jadis has had Narnia under her control for over 100 years. She is as white as snow and has a very red mouth. The White Witch wears a golden crown on the top of her head and carries a long straight, golden wand in her right hand. This witch has a heart as cold as ice and turns creatures to stone with her golden wand. She is truly the evil creature of the story.This story is very magical and curious. I think this because in the story, Lucy discovers the wardrobe out of plain curiosity and the story gets more curious as you read on. I would also describe this story as magical because it is about a fictional world of fantasy. This book has a fantasy genre. I like this genre because is this book, there is a lot of mystical events which helps good triumph over evil. I recommend this book to children in grades three through five. It is truly a wonderful book, but I think that it is too easy for sixth and seventh graders. Third grade is mostly whne children start reading short chapter books a lot and fifth grade is when children usually stop reading short chapter books and start reading longer books. However, if you are a kid at heart and love a good story, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This book is fiction and was written in 1950. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is about two boys and two girls named Susan, Lucy, Peter, and Edmund. These four children were taken away from there home because of the war. They were taken to another house where they lived with a professor. The main part of the story takes place in Narnia.In Narnia there was an evil queen she was called the White Witch. She would make it snow all year but there was no Christmas. And if she saw someone that was happy she would turn them into stone. The most exciting part of the book for me was the battle between Aslan's army and the White Witch's army. What I liked about the book was that it tells you four kids could save a whole world. The book had a great ending it turned out that Susan, Lucy, Edmund, and Peter became the new kings and queens and Narnia was finally in peace."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is an awsome book!

They are determined to save him and the rest of Narnia from the White Witch who cast a spell on Narnia to make it always winter, but never Christmas. Both children and adults have enjoyed this classic for years and it is now a wonderful motion picture. &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; is the second of a seven book series describing the enchanting woods of Narnia.

Lewis has been one of the best fantasy books I've read before. This book opened my imagination and showed me what fantasy really looked like. This story begins when four schoolchildren are sent from London because of World War II and the air raids. There Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find their way through the back of a wardrobe into the magic land of Narnia. Lucy is the first one that discovers the fantasyland of Narnia and met there Mr. Tumnus, a faun who explained how Narnia was controled by the White Witch who has cursed the land with eternal winter. These kids knew that the Witch had to be fought so that Narnia could return into its normal state.When the four of them went into the magic land of Narnia, Edmund was being controled by the witch. He made a deal with the White Witch, since he didn't know the witch wanted to turn him and the others into stone so that they could from part of her stone statues collection. the deal was that if he bring the others to her castle by the next day, he was going to become and turned into King of Narnia, which wasn't true at all.then they assist Aslan the great golden lion to triumph over the witch and in a blink of an eye all their lives changed."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I feel that any parent who would not encourage their child to read C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; should be charged with neglect. Even though these stories are a kiddie version of the &quot;Bible&quot;, where Jesus of Nazareth is replaced by a lion, they are fun to read and bring out the goodness in everyone. These books also show, not just children but anyone who reads them, that people can be swayed by evil, but that everyone can be true at heart. These action adventures have had a lasting impression on me. Yes, I understood that C.S. Lewis was just covering up Christianity with a lion's mane, but I have not let that affect my relegious views in any way. I did take the lessons of kindness and forgiveness to heart however. Even though my nephew was only a year old this past Christmas, I bought him the whole set of the &quot;Narnia Chronicles&quot;, hoping that someday he will find joy in them like I did."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I would never give any book a 10, unless it captured my heart time and time again, this book deserves it. I've read it fourteen times now and my mind dreams on and on for fortnights and my heart is singing and wailing to see the blessed Naria of which Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy talk about seeing. It makes my day bright and gay to read about such happy adventures that the four children have together. At least it's much better than reading about the misfortune in Jonsboro, Arkansas or about some gangs shooting at one another, etc. The Chronicles of Narnia are a wonderful collection to pass down from generation to generation. The best, though, is The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I have read this book over and over again, it's one of those. I am now in 8th grade and in fourth grade the teacher read all six books from the Chronicles of Narnia to us. I now read them to my sister and enjoy them so much myself as well. Presently, I am looking for information as I am composing a project on Clive Staple Lewis and the Narnia books. I have encouraged all of my friends to get wrapped up in them and they indeed have; and have all thanked me. There are so many great sites with amazing things. I never look at any of the pictures of the characters, since I do not want the way I have created them with my imagination to be replaced by an artist's point of view (no offense). In conclusion, I would like to say that I think everyone should be swept into Narnia, no matter what age they might be, they will all find the books (especially 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe') fascinating and delightful.

Enraptured was I in the prose and the way the it flowed. From the beginning when the children are sent to the country-side mansion to escape the air raids in London is a bit of a history lesson that children, as well as, adults are treated to. There are little lessons in morality, religion, history, and undeniable fantasy wrapped in a story sure to please. I read this book again and again and from the moment Lucy steps through the wardrobe door and pushes her way back through what seems and impossibly large wardrobe, through fur coat after coat, and finally into the forest, hearing the snow crunch beneath her feet, I was hooked. Hats off to C.S. Lewis for making literature that has kept me young in mind and heart."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I read this book when I was perhaps eleven and I have read it over and over again as the years have passed.

This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia. I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than 1 week and that was the fastest i read a book because it was so interesting and captivating. This is now 1 of my favorite books. I recommend that others read this book and like it as i did to. I enjoyed reading this because it was so captivating. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is very courageous, and caring to others. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named something very special. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She was my least favrite because she is evil. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were given a special position in Narnia My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he lied and said he had never been there. I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination. I liked it because it had vivid details and it was imaginative. It was also full of great characters kids can relate to. Since the characters were kids our age and the setting was an imaginary place it made it more fun to read.

The four children embark on an exciting quest to stop the witch and save Narnia.I enjoyed this book for many reasons, but also there were some parts that were a little annoying. Some of the good things about this book are that the fantasy world Narniaseems very realistic. The characters are also very believable, they have human-like characteristics. The characters are animals, that talk and act just like humans. Some of the annoying things that are in this book are: the way C. S. switches between characters it some times confuses me.

Back then, I had absolutely no idea what the Chronicles of Narnia were, and why my theology teacher had been mentioning it as a recommended read. Upon reading it, you would initially say that it is a beautifully worded work of prose. Dare I say I had thought it to be a children's book, but upon finishing it, I had to change my view.

It was awfully cruel of the faun Mr. Tumnus to be working for the White Witch although it was cool how he told the truth about it. I did not like it when the other children didn't believe Lucy, but then Edmund found it and the White Witch and he thought she was the Queen of Naria. It was weird though when she made a hot drink and turkish delight out of snow and something in a bottle. I love though the way the beavers let the four children come in to their house that was so kind of them. It was cool how they let the children even eat dinner with them. It was sad though about how Mr. Tumnus the guy faun that Lucy met got taken away by the police. The when the spell started to break I cheered up.

The children soon find out that they are the only humans and the animals can talk. Also they find out that they can stay in Narnia as long as they want and they wont lose any time on earth. The children and Aslan, the lion save Narnia become kings and queens and rule Narnia for many years with out ever losing a second of earth time.My favorite part of the book is the great big war between good and evil when the children find out that Aslan (even though he sacrificed himself to save them) came back to life and they fight side by side animal and human fighting for a common ground. The witch has great big ugly beasts on her side but Aslans army is far more cunning then these barbarians. Together, they defeat evil and rule the land of Narnia.I have read many fantasy books in my life and this one is not my favorite to say the least. If you want a quick read this is the book for you but if you want a book that will keep you reading for months I suggest the Shannara series by Terry Brooks. This was a good book but it could have been better. Overall this book has me satisfied and I will probably read the rest of the chronicles of Narnia series.

It was very exciting. It always had action in the book. It had a very great and fascanating plot. I loved how they walked into a different world. It was cool when all the characters were in the book.It was the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Have you ever imagined being sent away to someone's house, that has a secret that no one knows but you? The house in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe had a secret , which only Peter, Susan,Edmund, and Lucy knows. Once they went through the wardrobe in the house,their adventures would begin in the land called Narnia, and their lives will change.I love this book, because it tells about Lucy trying to save her friend Tumnus. It tells about the wonderful adventures she had with her friends, Peter, Susan, and Edmund and the great dangers they faced in Narnia. I also liked the little rhymes that describes Aslan, the great lion.I wish that this book would be longer and the adventures of Narnia would countinue in this book.I recommend this book for people who like adventure stories, because this book is filled with adventures.My favorite part is when the dwarf made Edmond a prisoner and used a whip to threaten him to go faster. If the White Witch ( a terrible witch) that calls herself queen of Narnia wants Edmond to go faster, the dwarf whips him until he goes faster.My other favorite part is when Edmond got tricked into bringing Peter, Susan and Lucy to her because she wants to turn Edmond and his friends into stone. They are smart and she doesn't want them to break the White Witch's spell. The spell is a spell that will keep Narnia always in a winter season.On the map, I think it is a little confusing because it doesn't show the place where Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy came through the Wardrobe to Narnia, but the story is exciting."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Having been a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings for a long time, I picked up a book by J.R.R. Tolkien's friend, C.S. Lewis. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read LWW first, as it was the first published, or to begin with The Magician's Nephew, as Lewis himself had said he preferred as the opening novel in the Chronicles. Although this is the only Chronicle I've read so far, I'm glad I started with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.From the moment Lucy explores the back of her makeshift hiding place and begins to find trees and snow on the ground and the famous lamppost, being completely free of the knowledge of how Narnia originated lets the reader experience the same wonder and amazement that the characters feel. I was entranced by the mystery of the land and its inhabitants. I don't think I would've felt the same way if I had prior knowledge of Aslan, Jadis, or the history of Narnia.The story itself reads very quickly and is sparse with details in areas, such as the battle at the end, but it allows the reader to fill in with their own imaginations whatever is not outright told to them by the author. Anyone who loves visiting fantastic worlds, such as Middle-Earth or Hogwarts, I heartily recommmend this book."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"... of Michael York.

The young reader noticed that the books were published out of order as far as the Narnian time line goes with the creation of Narnia occuring in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (the sixth book published). In the letter, the child asked which order the books should be read in. Lewis replied that it was really up to the reader, but he prefered them chronologically within the Narnian world which places \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" first. SO it is up to the reader whether you want to read them in the new order (approved by the author) or their publication order. Either way you do it, \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" occurs at the same time \\"The Lion and the Witch and the wardrobe\\" occurs. I read them both ways, and LW&W is a better \\"first book\\" because it's more action oriented than MN. It was more interesting for me as a young reader to go back in time and read about the creation of one of my favorite fantasy worlds...every reader might not agree (obviously the publishers and the Lewis family don't). Enjoy them either way!"},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, of course, loved by millions as a classic, and it truly deserves its distinction. Rarely will any reader of any genre find a story so moving and entertaining and so enlightening. I can't recommend anything more highly than this little volume.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter who wander through an old wardrobe into the magical world of Narnia. What follows is their adventure as they team with a nation of talking animals and other magical creatures versus the evil powers in the kingdom. The novel climaxes with one extraordinary act of love which tears through the kingdom and changes everything and everyone after.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is such a successful novel. It does serve as a wonderfully powerful read. The book also enlightens the reader with its commentary Christian symbolism on the nature of love. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a classic, and I really think that it is just now coming into what may be its most popular period. The world is pleading for some type of meaning, and here, Lewis is willing to offer it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"When four English siblings (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) are sent to the country to avoid the air raids in London, they find a secret passageway in a wardrobe that leads them to an imaginary land called Narnia. Here the four young children meet a few interesting characters: Tumnus the Faun, a half-goat/half-man that befriends Lucy when she's lost; the Beaver family who help the children elude the White Witch and her dangerous allies; and, lastly, the White Witch herself, who has laid claim over Narnia with her year-round winter spell and her self-proclaimed title: \\"Queen of Narnia\\". She is also the one who lures Edmund to her side with endless supplies of Turkish Delight and subtle hints of him becoming King.During their adventures, the four children ultimately meet Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia who has returned, at last, to reclaim his land from the evil queen. Together they--along with the help of several other mystical beings--aim to defeat the White Witch and return Narnia to its original state and ownership.After reading \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", you'll definitely want to read the following books in this series: \\"Prince Caspian\\" (#2), \\"The Voyage of the 'Dawn Treader'\\" (#3), \\"The Silver Chair\\" (#4), \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" (#5), \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (#6), and \\"The Last Battle\\" (#7). Although \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is geared for children age 8 to 12, I consider it appropriate for all ages and encourage everyone to read it.I received the entire Narnia collection from one of my aunts when I was a kid, either for my birthday or some other holiday--I don't remember. Anyway, this book/series has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. It's a wonderful fantasy meant for children, but will inspire adults as well. Highly recommended. It also makes a wonderful gift. ;)There are some Christian undertones in this book, such as the terms \\"Daughter of Eve\\" and \\"Son of Adam\\" for humans in Narnia, as well as Aslan's sacrifice for Edmund; however, I don't really regard The Chronicles of Narnia as a religious series. You can expect a wholesome story, but not to worry--it isn't preachy or overly self-righteous.Several years after it was published, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was made into a TV series in the late 60s, which I never saw because I wasn't born yet. Plus it only aired in the UK. About ten years later, in 1979 (the year I was born), a cartoon movie was made, but I didn't see that one either. The only movie I vaguely recall watching was the 1988 movie starring Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Jonathan R. Scott, and Sophie Wilcox. I remember that even then I wasn't too impressed with it, not as much as I was with the book.So, for those who love children's fantasies, or are just C. S. Lewis fans, then I highly recommend this book and series. It's well worth your time."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"While this is not my favorite book in the Chronicles of Narnia, it still merits five stars and is an excellent book. Few authors can capture the imagination like C. S. Lewis was able to do, and I doubt that many will ever be able to again. This book is unbelievable, yet believable. Extraordinary and impossible things happen, yet Lewis describes things like the meal set before them at the Beaver's Dam so eloquently and vividly, it makes you seem as if you were there, and when you realize you are not, you are suddenly very hungry and wishing you had some fresh fish just caught from the icy river.In addition to being a fantastic story, it contains a point, something which many modern fictional stories fail to do. In this book, C. S. Lewis lays out the crucifixion and Ressurection of Christ, except in Narnia Christ is not a man, but a lion, and not named Jesus, but Aslan. The power and majesty of the Great Lion impresses one while reading, yet his kindness and love shine through no weaker. Lewis does an amazing job of presenting to us the Christ of another world, and I cannot imagine anyone doing a much better job of it.If you have seen the recent movie which models itself after this book, you have seen but a shadow of the real thing. The book is thousands of times better than either the PBS version or the new release. The new release managed to take the focus off of Aslan and put it instead on the children by talking about how the hope that the children have brought has ended the winter, whereas in the book, it was Aslan's power which did it (among numerous other changes to this effect). The movie both lowers Aslan and the importance of the death and ressurection of Aslan, and I think that it fails to capture the real essense of this work. The real thing is so much better, it is well worth the time required to read it."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one.

Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"Unlike most of the rest of the world, I never read this series as a kid. With the movie coming out, I thought I would take a look as an adult. While the story is nice and there are some fantasy elements that would be appealing to kids, it seems odd to me to compare this book to epics like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, principally because there is just not much there. The story is short and simple, the battles barely rate a couple of sentences of description, there is a bit of repetition, and the characters are fairly simply drawn. Don't get me wrong: I have no problem with the allegorical message or the story for what it is, but is is more akin to A Wrinkle in Time in terms of depth and detail than it is to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. Thus, it is more likely to be appealing to younger kids than to those able to tackle more extensive and more complex reading material. YA readers who like Narnia might also like Jean Rabe's The Finest Creation."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) is a children's fantasy novel, the first and best-known in C.

This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"During the German blitz of London in WWII, four siblings are sent to the English countryside for safekeeping by an eccentric professor and his stodgy servants. Left with nothing to do besides play and get into trouble, Lucy, the youngest, gets into a wardrobe and finds a passageway to the magical world of Narnia. It is there that she meets a certain Mr. Tumnus, a nice enough chap who just happens to be a \\"Faun\\", or what I would call a satyr. At first Tumnus seems to be very friendly and invites Lucy back to his home for tea. It is there that he reveals that he is supposed to capture any humans he finds and report them to the White Witch, the self-appointed ruler of Narnia who has entrapped the land in endless winter. When he goes against the Witch's orders he is taken prisoner and taken to her castle. Lucy, along with Susan, Peter, and Edmund, set out to rescue the Faun, and in the process becomes agents of prophecy who may have the power to overthrow the wicked White Witch. They're not alone. Aslan, the god-like lion that created Narnia, has also returned to lead the fight against the black magic that threatens to extinguish all goodness. But the kids never counted on one of their own blood turning against them.Since they came out around the same time and the two authors were such good friends, one cannot help but compare the Narnia books to the Lord of the Rings sequence. And let me tell you, Lewis's work seems pale in comparison to Tolkien's. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe never quite makes it to epic status. There are too few characters, the world seems landlocked and hyperfocused, and you never get the sense that the book is part of a larger tapestry. Instead of world-building for all eternity, Lewis did just enough to frame his story. Nothing more. Nothing less. I just don't feel that the work has a solid mythology behind it.I also didn't feel very connected to the characters. They all seemed distant, cold, and at times very snobbish, in a way that only the English can be. Instead of warm-blooded real life characters, the four kids were more like anonymous cut-outs from fairy tales. Yes, Edmund was a little backstabber, and Lucy was the curious one, but beyond that, I never got a feel for who these people really were.I will say this. I liked the book ok. It was a nice diversion, but I just never connected fully with it. I definitely do not rate it as a classic. It seemed more like a work produced in the 19th century than the 20th, and perhaps that was Lewis's intention. It just didn't work for me. I will definitely continue to read the series though."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This is one of the best series out there for all ages !!!!!!!

Lewis wrote this volume first, in 1950, but he later said that The Magician's Nephew, written in 1955, should be considered the first book in his seven book Narnia series. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe occurs when the main character of The Magician's Nephew is an old man, a very wise professor, who lives in a very large house.Four children, siblings, two brothers and two sisters, are sent out of London to the professor's house in the countryside to escape the bombs dropped by the German air force during World War II. They discover a wardrobe that turns out to be a portal leading to the magical land of Narnia.Narnia is under the control of a wicked witch who is a descendant of Adam and the demon Lilith. She has covered all of Narnia with cold weather and snow, with no Christmas for a hundred years. Aslan the lion, the God figure, the creator of Narnia, has been absent from Narnia ever since the wicked witch took control. The citizens of Narnia look forward to his return to save them from the evil. This reminds readers of the popular idea that a messiah will come and help create an ideal world.There is a prophecy in Narnia that if four humans come to Narnia, two males and two females, Aslan will return. The four siblings are present; however, one of the two boys has been seduced by the witch. Nevertheless, the prophecy begins to be fulfilled, Father Christmas appears. He gives everyone gifts. He gives the three children instruments of war.How they fought? What did the lion do? What happened to the witch? What happened to the fourth child? Did all four children return home? These are questions that the rest of the book answers."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"This allegorical book, supposedly aimed at children, provided Mr. Lewis with a wonderful medium to deliver a Christian message to readers of all ages. He casts the perennial contest between good and evil as a secret adventure of four displaced children in a land frozen under the control of a wily wicked witchy ruler. While good prevails, it does not come without struggle and sacrifice. Along the way the Lion of Judah acquires a new name and important lessons of loyalty and courage are learned.I really like books that are inspiring, thought-provoking, and fun. It makes me wonder what is in the back of all my closets! This book makes a great gift for young people that they will treasure throughout life. Another Christian fantasy book I like, aimed at a somewhat older audience, isARROWS THROUGH TIME: A Time Travel Tale of Adventure, Courage, and Faith."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"For those of you who are unfamiliar with C. S. Lewis's works and stances on life and faith, I suggest you check out Mere Christianity, which is perhaps the best book ever written on the fundamentals of Christianity. Narnia is also one of the greatest Fantasy series to tackle faith, as it is filled with Biblical symbolisms. Lewis noted that kids often picked up on the symbolisms more than adults, so we gotta show those youngsters that we can still think creativelyStory overview:---------------Peter (13), Susan (12), Edmund (10) and Lucy (8), are evacuated from London to escape the effects of WW2. They go to the home of Professor Digory Kirke, who owns a huge country house and lives with his housekeeper, Mrs MacReady.Lucy discovers that a mysterious wardrobe is actually a portal to another world called Narnia. She meets a talking faun named Tumnus and learns of the White Witch, who made it always winter but never Christmas. No one believes Lucy on her return, but one day Edmund and her end up in Narnia after hiding in the wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek. Edmund is deceived by the White Witch and betrays his siblings once they all find their way to the world of Narnia.Meeting up with the Beaver family, the children learn about the fate of Tumnus and the goings on in Narnia. They find out about a prophecy and Aslan (The Great Lion), who is said to be on the move. They eventually meet up with him, and when Edmund is rescued, the White Witch demands his return. According to the ancient law (the \\"Deep magic\\") she has the right to do so, but instead of handing over Edmund, Aslan takes his place to die for the boy's guilt. This isn't the end of the Great Lion, as a final battle takes place and the prophecy is fulfilled.My thoughts:-------------When I was little, my mother read me this story and I absolutely loved it. Unlike some of the other books my mother had read, I still like this one as much today as I did back then. Ironically, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is one of the books in this series I liked the least, but it still marks the beginning of a wonderful magical world, and a journey that every kid should experience.

There are many reasons why you should buy the book itself. The plot is rich and full of details (however if you read The Magician's Nephew first, much of the plot will be spoiled). The illustrations are absolutely wonderful. Also (though this is a reason why you should buy the 1950 one), having it in hardcover and textured really holds the book together, so you can expect to get many years out of it, if it has already lasted 59. This is the order in which you should read the books: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and his Boy, The Magician's Newphew, and the Last Battle. By the way, if you're someone who absolutely loves the original order of the books, or even someone who prefers the chronological order, you'll notice there's just no way to change The Last Battle, with the \\"last\\" part of it in the title."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"I think kids would enjoy reading \\"Narnia The lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" because there's plenty of adventure and action.

For example, when the author described the kids being scared of the beavers. The beavers seamed real.My favorite part of the book is when Edmund went into the witch's castle. I liked this scene because it was very spooky. It was spooky because there was a lion that appeared to be real but was really made of stone.

The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of them. It has been almost twenty years since I first read this book, and I still get goose bumps. It's not one of the deepest or most poetic pieces of literature, but it is truly one of the most magical. \\"Magical\\" is really the word to describe this enchanting novel. It's very, very simplistic as it works its powers on the child imagination. A wardrobe that is a door into a magic realm that needs to be saved from eternal winter. Even after many readings and many years, I still feel the beauty and the darkness of the book. I still get a little freaked out by the paranoia of the trees listening in. And I still feel the incredible power and joy of the melting snows. C.S. Lewis' masterpiece is deceptively simple. He takes the ordinary and turns it into pure magic. He plays with the child's imagination. He creates darkness in simplicity. The simplicity is enchanting rather than dull. The characters are fantastic and utterly charmingly enchanting, from the brat and betrayer Edmund (my favorite) to the kind goodness of Lucy to the sympathetic and conflicted Mr. Tumnus the faun to the frightening and awe-inspiring Aslan and the White Witch. The simple and allegorical story of saving Narnia through sacrifice and redemption isn't really the point. The point is the magic of it all. One of my all time favorite books.

The four children then started playing games inside the house and stumbled across a massive wardrobe. Inside was a magical place called Narnia.C.S. Lewis put this fantasy together spectacularly. In Narnia there is evil, such as the White Witch, who creates many conflicts throughout the book. There is also something to stop the evil, and that would be Aslan the Lion and the four orphans Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan. A conflict that really frightened me is when Aslan the Lion was close to death. He was captured by the White Witch, and was murdered on a stone alter. I was surprised what happened to Aslan the Lion after he was murdered.C.S. Lewis did an awesome job writing this novel. In my opinion this is the best fantasy I have ever read.

Lewis, teaches biblical messages through a dramatic and intriguing plot. It all begins in WWII when a mother sends her four children off to the country to live with a professor for safety. The children were very curious and often spent hours playing hide and go seek, which lead to them discovering many new rooms and parts of the mansion. One day the youngest girl, Lucy, hid in a coat wardrobe. She walked to the very back of the closet where she revealed a new land. It was snowing and right away she discovered an odd creature. Lucy eventually went back through the wardrobe and tried to explain her discoveries to her brothers and sisters but none of them believed her. Finally Lucy was given the opportunity to prove her tale and her siblings peter, Edmund and Susan followed. Once they all entered the land they were told by a creature named Tumnus that the queen would want to kill them if she ever found them. This is because they were human and threatened her power. The rest of the novel is a biblical parallel to basics tenants of Christianity. The good and evil were always at war and at one point the Lion was slain. He rose from the dead and was able to overthrow evil. This is directly related to what the bible teaches. I believe this a great story. At a young age it has a fascinating plot with magical creatures and a powerful ending. At a more mature age is has vast symbolism that still allows for an easy read, without lacking in complexity. I think the characters in the new land are remotely bizarre but I enjoyed that if left me wondering about their personality because it lacks the usual stereotypes that are often placed on everyday characters. I couldn't tell whether the character was sympathetic or an antagonistic until I kept reading. Overall I highly suggest reading this book. When the final page is read it will leave you thinking.

Several years ago I read Lewis' classic, Mere Christianity, and I have had a growing interest in reading his fictional piece, The Screwtape Letters. I decided to read roughly a chapter a night to my girls who have seen both the BBC and Disney versions of the movie. It was a little difficult for Grace, my four year old, to always follow the story, but Rose, my seven year old, enjoyed hearing about the secret land beyond the wardrobe.

Leading the people who were once frozen into battle, they gained the upper hand and defeated the Witch.My favorite part of the story is when the four children are crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. The reason I like that part is that the Witch is dead and there isn't a care in the world and the children are happy. People should read this book because it is an action packed adventure and a great read.One person I think changed during the story is Edmund. The reason why I think Edmund changed is that at the beginning of the story he is spiteful. One example of his spitefulness is when he saw Narnia and said, \\"I was just playing with Lucy nothing really happened.\\" But at the end of the story he is kind and good. An example of his goodness is when he breaks the Witch's wand."},{"Title":"Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe","review":"The four Pevensie orphans Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are evacuated to the enormous country house of Professor Kirke. When Lucy, during a game of hide and seek, finds a big wardrobe in an empty room, she decides to use it as her hiding place. To her big surprise she notices behind the fur coats at the back of the closet a spot of white snow. The world behind the wardrobe turns out to be the wonderfully strange world of Narnia. At first her friends do not believe what she has discovered, but it won't take long before the others are face to face with the faun, Mr. Tumnus, the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a real treat for anyone who likes simple, but not less exciting fantasy. The power behind this book is that it brings the story without too much need to moralize. There is certainly some moral lesson behind what is happening, certainly when considering the actions of Edmund, but it never reaches the level of the Victorian Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. Of course this book dates from the 50's and is written in an era that differs much from Victorian times, still it strongly reverbs the explorative nature of those times. The colorful characters are brought to life in a dreamlike setting that is bursting of opportunities for the six sequels that will follow this book. The humor is omnipresent, but certainly is at its best when the narrator intervenes with his commentary. Again a wink to Victorian novels. If you want to be engulfed in a wonderful and not too complex world, then The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a good start."},{"Title":"Your turn to curtsy, my turn to bow","review":"When I was 18 to 21, I thought William Goldman was the equivalent of Kerouac and Salinger. Novels like Temple of Gold and Soldier in the Rain spoke to me, as if they were my life. But, my favorite Goldman novel was Your Turn to Curtsy, My Turn to Bow. The title alone was a gem. The final scene was so vividly written, it became a movie scene in my mind. Imagine crucifying yourself and not being able to hammer in the last nail, so your arm is flapping in the breeze...you try to hold it up, but it must inevitably fall. Hollywood in 1965 would not have the guts to film this!Goldman turned to writing screenplays, and many of our favorite movies he was the author. We became older, wiser(?), wealthier, more comfortable. However, I miss the angst of those early novels.Thanks to Amazon, I still find these books, which long ago I misplaced. My library is growing."},{"Title":"Your turn to curtsy, my turn to bow","review":"I don't really think this book deserves a 4 but I don't think it deserves a 5. Definitely a 4.5. I really like William Goldman and in keeping with his style of writing this book is definitely... well it has a certain je ne sais quoi to it to be certain.The shipping was fast and it arrived in good condition. Comment if you want more but I'm not a book critic."},{"Title":"The Voyage and the Messenger: Iran and Philosophy","review":"Even Henry Corbin's greatest admirers have to admit that he is not an easy read. There are two reasons for this, as I see it. One of them is his adherence to that peculiar French literary convention in non-fiction of assuming that the reader understands more than he or she actually does (the French have a name for this style, although at the moment I can't recall what it is).The other, more important reason is that it requires a considerable amount of unusual intellectual baggage to reach the point where you can begin to understand what Corbin is trying to say. In order to even consider embarking on Corbin's spiritual journey, it is extremely helpful to be familiar with Medieval Scholasticism, Islamic philosophy, Sufism, Shiite theology and Zoroastrianism. It also doesn't hurt to have a nodding acquaintance with Luther, the seventeenth century German mystics and Swedenborg. I don't know anybody who feels completely at home with all those topics; I know that I don't.Which is what makes this book so important for an understanding of Corbin. In fact, Corbin didn't put this book together; it is a compilation of various pieces of his writing. The book starts out with a lengthy intellectual biography of Corbin by Christopher Bamford, which helps considerably to set the stage. This is followed by two essays by Corbin on the development of Iranian studies and the history of Iranian philosophy. Both of these are rather long, and to me at least while I was reading them, they were rather boring. However, in retrospect I must admit that these essays probably do more to introduce Corbin's mindset than anything else that could have been selected. Following this are various, mostly short essays dealing with features of Iranian philosophy and mysticism. The whole scheme of the book it to lead the reader into an appreciation of Corbin's endeavors and an understanding of what he was trying to achieve.I first encountered Corbin about four years ago, when I attempted to read \\"Man of Light.\\" I gave up after about twelve pages; the material presented was too abstruse for me. After reading this book I realize that Corbin is pure gold, and I'm ready to tackle his work in earnest."},{"Title":"The Voyage and the Messenger: Iran and Philosophy","review":"Corbin is one of the foremost interpreters of Iranian, Sufi and Persian gnosticism in the west. This volume is a terrific introduction to his other works as it is a collection of short essays in which he discusses how he grew from being a student of Heidegger to a scholar of Persian mysticism. I would highly encourage those interested in the imaginal realm to begin their quest here and then take on his other works, especially &quot;Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth&quot; afterward. More people should know of Corbin's work, but unfortunately its audience is largely limited to students of Islam and Sufism. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Voyage and the Messenger: Iran and Philosophy","review":"This brings into English the insights of one of the great scholars of religious studies. If you are interested in mysticism in general or Sufi in particular then you will find this book an important adjunct to your studies."},{"Title":"The Voyage and the Messenger: Iran and Philosophy","review":"The last place I would have looked for a profound spiritualism would have been Iran, but this book proved me wrong. It is amazing and disturbing how much influence cheap media has on our views. After reading this book, I am not surprised that, of all places, Iran should be the country to exhibit such a sharp contrast with modern flashy and shallow philosophies. Obviously these guys know their stuff and can distinguish between real thing and fake ones, something that we in the west need to learn since our spiritualism usually ends up in some sort of sex or money scandal."},{"Title":"The Voyage and the Messenger: Iran and Philosophy","review":"I usually don't think much of religious scholars and their books, but have found Mr. Corban and his writings very different and profound. No doubt Corban is an icon for religious scholarship."},{"Title":"Disney's the Hunchback of Notre Dame: Upside Down and Topsy-Turvy","review":"I am a parent and read this book, I thought it was ok, but thats where it ends. As a parent I buy books that will teach and challenge my children. This book was a Christmas gift. Reading this book I don't see that you could learn anything. Its not going to win any reading awards because there is just not much in the book. I think there is a reason it is selling for under a dollar. Its just not a bad book, but not a good one either."},{"Title":"The world guide to beer: The brewing styles, the brands, the countries","review":"Not a complete reference by any means but a great book. Shares allot of content with another book on amazon because it is an older version so i ended up giving the older copy to friend.I actually bought this to study for the cicerone exam and am disappointed to mention that I did not pass needed to know more about kegging tapping and maintenance of tap and keg systems.nailed the styles though and that's what this covers."},{"Title":"The world guide to beer: The brewing styles, the brands, the countries","review":"More than you ever thought there was to know about brewers around the world. You get history, geography, ethnology, language, cultchah all mingled in with zymergy!Not a book to sit down and read at length--I read a coupla pages a day--truly enjoyable.The older edition was written during the baby steps of the craft beer revolution in the USA."},{"Title":"Blue Guide Umbria (Blue Guides)","review":"The Blue Guide is the most exhaustive guide on art in Umbria I came across. Usually this fairly small - and touristically not yet overexploited - region is treated together with Tuscany and/or Le Marches. So if you really want to focus your trip only on Umbria and art is your main concern, this is the guide to take along.It must be said that visually the guide has not much to offer : the lay-out is conservative and illustrations are kept to a minimum (no pictures, shaky pen drawings only).The city maps are very helpful.The depth of information offered is however staggering - and to a certain extent misleading : even the most insignificant borough gets jubilant descriptions of frescoes, oil paintings, sculptures and other works of art that are on display. Often however the actual quality of the art collections shown a.o. in the local pinacothecas of the smaller hill villages is rather disappointing and not really worth the trip unless you are fanatically obsessed with medieval and early renaissance art and want to see every scrap that is available.What is really lacking in these guides is a rating system that makes Michelin Guides so useful for planning excursions, because it would allow you to weigh more or less objectively the different options that are open to you. The Michelin Guide for Italy is however totally insufficient if you want to focus your visit exclusively on Umbria and want to see more than Assisi, Orvieto and Perugia."},{"Title":"Blue Guide Umbria (Blue Guides)","review":"I just returned from a trip to Italy which included 4 days in Umbria and 8 days in Tuscany. I found the Blue Guides for both regions outstanding. Not surprisingly, both are quite worn (the best sign of a useful guidebook).What makes this guidebook stand out is the incredible breadth of coverage of all tourist sites in Umbria. It is hard to believe that so much information is packed into such a small book. Each chapter represents a tour which covers either a town and its vicinity or a driving circuit. Within each tour, every conceivable tourist destination is identified, including small towns, churches, squares, public buildings, museums, archeological sites, etc. For significant museums and churches, the guide directs you through the works in a logical order. For the most part, individual works/objects are listed but not discussed, but notable works are identified with asterisks. Particularly remarkable works, such as Cathedrals and great fresco cycles, are discussed in more detail.If you are interested in Italian art, architecture, and ancient history, then this book tells you where to find it in Umbria, and provides brief descriptions. The guidebook does not teach you the history of art and architecture in Umbria, nor should it. For this, you will need to do some additional reading.Fine maps and a brief history are provided for each significant town. Parking advise is provided for most towns, and I strongly suggest you follow this advise. (I learned this the hard way.) Also pay close attention to the opening hours, which are quite accurate. The guide's hotel and restaurant recommendations seem quite good; they overlap significantly with the Michelin Red Guide and Frommers. Unfortunately, no descriptions or prices are provided, so most people will want another guidebook for this use. Some of the site closure information was out of date, but I expect this to be updated with the 2000 edition."},{"Title":"Blue Guide Umbria (Blue Guides)","review":"The Blue Guide series focuses on art. If you are looking for hotels, shopping, restaurants, or for entertaining reading, rely on something else. If you're looking for history and art, both the well-known and the quietly tucked away, a list of hours and days open for musuems, holidays (often to be avoided!), as well as addresses of libraries and research institutions, the Blue Guides are for you. They cover almost every artwork in the various regions, and do so accurately. The books guide the reader systematically through churches and museums and include accurate floor plans. Towns are grouped into touring areas, as are neighborhoods in the large cities. Town maps, even for little places, are precise and plentiful. City maps are equally precise and inclusive, even for Venice and Siena,but they are split among several pages, which can make them a harder to follow --- a minor flaw. I use Blue Guides as a textbook for my college students, and I never go to Italy without at least one!"},{"Title":"Programming ADO.NET (Gearhead Press)","review":"I'm a veteran developer who uses COM/ADO for most of his development. With 3 solid years of ADO experience (coming out of DAO beforehand and dBase before that) I couldn't suggest a better book. This is my 3rd ADO.NET book this year and I can assure you that if you buy ANY book on ADO.NET then this will be it, this will be the icing to any other book you own or the first and only book you will ever need.If you have a total lack of programming experience you should probably stick with a language + data combo book, then come back here later one when you have a better understanding of your language as this book will top off what you learn. I am positive there are better books for beginners out there, people who need more hand-holding and less code or people who may not be able to derive concepts without an explanation.If you are an intermediate, professional or veteran developer who knows a decent amount of ADO then this book, and specifically chapters 10 and 11, are what you really want. You want a book that will answer all the questions you would have about ADO.NET as if you sat down for the first time to write a Rolodex sample without the slightest clue about ADO.NET, but knowing exactly what you'd want to do if you were to veresed with 'traditional' ADO.The bulk of this book is a re-organized, regurgitated ADO.NET reference, with the first glance this bothered me but I've come to find it indispensable over the last few hours and it makes an excellent companion to the Framework documentation. Since there were no other reviews to this book I almost didn't make the purchase and as a matter of fact I bought yet another ADO.NET book from at the same time. I probably won't even read that book except as a boredom killer now (it arrives Monday, tomorrow).Hopefully this review saves someone else from passing this book by, If you're a pro and you're looking for the perfect book, this will be it. Trust me."},{"Title":"Programming ADO.NET (Gearhead Press)","review":"After purchasing many books on .NET, and several on ADO.NET, I had reached the conclusion that there weren't any books that covered ADO.NET well. The code samples from Microsoft and most of the examples/sample code in the books all demonstrated rotten techniques for accessing data (Mostly with SELECT * FROM), were overly complex or were so vague to be useless. I had finally despaired of ever finding a good book on the topic and was openly whining about it in a class I recently attended. The guy sitting next to me smugly replied that I hadn't bought the right book yet. He then had the audacity to recommend his own book! The \\"guy\\" was Steven Borg, who happened to be attending the class with me. It was such an audacious statement that I figured I would take him up on it...I figured if it was bad I could at least get a free beer out of it. No such luck. It was the book I had been searching for. I read all but the reference chapters the next day and spent a great deal of time reading the reference chapters in the following days. Steve and Rich hit the bull's-eye. This is the most comprehensive book on ADO.NET I have ever seen. Be cautioned however, this book is not for beginner programmers or those looking for a step by step introduction to building database applications. It is mostly a REFERENCE manual (over 700 pages). It does include three excellent tutorial chapters and three introductory chapters. It is NOT regurgitated MSDN! Wow! The book is easy to read and even funny in places (I loved the red pill/blue pill analogy) and the sample code is actually useful. It still contains a few too many SELECT * statements, but other than that it rocks. A previous review criticizes the lack of sample code and I almost agreed until I spent more time in the reference chapters. The sample code is there at the start of each object description. If you are looking for a thorough reference book on ADO.NET written in plain English without the techno-babble and withou all the technical class module errata jargon, this is the book."},{"Title":"Programming ADO.NET (Gearhead Press)","review":"I am a veteran MDAC ADO developer. Eventually I will be a veteran ADO.NET developer. When I reach that stage, this book will be an excellent reference. However, there is very little in this book which explains how to actually program against the new ADO.NET object model. In this context, the title of the book 'Programming ADO.NET' is somewhat misleading. 'ADO - The Definitive Reference' would be a better title for this book.If you are looking for a tutorial with sample code in order to get started, this is not the book you are looking for."},{"Title":"Dake's Annotated Reference Bible","review":"THE CD ROM DAKE IS ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT.

This is unscriptural and untrue. Numerous times in scripture it refers to Adam as being the first human ever.

Word of Faith teachers have twisted Scripure to the hilt. One example would be that Christ was reincarnated into a defiled demoniac which is blasphemy.

I'd never been to the Monongahela, or &quot;Mon,&quot; as it is known, but when I saw this new hiking book I thought I would give it a try. The first hike, to Rohrbaugh Overlook, in the Dolly Sods, stunned me. Have you ever just known you were in the right place at the right time? That's how I felt, while looking over the Red Creek Valley surrounded by rock outcrops jutting from green forests. After a little national forest camping, I headed down to the Cranberry Wilderness, enjoying Molloy's Middle Fork overnight backpacking loop. The Middle Fork Cranberry River flowed clear beneath stately yellow birch trees and when I got up to the highcountry, the scent of spruce trees provided an aromatic backdrop for a night beneath the stars. Unfortunately the work bell rang and I had to return to Pittsburgh, but with 31 other day hikes and nine overnight backpacking loops in this book I shall return to the &quot;Mon&quot; many more times. This is a very useful and interesting book... perfect for anyone considering hiking in this area!"},{"Title":"Day and Overnight Hikes in West Virginia's Monongahela National Forest","review":"West Virginia's Monongahela National Forest is the mid-Atlantic's best kept secret. Sure, there are a few popular destinations, like the Dolly Sods, but there are so many other places to go in the &quot;Mon&quot;. But with over a million acres of land, it's hard to figure out exactly where to go. That's where Mr. Molloy's new book comes in. It has there and back day hikes and overnight loops. It rates each hike and then gives a running narrative of the trail you are on. What is really nice, in my opinion are the concise directions to each trailhead, saving time and getting me to where I really want to be, and that is on the trail."},{"Title":"The Courtyard Duck","review":"While reading The Courtyard Duck, I imagined what the children in the school yard were feeling.

Something happens that threatens to separate the babies from their mother, and everyone from the custodian to a trusted teacher to the children try to find ways to keep the ducks safe. It raises a question: what can you do when wildlife is faced with danger? Sometimes you can call for help and sometimes it must be left to work itself out. THE COURTYARD DUCK is a teachable story, with some humorous moments. It is a meaningful story with some serious moments. As an educational tool, there are questions and activities at the end of the book for kids to think on and practice.
