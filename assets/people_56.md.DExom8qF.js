Having read all 700 some pages of it while doped up on vicodin and recovering from the removal of my wisdom teeth, I was able to digest it in one big, painful gulp.I loved how Rand subtly & not-so subtly wove her philosophy into the structure of the characters and the story. I also loved how, aside from Roark, I couldn't immediately tell who the good guys and bad guys were going to be. Through twists and turns of the story, I kept rooting for Roark because his character was so strong while he remained soft-spoken. I knew that no matter what happened, Roark would be victorious. But during the trial at the end, Rand used poor little Roark as a podium to directly spews pages and pages of her bullsh*t ideas in a very direct, patronizing way which to me seemed quite contrary(not in philosophy but in personality) to Roark's character as it had been portrayed in the book up to that point.

I read the mass market paperback version in high school and I still have it. I decided to re-read it (something I rarely do) and wanted a nice copy to keep, so I bought the hard cover \\"Centennial Edition.\\" It's basically a mass market paperback with a stiff binding, cheap paper and tiny print. It's much smaller than a typical hard cover, no dust jacket, and overall very cheaply made.I've read several Ayn Rand books and The Fountainhead is one of my favorites of all time, but the purpose of these reviews is to rate the product that you get from Amazon. This product is poor. I definitely recommend the book, but get a different version."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I readAtlas Shruggeda few years ago and loved it. The Fountainhead is also a great book. Ayn Rand spends less time focused on her philosophy of Objectivism in this book than she does in Atlas Shrugged, but she does touch on its main points. Rand has a very engaging style and her books are filled with fantastic characters. Sometimes they come off as archetypes, kind of two-dimensional, and this is true for the Fountainhead. Howard Roark, Dominique Francon, Peter Keating, and Ellesworth Toohey are all exciting characters, however, and I loved reading about their struggles living in the first half of the 20th century in New York. It's easy to love some of them and hate others -- she's that good at creating tension and developing an amazing and well-paced plot. I'd recommend The Fountainhead as a good introduction (just 700 pages) for anyone who hasn't read Ayn Rand, before plowing through Atlas Shrugged (over 1000 pages), which is more involved and has a greater emphasis on Objectivism."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This novel is amazingly written. I can't wait to get some free time so I can continue reading it. The author said in the introduction &#34; My basic test for any story is: Would I want to meet these characters and observe these evens in real life? Is this story an experience worth living through for its own sake? Is the pleasure of contemplating these characters an end in itself &#34; Well, I thought when I read this paragraph, that I will use the very same test to evaluate this story &#34;The fountainhead&#34; and I answered all the questions the author asked above with a big YES. I recommnd everyone to read it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I'm not convinced this is as good as Atlas Shrugged, but it is very insightful into her free market beliefs and the rights of man. It took almost the entire first part to &#34;get&#34; her thinking, but it quickly became clear in the Part II and throughout the rest of the book. She is, obviously, a purest in the sense of man's sovereignty and rights, but the struggle of piecing it all together early on was a lot of work. This is a good read - perhaps prior to reading AS - as it give you a good picture of her mindset. I feel this is just a bit more superficial drama than AS, but still a great read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I definitely prefer Atlas Shrugged to Fountainhead, but this is a quicker read and may be appreciated by those apprehensive about the length of Atlas Shrugged.

She seems to have developed the Protagonist and the antagonist very well, though it seems she did this by accident if only to fill her philosophical ideals. It's apparent because the supporting characters seem shallow and their interactions in no way resemble true human relationships.Rand seems like she tries to make up for this with excruciating and painfully dull, redundant, and useless detail such as the one sentence that almost made me burn the damn thing. \\"They went on, to move, to feel the movement, to know the feeling of their own muscles moving\\"If rand wanted to create a nice piece of literature and not just a semi creative philosophy book, she could have cut out the redundant details and focused more on tying in all the complex details and philosophy of the book itself with a viable and decent story line. If you cut out all the useless B.S the book itself would be about 1/3 shorter and easier to read.This book is a good example of why many famous philosophers such as Aristotle and Cicero stuck to the non-fiction genre. Philosophy alone doesn't make a good story."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Anyone rememembers Mills & Boon, the cheap, formulaic romances some of us used to read obsessively in our mid-teens, where all the men had broad shoulders and narrow waists and the women were wildly beautiful, and all their interactions were intense and melodramatic with meaningful glances and unspoken truths? And as silly little girls we fantasised about being part of the world?Well, thank goodness I've grown up! And having done so (by more than just a few years!) I thought it was time to read something of Ayn Rand's. THE Ayn Rand. I did not know what to expect, I'd heard snippets here and there about her controversial philosophy and her two famous novels but never much more. So with great anticipation I picked up The Fountainhead and thought that the chunky 700+ pager would be just the ticket for this summer.What I did not expect was melodrama and caricature people barely a notch above Mills & Boon! At 150 pages I thought, Surely it must get better. But it hasn't. Oh, the meaningful glances in which the unrealistic characters instantly read oh so much, the depth of emotions and staggering self-awareness possessed by characters who paradoxically know no shades of grey, how everything happens just at the righ time - the encounters, the new commissions... Good grief!But I plugged away. I'm loath to leave a book unfinished plus my desire to be able to have an informed opinion dictated that I actually finish the book. So I started skimming, hoping to get to the better parts faster. Another 100+ pages later (more than a third into the book) it's time to face the truth: this is not working for me. Instead of enjoyable summer reading, I'm spending my time in frustration - just to be able to say that I've read Ayn Rand?The other thing about growing older is the realisation that there's too many (good) books and too little time. I'm throwing in the towel with this one and going in search of something more rewarding.(I wonder if I'd do better with the movie....)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The book that change my life.

So many readers here have told you what it *is* about, so let me tell you what it is *not.*The Fountainhead is not a feel-good book meant to make you feel all warm &amp; fuzzy inside. (Buy Harry Potter if that is your mentality.)It is not about the status quo and going along with popular politics/opinion in order to get ahead.It is not your typical novel that was dumbed down so American readers can &quot;get it.&quot; In fact, if you don't get what the book is all about, then perhaps that is a good thing.Quite simply, if you are looking for a book to take along to the beach then skip The Fountainhead. If -on the other hand- you are looking to stretch your brain and deviate from the usual, mass produced, mass sexualized, mass dumbed-downess of an ever encroaching Disney-inspired, American mentality, then do yourself a favor and read Ayn Rand. *Any* Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is beautiful.Thank you Ayn"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The characters are unreal, the story is unreal, the philosophy,though we all appreciate Ayn's rallying around the individual,is also unreal.

And HOW trite and HOW platitudinous _The Fountainhead_ is! Aesthetically, the characters are more wooden than the Black Forest, and as believable as a Grimm Brothers fairytale; the conversation stilted; the plotting clumsy and predictable. As for the &quot;ideas,&quot; these are nothing more than a confused melange of refried Nietzsche, Social-Darwinism, and a near-sociopathic egotism and greed. And perhaps no more damning critique of contemporary America exists, than when one considers that this steaming pile of utter rubbish and its offshoots (Objectivism, libertarianism, the rest of the Rand oeuvre) has become so influential in the lives and thinking of so many Americans.P.S.: I would have given this book a &quot;1&quot; except for two things: 1) _Atlas Shrugged_ is even worse; 2) Ayn Rand HAS done something I thought no writer, no matter how inept, would ever do -- she wrote BORING sex scenes."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's Howard Roark is a hero, a rugged individualist, who refuses to pander to popular opinion at the expense of his personal vision. An architect who is about staying true to himself rather than win the masses, Ayn Rand created a character who inspired many a reader to her philosophy of objectivism. Though the story seems choppy, its message is more powerful than ever.

If you are unfamiliar with Rand or her philosophy, objectivism, then buy this book immediatly! Even if you do not agree with her, it is a truly engrossing and heart felt story.The novel is mainly about the life of two different men, both architects coming from the same school. One is intent on realizing his dreams without compromising his designs, while the other is only concerned with climbing the social ladder at any cost, including his friends, family, and dignity. In the beginning, the difference between the two characters are not as shockingly different, until they move through life. Before you eyes you see two people, anyone could relate with, move down different paths.All in all, although the book follows Rand's views about a free market society and rugged individualism, any reader will appriciate the story and learn that even during extreme hardships, the one thing no one can every steal from you is you integrity as person, unless you give it too them."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The Fountainhead is no simple book; it discusses society in some of the deepest and most unique ways I have ever read. What starts out as an eloquent yet simple tale about Howard Roark the striving architect becomes a struggle to maintain man's individualism. The true hero of this novel is egotism, while selflessness, as surprising as it might seem, is the evil. This is easily one of the greatest, most profound, books I have ever read. By the end of this book you will be thinking really deeply about your personal ideals and societies.

There is good drama along the way. I don't know if you will love any of the characters, maybe Howard Roark, but you will definitey loath and maybe pity some of the others. Also, don't be afraid of the 700 plus pages. You will be done before you know it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is about a very young friend who means the whole world to me, but whom I shall not name.There was a time - not very long ago - when he had lost all hope. He felt an immense guilt for what he was. He reached a point of depression where he was convinced that not only was he incapable of realizing his dreams and attaining happiness in life, but a greater monstrosity-that he did not deserve to be happy. Every night he went to bed with a blade in his hand thinking that he wouldn't see the next day's sunrise. Once he walked down to the chemist for sleeping pills. He punished himself in many other ways. I needn't mention the cause- he wasn't always like that- this state of mind had its own reasons -arising from his view of life, of mankind, of man, of himself.Then he picked up and read \\"The Fountainhead\\".Since then his motto has been-\\"I can, I will, I shall triumph.\\"He has never looked back; he told me that he was sure that that phase will never return-because the image of Howard Roark is always in his mind.Later I learnt that this had happened to more people than just him.Then I realized that this novel has a power which hardly any other has - a power to make a man fall in love with this world, with life, with himself.(Another novel which achieves, in terms of the broadest abstractions, the same effect is Henryk Sienkiewicz's \\"Quo Vadis?\\")\\"The Fountainhead\\" gives man the courage to dream and to fight to realize his dream, the courage to live your life on your own terms, the courage to say \\"Yes\\" when everything around you is screaming \\"No\\".It tells you that this world is a place where every man, provided he has a vision and is passionate about it, will achieve his values- however hard the struggle- the pain of the struggle does not matter, only the joy of its fruit; where good shall triumph over evil.It glorifies-above all- independence and integrity.It salutes the man of intelligence, of competence, of genius.It is a hymn to the treasure house that is this world, the beautiful experience that is life and the hero that is man.Ayn Rand has said, in this novel: \\"Whatever their future, at the dawn of their lives, men seek a NOBLE vision of MAN'S NATURE and of LIFE'S POTENTIAL.\\"(The caps are by me).This is precisely what \\"The Fountainhead\\" accomplishes-in the character and story of Howard Roark.This is greatest gift that a thinker and a visionary can give to the youth who shall shape the world tomorrow-and to a human being at the threshold of life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Many pseudo-intellectuals think they are geniuses for being able to read a book of this length. I am no intellectual by far but have read many books on philosophy. I believe this book to be one of the most important pieces for people of any age. This book puts life in perspective. It shows, quite cleverly, that there are rewards beyond materialistic ones. It also shows that greatness is not necessarily what others believe it to be but what the creator gets out of it. I first read Atlas Shrugged at the suggestion of my brother. I read it in about 3 days, seldom putting it down. I went on to read every novel written by Rand. I think that she is a very important author of our time and whether you believe in her philosophies or not you must read it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It's just a book. Really. . . despite what some might tell you. But it is a great book. Critics complain that Howard Roark, and the inevitability with which he rises to pre-eminence, are superbly unfit for the real world. This is true. Howard Roark, however, is not a person and perhaps not even a hero, but an abstract ideal. He is a model of matchless integrity and personal excellence (to a fault), and as I see it the book's premise is that these qualities -- that what is right -- will be recognized and accorded their due in the end. Thus, the good are the pure, those without compromise. Personally, I don't believe Rand even meant the book to suggest that this should, or does apply on planet Earth. Certainly, the theory is ludicrous and circular when applied in reverse to suggest that whatever becomes pre-eminent must have become so because it is inherently excellent and therefore should be allowed to remain so if it can (a theory with which some oppose the anti-trust case against Microsoft). In fact, I think history provides more examples in which those who are pre-eminent have used their power to squelch those who are excellent and right, often successfully. At any rate, I recommend The Fountainhead to anyone and everyone; read it, but take from it what you will."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is about individualism and integrity. By individualism Ayn meant &quot;A Primary orientation to reality&quot;, and by integrity Ayn meant &quot;Loyalty to Rational Principles&quot;. This is what makes Howard Roark a hero. While many of the other characters in the novel derive their self-esteem and their beliefs from other people, Howard Roark is an individualist who fights for what he believes is true - not because &quot;The Majority&quot; say so, nor because of what God commands - but of his own reason and volition.This is a truely romantic and inspiring novel, and is almost a tribute to all those throughout the history of mankind whom have fought for science and reason."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Followers of Rand note here that reviews of this book are either great or terrible, and claim that is evidence of its character as a book of challenging ideas. These guys are rationalists? Look at the emotionalism of the comments: &quot;changed my life&quot; or &quot;I model my life&quot; after the characters or &quot;the greatest novel ever written.&quot; Many books (other than this one) have moved me, given me inspiration, or made me rethink my perspective: none has ever served as a blueprint for my life - the very claim reeks immaturity.In fact, the claims made for this book are the same ones made for religious texts: that is why the reviews hit one end of the other of the spectrum. You're a believer or you're not. And belief has little to do with rationalism or individualism.I have dipped into Rands nonfiction as well. Before you judge her philosophy, it is advisable to read some real philosophy, or perhaps Durrant's History of Western Philosophy. Why? Even Rand's supposed objective work is mainly occupied with trashing everyone who came before her as an &quot;irrationalist&quot; or &quot;collectivist.&quot; Before you dismiss Descartes, Kant, and Sartre, you had best gain some familiarity with their works.Of course, it takes TIME to read real philosophy and it is difficult to understand - which is something that can't be said for Rand. When her followers say her books are &quot;challenging&quot; they mean that they had difficulty living up to her ideals; not that they are difficult to understand. Intellectual challenge it's not."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I didn't know who Ayn Rand was, nor what she had written before I started reading &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. It was on a Friday night and I literally didn't stop reading until Sunday when I finished it, with two 3 hour breaks for sleeping.This book is amazing from all points of view - first of all, it's a great story and it's wonderfully told; second of all the characters are fantastically built, multidimensional and actually spontaneous and unpredictable; and last but not least, the philosophical background, that of individualism is not only an exceptional idea, but also perfectly argumented and illustrated.The Fountainhead reminded me of Cohen's &quot;Belle du Seigneur&quot; because of the both the way the 20's and 30's aristocracy is portrayed and the gloryfying of pure love, except Ayn Rand's masterpiece is far more interesting from both points of view. Also, in my point of view, this book is very much about Dominique, perhaps even more that about Roarke. One way or the other though, the way Ayn Rand succeeds in defining a character through the ones that surround him is extremely intersting.In conclusion, this is definitely not a book to miss, whether you believe in individualism or not. It will definitely make you see the world through different eyes."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is fiction, with Rand's ideals thrown in for good measure, but that doesn't mean that this is a bad read. Actually this is a very interesting book, the characters A.R. uses are basically, stereo types, built up into real people. The main characters are predictable when alone, yet they are very quirky and unpredictable, when then interact. It kept me interested till the controversial ending kind of ruined it for me. It would have been good if this were a perfect world, but we all know it is not. After 6 months I still can't her out of my head."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A disclaimer first: Howard Roark is not my ideal man and Dominique Francon is not my ideal woman. Roark is a ... and Dominique is self-destructive. If I met these two in real life, I wouldn't want to be too close.There is, however, greatness within the both of them. It's not that Roark has a vision he kills himself towards; he simply knows what is true within him and works that as his guiding principle. Dominique, for all of her masochistic self-thwarting, is almost uncomprehensibly tragic. She shares Roark's commitment to truth to one's self but is so shaken and disgusted by the lies and compromises of the real world that she takes it as her duty to punish everyone for it- most of all herself. In my opinion, the book is really about her, as she is the one who needs to come to the realization that she can live in the world according to her own principles even if they are at odds with everything else.Gail Wynand, Ellsworth Toohey and Peter Keating all cut memorable figures as the tragic, powerful man, the Machiavellian villain and the dupe. As anti-ideal as Howard and Dominique are, these three make are even less appealing alternatives.Ultimately, this book is a great tool to help one figure out who is a real person and who is a poser."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"From the first pages of the Fountainhead, I was captivated by the struggle between Keating and Roark, not onlyas they battled as professionals, but even more importantly as they waged a less public war for their souls. Ultimately, the important question that Rand posed to me was whether a person can ever justify a compromise of their intellectual or artistic integrity to achieve a purely utilitarian goal. Rand, through Roark, answers this question in the negative, but her characters' ultimate fates leaves the question unresolved. I was immediately impressed by how well Rand developed her characters and made me care about how their lives would progress, especially in the first half of the book when Keating and Roark are defining themselves and their artistic visions.The book bogged down a bit in its later stages, particularly when developing the relationship between Roark, Dominique Francon, and Keating. Because of its extraordinary length and the fact that it lost some steam towards the end, I cannot recommend it to everyone, but I can recommend it wholeheartedly to those people who may feel disenchanted with a society that often values the material and superficial over the enduring."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book because this I could win a $10,000 scholarship. After I was done reading it, it was much more than that. I no longer care if I get the scholarship or not, this book has put into words many of the feelings I have in my heart. Howard Roark's passion for architecture is incredibly romantic, and I only wish I could be so dedicated a person like him. This book was non-stop twists and turns. It kept your eyes peeled and your mind open. I got done with the book at about 4 in the morning and had to go for a walk. I surrendered to the beauty of the book and what it represented. I would say that anyone who believes in total freedom of the mind should read this novel."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"The followers of Rand are a rowdy bunch. In her books they find justification for behaving in an anti-social manner that is slowly destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is supposedly derived from &quot;reason&quot;. In the real world however there is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that &quot;altruism&quot;, i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method. And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples. At best her books are useful self help guides, but this is also true of for example the Bible or the writings of Jung."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this book in high school. That is the perfect time to read it and fully appreciate it, when you are young and impressionable and looking for something strong to cling to. The force of Ayn Rand's thinly veiled philosophy and one dimensional characters are attractive for their idealism. I thought at the time it was one of the best books I'd ever read.In college I went to a couple of lectures sponsored by some Ayn Rand influenced group and found their politics appalling. When it came to their lack of concern for people and their entirely un-nuanced capitalism and libertarian agenda I realized the implications of her ideas. Upon re-reading the book I was embarrased by how much I had formerly liked it. The characters were simply personifications of capitalism and socialism. The \\"love\\" was hero worship and the sex, rape. I found myself marveling at how black and white Ayn Rand's worldview is and how little it deals with the nuances of the real world. And how little I'd like to live in her world.Read it when you're young, enjoy it, then look at it again later and see how far you've come. If you are interested in what she has to say, dig deeper. Read Nietzche, read Sartre, read Heidegger. Her \\"philosophy\\" is a watered down version of some of the best existentialist minds and much worse for the simplification."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A strictly entertaining story or interesting philosophy is a notable achievement. The capacity to combine both as only Kierkegaard and a few others have done before is a mark of special genius. The first fiction read in years which I seemingly could not put down, I'm glad I held off reading &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; until my late-20s. The marrow of this book -- its uncompromising stand against workplace compromise -- is a theme unlikely to be fully appreciated by younger readers. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is pure hyperbole, through and through. Though its chief protagonist, Howard Roark, will have great appeal, hardly anyone could stand a friendship with so self-assured an &quot;ubermensch.&quot; Few outside of Rand's world warrant such callous disregard for the judgment, experiences, and rational talents of others. Yet it is precisely this hyperbole which drives home Rand's point so convincingly. The lesson to be distilled? If our lowest common denominator world is the &quot;thesis&quot; and Roark its &quot;antithesis,&quot; then the world is surely a better place at the &quot;synthesis&quot; -- that point of equilibrium where intelligent, principled independence is asserted and yet where accomodation doesn't necessarily connote capitulation. &quot;Fountainhead&quot; is a must-read."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This novel stands as a monument to human accomplishment. To each their own but in my opinion a better character has never been brought to life than the protagonist of the Fountainhead, one Howard Roark. Throughout the novel he attacks his goals with a doggedness that is found in only the most disciplined of persons. I could write a short story describing Roark and his personal qualities, however, In this review I would like to focus more heavily on the theme of the novel and Rand's unique philosophy. Suffice to say Howard Roark endures what would have broken ten lesser men and at the conclusion of the novel we find him literally standing on top of the world.As I am sure you know Rand's philosophy is Objectivism. I first fell in love with this unique philosophy around the age of 18 when I was finishing high school. I read the Fountainhead and believed that I had uncovered the solution to all of mankind's problems. Every page seemed to be a personal revelation that would better my life. I tend to be anti-social and individualistic by nature so needless to say I was instantly attracted to a main character who seems oblivious to the outside world and its influences.I am now nineteen and have spent a year in college. I have come to the conclusion that it SUCKS to be alone. It really sucks... Which is in essence what Objectivism preaches. Howard Roark seems to do it without effort in the book, but he is a fictional character and this is real life. I am trying to think of how to summarize the Fountainhead in a way that would make sense to a person who has not read it, however I am not that talented nor devoted to writing yet. Suffice to say if you followed its advice word for word one would be living in a very isolated world. I love being with people and often find the most happiness when I am with them. Think about a few of your most remembered moments in life and ask yourself if you were alone or with other people. That answer is easy for me.I guess what I am really trying to say is that this book lured me in with its idealistic promises but after voraciously reading and re-reading all of Rand's work and having some months to really think it over and apply it to my life, I would just as soon use it as kindling as anything else. With some 1000 reviews before me I doubt anyone will even read this, at least not for a while. I am ok with that because I am writing this review more for my purpose than any other, but there truly is some sense to what I have written.In closing, this book is wonderfully written, the main character Howard Roark is incredible, a shining example of human achievement, but keep my above mentioned thoughts in mind when and if you read this book. I believe that some aspects of Objectivism like judging people by the quality of their work are excellent concepts but as a whole, I would rather spend my time with imperfect people (LIKE ME, Nobodies perfect) than to live an isolated life striving for a perfect ideal.One final thought, if you REALLY still want to get a true grip of Rand's philosophy it is essential to read Atlas Shrugged. The Fountainhead is essentially just a broad outline of her philosophy while the voluminous Atlas Shrugged is the core document, ground zero if you will.Sam"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's \\"The Fountainhead,\\" is a very thought provoking book, and at times, even exciting. There's a lot of memorable philosophy here. With that being said, it really is a good book. For philosophy. As fiction, however, The Fountainhead is rather bland. If you're looking for a good story, head elsewhere. But if thought provocation is your thing, this book is a pretty good read, despite being overly long and overly descriptive.Ayn Rand's novel follows Howard Roark, an architect who goes against traditional and conventional standards. Who builds buildings for him and no one else. Ayn Rand's ideal man. But the story isn't just about him. The story is also about a man named Peter Keating, everything a man should not be. A man who builds not for his own satisfaction, but for the satisfaction of others. It is also about a man named Ellsworth Toohey, Roark's nemesis, who is everything a man shouldn't be, but knows it. It is also about Gail Wynand, a man who could've been. Finally, it is about Dominique Francon, the woman who tries to defeat Roark. All these characters are involved in Ayn Rand's novel. The philosophy is there. What and ideal man should be and what a man should not be. Told through the power of architecture. The theme is very simple: Man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.It really is a thought provoking book. One that presents a lot of ideas. With the exception of Dominique Francon, every major character has an entire story that helps to shape what Ayn Rand is trying to say about man and how he should be. From showing us why Ellsworth Toohey is evil, to why Peter Keating isn't strong.However, the writing style of the book is definitely one you'll have a hard time plowing through. Much of the writing is over descriptive. It's almost like reading a novel out the Romanticism era. Ayn Rand makes sure to describe every leaf on every tree. It slows down the pacing of the book to a crawl. And with 700 pages to plow through, a slow pace can be very daunting.The book is a very slow read and it's very dry. The book is also so bogged down in philosophy that her characters don't come off as human. All the dialog that comes from the characters doesn't sound like how any human would ever talk. In short, these characters are not humans, they are symbols and that really makes them far less interesting to read about. Their actions are also not human at all. It may be because of this that the book is such a thought provoking read, though. Despite how dry the dialog is, it's interesting because it helps the ideas of Ayn Rand's philosophy come out. Whether you agree or not, she has presented her take on this philosophy in a fairly interesting way.Is The Fountainhead a good book? Yes. Is it thought provoking and intelligent? Certainly. But is it also boring and hard to get through? The answer there is also yes. It's a great idea put on the table. Surely there will be plenty who absolutely love that. However, at the same time, it's a very hard book to plow through because of its over descriptive and dry prose and characters who aren't interesting because they're symbols. And the representation they all stand for is far too clear, especially because the publisher felt the need to stick in some of Rand's notes.In short, The Fountainhead is a very good book, that presents many philosophical ideas. The problem is that as a book of fiction, the story is bogged down by dry prose and stilted dialog."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A couple of years ago when I read Rand's \\"Fountainhead\\" (it was the work that inspired my then hero Hunter S. Thompson as a young man so I wanted to check it out), I saw that like many of the works of Jack London (who I was also quite enthralled with at the time), there was a spirit of individual greatness woven within it and a perception of small, conformed souls to squash this greatness that really rang true with me.But something always stuck with me, something God wouldn't let me forget---that these great figures of pure, individual freedom that Rand and London wrote about were NOT real! I could find no evidence of such men ever existing, even scholar of a wide range of history that I was. They were purely figments of the imaginations of their authors. Sure, I had personally known a couple who thought they were such kind of men, but then had always caught a glimpse behind their Wizard of Oz-like facades. I saw that they hurt and were ruled by the same realm of emotions and doubt that all the rest of us were. Even Hunter Thompson was a poster boy for this very thing. He convinced the world that he was the invincible, do-it-yourselfer, take-no-guff-from-these-swine, bully and pure individualist. He even appeared to be on the side against corruption and hypocrisy. But in the end, afflicted with disillusionment, doubt and despair, he put a bullet through his head and went to his master in hell. He IS the statue of the god-man that the reclusive, genius sculptor put in the temple Howard Roark erected in the Fountainhead. But it is a statue with a hole through the top of its head where the brains used to be, a fitting testament to the greatness of man...on his own, as master of the planet, king of the species, lord over all, god of himself. A fool among fools.Look around you. Even as we are being told daily that we are the latest and greatest to walk the earth, that our technology is proof of our greatness--- what is the sum of all this \\"genius\\"? We are living in a world more divided and oppressed than ever before. A world where common sense is virtually non-existant and even the most elemental of problems are baffling to the \\"learned\\" men and women chosen to address them. If the past ten years on planet earth has shown me one thing, it is that we are a species (not just an economy) in recession. It appears that the evolutionists were right about one thing--- we are a species that is changing--- but they got the direction wrong. Devolution is what it is.One really has to question the motives and intent of those that would push a book like \\"The Fountainhead\\" on the mediocre minds of the modern generation (such as what is happening in our \\"educational\\" institutions). What awful monstrosity of \\"civilization\\" will we breed when the blissfully (often willfully) ignorant, programmed and conformed become convinced that they too are little gods and goddesses in the vein of Howard Roark? When they believe (like they believe in their superheroes in the movies) that the outlandish fictions created by a fevered ego (to borrow a HST-ism) can be transferred into real life? What a dung heap we will be in then! O wait, you don't say? Why yessir, you are right, we ARE already there!To answer the title question: Because they are not of Christ but of the Great Deceiver. They are not true Christians but rather the wolves in sheep's clothing Christ foretold would come to mislead the flock. Beware your leaders, my well-intentioned-but-guillible friends! I guarrantee you that Glen Beck and Ron Paul both hold Ayn Rand in high esteem. Then again, so do ALL the freemason hierarchy which rule this world. It is a poorly-kept secret that this book, along with \\"Atlas Shrugged\\", are essential pieces in any of their libraries."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A mix of unbelievable soap opera and long-winded philosophical rants about the supremacy of the individual, this book's sole redeeming value is that the protagonist, Howard Roarke, is to some large degree modeled after Frank Lloyd Wright. When you look at it from a FLW perspective there is a bit of interest in the story. Beyond that, a bloated overrated mess."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Okay, first off, I think that Ayn Rand is probably the most overrated writer in history. While this may be her best novel, (Atlas is one of the most boring piece of trash ever, Anthem is just unmoving, and We the Living is the worst thing I've ever read) that isn't saying much. Howard Roarke is, like every other Rand character, a poorly characterized superman who is never wrong and has no flaws at all. This is Rand's biggest flaw in all of her work, her hero's have no flaws and her antagonists have no good qualities. She tries very hard to make a romance out of this work but fails miserably. None of her characters have the depth required to make a believable romance, it's like two cardboard cutouts meeting and falling in love for some reason. Perhaps the only good thing about this giantic failure that is somehow considered to be a classic by certain people, is that it stresses the importance of individuality (a quality many Objectivists lack as they cling to Rand's image like little leeches) but other than that there is nothing to this novel. It struggles very hard to be great, you can almost hear it's little flippers slapping the cement floor of greatness, but it never quite makes it to the pool. It's boring, overlong with stretches of scenes that have no importance, and there are basically three characters: her supermen, the lovestruck woman, and everyone else. It's not as important as people want you to believe, go against the grain and don't read it. Get some Kafka instead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It amazes me the amount of effort some reviewers have put into explaining the failings of this book. Simply, it is a book that combines the orientation to the world of a neglected three year old and the writing skills of the average sexist high school student. Bravo."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I enjoyed this audio presentation a great deal more than the book. Much of the book had little bearing on the story, only on the philosaphy it represents. This audio left those secions out, keeping the story moving."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I can summarize all of Ayn Rand's books for you. Are you ready? Here it is:\\"I am smarter than everybody else. People who read my books are smarter than everybody else, too. Therefore, since you are reading this book, you are smarter than everybody else.\\"That's it. That's all Ayn Rand ever says. She says it over and over again, ad nauseam, ad infinitum. Now that I've told you everything she says in all of her books, you don't have to bother reading them. Read something good instead. Read _The History Of Western Philosophy_ by Bertrand Russell. Read _Flim-Flam!_ by James Randi. Read _Fads And Fallacies In The Name Of Science_ by Martin Gardner. Read _The Demon-Haunted World_ by Carl Sagan. Read anything you want, but for Pete's sake, don't bother with Ayn Rand and her narcissistic, egotistical, paranoid garbage."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand is so wrong in so many ways -- and spreads her mistakes out over hundereds and hundereds of interminable pages. &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; could be unintentionally funny, a kind of trashy read, a giggle for people with a brain. In fact it's just dull, full of stooges for Rand's tenets haplessly disguised as characters. And, oh, she doesn't know the first thing about architecture, either."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"If this book is so appealing to the masses (as it certainly seems to be) doesn't that mean the book itself is the opposite of its message?Or if you are one of the people who enjoyed this book can you stand the irony that you are the type of person she is mocking in this book?i can't tell you the number of whiny, uninteresting no-talents i have met who have recommended this book and consider it validation for why the world doesn't understand or appreciate them."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Anybody who does not love this book is basically a worthless human being."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book was not in the shape it was represented to be in. It was very worn and it was written in. That is not how it was described. I was very disappointed!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am a junior in high school. When I first read The Fountainhead, it was like a revelation for me. I thought that my life was basically meaningless as it was, and to truly experience enlightenment I must learn to be &quot;selfish&quot;. However, that initial passion has since faded, and I can now step back and see some of the fallacies of the book. Although great in concept, Objectivism, as the extreme opposite of Communism, may work in much the same way. I also noticed that characters in Rand's books (I have read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, and We the Living), especially the female characters, are fundamentally very similar, both in appearance and character. This does not detract from the books' overall appeal, but does take away a little of the mystery and intrigue. I love these books though, and while not agreeing totally with every aspect of Rand's philosophy, I appreciate the beautiful workmanship of her writing."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is truly a great one, but you really have to attentive and persistent to &quot;get&quot; it all and get through it. I especially had trouble staying focused for the first 200 pages (paperback).One the book does take off, it is a rewarding ride, a thought-provoking journey through a time in America when things were vastly different (but - in so many ways the same?). Especially interesting is some of dialogue surrounding freedom of the individual vs. the perceived primacy of the masses, enhanced even more so given the backdrop of our events of 9/11/01 in the USA (GBA!!!!). Some of the dialogue is downright eerie in this context, and it almost seems that you could peel some of it out and use it as an editorial without it seeming anachronistic at all.Overall, a great read, and absolutely worth it if you can spare the time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have always been interested in Ayn Rand, even though I knew nothing about her. I was recently lent this book by a friend. I don't think I could have asked for anything more in a book. It is thought-provoking and immensely satisfying. The characters are real, they each have a past, a motivation, and a tremdously human personality. The reader finds bits of himself in each one. The author tracks their development, walks you through their lives, draws you to one conclusion after another, until ultimately you have a clear picture of each. The most incredible thing about this story is the emotional response evoked by the people and events. There were times I hated something so much I wanted to throw the book across the room. There were times I actually thought I hated the book, as I vicariously experienced the torture of the characters. To me, the success of a novel is directly linked to the amount of impact it has on the reader. In this way, The Fountainhead is one of the most successful books I have ever read. Ayn Rand's philosophy, Objectivism is demonstrated so convincingly throughout the story, that it becomes impossible for the reader to distinguish it from the characters involved, yet simple for the mind to grasp. The reader is left with a knowledge of truths never before articulated, yet eerily familiar. Through the tangled, confused, and often excruciating lives in this novel, we confront our own illusions, short-comings and most importantly, our fears, until we are left with a simple idea, one that has become so obvious in the process of reading that we'd wonder why we hadn't thought of it already, if Rand hadn't shown us why we didn't. I can't say enough about this book. It should be required reading for life."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This is Rand's Great American Novel - it presents an inspiring view of individualism worth re-reading over the years. Roark is a self-actualized, self-motivated individual. Rand contrasts Roark's character with three fascinating male characters; Keating, who betrayed his dreams by conforming; Toohey, who deliberately seeks to destroy greatness; Wynand, who lives a tragic mistake. My one disappointment is the character of Dominique - Rand was not yet able to project the female equivalent of Dagny in Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this book as a junior in high school, almost five years have passed and I have read it 4 times already(practically once a year). This is an excellent story if you take it from a fictional point of view and it is also filled with great political and ideological viewpoints. I find this book very inspirational."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This was definitely a life changing book for me. I read it in high school and immediately fell in love with Howard Roark and all of his ideals. Rand did an amazing job putting together a novel that really expresses that intangible desire to be more -- particularly considering the fact that the book was written in English, which was her second language.The fact that most people who come to Rand as a writer move on to explore her philosophies, well, that's somewhat of a disappointment. I did, too. Ordered all sorts of pamphlets and immersed myself for a while in all of the Objectivist activities. But she was not a perfect woman; she was not a good role model or philosopher. But she WAS one hell of a story teller. And this is a story to hold close to your heart.It also is an ideal gift for anyone making a big change in their lives -- graduation, moving, job change."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Aloha, The Fountain head is the most pleasurable audio tape I have never finished. I drive allot for pleasure about 1,000 miles a week. I borrowed this book from an east coast library, along with a lot of others.

Was I surprised and delighted to find that I only had part one.Of course I will start it from the beginning and do all 24 tapes in a row next time.Not much to say.

The struggle of a passionate architect-Howard Roark against the conventional world and his ultimate victory over them clearly portrays the need for self growing - 'ego'.

I smelled scents of resentment to communism in its debunking of altruism, which is, in this book, quite terribly distorted. Two major characters, Howard Roark and Ellsworth Toohey, are poles of two dogmatic principles. But not only so, Ellswork Toohey also soiled himself with the evil of destroying others, the effacement of independence and creation, that are, in my impression, not part of altruism. This is just not a world that one has to kill another to gain his or her independence, vice versa. But to make a world like that, Ayn Rand is sucessful in her own way."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I enjoyed Atlas Shrugged - which I read first - and to a lesser extent The Fountainhead. My feelings about these two novels can be best be summed up by what my sister once said about White Castle burgers: they're good in a sick kind of way. Whereas Rand really hit it out of the park with Atlas Shrugged, The Fountainhead lacks a conflict we can care about and protagonists that act in ways that make sense. It really seems like Rand wrote Atlas Shrugged with an eye toward correcting the mistakes made in The Fountainhead. With the exception of being somewhat overwritten, Atlas Shrugged is superior in every way.Howard Roark is a brilliant architect who is so dedicated to his progressive modern style he is willing to starve rather than compromise his art. He doesn't do compromise or design by committee. So far, so good. He meets the fabulously wealthy Dominique Francon and they fall into that hyper-intense state of psychotic love that only Rand characters can achieve. At this point everyone should live happily ever after - but if they did we wouldn't have a story and besides, these two are crazy-stupid. More accurately, Howard makes a couple of really stupid decisions that complicate his life needlessly and Dominique is just plain nuts.Howard is too stupid to realize that by marrying Dominique he could have the love of his life and also be able to pay his electric bill, thus making his unwillingness to compromise much easier. But his big bonehead move comes when he allows his design for a government housing project to be submitted under another architect's name - with the nonnegotiable condition that no changes be made to the design. Expecting to get your design through government red tape without changes is ridiculous - government, after all, being the ultimate example of decision by committee. Suffice it to say, he's no John Galt.Dominique is so crazy that she decides to dedicate her whole life to destroying herself because one of Howard's buildings is mutilated by its owner, even though Howard moves on with his life without giving the matter a second thought. She marries two men whom she despises, sublimating her real self to become a Stepford wife. As the image of a Rand woman, she isn't fit to hold Dagny Taggart's dirty underwear.Rand uses the conflict of bold, progressive architectural design versus the staid, classical style favored by the majority to argue for her belief in individualism over collectivism. I'm all for individualism, but it's hard to get too worked up about the creeping influence of collectivism in architecture. Who cares? In Atlas Shrugged the collectivists were literally killing the country with their policies, something that doesn't seem possible to achieve through architecture.Skip this one and read Atlas Shrugged."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"A wonderful look into the passion of architecture...and some other philosophical stuff as well."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"That's really all that needs to be said. I started reading this book because a girl I liked loved this book. I started out wanting to like this book. By about page 200 I just gave up. I have no problem reading long books.

It had shallow characters and a predictable plot. I was really excited to read the book because I was interested in learning about Ayn Rand's philosophy. From what I've read her objectivism was not fully developed when she wrote this trash. Fair enough. But the philosophical ideas presented in this book (and they were presented AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN) were pretty shallow and really turned me away from caring to follow up and look into her more deveoped ideas.

I have a lot of questions for her but I still bounce off the walls. This is not of book of \\"real\\" characters and it isn't supposed to be--this is a dramatization, almost cartoon-like, but still full of deep, totally new and differing people. Reading this was a roadtrip for my mind and I appreciate the unapologetic, straight-foward and well thought-out logic that says that altruism retards society. On this note, I oftentimes don't agree with Rand or can't see how her ideas can implemented well in \\"real\\" life, but she makes some excellent ponts and raises interesting questions that serve as scrumptious brain-food. She sides on the extreme and lets the responsible reader look elsewhere for a differing point of view.I love it, just love it."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Contrary to what some people might think this book is clearly NOT about facist ideas. Quite the contrary, Rand was against concepts such as facism. Rand does not anywhere that I can see in the book say that doing something that benefits society is wrong. What she does say is that it is individualism that makes a society great. She illustrates how a &quot;collective&quot; mentality only produces mediocrity. There is nothing wrong with doing something that benefits society, as long as it is not being done because society demands that you do it or in some way has rights over you as an individual. Take the housing development that Roark builds as an example. Society benefited from the project but Roark did it simply to satisfy himself and his vision. He did NOT build it to win praise or admiration from anyone. This is what Rand tries to convey in her works. All of the best things that we have in society are because an individual dared to say &quot;I can do that&quot;.

It was the contrast of these characters that kept me involved in this novel. Rand quite beautifully sets her characters up as opposites to one another and then through intense characterization explores how these opposites interact with one another.

Ayn Rand takes no prisoners and shows us what happens to those who are gifted and intelligent in this world.

Skip this and spend your money on a pizza instead."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Rand's irrational philosophy is expressed (at length) in this poorly written book. Others like Emerson have expressed similar individualistic thoughts in a much more appealing and concise way."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"In recent years Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD has skyrocketed to the top of Favorite Book lists among young people everywhere, which to discerning readers is almost as frustrating as reading the book itself.As a novel, THE FOUNTAINHEAD manages to fail so abysmally that it makes a very readable spectacle of itself; it's the equivalent of a twelve-car pileup on the freeway, a beautifully obscene attraction for literary gawkers and rubbernecks. No other author comes to mind capable of producing a landscape tortuously drawn out over 700 pages absolutely devoid of human characters; only Rand could have conjured up such elegant stick-figures as Howard Roark, Ellsworth Toohey, and Gail Wynand. The mind's eye pictures them as Art Deco cartoons much like the characters of the TV show BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES. That is, these people are not even archetypes or caricatures; they neither echo nor mock anything within the boundaries of life or literature as they are really expe! rienced. Rand plunges so far into her aborted brain-children's illusory depths, however, that the reader cannot help applauding--say, the way one would applaud for a monkey doing backflips.Despite its seeming cold precision, Rand makes her style just as plaintive and purple as the worst of 19th-century English romances. Thematic messages in literature are not heard, but overheard--a point that is rather lost on Rand, who obstinately bludgeons the reader over the top of the head with her self-serving, almost childish rants. Her prose is brilliant but not beautiful, her ideas jarring but not substantive, her rhetorical progressions subtle and devious but failing to convince us of anything we will believe; in short, THE FOUNTAINHEAD is like a sleek shining limo without an engine.What makes plodding through THE FOUNTAINHEAD such an ugly ordeal is Rand's insistent allegorizing of her half-wit philosophy, which denies altruism is a virtue and advocates rational self-interes! t as the fundamental principle to govern the lives of &quot;! ;men of intellect.&quot; At times her indictment of conformity actually manages to hit the mark and ring true, but unfortunately these times are lost amidst what amounts to hundreds of pages of poison-preaching, as Rand baldly assigns more worth to human achievement than humanity itself. Her world view is embarrassingly limited and excludes the fundamental reality of how billions of human beings actually live.Perhaps the novel's surging popularity among high-schoolers is a sign of our times--our generation is often demonized for renouncing all accountability--but one would like to think that this is not true. In the meanwhile one hopes that THE FOUNTAINHEAD will be exposed to its admirers for what it really is--pop literature at its worst."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book as well as its companion Atlas Shrugged are two books no one should go without reading at least once in their lives. Both give a true insight to the very nature of man."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"You may really hate what you see...Frankly, this is not a book for you. That is, it's not for you unless you've made one important insight...You see, if you plan to read this book you may be in for a surprise. Kind of like the surprise of a review that you're in for considering my rating.I loved this book, and it started, for me, a roller-coaster journey of emotion &amp; thought from my earliest and darkest memories as a squirming tot, right through my last cup o' java.You can have no idea of what's in store for you before you begin this trip. This applies to all of life's travels, after all &quot;life's what happens while you're busy making other plans.&quot;And this novel is no different, but with a special twist. It will be unlike anything you've ever read before.You honestly will open the windows of you're mind into either a chasm-like, fearful place of fog, into which will shine the diffusive rays of sun, illuminating all that's inside, forcing you to examine everything it holds, and become horrified and turn away from the dark terrors it contains, or into a place where you'll find soltice, companionship, and a peace (and I mean that) unlike any which can be imagined or meditated upon.You may be amazed by the things you've accepted to be true, or you may realize that incredible feeling of justification in the knowledge that at least one other person in the world has experienced the same things as you have.Someone has felt the same disgust in the blind leading the blind devotion of society at large, and has been repulsed at each and every sniveling boot-licking gesture of those who live to please others, and never themselves.Upon stumbling across this world contained in The Fountainhead, my personal journey became populated by the idea of hope.Hope that there must be another - that I am not the only one the world coming to these inevitable conclusions about life. It's amazing how freeing that can be...just the idea that I might some day be able to share these feelings with at least one other person.I'm not saying this book will change you're life.Not at all. I will say that it will force you to examine it.It may justify, repulse, comfort, or terrify you.But I can promise that it will never leave you. By ordinary standards, this has no business being considered a novel. I know of no equal sharing such a description.Please E-mail me if you've read it because of this, and if it's been enjoyable you'll want to read Atlas Shrugged next (a book I consider equal to The Book of Revelation - for the western world).

There's simply no excuse for such sloppy work."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My first thought while reading this book was \\"Why does Rand hate women so much?\\" There does seem to be a misogynistic theme throughout the text, which is unfortunate because the story is pretty decent. Like \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" the characters here are one-dimensional and not terribly interesting, but Rand writes some good descriptions and the plot is good enough to make you want to finish it. Even though it's clear what her philosophy is in this book, she doesn't beat you over the head with it nearly as much as she does in her other fiction books. That said, you still do get the sense that if you don't agree entirely with how Rand feels about certain things (like, say, the arts), then you are an idiot and are part of the problem. Some authors are masters of subtly, but Rand isn't. She's about as subtle as a picture book for toddlers. If you can put up with this style of writing, then the book shouldn't be a problem. If you like shades of grey and think that the world doesn't exist solely in black and white, you might want to skip this, along with \\"Atlas Shrugged.\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is brilliantly written. But that's where the brilliance ends. The characters are completely unbelievable. If you've read this you know that Roark claims that he doesn't care at all, about anything but himself. He claims that he doesn't need anything but himself and his art. If that is true, why was he so unhappy when Dominique was with Wynand? I don't understand the characters at all. I know a lot of women and none of them would risk their own happiness the way Dominique did. The only character with genuine emotion is Wynand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Somebody tell Howard Roark to go get a job where he can earn a steady living and have some &quot;security&quot; in his life, will you? HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA........Those might be the words that a second hander would utter. And yes, I do suppose that along with that very same second hander there are many many others who, if presented with howard's creative, inventive works, would rationalise/attribute the outcome of such a great man to something other than INDIVIDUAL EFFORT. The second handers, upon viewing a great building, would say either that it is not beautiful, simply because it is not of the ORDINARY (exceptional, by definition, is not of the ordinary) or would rationalize-away the greatness of the individual accomplishment of the person who designed it simply because a second hander realising and acknowledging such ability would be faced with the terrifying TRUTH of his own personal philosophy. At once, the second hander would have to acknowledge who he is and re-structure his life goals along the lines of individual accomplishment (which is NO EASY task in modern american society). Or, the second hander would follow the very same course of reasoning/rationalization which led him to his present state of group supported existence and shy away in terror from the possibility of individual greatness and accomplishment and attempt to secure himself among his &quot;groupies&quot; by saying something such as the first sentence of this review. And, possibly, as has been the case for several decades now, the second hander would find some feeling of security just so long as his tax-funded subsidy which he calls a pay check keeps on rolling in.If you have ever wondered just who produces that subsidy... and what would happen if such rare, select men were to simply walk-out on society, read another of Rand's great novels &quot;atlas shrugged&quot;."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"THIS BOOK IS THE BEST EVER WRITTEN. iT HAS ever facet of literature available. i reccommend this book whole heartedly and feel that it should be recquired to read so that may one continue to live."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I could have justified giving this book two stars, or even three. It is, after all, well and cleverly written. It is seductive, easy to get caught up into the plot and hard to resist caring about the characters, even when your head tells you that you REALLY don't even marginally like any of them. Also, there are parts of Rand's \\"philosophy\\" that are undeniably true, and need to be heard in the modern world. But she's made it clear that she prefers honest hatred to indifference, so I'll do her that much courtesy.The biggest problem with this book is the \\"romantic interest\\", a term which I use advisedly. The main character is supposed to be Rand's concept of the ideal man; one must therefore assume that the female lead must be the ideal woman for such a man (after all, if he's ideal, he wouldn't fall for just anybody, right?) and their relationship must also be ideal.That relationship begins with him raping her. No, this is not an exaggeration, it isn't date rape, it's actual, honest-to goodness, no mistake or confusion rape. But that's okay, because it's only what she secretly wanted from him, and certainly what she had coming; she was, after all, a snotty rich woman who'd treated him with a lack of respect just because he was (so far as she knew) a common laborer.Does anybody else out there see a problem with this concept? How about the fact that she spent the rest of the book trying to convince herself that she deserved him, because his treatment of her earned her worship?There are other problems with the philosophy expressed in this book, as if there's actually any need for MORE reasons. But this one is sufficient in itself to make the book utterly worthless, in spite of the validity of SOME of its message. Those parts of the message can be found in other books that do not have the baggage that this one carries. I recommend \\"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\\" by Ken Kesey."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is so overrated it is simply beyond comprehension. I bought this book, together with Atlas Shrugged years ago and never read them. I've now discovered why! Ayn Rand is the most overrated author of all time. Her so-called philosophy of \\"objectivism\\" is nothing more than a cover for blatant selfishness and cruelty. Ayn Rand writes with no feeling and seems to have no understanding of human relations. The dialogue is terrible, the descriptions sound like they were written for a \\"What I did on Summer Vacation\\" essay and the plot (is there a plot?)meanders along for a laughable 700 pages! All I want to know is what everyone sees in her books that I don't? Her characters are cardboard cut-outs- they are totally lacking in depth. I kept plodding along waiting for an \\"aha\\" moment. It never came. It was so incredibly dull and the characters so awful they made the murderous protagonist in American Psycho look a real nice guy. Horrible stuff."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I own both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged in hardcover and paperback.

Well, when I saw the cost to download either book to my Kindle, I decided, no, you really don't want to download those books, not at those outrageous costs.

For all the times you were punished or criticized for following your own individual values, this book is your redemption. If you still cling to innocent, idealistic values, you will love Howard Roark and be grateful for his existence. If, however, you have given in and compromised your values to try to succeed on society's or others' terms, it is too late and you will probably only resent Howard Roark for representing what you could have been.

I loved the plot and I even enjoyed the characters (although they exhibit an amount of emotional repression that is extraordinary). The problem with The Fountainhead is that it is intended to seduce its target audience (high school and college age kids) to embrace right wing politics. Kids who read The Fountainhead have seldom ever read or have a clear understanding of politics, philosophy, and sociology. After reading The Fountainhead kids will come away parroting Ayn Rand's polemics. Kids who read The Fountainhead remind me of kids who used to study the works of Karl Marx in the 60s and 70s: they put down the book thinking they now have all the answers to life. Most kids abandon objectivism (like kids in the 60s and 70s abandoned socialism) after they experience life. But, oh, how annoying they can be until then! The book still wields a cult-like trance with the young which is why The Fountainhead will always remain (after the Bible) the book most kids claim changed their lives.

Notice that they list specifically the ideas and characters that appeal to them. If you can think, you will like this book.

Those concerned about the state of affairs with humanity should read this book and consider its implications that still ring true to today. It will demonstrate that humanitarians and those with a collectivist ideology are as selfish as their counterparts. At least think when you read this book, but try harder to think for yourself, as Ayn Rand suggests. Plunge into it, sustain judgement, and view the world with a realistic perspective.

I've encountered people that have tried to be Howard Roark, and known people who have dropped out of architectural schools after reading this work. regardless of hate or love one must respect a work for being able to make us feel the way we do, for makeing us act the way we act, and for makeing us think the way we think. This book, for me anyway, is a shineing example of what words are capable of. I was on a bus to arizona and I heard a woman talking about The Fountainhead. She hated it because she tried to live like Howard Roark for 2 years, and failed to become &quot;like him&quot;. She had rage in her voice, and anger, genuine and pure balled up her fists.

Many of the reviewers of this work obviously cannot. Two reviewers proclaimed putting Rand on a pedestal defeated her purpose, Rand was a strong advocate of &quot;hero-worship&quot; that is looking up to the great, not walking on them or degrading them to a lowly standard. Rand belongs on a very high pedestal, as proving that she is one of the greatest authors of the 20th century. Those who find this book as &quot;hypocrisy&quot; (as one reviewer put it), should read Atlas Shrugged. If Atlas Shrugged is too long for your small conceptual ability, read the 50 page John Galt speech it does a good job in smashing your review into pieces."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am tired of people saying that they really enjoyed The Fountainhead, but that Rand could of said what she needed to say in a more condensed manner. What person out there would care to summarize genius? Mozart was also told that he should just take a few notes from his symphonies and then they would be quite perfect. People thought that his music was too strenuous for the human ear. Perhaps we should also begin to take out,at our whim, a figure from the composition of a great painting. What I am trying to say is that you can't take only a piece of a book,painting,or musical composition, and love it only sectionally, while seperating it from the whole.

I found the book a slow read up until maybe page 300, but in the end I thought it was worth it. In spite of popular belief that we the youth believe we have all the answers after reading this novel and other writings, I found rather that it posed more questions. The ideas Rand posed in this novel are quite thought-provoking. The story is intriguing if not believable. I enjoy her prose, though, yes, after 700 pages one feels numb. In the end, I couldn't write the essay. Just as another youth wrote, putting Rand on a pedastal would go against everything she believed in and advocated. Rather than harp on her ideas for the $10,000, I decided that the new ideas and questions I came out with were worth much more."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read it in about a week. the ideas that were presented could unfortunately, as another reader suggested, have been expressed in several hundred less pages, no mater how great they were.

Those who deride this brilliant piece as such have either not read the book (such as the writers of &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; in which a total egotistical jerk says it's his bible) or just could not understand Rand's true, complex messsage. I pity you if you fall into one of those catagories, for I found this book to be thought provoking, even if disturbingly so. I couldn't get this book out of my head for months and am still trying to decide to what extent I subscribe to Rand's philosophy. Much of what Anne Rnad has to say will strike a chord within you. However, I do have problems with certain aspects...for one, in order for Rand to make her point, her characters become a little linear, and she becomes rather repetative. However, my main problem with Anne Rand's philosophy/novel is it's hopelessness: we can NEVER achieve the ideal that she presents, nor would we necessarily survive the process to achieve the ideal. If you are prepared to live with that wrenching reality, read and love the novel. Otherwise, be careful, for you can neither read this novel lightly nor survive it without a few scars. Still, a gut feeling tells me that those scars are worth it and that everyone should read this book. It should be required for living even if you don't agree with the philosophy!

This book was a great encouragement, it defines the ideas that until now have been hard to grasp. It might seem a hard read at first but once you get it it all comes together. There is so much greatness in this book but I guess everyone has to discover that for themselves.

I don't know about life in the 40's, but I know that it surely wasn't like it is today in the 90's. Reading this book also taught me a lot about people.

Think of it as therapy for people who need someone to *tell* them that it's okay to live their own lives and that they don't have to buy their right to exist through fulfilling external and unchosen &quot;duties.&quot;Unfortunately, many of Rand's less critical admirers have *stayed* in therapy for a very long time -- and Rand, who herself suffered from a host of psychological problems, was among the world's least qualified people to administer therapy to adults.You'll search her philosophy in vain for any indication that psychologically healthy adults *do* seek to help one another, not as a &quot;sacrificial duty&quot; but out of the generosity that marks a rational and successful human life. And you'll especially search *this* novel for it in vain; generosity and helpfulness weren't very important virtues to Rand (if they were important at all).And if you insist on taking Howard Roark as your own personal role model, you'll drive yourself nuts in fairly short order. Roark's behavior usually involves repressing his own emotions and other internal danger signals, feeling more &quot;empathy&quot; for buildings than for human beings, thinking everybody else under the sun is a miserable (and forgettable) &quot;second-hander,&quot; and generally regarding his own &quot;creativity&quot; as an excuse for being a whirling sonofoabitch.Some people enjoy this sort of thing; they're called adolescents.

It does not apologize in its viewpoint and puts forth a good faith argument that ego makes the world go round. (Of course, it doesn't address if the world *needs* to go round, or whether ego does bring happiness, but we can read the Dalai Lama on that :)Is it a life changing book? Depends on your life and beliefs. It didn't change mine, but it certainly asked some serious questions that everyone should answer.Nevertheless, I'll probably read 20 other books before I read Atlas Shrugged.And oh yeah, I *loved* the Frank Lloyd Wright character ;^) (Sorry Ayn, wherever you are)"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Why are all the protagonists in Ayn Rand's novels male?

She's an imperfect novelist and a flawed philosopher, but she is in a literal sense the greatest published writer of English of anyone in the post-war English-speaking world - and her native language was Russian!

Shortly after reading it, I found that it was based on the life of Frank Lloyd Wright, who was one of the pioneer architects of his time. His person was amazingly split into the main characters. I love the language used by Rand pertaining to the way she says what she wants us to know, as well as the deep thoughts that she shares with us. Besides a few chapters that were about sadomascism, I think this book was a great pick!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ayn Rand's &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is probably one of the best pieces of literature I've ever read. I'm a high-school student, on the advanced-track curriculum and have been taking college level Englsh courses for the last two years. Having initially grumbled at the idea of wasting my entire christmas break reading &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; in preparation for upcoming class discussion, I was pleasantly surprised by the level of interest that the first two chapters generated within me. Soon I was hooked, and I got the book finished in four days, despite Ellsworth Toohey's insufferable monologues. The book is a must read: It grabs the reader and propels him through the story, the sheer momentum gets you through the boring parts, in anticipation of the excitement that is sure to come. All though not &quot;action&quot; in the Clancy-esque sense of the word, the book is one that is difficult to put down. I reccomend it for everyone!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Anyone can read The Fountainhead, and if you are a deep thinker, you will grasp the full meaning. In many respects, it is a book that was designed to make you think. It takes you on an introspective journey, one that you will never forget. I do not completely agree with Ayn Rand's philosophy, but it is not necessary in order to appreciate this thought provoking, beautifully written work; reading this book with the assumption that Rand is trying to impose her views on the reader is a limited and false perception. Rand challenges you to think independently! If you read this book with your mind, with your ability to reason - your sense - you will surely enjoy it. The plot is well organized, and this is evident upon completion of the novel. Truly a masterpiece of all time, once you begin, you will find it hard to put the book down. I also recommend this book to anyone involved in the field of architecture."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This novel offers a unique and original philospohy of objectivism. Rand exposes her values in an intriguing fictional tale, but one that has a resonating truth. This is a fictional novel, that makes you think. You may feel as though you earned a second degree if you are able to read both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. These novesl are based on core values that enable you to revisit and reconnect. An amazing aspect of both these novels is the entertainment they lack the unnecessary drama or exaggerated plots that we are so used to today. The combination of the core values and realistic plots have enabled her books to stand the test of time."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is about being truthful to one-self. It is wrong to say that this book is not about architecture. First, the architecture of New York and the northern US East-Coast in the 1920s and 1930s is the offspring of capitalism and individualism. Ayn Rand's was born in St. Petersburg Russia and lived through the first years of the Communist Regime, which she detested. She moved to the United States where she developed a theory praising man and what it can do. That is why the characters in this book are so fond of New York - the huge skycrapes are NOT TO MAKE MAN FEEL SMALL, BUT TO ELEVATE HIM THROUGH WHAT HE CAN ACCOMPLISH.On the other hand, you will understand the superficiality of renaissance, baroque, classic and neo-classic architecture used in the early 1920s and 1930s. This architecture is merely decorative. Howard Roark comes to tear all this apart with a concept of unity and \\"objectivism\\" largely criticized but admired by those who do not live with the flow like the passive-agressive Peter Keating who you will probably despise at the end of the novel. It makes me feel like when I finished The Catcher in The Rye.Other themes include love, sex, jingoism and sensationalism, art, society and socialism. That is why this book is so rich. All this is set with very en-vogue New York as backdrop. I highly recommend this book for prospective and practicing architects and to anyone who appreciates anti-heroes."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is a must read - beatifully and powerfully written."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I read this book along with Atlas Shrugged and found them both to be some of the most powerful reading I had ever experienced.

I started finding whole of Rand's so called objectivity a cruel farce. The story starts with the naked Roark and ends with a successful Roark who after 700 odd pages looked to be mightier and aweinspiring than ever.

Roark is the .00000000001% of people ever to have even come close to being perfect. Perfect is cold and dull, that is why Roark is. But perfect is also great.Of all the criticisms I've heard about the book, I do not think many are valid. People don't like it because they don't fully understand it, because it is bold and not what they are used to. It is often pointed out that Roark is exactly what Rand was, this is quite true.Why I gave it 4 stars: I don't completely agree with Rand's philosophy (I am actually more extreme about some things) but that does not matter in a well-written book. It got a bit preachy at times but for the most part kept my attention, and the characters were great. For those who have not read the book, read it.

The reader may object to the idea of objectivism as a solution to the plagues of modern society, but he should keep in mind that this philosophy has not been offered as a solution at all. The world may not be better if the world is filled with men and women like Howard Roark, but the reader must not miss the fact that the book believes that care for others is unimportant, and of secondary concern. This is a valid point; the very point that makes it such an eye opening piece of literature.

I, however, only read it this month, 17 years after graduating from highschool. The themes of the book are well-taken, and considering the era in which they were first published, were probably considered quite revolutionary and racey. Themes of &quot;individualism&quot;, &quot;counter-facism&quot;, &quot;censorship&quot; and &quot;mind-control&quot; are still pertinent today and that is probably why the book still has appeal today.I felt though that such themes were presented too much in a black and white manner--with not much room for grey. The characters were either over-zealous, adamant, idealists or spineless louses. Toohey with his evangilism, Dominique with her self-sacrifices, Rourk with his inability to budge, and Keating with his manipulations.

Maybe the best position to be in, is a balance between the ego and altuism; or is this a &quot;cop out&quot;? To be a true egotist is so difficult to achieve in today's society and perhaps can never be achieved; but we must try. Self love is the only true freedom; when you love self then everything around you becomes beautiful; you begin to operate from a position of non-judgement.

Howard Roark is a brilliant architect, who refuses to sacrifice his ideals and beliefs in return for monetary gain, popularity, or any of the other rewards that the people around him are so greedily willing to trade their values for. Unbending and noble, Howard fights to bring the world honesty by using his skills in architecture to create startlingly unique buildings. Criticized by the world for his unusual and functional buildings, that lacked the splendor and ornamental uselessness that had become so popular, Howard fights an uphill battle, while everything he holds dear hangs precariously in balance: his life, his work, and the woman he loves.This book is a clear illustration of Ayn Rand's philosophy of rational selfishness. Howard embodies the perfect man, who gives nothing of himself, and would never allow his values crumble. He embodies selfishness, in a balanced, reasonable way. Roark lives in the world, but not of it. He lives by his own standard, does his own work, and relies upon himself, never stealing another's work, or looking for his own gain. Integrity guides his actions, while he ignores the opinions and criticism of others. While Howard is the clear protagonist, the other characters vary in standing; some represent the evil of the world: of men that have failed, of men that could have never succeeded, of men with potential that discarded it for the dishonesty of the world.Peter Keating represents one of these men: the man who would never succeed. He aspires and plots; using men to achieve what he cannot by himself. He is weak and easily manipulated, and led away from the things he truly wishes to do with his life, preying on the weak to hide his own insecurity and lack of talent. He is easily corrupted, and lives his life only for the fickle and false approval of the world, which does not last. As he bases his personal value and happiness on this shaky foundation, he finds himself father and farther from the things he really desires, and in the end, alone, as a failure.Another man that represents the evil of the world: Ellsworth Toohey. A columnist for a widely read newspaper, Toohey shapes the public to his own diabolical whim. By highly praising those with little true talent, he takes the standard of man and lows the bar significantly, making mediocrity the highest aspiration, and turning the public against men such as Howard, who have true ability to succeed. Throughout the book men such as these represent the lowest humanity could fall to, thus causing Howard to be an intellectual giant amongst greedy, lazy, inept men. He is criticized for being \\"selfish\\" and \\"egotistical\\" though his only offense was to unyieldingly defend his values.Dominique Francon is another character that exemplifies greatness. Passionate, yet deeply afraid to love anything, only to see it taken away, Dominique lives only a half-life until she meets Roark. Howard's only love, and brilliant in her own right, Dominique fights fiercely against the world, hating them for what they do to Howard. Roark helps her to find that the world really doesn't matter, and she finally finds a way to discard what others think, and live her life fully and proudly, as Howard does.Gail Wynand is another man who Howard changed. Despite living in poverty as a child, he rose to become a great newspaper owner, with his newspapers influencing and shaping the way the public thinks and feels. He becomes good friends with Howard, who sees Gail for his genius and ability, and respects his talent of gaining personally. But Gail's success and love of life is only based on his ability to shape public opinion, so when his power fails, he fails as well.As the story goes on, Rand's antagonists constantly try to thwart Howard, including Dominique for a brief period of time. She marries Peter, trying to hurt Howard, to break him, so he stops offering the world his beauty and perfection that they will, in the end, only reject. So caught on what others thought, Dominique believed that the world didn't deserve Howard, and worked frantically to destroy his work. She begins to see as Howard does eventually, leaving the world behind and standing beside Howard to defend him and aid him in surviving obstacles. Her fear dissolves when she sees how untouchable Howard is, and how nothing can destroy him because of the confidence and knowledge he possesses. He has a difficult time getting commissions, and refuses some, only building the way he saw fit; refusing to compromise his integrity to build something he was not inspired to do. In doing so, he invoked the hatred of the people who would never understand or appreciate Howard's magnificent talent. As Toohey brought the public against Howard, Peter worked to use Roark's genius as his own, taking credit for Howard's work. The climax of the book occurs at Howard's trial, after he was arrested for destroying a building which he had designed, but had been secretly defiled. he delivers a speech about his ideals, trying to correct the corruption the world has fallen into, and explain how true happiness can come only from integrity, hard work, and self respect.The storyline is elaborately and skillfully weaved, the point comes across both bluntly and subtly; with enough imagination and fictional drama to hook the reader, and enough reality and philosophy to engage the reader, to invite thought and consideration about the world as it is today. Sometimes the plot seems a bit outlandish, but a touch of surrealness only adds to the entertaining aspects of the book.The characters in this book are vivid, though unrealistic. The heroes are vastly superior to those cast in a less desirable light. Nonetheless, Rand gets her point across. By making her \\"perfect man\\" so stunningly righteous and decent, by comparison everyone else is seen as dirty and low. They are too perfect, or too imperfect, and none of them really have much \\"humanity\\" to them--emotion remains unexpressed, there is no laughter, and few tears. The characters sometimes seem to be made of stone. Despite this, the symbolism behind each of the characters is very well done. The text can sometimes seem a bit thick--in subject matter and length. Some of Howard's monologues are overkill, but still, the point is there, without flourish or disguise. Rand places her point in front of the reader, presented by the glorious protagonist, and to disagree would put the reader into the same category as Peter Keating, and Toohey: not only in the wrong, but as a being that is working to destroy human progress; the embodiment of pure evil. The characters draw the reader in, and before they know it, Howard has won them over, and so has Rand with her philosophy of rational selfishness, and the theory that \\"A man's ego is the fountainhead of human progress.\\""},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"One can safely say that both the tone and text of a review of THE FOUNTAINHEAD (or ATLAS or any of the other Rand books) is determined more by the philosophical outlook of the reader than the actual story, characters or message. I read this book some thirty years ago and reread it again recently just to see if it still &quot;rang true&quot; and if the same things that I liked and disliked the first time were still there.I am glad to report that the story still is a powerful one - ignore the politics if you must. The handling of the many relationships, the uniqueness of the characters, the totally unconventional love story, the tragic hero - it was all still there. Also, the same things I disliked were present - the lack of more female characters, the dryness of Roark, his wooden speeches...indeed, his presence is like a shadow. And just as the REAL hero in ATLAS was the very human Hank, the real central character in this book is the very human Wynand. The portrait of this man is still - in my opinion - one of the best insights into the psyche of a complex, would-be-great individual I have ever read.Perhaps the fact that Wynand was so &quot;like us&quot; and not on some stellar plane or residing on a lower rung of hell makes him such a likeably character. The writing is deft, brilliant at times, turgid occasionally. The arguments against collectivism still ring true. The basis of collectivism is that the State, through force, attempts to create equality by distributing material and intellectual wealth from those who have it to those who don't. The fact that the given wealth is unearned is apparently not important.And although it's been done without success many times, it will be tried again and again for one reason: Those who contribute the most are fewer in number than those who simply &quot;go along for the ride&quot;. Good book with some banal parts - great story and great blend of science, business and art."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Howard Roark is an architect who dismisses the design practices of the past as a crutch for lesser architects and their impressionable clients. For Roark, form follows function, and there will be no compromise. No matter how hard pressed he is for money. Peter Keating, however, has no such qualms, and is perfectly comfortable with the old-school way of doing things. But he does know his limitations. These he circumvents by having Howard Roark redesign some of the more complicated commissions that come his way.Years pass. Peter Keating rides the crest of a wave with the help of the boss' daughter, Dominique Francon. Howard Roark, on the other hand, struggles from one commission to another. One of them is a property scam which worked out for the better. Another lands him in court because of manipulation of a client by the newspaper columnist, Ellsworth Toohey.Dominique Francon, who had married Peter Keating, leaves and marries the media / property tycoon, Gail Wynand. Peter Keating's world begins to crumble, and he finds himself begging the influential Ellsworth Toohey for a chance at the government's housing development project, Cortlandt Homes. Ellsworth Toohey invites him to try, well knowing that the chances of him succeeding in the bid are slight, since he suspects that Peter Keating hasn't designed everything he has claimed to.So Peter Keating turns to Howard Roark, begging him to secretly design the project. His plea is accepted on the proviso that under no circumstances, whatsoever, is the design to be diverted from. Peter Keating agrees, signs a secret contract with Howard Roark, and has Ellsworth Toohey submit the design, which is accepted. The project is begun.Returning from a yachting trip, with Dominique and Gail Wynand, some months after the commencement of the project, it transpires that Peter Keating has been forced to acquiesce, mutilating the original design. None too surprised, Howard Roark decides to dynamite what has been constructed of the Cortlandt Homes project and take his chances in court....Read as a work of fiction, and not as a Trojan horse for the Rand Manifesto, my opinion is:There is a lot of eye-poppingly bad and redundant literary prose, as unnecessary to the story as gargoyles and Athenian arches would be on a Howard Roark building.The use of mixed viewpoint robs the reader of a more direct understanding as to why some of the characters have some of the extreme attitudes that they have. Having Dominique Francon issue streams of almost incomprehensible dialogue to have someone else say they don't have a clue what she's talking about is hardly the best way to involve the reader.There are occasions when the logic is a bit skewed. For example, Dominique encounters Howard at her father's granite quarry and wonders what such a noble specimen of manhood is doing breaking ( unyielding ) rocks. She contrives a way to meet him at her home. The means she chooses is to damage a marble slab fronting the fireplace in her bedroom. Howard appears as instructed and lectures her on all the types of marble available and how it is vital that she obtain the correct grade. Dominique doesn't give any thought to how a rock-breaker would be so articulately knowledgeable on the subject of marble. And so she doesn't make any attempt to have her earlier wonderment answered. Details such as this are quite a common failing, its rectification subordinated to the eye-poppingly bad prose.Even so, The Fountainhead is obviously written by someone who is tremendously skilful at integrating a plethora of sub-elements; can create a sense of high drama; and can cut through the utter mush that prevails in the world today."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I first read this novel during my sophomore year at a top business school.

Could there be any better evidence of the adolescent mindset to which this book appeals?No, *The Fountainhead* really can't change your life. This charge has nothing to do with being &quot;on the premise that life-changing -- and life -- is possible,&quot; and everything to do with the fact that ultimately, only *you* have the power to change your *own* life. What a shame that this very view -- which Ayn Rand set out to defend in the very book here under review -- has been so corrupted by her &quot;followers&quot; that the rest of us can't even criticize her literature without being pegged as anti-life and anti-reason. Wake up and smell the coffee, Randroids: Rand didn't uniquely represent either life or reason, and you don't represent them *at all* if you let her do your thinking for you.Do you really think Howard Roark would have listened to *you*?"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I am an avid reader and have always put-off reading Ayn Rand for some reason or another. I knew of Rand and her philisophical undertakings while taking some courses at university, but I had always been apprehensive about reading her work in a literary form. After finally reading The Fountainhead, I now I understand my own reluctance. Ayn Rand is a great writer, and a great thinker. The first hundred pages of The Fountainhead are very insightful, intriguing, and provocative. However, as the book goes on, I grew very weary of the author's philosophical objectives personified through the main characters. These are not characters but charicatures, they are philisopichal essays in human form - complete with the philosophical language, speech, and worldviews that would even make Nietzche shudder. This is the essential problem with Rand's book - it is less a novel about real people in real life situations than a normative statement on human interaction, behaviour, and power. Even with my wildest imagination I just can't fathom a self-made man from Hell's kitchen, a rich architect's daughter, and a kid who went to architecture school discussing man's place in the world ALL THE TIME. The conversations get so ridiculous you'll want to turn on an episode of The Simpson just to recall what \\"real\\" people talk like. If you're like me, and can appreciate what Ayn Rand is trying to do in The Fountainhead, pick up a much more superior novel such as Hesse's \\"Damien\\", Musil's \\"The Man Without Qualities, or (if you're time is at a premium) read Satre's \\"The Outsider\\"."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"It's hard not to be swept up in the fervor of The Fountainhead. It reminds me of the challenge a film professor gave to an anxious audience moments before screening Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda masterpiece \\"Triumph of the Will.\\" \\"Try not to tap your feet to the music,\\" he said. I found I could not resist turning the pages of The Fountainhead despite its flaws. Take the premise. No one in their right mind should believe that the fate of America rests in the palm of a liberal New York art critic named Ellsworth Toohey who nurtures a conspiracy so broad-reaching that intelligent people will eventually be reduced to a pack of drooling, slack-jawed socialists. But that is precisely what Ayn Rand proposes. She believes that you and I are all dolts - idiots - who have succumbed to mediocrity based on altruism. The hero who can save us is an egotistical architect named Howard Roark. As heroes go, there is nothing warm and cuddly about Howard. He doesn't really give a damn what you think about him or if you like him. Given Howard's prickly disposition, the ludicrous premise on which this book is based, and Ayn Rand's contempt for her readers, why is this book so damn popular? What gives? The answer is obvious. It's a timeless, paranoid fable that grabs at the emotions, negates the intellect, and reduces everything to absolutes. Perfect in other words for the red-baiting 1950s of Eugene McCarthy or the modern Bush era. Try not to tap your feet."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"My only regret is that I didn't read this book when I was eighteen. For 700+ pages, it was a good and fast read.

This novel is definitely a though read, the author does not allow you one moment of relaxation, pumping the book full of deeper meaning. Sometimes it takes someone else to point out obvious theories about life, and what we're living for, which is ultimately what she does.But I agree with a previous reviewer that our hero was not much of a hero because he took what he wanted and didn't care about others - while other characters didn't even know what *they* themselves wanted, and were very much worried about what others would think. Ultimately, I believe that Ayn created the characters in different extremes to make a clear point about what the differences were between them."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Until page 137 I was enjoying this book (despite the seemingly inexhaustable number of contrived, characters).

As a single working woman myself, I adored and identified with Tagny Taggart, the heroine of that book, throughout all the ups and downs of the story. The two criticisms that I had of that book was the excessive use by the author of the phrase \\"as if\\" and the lengthy philosophical \\"lecturing\\" every now and then which tended to be boring and made me say to myself, \\"Oh, not again.\\"I just finished recently The Fountainhead, and I have to say that Atlas Shrugged was much more powerful. I wished after finishing The Fountainhead that I had read it first before Atlas. When you consider that The Fountainhead was published in 1943 and Atlas was published in 1957 you can see the reason... fourteen years of life experience.Here again, the author uses \\"as if\\" just way too much, but the philosophical \\"lecturing\\" seems a little less than that of Atlas Shrugged. On the other hand, The Fountainhead, to me, was much less convincing as a story. Why would a woman who claims to love a man go and do all what she did (I don't want to spoil the story for perspective readers) instead of standing by him through thick and thin? It just didn't make sense to me. The only reason seemed to me just to make a novel out of it.Also, I was surprised to read at the end of the Fountainhead (under the title About Ayn Rand) that the goal of Rand's novels is the projection of a moral ideal man: \\"My purpose, first cause and prime mover is the portrayal of Howard Roark or John Galt or Hank Reardan or Francisco d'Anconia as an end in himself-not as a means to any further end.\\" O.K. what about Tagny Taggart, the heroine of Atlas Shrugged? Wasn't she a moral ideal woman too? This looks like sexism to me. I understand that Atlas was written in 1957, but still if the author was able and willing to write such a courageous character as Tagny Taggart at that time, I think a statement like this is sexist. I loved all three heroes of Atlas, especially Hank Rearden, but I loved Tagny Taggart just as much, if not more."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is the \\"Louie ,Louie\\" of literature.

If you are scared to look deeply into your heart and mind, if you are terrified of changing yourself and your life, do not read The Fountainhead, or anything else by Rand. But if you long for honesty and integrity, if you want to be proud of your achievements without guilt, Rand provides priceless inspiration."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"I have been waiting to read a book like this for a long time. Ever since I read Marx's and Engel's &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; in college, I had very refutable thoughts against their visions of the ideal state and a human's relation to it and in it - I just couldn't articulate them. I knew that there was something not right with an individual giving up her/his own self for the &quot;good&quot; of the people (or state). It just didn't sit well with me, but I had a very hard time trying to articulate my thoughts and arguments.Then along comes Ayn Rand with &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (HALLELUJAH!) She does an outstanding job defending the right of the individual and self. Moreover, she presents it in the form of a novel and not a step-by-step detailed list of her ideas, which is much more enjoyable reading. It is a brilliant story set in America in the 1930's during the time when most of Europe was being consumed under the dark cloud of communism. And that dark cloud was setting its course overseas toward America.I won't provide any details about &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; (besides, there are plenty in others' reviews) but I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. Yes, the novel has its shortcomings, such as its length (ever read &quot;War and Peace&quot;?) but even that isn't so bad once you get into the book. Some have argued that Rand herself is guilty of propogandist ideas, but everyone has her or his own thoughts/judgements, and herein lies precisely the theme of the book - YOU have a right to your OWN thoughts, ideas, judgments, and no one or nothing else could or should control them or make them for you.Love it or hate it, it is a must read for all; I recommend it highly to all college students. And, I can't wait to read more by Ayn Rand."},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"Ahh, the Fountainhead. I gave it 4 stars because it is not quite as good as Atlas Shrugged.But then again, if you are reading this you probably haven't read that book either.Look no further for a book about a man who does not know the meaning of the word &quot;compromise&quot;, Howard Roark. Some people tend to take everything very literally (at least judging by other reviews). Howard Roark is a man who will not let his ideals be torn asunder by his coworkers, so-called friends, and associates. Neither will the media take him down. Is is an idyllic tale of a man who did something we all want to do: chase his dream.If there's something wrong with that, then I suppose we are all in some real trouble and this book isn't going to help!"},{"Title":"The fountainhead,","review":"This book is overlong, filled with ponderous prose, and many banal trivialities. It could have benefitted from a decent editor. It is nevertheless a greatly inspiring book. While the characters are generally drawn in black and white, at least &quot;white&quot; is well-defined in a creative way, and in many respects gives the readers some true perspective which in fact may be applied to their lives. On my wall at work, I have written: &quot;What would Howard Roarke do?&quot; and while I can't say that this has greatly influenced all of my major (or even minor) life decisions, I value the availability of this benchmark personality, no matter how perfect (and hence unrealistic). It is very easy to be cynical about Ayn Rand and I have enjoyed that pastime myself. However, her work survives due to the truly insights it provides. I recommend The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged for both good stories and potentially life-changing ideas."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin (Cliffs Notes)","review":"I remember using Cliff Notes in my high-school days to avoid extensive reading and yet to pass the tests/write the papers. However, when it comes to this specific book, I highly recommend that you actually READ this book for the personal benefits you'll get, and use the Cliff Notes for summary and a guide only. Some of the most powerful aspects of this book cannot possibly be obtained through the Cliff Notes version alone. It will be found shocking to many African Americans (and educational for many Caucasians) to discover that Uncle Tom was the HERO of this classic novel, and not a \\"weakling\\" by any stretch of the imagination. \\"Uncle Tom\\", or its shorter form \\"Tom\\", has become a slanderous term within the African American community and implies a weak and Caucasian-controlled person, when in actuality Uncle Tom was a powerfully moral man who was willing to die for his convictions rather than succumb to the will of his worst oppressors. In fact, this book was credited by Abraham Lincoln himself as the catalyst that won his election on the abolition of slavery platform, and the resulting Civil War that followed. \\"Uncle Tom\\" became a negative slander one hundred years later only after Malcolm-X and the Black Muslims used it to slander Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who exemplified similar characteristics of strength and courage--from a similarly peaceful perspective--in his approach to the Civil Rights issue. As with the fictitious character Tom, Dr. King also died for his convictions without raising a hand against his oppressors. I highly recommend this book to people of all colors and races because of the lessons of self-sacrifice and courage it contains. Caucasian readers will hopefully learn of the pain and suffering of the slaves and gain a deeper compassion for its lingering legacy today. However, I especially recommend Uncle Tom's Cabin to African Americans, for contained in its pages are stories of love, compassion and courage--by both black & white--that will offset the painful legacy of that period caused by the suffering of so many. May the ignorance of the \\"Uncle Tom\\" slander be eradicated from their minds as they read of the courage of this fictitious character--who reminded others of Dr. King himself--and the other characters whose struggles and triumphs are contained in its pages also. I also recommend the books: No Apology Necessary, by Earl Carter, Let's Get to Know Each Other, by Tony Evans, and my own book, which is-- White Man in a Black Man's World (tm), by Richard Vermillion."},{"Title":"Uncle Tom's Cabin (Cliffs Notes)","review":"Even though long before I had a bachelor's degree, let alone did graduate work on Stowe, I was recognized as an authoritative writer on issues of African American politics and history, I used these Cliff notes when I studied Uncle Tom in graduate school.Uncle Tom is designed to be read as the sentimental and womens novel of the mid-19th Century it is were meant to be read, to be read in a torrent, in as close to one sitting, to be read to produce the torrent of emotions that it is meant to unleash. A 46-year-old African American political with long experience in real danger in political struggle, I wept when Uncle Tom died in this book, even though I was reading it for graduate school.Using the cliff notes for this book allows you to read this properly as Stowe meant it to be, as her contemporaries meant it to be read, but to keep up with the details of all the characters and plot devices that literally range all over the United States with implications and discussions going around the globe.I would also urge you to consult Eric J.

That means that the verbs used are likely to be in the form of either the simple present-tense (e.g. runs, paints, fishes, etc.) or participle (e.g. running, painting, fishing, etc).Well, apparently there is no set rule about which to use, but here is an example of what the use of the participle will allow:One of my own (not necessarily good) haiku used as an example:a garden ponddrawing the moon outfrom behind a cloudThe use of drawing allows that it can be read as any of these: \\"a garden pond [is] drawing\\" or \\"...[was] drawing,\\" or even \\"...[will be] drawing.\\"Using the participial form provides the haiku with a versatility or flexibility with regard to the dimension of time.Here's what it would be using the simple present tense form:a garden ponddraws the moon outfrom behind a cloudThe versatility that the participle provided is gone, but it also may be true that this version rings more pleasurably to the ear.Well, anyway he speaks about that in his book and I just appreciated that he addressed that point; no other haiku book that I have ever read had ever done so.(By the way, if you are interested in reading about this particular point for yourself it is to be found starting on page 79 in the \\"Haiku Grammar\\" section.)***In conclusion:The author thoroughly fills you in about haiku's origins, evolution and its future.There are many examples of successful haiku from many of today's practicing haiku poets included with valuable analysis for each.This is a very worthwhile book for becoming acquainted with the haiku verse form and I could find no fault with it.I heartily recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Haiku: A Poet's Guide","review":". . . but anyone serious about writing haiku in English (or any language, if they read English) will find *Haiku: A Poet's Guide* invaluable.

Her granddaughter is a constant helper, getting her through the day.This book is unusual in its first person narrative from the grandmother. A light and heartwarming tale about the love and support between a granddaughter and grandmother, this story broaches the issues of forgetfulness in the narrator's life gently and humorously. (The grandmother goes outside in her pyjamas, or forgets which day to do something.) This light-hearted approach is supported by artist Dee Huxley's soft edged, watercolor pictures that portray such scenes as a house full of notes on every surface reminding the narrator of what to do. (the cat even has a note on its collar saying \\"feed me\\") But the whole issue turns poignant when the narrator can't remember her grandaughter. But she focuses and slowly remembers her--from the girl's birth up to the present, and the granddaughter promises she'll be around to help her remember.This is a wonderful book for dealing with the forgetfulness and senility of of an older grandparent or relative. It may not be as appropriate for children whose grandparent's are suffering from the severe stages of Alzheimer's, as the grandmother is still able to be fairly independent and the humor might feel unrealistic for the situation the child is faced with. I still recommend it highly to parents, but situations will vary for appropriateness.

Written prior to the horrors of Hitler and Stalin, it avoids the hysteric sensationalist view seen in some modern works, but deals primarily with the organization of Inquisition methodology. We learn court proceedings, methods of preaching, and of course extraction of information, not always limited to the rack, stake, or strappado. The fascination lies in the use of false promises, prevarication, even having a Hebrew-speaking inquisitor act like a Rabbi to seek out secret confessions or accusations. The question of the ethical values of such behaviors, in addition to bribes and favors, was apparently debated in the courts, and was not universally accepted, even within the hierarchy of the organization. The rules, the techniques, and the goals are extracted directly from the writings of Torquemada, Eymeric, Gregory IX, and Domingo. What is ironic here is how a good concept - the idea of Christian love and charity - was not only perverted, but the result was convincingly believed to be valid and uplifting. You can see how these tyrants really saw themselves saving the world. It is but a small step to make a comparison with our own hypocrisies, propaganda, and self-deception."},{"Title":"Torquemada and the Spanish inquisition;: A history","review":"This is a very informative book about the Spanish Inquisition.

The Milet books come in many languages.As someone who has been learning Portuguese, this is very helpful in fine tuning vocabulary on some words such as spider and fly, butterfly, as well as in reinforcing words you might already know. In the case of butterfly, borboleta, as an example, bit is helpful to see the picture, see the word in English and see the word in Portuguese. It is a word that you can easily mispronounce.There are about 250 words in this dictionary, which is a pretty gound noun foundation for any language, and it includes common animals, as well as colors and body parts.

At the heart of the narrative is a love triangle between Gid, Johnny and Molly over sixty years. Love is actually the wrong word as selfishness is at the heart of each, but so is heartbreak. And yet, there are tiny moments of grace and redemption, be they ever so slight and then immediately gone. Not an easy book to read by any means, but one that contains some early laughs and deep thoughts about how quickly live moves and how decisions one makes young last a lifetime."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"This early effort by master writer Larry McMurtry is one of his finer works and worth reading by all McMurtry fans and anyone interested in a book of the contemporary West. Using first person, the book captures the essence and the lives of three people including their fears, their joys, their sorrows, and mostly their reactions to the various events that occur. The odd love triangle somehow seems normal and even improves upon their lives.Each person is unique with an individual personality and value system and the love of each other shines forth with a rare kind of emotion that is not easily dismissed. This makes the expansive story seem personal regardless of the extensive time period being covered. As they play out their lives and their disappointments, they somehow retain their optimism through the special relationships that exist and never seem to wane.Humorous situations abound throughout the book and the tender moments are balanced with energy and action. Obviously McMurty's perceptions about people and his experience living in the West find accurate fruition in this marvelous story. Leaving Cheyenne is a special book that allows the reader moments of reflection and admiration of hard work, friendships, and constant love of life and people. While hints of the future Pulitzer prize winning author can be found, at the same time, this book stands alone and does not need comparison to other McMurtry books.Leaving Cheyenne is highly recommended and upon completion will not be forgotten. A wonderful read in all respects. While the ending was necessary, it was also rather...okay, need to avoid a spoiler!"},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"This is pre-Hollywood McMurtry and, I feel, his best. He can make you laugh and cry, but this novel does more.

I read Leaving Cheyenne and am struck by how different my values and lifestlye are compared to just two generations ago in the same geography.This book is such a pleasant and mature read.

If you want a glimpse of growing up on a ranch in Texas west of I-35, this is it."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"This isn't McMurtry's best novel, but if you like his old, pre-\\"Lonesome Dove\\" novels, I think you'll enjoy it. For that matter, if you've never read a McMurtry novel but enjoy sad, touching tales, this one is for you.The novel follows the life of three characters--Gid, Johnny, and Molly. It starts in the twenties with the two boys, who are best friends, each trying to earn Molly's love. The novel end over 40 years later when all three are old and gray.An interesting thing about the book is the way that McMurtry chose to tell the story. The first half, when the characters are young, is told by Gid. The last half of the book is divided into two parts. The first part is told from Molly's point of view, and the characters are in their forties. The last part is told by Johnny when the characters are in their sixities. It's a different way to approach a story and it works well. In each of the books three parts, something significant happens in the lives of the characters that alters their relationship with one another.McMurtry's story-telling technique isn't as strong as in some of his other novels. There are portions that are a little slow and drawn out, and there are times that the characters aren't defined well enough. But, overall, it's a good read. It's still a very emotional tale and anyone would be moved by the story, which takes a good look at the mistakes we make in our youth and how nobody gets a second chance to make things right."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"Although McMurtry has written a monumental Pulitzer winner (Lonesome Dove) and an abysmal piece of trash (Texasville), I think this often overlooked little novel is his warmest.

GET IT!"},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"I have read all of McMurtry's novels and have enjoyed them all, but Leaving Cheyenne is one of my favorites.

It's hard to imagine a book less interesting than \\"Texasville.\\" \\"Lonesome Dove,\\" while a fine epic read, will never be seriously confused with great literature. But \\"Leaving Cheyenne,\\" modest and overlooked as it is, is an exceptionally deft and compelling story, containing, in Molly, one of the great female characters in 20th century American fiction."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"This is a story about enduring love and friendship. Gid, Johnny, and Molly are characters that you get attached to. Their tenderness for eachother is sure to touch most readers. The book also beautifully portrays how each of the three characters age. This is the first McMurty book I've ever read, now I must read all of them. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"To readers of this space it is no surprise that I am reviewing a Larry McMurtry novel. I have \\"discovered\\" this little Texas gem of an author recently (although I knew of him and some of his work earlier). Naturally, once I get \\"high\\" on an author I tend to read everything that I can get my hands on. A partial reason for that is that the number of fiction writers who hold my attention is rather limited, but mainly I like to see the high and low sides of the writer's career so that I can revel in the reflected glory of my very good choice in picking the author to comment on. I also tend to read an author's output as I lay my hands on his or her work rather than any particular order. Thus, at present I am reviewing this late work (2004) and an early work Leaving Cheyenne (1962) at the same time. Loop Group definitely suffers in comparison to that earlier work.If I tried to put my finger on what is the outstanding attribute of a good Larry McMurtry read that would most probably be that he is a thoughtful and credible storyteller. The structure of such a story permits one to sift through life's issues whether it is the vagaries of coming of age, the trauma of a mid-life crisis or the grimness of the struggle against mortality. This, moreover, has nothing to with locale or occupation. As a die-hard older urban Northerner Western stories, modern or from the Old West, would not usually be my natural choice of reading. However, when McMurtry is in his \\"high\\" story telling mode and he develops incidents that are believable and has characters do things that seem within the realm of human experience -and that permit one to care about and reflect upon the fates of the characters if only for the length of the story- then he is a premier American writer. That, fortunately, is the case here. Here we have \\"high\\" McMurtry. Why?There are many ways to tell a love story. There are many ways to conceive of a love triangle, as here with the saga of the lives of Gid, Johnny and Molly out in West Texas, just East of Eden in Thalia by McMurtry's lights, in roughly the middle third of the 20th century. There are many ways to put obstacles in the way of a satisfactory resolution of a love triangle in puritanically-driven America. McMurtry has come up with a very innovative method of doing this. In the first section we get the all the tensions of young love, hindered by a father-inspired driven sense of responsibility, as told by Gid. In the second section we get the mixed fruits of that puritan sense of responsibility on Gid's part, the lack of it on Johnny's part and also of girlish indecision as told by Molly, with the proviso that as she tells her tale she is a mother who has lost two sons to war and paid a pretty high price for that earlier indecision. In the final segment we get the inevitable struggle against the vicissitudes of mortality, as told humorously and with a little pathos by Johnny.This is nicely done and the individual stories are woven together almost seamlessly so that the first event concerning Gid's and Johnny's rivalry for Molly described by Gid in Chapter One gets a very different look as told by Johnny at the end forty years later. Moreover, with some other nice humorous touches added alone the way concerning some of the minor characters like Molly's father and an old goat herder, including animals, as well as exploration of the necessary hardships of running a ranch, a labor-intensive business operation subject to all the randomness of nature. But, better than that we are given an emotional roller coaster ride as these three West Texas characters try to make sense of life, their previous histories and their entanglements together. If Loop Group was a low in the literary marathon McMurtry is running then Leaving Cheyenne is prima facie evidence for his honored place in the American literary pantheon.

The book is told by three friends who have been good friends forever. The time begins in the early 1920s and ends in possibly late 1960s or early 1970s. Gid begins the tale by telling of the three buddies youth. Gid was brought up by his father, a hard working man of his word and he expected Gib to be the same. The reader learns more about Gid and his feelings and his friendships than that of the other two. He has the longest part in the book. Gid loves Molly. So does Johnny. Gid wants to marry her. No says the fair lady. She doesn't feel the same way about Gid as he feels for her. But Gid is her favorite she always says. Gid and Johnny share her between them, her good cooking and her bed. Johnny is full of fun, never takes life or himself seriously. Molly has a mean old father who she will not let anyone speak against. She marries Eddie, a loser. Nobody knows why not even Molly. Gid loved her so much, Johnny was not the marrying type. Out of disappointment Gid marries Millie, a girl from a white trash family. She only marries him and she would have married anyone to get away from that family. Upon the marriage she takes notions of herself, becomes uppity and feels Gid is beneath her. Hard working Gid becomes wealthy.Now to Molly. Her tale begins in middle age. Eddie was killed and buried in his native Oklahoma. His girlfriend came to the funeral and taunted Molly about how much Eddie loved her. Molly had two sons, one from Gid, the other Johnny's. Both boys enlisted in World War II and both were killed, one in Europe, the other in the Pacific. She had none from Eddie. He didn't want kids. Molly keeps her home and keeps on cooking good meals for Gid and Johnny plus sharing her bed with them. She has never gone very far from her home. A local girl. She tells of the sex education of her and her brother from her mean old father. She has had a rough life and depends on the friendship of these two men. She never had nor wanted women friends.Then Johnny ends the tale. The three are old but Johnny has never changed. He is still full of fun and jokes and laughs. He has still never married, never settled down, works for Gid. He retains his youthfulness, an elderly Peter Pan with no ties to either land or family. Both Molly and Gid made lousy marriages. A fun read.The book is written in the way uneducated country people talk."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"These characters were at least engaging enough for me to finish the book. The first McMurtry I'd read in many years was \\"Duane's Depressed\\" and I loved it. Totally engaging. So I tried this as a follow-up and it's not as good but worth a read."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"I read this book some years ago and I was very impressed. I enjoyed just about all of Larry McMurtry's early (pre-Lonesome Dove) works. Indeed, I felt that his three greatest works were &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, and &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot;. After &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot;, I think McMurtry lost a lot of his sense of reality as a writer. In &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot;, McMurtry tells a common enough love triangle story but in a most unique method. The three characters tell their story from their perspective which, I'm sure, has been done before and probably with greater effect. However, what makes this book special and all the more enjoyable is that each perspective is given from a different point in time. Thus we have the serious young man's perspective, the pragmatic middle aged woman's perspective, and, finally, the fun-loving old geeser's perspective. Bear in mind that these three characters are all essentially the same age but looking at their lives together from a different point of maturity. It works, too. With the serious young man we sense the cold, calculated mistakes of a driven youth. With the pragmatic middle aged woman we see the acceptance that not everything works out the way you would want them to. With the fun-loving old geeser, we see that life is not judged by past mistakes; it's judged by how much fun you're having right now.I noted some very negative reviews on this book. To each his own. However, it is a short read and I think you may get the same impression I did. It's worth a try."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"Larry McMurtry grew up among ranchers and cowboys, and his familiarity with this rural world makes his early novels set in and around Thalia, Texas, genuinely alive with rich detail and believable characters. He knows this world as it's seen and understood by the people who live there, both young and old. Most revealingly (and colorfully) he knows how they really talk to each other and to themselves -- not in the stereotypical ways often ascribed to country people.You read &quot;Leaving Cheyenne&quot; slowly (the reference is to an old cowboy ballad, not the town in Wyoming), savoring the re-creation of real times and places, even when the story itself may move with no great urgency. The insights into characters and the observance of their behavior make them come alive on the page, and you simply enjoy the portrayals of them, their values, beliefs, and experiences.Part I of this novel is told from the point of view of Gideon, a rancher's son, about 20 years old, around the year 1920. There is his friend Johnny, from a neighboring ranch, and the two of them compete for the affection of Molly, a barefoot, independent-minded girl who willfully and unwisely marries another boy, an oilfield roustabout.In Part II, it is 20 years later, during WWII, and Molly, now widowed, remains friends with the middle-aged Gideon and Johnny, each of whom happens to have fathered one of her two sons. This part is told from her point of view. Gideon has married another woman (also unwisely) and has become a prosperous rancher, while Johnny works for him, content to be a happy-go-lucky cowboy. Molly lives alone, her sons off to war, and yearns for the company of each of her two old friends and lovers.In Part III, it is again 20 years later, about 1960 (the novel was published in 1962), and the three characters are now much older. Told from the point of view of Johnny, this section is farcically comical. Meanwhile, Gideon is haunted with guilt for his infidelities with Molly, and Johnny, as he says, has never lost a night's sleep feeling shame for anything he's ever done.Written in 20-year jumps, the novel gives a sense of how quickly life passes and how people remain the adolescents they once were even as they age. We see that choices made in haste cannot be undone and can leave a life-long legacy of regret. Yet there is also solace in affection, loyalty, and tenderness of heart. The novel celebrates the special quality of friendship among friends who have lived their whole lives together in the same small rural community. And over the years, there is the land -- and working the land -- to ground their rural lives with purpose.I recommend this novel, along with the author's &quot;Horseman, Pass By,&quot; to anyone with an interest in cowboys and ranching. McMurtry captures rural western life and character in rich detail."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"Perhaps one of the least known(popular)but greatest works from McMurtry.

McMurtry treads where writers fear to go, always creating unique characters to unveil the complexities of the human condition. I couldn't help but fall in love with these three personalities. You have to read this book to believe it. McMurtry (along with Dos Passos) is in my opinion the greatest American writer. May he continue to bless us with his effortlessly flowing narratives.

I just finished reading Texasville prior to starting Leaving Cheyenne. I was expecting more after reading Texasville. The book was written in the manner that an uneducated early Texas settler might speak, thus making it hard at times to understand. The story is told in three intervals with each character contributing his/her point of view. Too much emphasis was put on Gid (the main character) to leave so abruptly and shift to the thoughts of the other characters. And their parts were too short in comparison to Gid's. The characters have potential and the book worked off of a similar plot, I thought, to The Man Who Rode Midnight by Elmer Kelton.

But in a bizzare plot twist, one turns around after a few weeks and believe it or not, returns home and has some more sex with the lonely lady. The fact that none of the characters has much more to say than &quot;I sure missed Gid,&quot; or &quot;I really loved Molly,&quot; really keeps you flipping those pages.

This novel is reminiscent of these great novels (all are set in Thalia, Texas), but falls short. As usual, McMurtry depicts quite flawlessly the atmosphere of growing up in Texas. The main character of Gideon is multi-dimensional and intriguing, but Molly and Johnny remain enigmas. That situation makes for a long read, especially once the main point of view shifts away from Gideon in the later half of the book. At this early point in his career, McMurtry also did not seem to understand women - seeming to view them as existing primarily to tease and please men. The story gains momentum and the characters become richer as it prgresses, but by that point, I was just wanting to get through the book."},{"Title":"Leaving Cheyenne.","review":"I don't know how a talented writer like Larry McMurtry managed it, but somehow this short novel reads like one of the longest books I've ever read.

Let me put it like this: I am currently undergoing physical therapy that, among other things, requires me to sit still for 30 minutes at a time, 2-3 times per day, and this book is so dull (yet annoying) that I found staring into space more satisfying than reading, and normally I'd rather read than eat.

The three narrators, whose lives span the period between the late 1800s and the mid-to-late 1900s, seem to expend effort and achieve little for their daily struggles. Conscientious Gideon Fry, married to Mabel, extends his beloved Texas ranch, increasing its acreage through years of work. Best friend Johnny McCloud, carefree cowboy, earns his living in others' employ but also holds on to his nearby tiny plot. Shared lover, Molly Taylor, tends her adjoining hardscrabble farm faithfully. Although married to Eddie White, she gives birth to two boys, one by Gideon and one by Johnny, both sons later killed in World War II military service. When Eddie accidentally falls to his death from an oil derrick, Molly continues her relationships with Gid and Johnny and her solitary dedication to her lifelong home. They all are overcome by changes in technology and transportation, leaving behind their beloved Texas land which is unlikely to be similarly respected and cultivated by others."},{"Title":"Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing","review":"This is a great text that I use when teaching the English Ed class for teachers who will be teaching rhet/comp, either as dual credit or at a community college.

It contains a wealth of useful guidelines for establishing and managing processes to support development of products that are based on embedded software or hardware/software integration, The core of this book is a collection of templates that were developed and proven in the DoD industry, and are designed to manage integrated testing, failure management and field feedback. Each element is applicable to commercial environments, especially for companies that are manufacturing intelligent network devices, data storage systems and specialty products such as digital control systems, sensors and other integrated hardware/software products.The templates are introduced in Chapter 1, and each of the seven functional areas covered by the templates are discussed in separate chapters. These functional areas are: integrated testing, failure reporting, design limits, product life, test/analyze/fix process, uniform test reporting and field feedback. A chapter on applying these follows, but the material is slanted towards DoD issues. If you apply thought and imagination while reading this chapter you should get ideas on how to refactor the cases into your own environment.Section 2 devotes three chapters to software design and test, which are based on the older waterfall development life cycle. However, this particular life cycle lends itself well to developing embedded systems, making this material valid and applicable to commercial environments.Overall, this is a useful book for the intended audience I cited above if you can track down a copy. In particular, the checklists and overall framework are valuable, and much can be learned from the risk-based approach taken in the book."},{"Title":"Medical Terminology With Human Anatomy","review":"This was the required text for my second subject in Medical Transcription. It was very good and detailed enough for the beginning transcriptionist to understand where everything is, and to familiarize yourself with more medical terminology. This one seems to assume you already have a beginning foundation in basic medical terminology and how to form medical words using word parts, combining forms, suffixes, and prefixes. I say this because the first chapter immediately launches into a LOT of these word parts with very little discussion on what they are, how to do them, etc. The book has a detailed glossary of medical words, though, and it has these little cardboard cutouts that look like miniature index cards (flash cards) that will aid you in memorizing basic word parts. The book has very long and detailed exercises at the end of each chapter that builds on what you have already learned and strengthens your medical terminology foundation. It also comes with a CD-ROM that has exercises relevant to each chapter. WHen you complete a chapter exercise, the software evaluates your performance and tells you where your mistakes are, then prints out a study plan for you where you can bone up and read about your mistakes. An over-all good book!"},{"Title":"Medical Terminology With Human Anatomy","review":"This is a great book. It has everything you will need to learn medical terminology and anatomy.

The book is part of a planned four-volume series that looks at the role of third parties in American history. Richardson's research is outstanding and very detailed. He not only provides biographical thumbnail sketches of persons of interest to breathe life into these forgotten heroes of elections past, but illustrates how some of the early third-party movements routinely fielded tickets headed by men of stature and substance, including ex-governors, congressmen, diplomats, and even former Presidents (i.e., Free Soiler Martin Van Buren in 1848 and the Know-Nothing Party's Millard Fillmore in 1856). In this first volume, he thoroughly re-examines these parties and key players from our country's beginning to the mid 1880s, culminating in the demise of the Greenback-Labor Party.Where I had already thought that I knew quite a bit about the early American parties (the Federalists, Democratic-Republicans, the Whigs, the Know Nothings, the Free Soilers), Richardson not only expands my existing knowledge but also introduces the forgotten parties of the earlier periods, including the Anti-Masonic Party (anti-secret society), the Liberty Party (anti-slavery), and the Prohibitionists (teetotalers). He clearly has his hand on the political pulse of early America and writes in a guiding narrative that leaves the impression that he himself was there at these pivotal points in American history; at the early political conventions with all their intrigue and deal making; reporting the newspaper headlines and pamphlets of the period; the behind-the-scenes politicking between the candidates, the party bosses and assorted movers-and-shakers. Unlike some in academia, Richardson makes no attempt to force his own interpretation of events on the reader, but merely reminds his audience of the impact third parties had on the nation's political development.All in all, Richardson has written a wonderful book that is insightful, informative and a terrific read. He brings to light the lives and dreams of so many forward-thinking Americans who, for the most part, have been overlooked by other historians. I look forward to his subsequent volumes so that I can expand my knowledge on the third parties of the 20th century. I can see where this book will be a reference for anyone looking to examine the role third party politics have played, especially during some of the more volatile periods in our nation's history."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Student's Book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"I just received the paper back book, the CD dosen't include the Clear Listening Test part. It is hard to judge the whole book since I haven't studied yet."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Student's Book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"As an experienced language teacher and DOS at a language school, we have designed a short course around this book. Providing one keeps sound understanding of what language is made up of and what sound language teaching sonsists of. The Clear Speech book is extememly useful, fun, and interesting to both the learner and the teacher. Informed language teachers realise that language is not infact just about discreet points of aspects about language i.e. it is about successful communication and involves all the skills including socio-linguisitic as well as purely linguistic features. We know these days that language needs to be approched with an ecclectic perspective and the learners' needs foremost as part of the program. Part of any program should include pronunciation, so long as it is in balance. This book focuses on the wider influences surrounding pronunciation which affect overall fluency and language proficiency, for example, stress, intonation, timimg, rythum, syllable-length, patterning, listening. Most importantly, I would argue that it is a very soundly designed book usefull for serious language teachers which will help develop a monitoring system into the learners' language useage, thus influencing significantly their fluency. In this context, the exercises are very beneficial. They are not so focused as to ignore or take the place of the wider needs and other macro skills that need more attention overall such as general conversation etc, but offers a user friendly and relative set of exercises in a format that has continuity if desired or can be utilised in a selective supplimentary tool. I wuold say that it is a book that is preferrably teacher-taught to be truly effective."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Student's Book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"Doesn't really cover material not covered in more basic books like Murcia.

Too many rules in books conflict with standard rules we learn all along. They may be correct, but obviously confuse people who are not native speakers.

I was surprised at what the book really focuses on, and I have found it to be quite helpful. THE GOOD: 1) This book is different from other pronunciation books in that it only spends part of the time focusing on the sounds of English letters. Rather, it is organized into chapters based on other features of English, such as rhythm, linking, syllable length, stress, intonation and reduction. This is a wonderful &quot;next step&quot; for students who have had adequate practice with the sounds of English letters, but still have an accent. 2) It provides practice exercises that allow the student to practice more than one thing at a time. For example, one exercise allows the student to practice linking words while practicing the &quot;sh&quot; sound. 3) I think that the most valuable part of this book is the Clear Listening and Clear Speaking test at the beginning of the book. These allow teachers to get very specific responses from students, and then focus on the problem areas. THE BAD: While the book is great at helping students practice consonant sounds, it doesn't give much practice or help with vowel sounds. This is really my only complaint with this otherwise wonderful book. OVERALL: A great book that will help students fine tune their English speech. I recommend it for high-intermediate or advanced students. If students are looking for a good way to reduce their accents, or make themselves more understood by Americans, or even understand North American English better themselves then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Student's Book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"Clear Speech is a well-conceived pronunciation text that, in my experience, students have found very pleasant to use. It covers individual sounds, as well as speech rhythm and intonation, in a very fluid way. It can help instructors teach ESL students to pronounce well not only word by word, but also to arrive at more natural-sounding sentence flow. I have found that the exercises in the book benefit students beyond their own pronunciation, and actually help them to understand native English speakers better. The third edition is a vast improvement over the previous one, because it guides students in deciphering English spelling and provides more practice in specific, troublesome sounds. The new edition also includes a practice CD, which is something many students using the second edition often wished for. The graphic simplicity of the book is a huge advantage over other pronunciation texts available. All in all, I think Clear Speech is one of the best - if not THE best - choice for teaching pronunciation."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Student's Book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"I split this book to create a 2-level pronunciation course for lower intermediate and higher students in Japan. The courses were extremely well received time and time again. The book is an excellent guide for such classes.I rated the book at 5-stars on its own merit. However, together with the audio cassettes I would have given it four and a half stars, as I believe the audio component needs to be available on CD for cueing purposes and ease of use.Teachers who have training in teaching pronunciation will probably be delighted with the book. Instructors trying to use the book without the benefit of training in teaching pronunciation may not have the background to utilize it fully.Rather than use the tapes an instructor can easily use their own pronunciation to model the lesson targets. This allows for easy adjustments of the speed, timing and rhythm of the exercises for different class groups.Students can practice the targets as a group, and then individually during the listen and repeat sections. The students generally loved the excellent pair work that followed, which allowed them to further practice and master to some degree what they had covered.As much as it is a pronunciation course, listening skills are an equally strong component. Again, the pair work was excellent in ensuring each student strove to achieve the listening and production targets.This book allowed mixed levels of students to work together harmoniously, challenge themselves in a very enjoyable and insightful way, and achieve real gains in their struggles to produce and understand spoken English. Students liked the limericks.I agree with the other reviewer who stated the diagnostic test with the book is an extremely useful tool.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Student's Book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"Although I find the second edition useable with students, in my opinion, it was written for the trainers. I used the first edition with far more student successes because each chapter was built on the preceeding ones and stuck to the basics. In contrast, the second edition is TOO full of the many intonation elements all jammed and crammed into each chapter. Frankly, I was hoping that the second edition would give us more practice examples to solidify the the basic intonation elements people need and most can absorb. Instead,by comparison to the first edition, the book is overfilled with way too much &quot;stuff&quot;. Still, it's the best book on the market in it's class and I would highly recommend it to the trainers. I believe most students will have difficulty sorting out and dealing with the &quot;details&quot; in each chapter on their own. On the other hand, because of this jammed text, it is easily used for both intermediate to advanced level students ... you can get more bang for the buck."},{"Title":"Clear Speech Student's Book: Pronunciation and Listening Comprehension in American English","review":"This is one of the rare pronunciation textbooks that focus on helping speakers of English as a Second Language understand the way American English sounds when spoken in context, not just the way individual words are pronounced in isolation.

Her approach is refreshingly honest, stressing the most useful elements of pronunciation--those which are tied to listening. It frees the teacher and student from unnecessarily complex pedagogy.

Hope it helps.First Published in August 1935 - 250 pagesPersonally, never liked this one very much. Johns had a bit of an anti-chinese for some reason / anti-japanese as well, but given the period he was writing in, I guess it's understandable. As an author, he did tend to reflect the societal attitudes fairly closely, and he did move with the times. That said, this isn't one of my favorite Biggles books.Whilst celebrating Ginger's award of his pilot's licence, an SOS on B.B.C. radio asks for Major James Bigglesworth to contact his Uncle, Professor Richard Bigglesworth. This is of course, Dickpa, previously seen in the story 'The Cruise of the Condor'. Visiting Dickpa at his house, they find him and his friend Lord Roger Maltenham, under attack from mysterious enemies. Both Dickpa and Maltenham have returned from the heart of Western China on the borders by Tibet and have a strange tale to tell. Maltenham agrees to finance an expedition back to the borders of Tibet in search of the so-called 'Mountain of Light'. Buying a Gannet amphibian and naming it the Explorer, Biggles, Algy, Ginger, Dickpa and 'Malty' fly to Tibet.On their first night, they are able to see a shining blue mountain, the effect being caused by the tremendous quantity of radium in the mountain. Attempts to approach the mountain are initially thwarted by a strange paralysing effect and giant man-eating centipedes. However, the rescue of a Scotsman called Angus McAllister gives our heroes vital information. A strange race of Chinamen called the Chungs has been holding McAllister captive. The radium in the mountain has given the Chungs weird powers, including the ability to make themselves invisible! McAllister was the Chief Engineer on a ship, captured and forced to work for the Chungs. The Chungs have the ability to use a bizarre blue ray that has a paralysing effect. However, there is an insulating fluid, which can be used to ward off its effects.The Chungs plan to invade the world from the Mountain of Light, which is their power base. The Chungs attack Biggles and the others by blue rays at their aircraft from a nearby plateau. Biggles and Ginger make a desperate journey to attack the Chungs and prevent this continuing. The Chungs then attack the aircraft in force and capture Dickpa, Malty and McAllister. Algy manages to escape and join Biggles and Ginger. Meanwhile Biggles has taken a hostage, a Chung called Prince Sing Hi and he is able to exchange the Prince for Dickpa, Malty and McAllister. An expedition to get some radium from the Mountain of Light sees Biggles falling into a network of tunnels, which honeycomb the Mountain. Biggles comes up with an idea to flood the gorge where the Chungs have their City and he is able to breach their dam resulting in a deluge of water. Back in England, the small amount of radium they recovered is found to be worth 250,000 and Malty gives Biggles the Explorer and agrees to finance his next trip."},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"This is a very important work on a difficult subject. Gyana Yoga is the path of attaining the Absolute through the use of right knowledge, that is, through constant discrimination between the true and the false. Learning to recognize what is true can be a difficult path, and there are many philosophical quandaries along this road.But Swami Vivekananda with his powerful oratory and use of his vast knowledge lays bare the basic principles of Gyana. In this book, he shows that Gyana is not a doctrinal path but something that can be reached through reasoning. This is one of the greatest expositions on the beliefs of Advaita Vedanta, specially since it is done not through technical terms but through a direct appeal to logic and reason. The path of Gyana Yoga through this book becomes a path of spirituality that is accessible to those who would not like to abandon science and reason for religion.----- P. J. Mazumdar, author of \\"The Circle of Fire\\""},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"Swami Vivekananda's Jnana-Yoga is a sublime work. Rather than a volume filled with numerous Sanskrit terms and modes of thought which are difficult to follow, as most works of this nature are, the swami speaks directly from his heart to yours and the end result is a compilation of straightforward lectures than instantly transmit wisdom that can be immediately applied. This book was immediately placed upon my shelf of Vedanta favorites. Great for those well studied and practiced to those just beginning their search into this lovely mode of religious thought."},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"Lectures of Vivekananda.

Jnana Yoga is the method of 'realizing' religion or God through knowledge and discussion. The other methods are Karma(work), Bhakti(devotion) and Raja(mind) and everybody should select a method according to his/her interests/capabilities. Jnana Yoga presents an extremely logical and intellectually satisfying view of God and religion. Vivekanand has been quite impressive, his style very 'scientific' and language : simple and superb. Must read for people with an inquisitional bent of mind. I especially recommend the chapter called &quot;Atma&quot;."},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"This book if anyone was to read it is amazing and I find it difficult to find words of praise that could do it justice. Therefore the best thing would be to read it. Some one said that this 'does not appeal to the modern mind' This is certainly proof that the person has not read the book or read it with closed eyes, what a pity! Vivekananda blends ancient hindu texts, into modern thought and also weaves into his work modern scintific thought into the ever so ancient wisdom of India. Whosoever reads this book is bound to become transformed, trasfigured and awakened to higher truths in this universe. This rare crest-jewel of a book has come from a great soul, and I feel blessed and thrilled to have come accross this precious gem."},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"Though Jnana yoga is presumably the favorite subject of Vivekananda, he himself is supposed to have quoted that his bhakti is covered by a cloak of jnana, while his guru's (Sri Ramakrishna) jnana is covered by a cloak of bhakti. Whatever he may have learnt from Ramakrishna, who spoke in parables, Vivekananda transforms them into powerful words with striking sentences to give a sublime meaning. He is at his best while expounding the Vedanta philosophy.His examples simplify the understanding of such a complex and profound philosophy. The way he coins the words and grammar in his lectures is unbelievable. His logic is almost always unarguable. One of the best lectures is &quot;The Real and Apparent Man&quot; where he lays a solid foundation of the nature of man, the support of which comes in later lectures on Maya and Cosmos . The exposition of Katha upanishad is beautiful and one does not get that picture and depth of understanding while reading the original upanishad. The final lectures delivered in Pasadena, California appeals to the unity of religions and friendship with science - a subject which is probably never more important than now.No wonder during his lectures in America, he was the last to deliver, as the audience would wait patiently to listen to him."},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"Swami Vivekananda, a major (if not the main) disciple of the famous Ramakrishna, has done both Hinduism and comparative religion a great service by writing several works that address the main types of transformational yoga. Interestingly, Hinduism has constructed a wonderful model that differentiates among and between these seemingly divergent paths up the spiritual mountain (or paths to God for Theists). These include: Karma Yoga (addressing action) and Bhakti Yoga (of devotion) included in one volume; Raja Yoga (of mind, but addressing more psychic development); and Jnana Yoga (of wisdom). The latter is more difficult, IMHO, to find out about. Religions generally specialize in one of these four with additional elements (sometimes only in subsets such as clerics or monks) from some of the other ones. Jnana or Gnani appears to be among the rarest. Thus, having read this book is a great coup in understanding the higher philosophies and theological approaches to Omneity or spiritual development. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, it would be applicable to Dzogchen and Mahamudra as opposed to the more normal or pervasive Vajrayana practices. IMHO, Jnana (and its equivalents in other religions) is the most profound of teachings. Vivekananda was obviously a Master and has presented a wonderful exposition on this esoteric subject. We are privileged to have the opportunity to read and study it."},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"swami vivekananda is/was one of the giant intellects of all time. a direct disciple of the great 19th century indian god-man, sri ramakrishna, vivekananda learned his lessons well at an early age and built upon it to the point of sometimes surpassing his master. especially in the sense of providing a bridge from the worlds oldest extant religious traditions to plain spoken accessability for the spiritual seeker of our own time. jnana yoga is the approach of experiencing oneness with God using the path of knowledge/philosophy/contemplation. this book is among the very best in laying out the methods and ideas the aspirant can use for his own search [ thru the path of knowledge ] of direct experience of God, i.e. being-conciousness-bliss absolute. the book carefully and clearly leads us thru our most primitive lowest levels of humanity up the ladder of understanding spiritually we are truly One with the highest of all realities. that indeed, \\"thou art that\\". \\"what frightens you? what holds you down? only ignorance and delusion; nothing else can bind you. you are the Pure One, the Ever Blessed...he who knows this and models his life accordingly will no longer grovel in darkness.\\" the good swami's writings on all the yoga paths are among the best the world has yet seen. this particular volume is a must read for the student practitioner of jnani yoga. if i could spend an hour having a cup of tea with any person who ever lived, swami vivekananda might well be the one i would choose. not only for his giant intellect but his purity and holiness and breadth of understanding man's need for transcendence and the ways of actually doing so. this is a great book for anyone looking for the true innermost Self."},{"Title":"Jnana-yoga","review":"For those who reject standard religious dogma but still recognize the certain spirituality of mankind, this book is for you.

It contradicts the commonly held belief that there is some Superuser sitting up in the sky, running the whole Universe. It explains how that is false. It preaches nothing.

What had started out as a humid but quiet day in late spring turned quickly into one of the worst tornado outbreaks ever recorded in this nation. Very few people expected it, or even knew what to do when it hit. There was warning by weather forecasters--though not much--but most people refused to heed it anyway. The results were mass casualties and devastation.In this suspenseful non-fiction thriller, John G. Fuller (author of The Ghost Of Flight 401) keeps the disaster story-lover on-edge for most of the book, as he describes--in well-researched detail--the way events unfolded for both weather watchers and citizens alike on that day. Fuller even takes the reader into the lives of some of those affected and makes one feel as if (s)he, too, is present in the area for which the National Severe Storms Forecast Center has just issued Tornado Watch #211.Aspiring news writers should read this book to see how cataclysmic events should be covered (but frequently are not). Anyone who is a meteorologist, weather watcher, fire chief, civil defense director, or concerned citizen should want this book for his/her personal library."},{"Title":"Tornado Watch Number 211","review":"This is a must-read book if you have any interest in tornadoes. It is a gripping tale of small town America against the unforseen fury of one of the largest tornado outbreaks in the world. You don't just get facts - you get behind-the-scenes work on what meteorologists do to predict and forewarn for severe weather outbreaks. You are taken, step by step, through the history of these fantastic forces of nature, from the earliest signs of unstable air to the advent of the outbreak to the in-house experience to the grief and cleanup."},{"Title":"Tornado Watch Number 211","review":"This is truely the best tornado book I ever read. I lived not far from several of where these tornadoes struck. An F4 tornado just passed south of my hometown, Warren PA, and struck Tionesta and Northern Forest County, killing 7.

This book repeated some of the other schools of though about curing hypertension naturally, but also shared Dr. Braverman's natural supplementation that he uses at his clinic. I took this book to my Internist who is familiar with my struggle to control my hypertension, and I asked her to read the book and come up with a supplementation protocol for me. My doctor reported that she enjoyed the book as it had reminded her of some of the nutrition themes she had learned in medical school. We worked together on a supplementation for my treatment of hypertension. I wish I could afford to go to Dr. Braverman's clinic in New York, but until then I will follow the guidelines on eating, exercise and natural supplementation in this book. I have not yet weaned myself off of hypertension medication, but I have been able to resist adding more medication, which does not make me better, but only more dependent on chemicals to cure disease."},{"Title":"The Amazing Way to Reverse Heart Disease Naturally: Beyond the Hypertension Hype: Why Drugs Are Not the Answer","review":"&#65279;What a wonderful idea Dr. Braverman promises - \\"REVERSE HEART DISEASE, Naturally\\" with his \\"30- to 90-Day No-More hypertension and Heart Disease Program\\" in 198 pages.

Safflower oil is an omega-6 which is harmful to the body. Some people use safflower oil to maintain or increase weight when they are very ill. You should not take it either if you are allergic to eggs or soybean oil, have had kidney disease or diabetes, are, or plan to become, pregnant, or are breastfeeding. I'm not sure if the book states this. I am writing this review only because I saw the use of safflower oil in the recipes listed in \\"look inside this book,\\" which completely put me off from purchasing it. There are also other side effects of safflower oil, per the website, the dangers of safflower oil [...], like vomiting, chills, fever and shivering when used in higher amounts. They list other adverse reactions such as hyperlipemia, dyspnea, cyanosis, flushing, dizziness, headache, sleepiness, nausea, hyperthermia, sweating, chest and back pain, thrombocytopenia, hypercoagulability and transient increases in liver enzymes, so how could this oil be at all beneficial in heart disease? However, I did read on other websites that if you use it as part of a balanced diet, key is balanced with more omega 3's, then it does not have any side effects. However, having an excess of omega-6 EFAs in your diet is now being linked to greater incidence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and non-insulin dependent diabetes. Safflower oil is full of omega6-EFAs and perhaps that is why it says consult your physician after the asterisk next to safflower oil. I don't know why they would not promote more heart healthy oils like Extra Virgin Olive Oil or Canola Oil (maybe it is noted in the book). Maybe you can substitute oils. I just wanted to make people aware of this before purchasing. I am glad they had the recipes in the preview of the book, otherwise I would have purchased it and been very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Amazing Way to Reverse Heart Disease Naturally: Beyond the Hypertension Hype: Why Drugs Are Not the Answer","review":"This is a very good book on how to take care of your heart.

It's about so much more than broccoli, and I've learned a great deal about putting flavor into healthy food (a skill which doesn't come naturally to me). The authors (a mother and daughter team) are very amusing and informative, and a novice like me would actually feel comfortable cooking with them, rather than feeling intimidated. I would recommend this book to anyone who's not already an accomplished cook or chef ; I'm inspired to go buy a R&ouml;mertopf (clay pot) and cook up a feast this weekend.

Still, I have volume III as well as this one on my shelf for reference. For it's time in 1982, this book was very useful, and now commands a rather hefty price if you would wish to obtain one.

One idea was to support Saddam Hussein in any misadventure he happened to choose. Another was to impose some sanctions on Iraq.In effect, Saddam Hussein decided to keep food from Iraqi children and blame any resulting problems on sanctions. That's a crime! But in this petition, Boyle allied himself with Saddam Hussein by blaming those who imposed the sanctions.That says something about Boyle.If Boyle had truly been opposed to a war with Saddam Hussein, I think it would have made more sense for him to argue in favor of sanctions. And if he had truly cared about the children of Iraq, it would have made more sense for him to argue in favor of removing Saddam Hussein from power, given that Saddam Hussein was the one responsible for many of their problems."},{"Title":"My Fun With Learning","review":"Bought this for my 7 and 4 year old grandchildren.

But it's his willingness to expose just about all that can be noted by the modern traveler (even sites on private property, though he is careful about warning against trespassing) that makes this guide book so valuable. This is the Second edition, published in 1986 after a careful note-taking retracing of the trail in 1985; probably a new edition is needed to update further changes made during the last 20 years (if it hasn't been done already). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers","review":"Marc Simmons is the pre-eminent author on Santa Fe Trail lore and this updated version of his &quot;Following the Trail&quot; is better than ever! He has captured those significant, visible elements of the SFT that make it impossible to follow the Trail without this book. The pictures and maps are explicit and easy to follow. His stories and anecdotes bring the Trail to life.If you're an SFT buff be sure to also read his book: &quot;The Old Santa Fe Trail&quot;, a collection of essays; and his new book: &quot;Spanish Pathways&quot; on the history of Hispanic New Mexico.Jim Ryan"},{"Title":"Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers","review":"Don't count on AAA or Fodor's to guide you to the wagon wheel ruts, remnants of watering wholes, or Indian ambush points along the Santa Fe Trail. On one had I was pleased to see that the noted Santa Fe Trail historian had put together a guide to the location of the remnants of the trail. Unfortunately I found details lacking, particularly when it came to local observances and current road and off-road access to the location. I was particularly disappointed by the lack of detail for the Raton, NM area of the trail."},{"Title":"Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers","review":"I recently followed the trail from St. Louis to Santa Fe on a trip west. I purchased this book at a museum about half way through the trip in Kansas and found it to be extremely helpful in tracing the trail's route--much better than just relying on maps and random historical markers in towns along the way. It has maps, photos, detailed directions to trail sites, and historical anecdotes. While it isn't perfect (it is now ten years old), you would be hard-pressed to find a better modern guide to the trail. If you want to add an historical theme to your next road trip to the southwest, buy this book and head off on a Santa Fe trail adventure. Wish I had purchased it before leaving!"},{"Title":"Following the Santa Fe Trail: A Guide for Modern Travelers","review":"This is a Good Book and we used it in July of 2012 to find remote spots on the Santa Fe Trail. But remember this book was first written in 1984 and then reprinted in 2001. The places are still there, but access conditions are not always the same as they were 25 years ago. We were traveling the trail from West to East, which also made it a little harder to use the book, but it was still very helpful in finding those obscure locations. Maybe not the only book to take on your trip along the Santa Fe Trail - But one you should have!"},{"Title":"Earth","review":"A wonderful and intriguing text.

Terrific if used only for a picture book, but it is so much more!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Earth","review":"I bought this book for a course on Earth and Space Science. It was delivered promptly and just as described. I bought the book basically in new condition, and I payed a lot less for it than any of the other students in my class."},{"Title":"Earth","review":"A great book with a nice balance of pictures (including some full page) and informative text about, well...about nature!"},{"Title":"Earth","review":"THIS IS GREAT BOOK WITH A LOT OF INFO. MY TEENAGER LOVES IT AND SO DOES MY HUSBAND"},{"Title":"Earth","review":"As a college geography professor I decided to require Earth as the textbook for my physical geography classes. Tired of the exorbitantly priced textbooks which empty students' wallets, I thought it would be worthwhile to order a cheaper, more accessible book which the students might want to read even after the course ended. Now as the semester is finishing I am mostly happy with my choice. Earth cuts down on the jargon which is part of most college geography classes, so I had to alter my lecture and change some of my exam questions. Also, the sequencing of topics is different than most physical geography texts and I found it necessary to tell students that \\"today's material is found on pages 110-111,116-119, and 252-253,\\" not quite as simple as telling the students to read chapter 11. Nevertheless, my classes have loved using the text, which caters to the shortened attention spans of most students.I think any reader would enjoy picking up this book, thumbing to any page, and reading it for even a mere 5 minutes. The photos are beautiful and the captions alone are informative. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Earth","review":"It seems that DK and the Smithsonian have teamed up to produce a sure winner with their new book \\"Smithsonian Earth\\". It is profusely graphic with superb full color photographs and illustrations throughout.This book is divided into five major subjects: (1) Planet Earth (2) Land (3) Ocean (4) Atmosphere and (5) Tectonic Earth. It is extremely well organized with a comprehensive index and glossary. One will find \\"thematic panels\\" scattered throughout the text, which might in other works be referred to as \\"sidebars\\". They serve three functions: They are used to highlight science (how scientists have learned about different aspects of the workings of our planet), biography (notable earth scientists, explorers and others are profiled) and environment (the ways humans are changing the Earth). These panels are color-coded. For instance, all biography entries have a light gray background.Having indexed some books myself in the past, this comprehensive feature was much appreciated. It was impressive in that even the \\"thematic panels\\" are indexed as well as the regular text. The index in boldface type refers to the most prominent page. For instance, copper's indexed entry referred to the \\"thematic panel\\" that noted that copper is extremely malleable and can be formed into intricate patterns that are invaluable for covering domes, spires and cupolas. Furthermore, it notes that the copper roofs last for centuries - all this in a small thematic panel!The first part of the book deals with the Earth's past with a colored timeline extending over several pages dating from the Big Bang. The color reflects the temperature and the environment.One outstanding feature of this book is the use of what they call \\"double pages\\" (facing pages) that are used for subjects of a global nature, for instance, such as \\"The Solar System\\", \\"The Earth and the Sun\\" and \\"The Earth and the Moon\\". This is the same format that DK used expertly in their superb Concise Atlas of the World. This format eliminates the annoying necessity of distractive page flipping.The Planet Earth section is broken down into the Earth's Past, the Earth in Space, the Anatomy of the Earth and The Changing Earth. Each of these subjects is further subdivided.The Land section focuses on Mountains and Volcanoes, Rivers and Lakes, Glaciers, Deserts, Forests, Wetlands, Grasslands and Tundra, Agricultural Areas, Urban Areas and Industrial Areas.The Ocean section covers Oceans and Seas and Coasts. These are also further subdivided. Coasts, for instance, are broken down into Tides and Waves, Coasts and Sea Level and Erosions and Depositional Coastlines topics.In reviewing this book, I first ran a readability test to determine the reading level (the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level) and it showed that it was written on the 12th grade level.In other words, this book is appropriate for seniors in high school and above and \\"advanced\\" young readers. It's good to see an educational book that has not been \\"dumbed down\\" to the lowest common denominator! For instance, because of its high quality, this book might be used in an AP Geography course in high school.In short, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in our Mother Earth and its many themes, vistas and environmental problems.As a former social studies teacher, I can see that it should meet many needs, especially in our schools as both a reference work and as a textbook. To be quite honest, it's a sheer joy to read and to just \\"look\\"! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Earth","review":"This book covers an enormous amount of information. Features such as mountains, rivers, lakes, oceans, plains, deserts, forests, glaciers -- you name it -- are described in general and then short sections are devoted to specific places (the more prominent instances of those features, such as Mt Kilimanjaro for mountains, the Yangtze for rivers, etc., but many relatively lesser known places as well). But this book goes way beyond just land/water features. It also has a timeline of Earth's geological and biological history, covers rocks and minerals, soils, ecosystems, tectonics, natural forces, climate, conservation, and much more. The pictures are spectacular, and this book is full of them. Anyone with a general interest in geography, geology, or nature will certainly enjoy this book immensely."},{"Title":"Earth","review":"This volume has spectacular full-color pictures of the earth.For instance, diamonds, gold, silver, copper and other mineralsare depicted as they are found in the environment.

Which should I choose? The book is magnificently presented with wonderful photographs throughout - hundreds, perhaps thousands. The page edges are decorated beautifully with a different design per section,and the text is woven in among the graphics so that you aren't overfaced with masses of text at one time. The text is clear and flowing and on good quality paper. I cannot imagine that there is anything in this masterpiece that I might want to find and cannot. Clearly it cannot delve over deeply into every topic on a subject as grand as \\"Earth\\", but it has a jolly good try. The original price was reasonable - this lower price is an absolute bargain.

This is not the kind of book you're going to sit down and read cover to cover, but instead are going to use like a good encyclopedia of earth science.

This book explains our home planet in all its awe-inspiring wonder and what makes it unique, for now, in the universe. You will learn how our planet formed, what is underneath its surface, what is in its atmosphere, how weather systems are formed, and how it is the only planet in the universe known to support life. This should be required reading for both students and teachers. It should also be required reading for the average lay person who is concerned about protecting our natural environment against abuse and neglect by ignorant people who have no appreciation of the only planet that is our home for now. Yes, we have more information about the earth than any other object in the universe but there is still a lot more we don't know. We need to quit burying our heads in the sand and educate ourselves about the only planet we call home and this book does just that. This book will motivate us to take action to protect our environment and not abuse or neglect it.

I love Oceania, and the section was good, but not as long as it should be considering 70% of earth is ocean, and the only thing that really sets our planet so much apart from all others currently discovered is water.

So started looking into his writing and found this wonderful gem of a book.

If you are in the least interested in food and more to the point food history about France you need to get this book."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"I received this if decent condition but about 30 pages were cut off at the top and connected together. I requested a new book in better condition but they were unable to do that so they refunded my purchase."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"&quot;The Food of France&quot; is a delicious, exhausting account of the cuisine of France - definitely not reading for those watching their cholesterol level. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"Mr Root's overarching theory is that French food can be divided into the three culinary domains of fat, butter and oil. The Food of France reflects this belief and is similarly divided into three main sections, each chapter within a section dealing with the geographical/culinary regions within each domain. Within this structure, each chapter explores the food of a specific culinary region, and highlights the dishes distinct to that region.Underpinning Mr Root's overarching theory is the premise that food and how it is cooked is intimately related to and is influenced by the geography, history, and culture (agri- and otherwise) of its region. As a result, each region develops a food and cooking style unique to itself. He proceeds to illustrate this with erudition, verve, wit and style. Drawing on his knowledge of French geography, history, and culture, as well as what seems to be his vast gastronomic experiences across France, he makes a fine case for how each have been an ingredient in shaping and influencing the development of the food of each region. The Food of France will not only tell you what goes into an omelette provencale, it will tell you why this is different from an omelette a la nomande or an omelette a la nicoise, as well as consider different theories as to how the omelette got its name.The book comes with a general index, as well as an index of food and dishes. Dishes are described with sufficient particularity that a good cook could reproduce the dish. I should note that as the book was written in 1958, some of his information is a little outdated (his recommendations for good years of wine) or a little late (his urgings to visit Provence before it becomes too touristed). Notwithstanding this, The Food of France is an excellent resource and wonderful read: perhaps there can be no better recommendation than to admit that I enjoyed it so much that I have gone to buy The Food of Italy, also written by Root.My Personal Rating Scale:5 stars: Engaging, well-written, highly entertaining or informative, thought provoking, pushes the envelope in one or more ways, a classic.4 stars: Engaging, well-written, highly entertaining or informative. Book that delivers well in terms of its specific genre or type, but does not do more than that.3 stars: Competent. Does what it sets out to do competently, either on its own terms on within the genre, but is nothing special. May be clich&eacute;d but is still entertaining.2 stars: Fails to deliver in various respects. Significantly clich&eacute;d. Writing is poor or pedestrian. Failed to hold my attention.1 star: Abysmal. Fails in all respects."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"Now finishing my second reading of this tremendous book, all the while suspecting that Waverly Root was really a well-disguised poseur and not really the erudite man-of-the-world he appears to have been, I have to finally admit that, in addition to being one hell of a fine writer, he must also have been one of the most broadly-informed gourmands ever. True, occassional anecdotes and opinions of his betray the fact that the book was originally published 50 years ago, but the scope and intimacy of his knowledge with pretty much every provincial outpost, grand boulevard, and Basque backwater in France is astounding. I suspect he read and took to heart the 1950s edition of the Larousse Gastronomique, since many of the culinary practices he describes hardly deviate from what the Great Book says, but he provides so many examples of eating experiences that could be nothing but first-hand that I have to conclude that he actually DID spend his 30+ years in France doing little but travelling, eating, and drinking. These culinary expeditions are a treasure now: many of the regions he sampled so amply have been globalized to oblivion. His enthusiastic, almost childlike [but, nonetheless, world-wise] forays into the Haut Pyrenees, for example, record a local tradition of farmhouse cooking that is no more. But he was no mere chronicler of foods: his essays are leavened with witty, insightful, broadly-informed and fascinating anecdotes and contextual notes geographical, historical, literary, and agricultural. In this sense, I believe he was one of the pioneers of the broad, anectdotal form of journalism that remains perhaps the most effective means of presenting the world to an armchair audience. I have to forgive his peculiarities. Even his apparent contempt for Champagne seems inconsequential when I read his descriptions of travelling into darkest Corsica, sampling the wild, unrefined local wines, and immediately perceiving their perfect suitability to the food of the region. I am not aware of any other food and wine writer from that era who so heartily insisted on describing food and wine as a marriage. He wrote 20 years before Richard Olney brought his own sophistications to the table, and, understood in this context, his predilections must have been radical at the time.I urge you to read this book with a willingness to forgive the occassional signs of age. They are few and forgivable. Please savor the writing, with its erudition, lovely sense of timing and flow, gentle humor and enthusiasm. Please also consider it as the eloquent indictment of globalization that it is. To read a book written in the uncritical heyday of postwar American optimism and to find in it laments that the old world was slipping away, a victim of commerce and centralized policymaking, is a poignant experience indeed. This book is an education like few others."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"The Food of France, written in 1958, is a wonderfully erudite and relaxed look into French cuisine. Root, who has evidently spent many years in France eating his way through its various provinces, has written a travelogue and a paen to French cuisine.Root divides France into various gastronomic regions, and looks at the foods typical to each of these regions. His theory, that these gastronomic regions can be collated under three different regions - the domains of fat, butter and olive oil - forms the overarching structure of the book. In each region, he describes both its social and cultural history, as well as its geography and agriculture, in order to better explain why the food of that region developed in the way that it has. His riffs move from the origin of the name &quot;Languedoc&quot; (the language where &quot;yes&quot; was &quot;oc&quot; and not &quot;oui&quot;) and &quot;Carcassonne&quot; to the reason for large roofs in the Jura region. While some of this information may undoubtedly be out of date (his urgent plea to visit Provence before it becomes too touristetd is definitely 20 years too late by now as are his recommedations of good years for particular wines), most of the information is still pertinent and interesting.Among all of this, he manages to describe with luscious wit and warmth the food of the region. He will tell you with authority how snails are cooked, which cities have the best type of pastries, and what goes into the preparation of cote de porc a la vosgienne. If you've ever wondered about the difference between an omelette a la savoyarde (and he tells an amusing and fascinating story of how the omelette came to be so named) and an omelette a la lyonnaise, what a pamplemousse is or what goes into a cassoulet (depends on which region the cassoulet is made in), this is the book for you.It comes with an excellent general index, as well as an index of food and dishes. Cooks out there might be interested to know that he frequently describes dishes with sufficient particularity that a good cook could reproduce some of the dishes so described, even though details as to proportions and cooking techiques are not provided.I enjoyed this so much that I went off to buy The Food of Italy also by Root and am anticipating reading that with equal relish. There can really be no better recommendation than that."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"Without a doubt one of the very best written journeys through French cuisine via the country and the way it cooks food. Wonderful introduction to the best of French wines, just the right touch of history per region or dish - all vital to the appreciation of the food. It inspires the desire to take a slow 3 or 4 month tour with your appetite and this book as your guide."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This is a classic - I believe it is one of the first books for foodies. An accomplished American journalist in France after WWII provides a thorough discussion of what the three types of French cuisine are, where they are, how the foods and wines are linked to the terrain, and how, in terms of society development, French cuisine arrived at the point it was at the time of publication. I found it fascinating, and every time I go to travel in France, I review the section covering the region I will visit."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"The topic, broadly, is the relationship of cuisine to its Terroir. the text is incredibly engrossing and informative. This author's place in history and time -- an American, writing in the 1950's about knowledge acquired between WWI and WWII, combined with his writing talents, make this book indispensable to both the traveler and the chef. What an insight into what makes the French so... well, French. Root famously divides France into three geogra-culinary categories: those who cook with lard, those who cook with oil, and those who cook with butter. Helpful Maps, good index make it an excellent guidebook.I am so proud to have a good used hardcover of this book in my Library."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read on France and what makes it such a unique and beautiful country. Yes, it was written a good time ago, but unlike America history is something to cherish and is very present in France. Mr. Root captures the pure essence of France through it's food. I would strongly encourage anyone traveling to France or returning from a trip to read The Food of France. As a food writer from a day when writers told stories Mr. Root takes you into each of the regions of France provides you with tidbits of unknown and known history and the food that was shaped by it. Mr. Root knew his food very well and enjoyed it in a way that many would only hope to, a true pleasure in gastronomic reading."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This book is an irresistible read for anyone with a love of food an an interest in the history, geography and culture of regional France and its food products and cuisine. Root writes beautifully and it's impossible not to become as enthusiastic as the author as he shares his vast knowledge of each region of France and its culinary traditions. A book to return to again and again."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"I moved to Europe in the late 70s when Waverly Root still wrote on food, culture and life-in-general for the International Herald Tribune. At that time he was already advanced in age and had in fact invested much of the 20th century learning what makes the French who they are. This book represents a bit of the old way of perceiving France as the leading culinary and viticultural thought-leader of its time (a vision which persisted into the Kennedy years, but not far beyond). A lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then, and nouvelle cuisine and nouveau monde wines have changed the way sophisticated people think about food and drink.Nonetheless, the book -- the details, the imagery, the culinary analysis, the richness of the language, the enthusiasm -- remains an extraordinary vital resource on French cuisine. Whether you are an expert on France, or merely curious, Root gives you the lowdown on what grows where, how it is transformed into food, and what local people might drink with it. All within the rich context of French history and geography.Breathtakingly clear, Root divides Gaul into three parts: those that cook with butter, those that cook with olive oil, and those who cook with lard and goose fat. It is a simple and coherent framework which allows the reader to immediately comprehend the inherent differences in regional cuisines.In short, even if you know French food well, you will certainly find something insightful and amusing in this book."},{"Title":"The food of France","review":"This is one of my favorite books about French cuisine. In fact, it is one of my favorite books period. Root's prose is elegant and charming, and the information is highly interesting. The book has no plot or story (it simply goes from one region of France to the next, explaining the characteristic foods, wines, and preparations of that area), and it has no pictures, and none of the \\"recipes\\" are written as such--they are merely descriptions of how the dish is prepared. But even so the book is incredibly compelling, beautifully written, and very fun to read. For a companion volume (with pictures and recipes), I would recommend Samuel Chamberlain's \\"Bouquet de France: An Epicurean Tour of the French Provinces.\\""},{"Title":"Great Souls: Six Who Changed the Century","review":"Great Souls: Six Who Changed the Century is undoubtedly one of the best collections of biographies I have read in years. In an era where celebrities are designated &quot;heroes&quot; and fifty or so men in New Orleans are called &quot;Saints&quot;, it is refreshing - no it's inspiring - to read about five men and a woman whose attitudes and actions had a profound and positive effect on this century. David Aikman, a talented foreign correspondent for Time Magazine turned writer, has done a superb job capturing, in a few pages, the extraordinary lives and accomplishments of Billy Graham, Mother Teresa, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Pope John Paul II, Elie Wiesel and Nelson Mandela. If you are looking for perfect people, you won't find them in Aikman's book. What you will find, however, are six individuals who again and again, rose above their times and circumstances to change, if only for a brief time, the course of human events. Aikman's astute observations into the worldly and spiritual lives of these great souls hold important lessons for all of us today. Mother Teresa's inexhaustible compassion for the poorest of the poor, Nelson Mandela's amazing capacity to forgive, Billy Graham's urgent quest for salvation for the human soul, Solzhenitsyn's implacable pursuit of the truth, Pope John Paul's passion for human dignity and Eli Wiesel's constant reminders of the profound wickedness that lurks in the hearts of men, these are some of the lessons in store for those who read this enjoyable and inspirational book. Perhaps the best chapter is the last. Here Aikman uses Eli Wiesel's compelling and tragic story to inquire into the nature of evil. Was Adolph Hitler a charismatic but misguided despot or Satan incarnate? Was the Holocaust &quot;a mutation on a cosmic scale&quot; or &quot;merely the natural shoots watered by Europe's longtime subterranean lake of anti-Semitism&quot;? As we move from this millennium to the next, hopefully the brilliant lights of these great souls will illuminate the answers to these questions and be a lamp unto the uncertain path that lies before us.rlrodriguez@ucdavis.edu"},{"Title":"Great Souls: Six Who Changed the Century","review":"It was truly wonderful to read David's biographies of these great souls. There is quite a warts-and-all documentary style to this, but I really felt that I got into the lives of the people.

The mysterious cult that changed her cannot bend her will to their purpose; she escapes, assumes an alias, and rises, aided by her powers and a great deal of effort, to become a Space board investigator, wherein she solves crimes that may have been perpetrated by her abductors. Her abductors having blocked many of her memories before she was able to escape, she has to piece together her own history to get a sense of who she is, and piece together clues as to what the cult are about; she is aided in this by her friend Blake Redfield.After having gone through crises and adventures (each gripping adventure being covered by a volume of this series), she learns more of her history. This is crime-solving science fiction at its best, and having read the first 5 volumes I can hardly wait to read the 6th.Volumes of this Venus Prime series are:1. Breaking Strain2. Maelstrom3. Hide &amp; Seek4. Medusa Encounter5. Diamong Moon6. The Shining OnesIf you enjoyed Robert A. Heinlein's &quot;Friday,&quot; you will like Sparta even better.

I've read some complaints about this, but I find these techniques interesting.Preuss does an excellent job of combining science fiction and mystery/thriller. I used to read a lot of mystery books, but quickly tired of the genre.

There is superfluous obsession with technical detail, such as the protagonist's cybernetic abilities. As we don't get to learn much about her before the action kicks in she remains a superficial character, and since we are privy to more than she is in her amnesiac state, she is a difficult character to relate to."},{"Title":"The Criminal Personality: The Change Process (Volume II)","review":"I have used telling the criminal who he is and how he thinks often in my work. This alone gets their attention. To be so accurate about their thinking and reasoning has won hands down their interest and willingness to participate in the change process. They can't imagine you know already what really happens in their day to day thinking. To me this is the reference work I go back to time and again especially with difficult clients that have failed all other attempts at change. This book gave me the tools to work with the most hardened cases. If you don't understand the change process how can you guide them through it. Its most useful feature is the cases that are presented and the methods used to create change in thinking and action.

Reality tv may not have gone quite as far as the entertainment for the proles depicted in this novel, and science fiction is an exploration of possible futures rather than a prediction of an actual future, but Pohl and Kornbluth's depiction of one of those potential futures is uncomfortably close to present day reality.There are some nicely drawn characters, and a realistic look at the hazards of battling powerful vested interests -- while there is a happy ending, it comes at a price. The novel is short by today's standards, but a good read, and well worth hunting down a copy at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Gladiator at Law","review":"Unfortunately for sci-fi fans, Cyril M. Kornbluth had a very short life (1923-1958). Nevertheless he was able to deliver several very good novels.\\"Gladiator-at-law\\" (1954) in collaboration with his friend Frederik Pohl is one of them.First of all what an enticing title! You simply can't let it pass by unnoticed!The story describes a dystopia with many traits in common with their previous successful novel \\"The Space Merchants\\" (1952). I think these similarities conspired against \\"Gladiator-at-law\\" relegating it to a more obscure place than it deserves.The plot is as follows: this future world is ruled by Corporations that control economic and political power.Population is roughly divided in three segments.Top level is the Titans (industrial and/or financial).Middle class (professionals, administrators, technicians) bonded to the Corporations by a contract. They live in permanent danger to loose their job AND housing. Being the housing the key issue of this nearly servitude status.Finally at the bottom of the pyramid a huge mass of dispossessed are nourished and entertained by the state and lives into pauper neighborhoods without law.A lawyer that is barely able to keep into the second class is contacted by a mysterious couple of siblings.From there on action rage without respite allowing the reader to get in touch with a nightmarish world.This book is a wonderful example of a turning point in sci-fi literature from traditional technological spaces operas to a more humanistic and sociological subjects.Enjoy this somehow underrated sci-fi classic!Reviewed by Max Yofre"},{"Title":"Gladiator at Law","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager, nearly 50 years ago, and just finished re-reading it. It holds up surprisingly well for a half-century-old work of speculative fiction. Sure, the technology is dated, and you have to mentally multiply all dollar figures by a factor of 20, but as social commentary it's still readable and even engrossing. P&K's portrayal of a decaying, corporate-controlled America is well crafted, with vivid descriptions and dialog. Their grasp of economics is spotty, and Pohl's far-leftist sympathies are all too evident (he was a Communist in his younger days) but the narrative moves along briskly, and the characters are vivid and memorable. I hesitate to give this five stars; it's really more like a 4.5 star entry, but why quibble.

This statistical error causes a disparity, but it only \\"seems\\" that the ROI between leaders and non-leaders looks larger. But, sheesh, there is only ONE leader but SEVERAL non-leaders. Using basic math, if the win percentage for leaders in a certain category is 30% then the win percentage for non-leaders is 70%.Using Steve's calculation method, in an 8-horse race you would bet $2 on the leader and $14 (the \\"non-leaders\\" times 2)on the non-leaders. Even if a non-leader won there would still be six losers among the non-leaders so the \\"win percentage\\" is just 14 percent. Unless the winner pays off at more than 6-1 odds it's a NEGATIVE return-on-investment!In my opinion, look to other handicapping books for a better return on investment."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"The title says it all in that early speed is the ultimate bias. It's like in the movie Top Gun where Tom Cruise says \\"I feel the need, the need for speed.\\" The stats of the sucess of early speed don't lie, & this book presents an interesting way of compiling them with an emphasis that includes field size. And a large part of the book presents charts on trainers, jockeys, etc. But concentrating on the 1st call only without the all important 2nd call & no use of fractions means that this work as providing raw numbers is only a starting point for further research. The books of Ainslie, Beyer, Davidowitz & Brohammer should be studied first, as while this effort presents a formula for early speed points, the best system is that one that compiles information & experiances using the most complex computer, the one above the shoulders."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"I agree that early speed is important in horse racing and in particular horse racing on dirt. Klein Speed Points and Klein Track Bias Numbers as mentioned in this book give the horse racing fans some kinds of objective measurement and idea on how the speed of a race will look like and the likelihood that a horse will perform better because of the favourable change in the pace of a race as well as track bias. However, the author of this book does not explain how the formulas used to derive Klein Speed Points and Klein Trace Bias Numbers are created.Once again, I would like to stress that just knowing early speed is not enough. This is only one part of horse racing. Moreover, if everyone focuses on early speed evaluation, the inefficieny in the \\"horse racing market\\" will disappear and the profit will also disappear.This book is OK to read, but as an experienced horse racing fans who have read many books on handicapping I found no surprise in this book."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"Klein Speed Points may be an improvement over the Quirin numbers if you are looking for a more precise gauge. The question the book leaves unanswered is how predictive are the speed points? How often does a horse with a sizable speed point advantage actually get the first call lead?The book studies horses who get the early lead. The speed points themselves are not studied. Whether you use Quirin numbers or Klein's points, pace setters are usually obvious and overbet. Key insights might include: When is the early pace likely to collapse? Why do plodders pop up so often in trifectas and superfectas? What conditions favor pressers or closers that have competitive point totals? Klein's method cries out for a description of his handicapping process.Instead, Mr. Klein filled the book with dense tables to back up his early speed hypothesis. He writes with a tone that suggests he's discovered the Holy Grail, as if he hopes readers won't notice the thin content. It's like he told his publisher, \\"Look, I don't have enough material for a whole book.\\" No problem, just fill it with tables. I think DRF should be more scrupulous about rushing a half-baked concept into print. Three-stars, incidentally, is not a trashing review. Those who like to play with numbers and wade into reams of data will find the book helpful.The upshot of Mr. Klein's research is horses with low speed point totals are likely to try for the early lead. You can usually identify those horses by eyeballing the running lines. The best you can say for speed points is they are informational, another number to look at. Do we need another number? Is it worth the extra effort to calculate them? The BRIS past performances include Quirin numbers, which are highly useful. Not only do they point to runners likely to take the lead, they indicate a horse's potential to get involved in the race. Quirin numbers are an easily-understood measure of a horse's competitive spirit. Because the Quirin numbers are old school and so simple they may not get the respect they deserve. I've worked with them a lot. They are a powerful handicapping innovation. I don't know Bill Quriin, but Steve Klein is no Bill Quirin. Klein's speed points are not about to replace Quirin's.I suggest setting up an Excel spreadsheet to calculate the numbers. Because of rounding, your totals may differ slightly from Klein's. Work a hundred races. You may, like me, lose any enthusiasm you may have initially felt about Mr. Klein's discovery. In his book, Mr. Klein cherry-picked a highly unusual instance when his speed points clobbered the experts, including James Quinn. After your workout, you'll realize just what an outlier this situation was."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"I liked the book mostly for the Klein speed figures, I have applied them with some success.

But it did give me a new respect for early speed that I will continue to use in my handicapping."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"Horseplayers have always known that, all things being equal, the horse that takes the early lead has the best chance to win the race.

After describing that it gets into a method used by the author and then covers alot of races to prove the point."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"This book was published in 2005 but the cat is still not out of the bag yet as, seven years later, a keen handicapper using many of Klein's principles can still make money at the racetrack betting horses that fiqure to get a clear early lead or run extremely close to the pace.Klein's speed points are a vast improvement over Quirin's speed points of the past and by using them one has a substantial edge over the competition.His method of adding or subtracting seven points for each half furlong in distance comparing today's race distance with the distance the horse ran in each of his last three races is worth its weight in gold.Klein lists all types of distances, race conditions and tracks as well as jockeys and trainers and gives the ROI for each category. Overall, in a study of over 200,000 races, the horse that had the lead at the first call won over 28 percent of the time with a ROI of $3.12 for a two dollar bet.However, if you refer to his ROI tables for tracks, distances, etc., you will find there is still greater opportunities to make money at the track.For example, the highest ROI at the class levels are the maiden races. Maiden claimers show a $3.62 ROI and maiden special weight contests return a $3.50 ROI at all distances. Sprint races show a substantially better ROI than distance races. I would assume the ROI for maiden sprint races is over $4.00.Some racetracks, like Mountaineer Park in West Virginia have extroadinary high ROI's in sprint races. At Mountaineer, the ROI in five furlong races for the first call leader is an astounding $5.47. ROI's of $4.11 and $4.10 for five and one half furlong and six furlong sprints are not to be sneered at either. Klein lists this in his book as well as ROI's for all tracks, distances and surfaces.I've incorporated some of Klein's methods in my own handicapping. I've become a sprint specialist, playing only races between five and six and one half furlongs (the highest ROI's). I use my own pace ratings, enhanced by Klein's rule to add or subtract seven points per half furlong as regards to the distance the horse ran in each of his past three races compared to today's race. I don't use distance races and interchange surfaces as Klein does and I'm very leery of using a figure earned on an off track unless the horse previously ran a comparable figure on a fast track or the track is off today.Just a couple of weeks ago, I had a $43.80 winner at Prairie Meadows. At five and one half furlongs, he jumped to the lead, opened up by almost four lengths and won by two lengths. The second rated horse finished in the place position for an exacta of over $134.00.After reading this book, one definitely has a new perspective on an old game. Buy it.

For me, the book provided a reawakening and clearer focus of some of my handicapping skills that had become underused over the course of time. Steve's work dwarfs another previous computer study \\"Winning at the Races\\", by William Quirin, Ph.D., William and Morrow, 1979.

I feel that it will help me alot in making me a better handicapper."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"It is a shame that the vast databanks of information held by Daily Racing Form and Equibase have not been gleaned and explored like Klein has done here. This is a study of 1,671,627 starters and the effect of early speed in racing. It is the first of its kind, to my knowledge.What Klein provides is not the Rosetta Stone of racing, but rather an affirmation of what critics will say we already knew--early speed is the universal bias in racing. But Klein goes further. He doesn't just prove up early speed's influence, he provides a solid (if in-artful) way of determining how a race will shape up by the first call. His surprisingly simple formula makes the Quirin Speed Point obsolete.I highly recommend this book to horseplayers, especially those advanced enough to understand the significance of the scale of Klein's study. Any expert horseplayer that can put aside the arrogance of his close-minded commitment to his own hunches, rules, and opinions can undoubtedly benefit from this treatise and avoid the inevitable award of stubborn inflexibility--a slow, grinding loss at the track.The statistics in this book overwhelmingly establish what should have been known by any horseplayer worth a two dollar bet--find the speed in a race and you are length away from the winner.The disappointing part of the book is Klein's anecdotal evidence. Klein, like all prior authors of books on handicapping, relies on self-serving anecdotes to prove some of his hypotheses. I do not know why he has chosen to do this considering the volumes of hard-and-fast empirical evidence that he has at his fingertips to make his point. For instance, in his chapter on what speed horses to avoid, he fails to support his argument with any quantitative evidence, but rather relies on a few past races. Why, Mr. Klein? The rest of the book is based on the performances of over a million thoroughbred starts. Why revert to the woefully-inadequate method of proving your point by referring to a solitary (and therefore impenetrable) isolated event in racing? I would have preferred Klein had just admitted that his statistics do not tell us which speed horses to avoid, rather than attempt to tackle the question without any credible data.Klein's endeavor here was long overdue, and I hope he, or others at DRF, will decide to use this scientific and statistical method for dealing with the other elements of handicapping--speed, class, track biases, angles, and conditions."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"Steve Klein authored a good one. He is a believer in early speed and now I am, too! His work, The Power of Early Speed, is one you should have in your library. It is appropriate for both the casual weekend player and for the more ambitious handicapper who plays one or more tracks each day.The book starts with the history behind his idea to write a book-- Steve had early success with early speed while growing up in California. The history moves to the present: Steve works for the Daily Racing Form and covers Kentucky racing. He pondered whether early speed was something that was universal. He decided to use the vast DRF database and used 1,671,627 horses to find out. I'll ruin the ending of the story for you -- it does!He includes charts that show the profitability of early speed at the different odds levels and at different track conditions. Same with the different distances carded by each track. He includes additional data of track specific trainer and jockeys success vs. early speed. These charts alone could be used favorably by the casual player. Finding and recorded early speed track biases and how to handicap early speed via Klein speed points rounds out the volume.The lone complaint I have is that the font size should be larger. It was difficult for me to read the charts and past performances. I ended up using a magnifying glass. I recommend that when the second printing takes place that the past performances and charts be enlarged.I've been playing and reading handicapping books for close to 50 years. Steve's book is one I strongly recommend. It has helped my game; it will help yours."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"Steve Klein, The Power of Early Speed (DRF Press, 2005)There are a whole lot of handicapping books on the market. Few of them contribute anything new to the genre. The Power of Early Speed may be one of the books that does, though I plan to give it a lot of testing before I start making that claim with any force.Steve Klein here gives us a new method for calculating early speed points. Despite the book's rather considerable (for a handicapping tome) bulk, that's the long and short of it; much of the book's three hundred-odd pages is taken up with lists of tracks, trainers, and jockeys to refine the original early speed points calculation. As you could probably compress the actual information in this book into an eight-page pamphlet, you have to ask yourself if it's really worth the cover price. My answer, for the moment: it depends. If Klein's early speed points turn out to be the best handicapping tool since the Beyer Speed Figures (and the promise is certainly there), I guarantee you this book will be worth its weight in gold many times over. Otherwise, you'll end up having paid for a curious collector's item, like those horrid William Baumann books you want to forget you ever even read. It's hard to tell simply from the book; Klein has not yet recognized the value of a technique many handicappers have adopted since William Scott first popularized it: showing when your system loses along with when it wins. If you read this book without a critical eye, you're likely to think Klein has uncovered the secret to your own personal banking industry. Hopefully, you'll come to your senses before you go broke.It is possible, however, that Klein has provided us with a valuable handicapping tool, and that is an intriguing proposition. I'll be testing the numbers out over the next few months. ***"},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"The data presented is great. The format is easy to use. Well worth having in your library.Sadly, the method presented to find the early leader only works about 40% of the time. To make the data work as a positive roi factor it would need to work about 80% of the time.At least it set the wheels in motion for more study's of finding the early leader,Jerry Hill"},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"In the month and a half since I read my copy of The Power of Early Speed, I've gone on the best run of my handicapping life-- nearly +$3000 on $5 win and $2 exacta wagers. I'm regularly identifying 8-1 and higher longshots that my normal handicapping would have ignored.The basic principle is this: Horses on the lead at the first call of dirt races win roughly 20% of the time yet yield a positive return on investment. This holds true across all class levels and at every track in North America, based on a 9 year, 200K race sample.Klein shows you how to identify horses likely to take the lead with a Speed Point formula that's useful, but that isn't necessary to calculate all the time, if you keep in mind running position at the first call, field size (it's more impressive when you make the lead or are close to the pace in a larger field) and race distance (horses entered today in longer races have a greater chance of making the lead).In addition, Klein points you towards trainers whose horses tend to go to the front more often-- especially good when you're in a 1st off claim or 1st with trainer situation. He also details which riders like to gun from the gate at each track-- and sometimes certain riders gun at one track while holding back at others. For instance, Edgar Prado is much more likely to head for the front at Awueduct while being more patient at Belmont.Details like that give you a great edge at the windows."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"Handicappers and writers have long talked about the importance of early speed, but now Klein brings a massive research project to the table to show exactly how powerful this factor is. Most handicapping books bring select examples or limited samples of a few hundred races results to the table, but Klein calls on the Daily Racing Form database to inclued over 1.6 million starters. He then details by track, condition, and class to provide more insight into return on investment for each. The idea isn't revolutionary, but the data that backs up his ideas leave no doubt as to the \\"Power of Early Speed.\\" Klein's speed points appear on the surface to be better than Quirin's technique that he developed 20+ years ago.I wish Klein had given his point technique somewhat of a test run and provided results of his test. It's easy to look back and talk about return on investment for early leads after the race is run, but I would like some proof of how effective the Klein points are at identifying leaders because that is what will produce results."},{"Title":"The Power of Early Speed (Elements of Handicapping)","review":"I've been handicapping for quite some time and find the author, Steve Klein, unable to come up with anything new on the subject of handicapping. It's a shame. I buy pretty much any new handicapping book that comes down the pipe in the hope of finding even ONE nugget, but all I found here were previously turned over stones.Quirn has already written on the same thing. I think we all know early speed is important (at least my 12-year old does).I guess if I had to find a plus (and believe me it took awhile) was Klein's speed points, however, I found it impossible to relate how these points relate to the leaders at the first call. This is probably because the DRF book failed to contain any tests or verifications of the author's work. Incidentally, I found that fact (no verification) quite odd given that the book seemed to be made up of 50% charts.If you are looking for a book that is an overlay, this isn't it. Just another tome coming out of the DRF puppy mill.I will say it LOOKS nice next to the other DRF books if you are collecting."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"This is a typical michener book of fictional and non fictional characters and events. I found the whole description of the salmon business in Alaska very interesting and especially liked reading about the chaos that endured during the gold rush era. Any michener fan will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"A classic read Michener at his best. Great history, believable and engaging characters. A recommended read."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I found myself booked for a number of promotional appearances in Alaska. I re-read Mr. Michener's ALASKA to help me prepare for my journey. ALASKA, while a work of fiction, is amazingly informative and educational. James Michener is a masterful story teller, yet he always gives his reader a thorough feel for the setting he is writing about. In ALASKA, Michener covers that vastness we know as Alaska--from its earliest history to its present day challenges. When I arrived in Alaska, I felt most comfortable in that unique state because I had just read this book. It is a master work."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"The book arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting. This book is a great read and is a perfect gift."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I read Hawaii by James Michener and am excited to dive into another brilliantly written adventure of his. A great writer"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I decided to read &#34;Alaska&#34; before heading to Alaska for a family vacation. What a great read! Michener is a fantastic storyteller. I ended up with a much greater sense of what the amazing state of Alaska is about and why as the book starts in prehistoric times and ends up in our present time. In the process of reading this wonderful book, I rediscovered why I had enjoyed reading Michener's book such &#34;Hawaii&#34; and &#34;Centennial&#34; years earlier.If you are planning on visiting Alaska, pick up this book and read it before you go. It will make your experience much richer."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"The day this book came out in Alaska I bought it & read it through. Soon after I learned author Michener was taking a cruise to Alaska & doing a book tour on his stops. I had noted that he stated in his book that Alaska Natives hunted Sea Otters but did not eat them, which is what most people had a problem with esp. during the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill when I got our Alaska Native people involved in saving sea otters. I was an Alaska Native sea otter hunter when I was a young woman and I wanted Mr. Michener to know that some of us did indeed utilize what we take. I overnighted my letter to his next stop in Juneau Alaska and after his tour was over he wrote me back. Quite a long letter indeed, on Miami University letterhead I believe (I think he taught there). I lost the letter during the Exxon Valdez days since they never paid our group for saving sea otters oiled by the spill. But the book was well researched."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I bought this audio book and when it arrived there was only one cassette in the box. Should have been two."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I enjoyed this book so much that I purchased this copy for a friend with similar interests. I'm sure he will enjoy it too. Michener's books are great!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"book arrived in a timely manner and was in very good condition. My grandson will have many enjoyable hours reading on the long flight to Germany."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"When I was about 12 my mother told me that she was tired of buying me Hardy Boys books which I would whiz through in about an hour. Books had starting climbing in price and it was getting pretty costly. So I asked my mom what she wanted to do for a solution. She produced a book that had to be almost 2 inches thick to my young eyes. The title was Alaska. I was quite intimidated by the size of the book but since I was a bookworm I decided to try Mr. Michener out. By the end of the first chapter I was hooked. James Michener's impeccable research methods and character developments were genius. I had finally found a favorite author. I've read several of his books since. His books require a lot of time of course. Right now I'm working on Chesapeake. But, I will never forget Alaska. I'll remember the Tlingit, the stories of the pelt salesmen, the Yukon, etc. Michener makes historical fiction far more enjoyable than one would imagine."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I am lucky enough to have taken 2 cruises to Alaska and it is, by far, one of my favorite places in the world! Shortly after my 2nd cruise, I snatched at everything I could get my hands on to learn more about the history and background of this area. When I saw that Michener wrote the be-all, end-all novel on Alaska, I raced at the opportunity to read it.For those who don't know, this book is NOT necessarily dubbed as an accurate representation on the \\"history\\" of Alaska. Michener creatively takes real historical happenings but devises made-up characters and stories around events such as The Gold Rush, the settling of certain areas/cities, the salmon industry, etc... This allows the reader to associate with engaging story lines while simultaneously learning a fair amount regarding the historic progression of Alaska and all events surrounding the creation of our 49th state. Some chapters are better than others throughout the book, but most of the book keeps the reader engrossed with Michener's imaginative stories. One particular chapter, entitled 'Salmon,' is my personal favorite, outlining the life duties of a single fish and its journey through different bodies of water. Michener has a very innovative way of tying in the lives of the characters and their duties (primarily in the salmon cannery industry) in with the life-long (short) voyage of a fish he calls Nerka. This chapter can be a single story within itself! Lastly, I feel the book is generally appreciated more by people who have visited Alaska since the visual association with areas Michener mentions in the book are so memorable.So, why only 4 stars? To begin, it's a very long book (as with most of Michener's novels). Be very patient reading it! Additionally, there are points of the novel that are jumpy, inconsistent, and tend to really drag on. Sure, it all ties in eventually, but Michener goes to the \\"nth degree\\" with details about certain characters, only for the reader to find out later they were fictional all along. Unfortunately, the end of the novel seems to be the most guilty part of this characteristic, which unfortunately concludes with an oddly anti-climactic ending. I give the author credit for putting the amount of time and research it took to create such a gem. However, I feel myself gravitating toward a history book on Alaska to see just what is fact and what is fiction after all."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"There are two books that are a must read if you or anyone you know is intersted in Alaska. They are ALASKA by James Michener and LOOKING FOR ALASKA by Peter Jenkins. Remember Jenkins from his book, A WALK ACROSS AMERICA, Michener from so many big sellers like TEXAS. Michener offers more of the history, in his fact-ion kind of style, Jenkins offers many fascinating views of real people and actual places from today. Michener wrote this book in the 70's and it is a very, very long book, so there is thirty years of Alaska that is no where to be found and this place has changed so much in that time. Peter Jenkins lived there for a year and a half in 1999 through the end of 2000 and traveled thousands of miles in search of the amazing Alaska of today. I wish Jenkins had included more history, is there a place that has had much more of a diverse and fascinating one than Alaska, I wish Michener had met more of the actual people and gone to the actual places and lived the Alaska life like Jenkins did. For these reasons I suggest both books to the several thousand people every year that I work with as they plan their tours of The Last Frontier. Many of my clients have told me after reading these books and going to Alaska that the books greatly enriched their trip and made them go back. One couple I book travel for has been to Alaska five times in the last three years!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"This book was a surprise gift to me after I mentioned that I love Alaska and am fascinated with the place. I let it languish on the shelf for over two years and only picked it up with passing interest. I became enthralled with Michener's style of weaving historical and archeological tidbits into a fictionalized portrayal of the eons of geological forces and peoples that have shaped Alaska's culture and landscape. This is a fascinating look at a fascinating part of this Earth, and Michener is a formidable storyteller. While not the best writing I've encountered, it's good enough to turn what might otherwise have been a rather ho-hum narrative into a book that on several occasions I haven't wanted to put down to go to bed."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"The harsh climate and unique geography of Alaska have made it a place where only the hardiest thrive. In James Michener's \\"Alaska\\" he highlights those hardy souls, starting with the earliest inhabitants, the mammoths. He then takes us through the human history of Alaska's various peoples: the earliest settlers who came from eastern Asia, and later the Russians who came seeking the valuable pelts of sea otters. After Alaska was sold to the United States gold was discovered in the Yukon and Nome and the gold rush occured, followed by bids for statehood and the latest rush for oil. Throughout we are treated to a picture of the various people it took to survive and build the modern-day civilization that currently exists.I appreciate the insights gained into this land and it's people from reading this book, and that Michener included a brief listing of which people/parts were truly fictional and which were real. As is typical of his style characters drop in and drop out of the story. Missy Peckham and Tom Venn from the gold rush days seem to linger longer than most in this novel, but sometimes it's a little annoying when you get interested in a character and then they kind of fizzle out of the story to be replaced by others. Kendra Scott at the end is also very likeable, but then abruptly fades away. This style also makes it hard (for me) to recall the earlier characters. But overall, the story(s) were enjoyable and left me with a desire to visit this great place."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Then this is a must read. Reading it just prior to traveling to Alaska made the experience all that much more meaningful when you learn that Alaska's history is as amazing as its beauty. It was a great moment in my life to have met Tlingit Indians, eaten sockeye salmon, and traveling up the White pass after having read all about them in Michener's book. That last couple hundred pages did seem to be a bit rushed with too much skipping around. The ending was just \\"OK\\". Otherwise, if you are planning a trip to Alaska, do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"After visiting Alaska recently I searched for books that would fill in the gaps in my understanding of the state's history. Along with historical works, I chose Michener's Alaska believing that it would be an enjoyable and enlightening read. I found it to be well-written with fascinating plot development. However, I also found it to be unnecessarily liberal in its portrayal of any groups other than the native Alaskans. In particular, Michener too often depicts businessmen, missionaries, politicians, military leaders, etc., from the \\"lower 48\\" as conquerors who are driven mainly by their own greed for money and/or power and lacking in basic morality. I realize from other reading that much occurred during the development of Alaska that demonstrated too little regard for the indigenous population and the resources of the land, but all \\"Americans\\" from the \\"lower 48\\" were not as evil as the author seems to insinuate.A brief but good example is Michener's (fictional) account of the sinking of the Montreal Queen cruise ship south of Juneau within the \\"inside passage.\\" The fictional account is obviously loosely based upon an actual sinking of the S.S. Princess Sophia after running aground on Vanderbilt Reef in 1918. After 36 hours on the reef, the Princess Sophia was finally broken apart by the raging waves, and all passengers and crew were lost. It was determined that it had been impossible to immediately rescue the passengers due to the terribly bad weather, prohibiting vessels from approaching safely. But in Michener's account, the picture is one of a ship's captain so driven by the need to save money for the shipping company that he will not risk other ships claiming any salvage rights by off-loading anything or anyone. In addition, the ship is owned by the same company that has been essentially raping the land of its resources and treating its people as serfs. As a work of fiction, such depiction is certainly within the rights of the author; but since this is a historical fiction, the reader is always trying to ascertain what might be actual fact. Unfortunately, the liberal cast that Michener gives to this account is repeated over and over throughout the book. A positive aspect of this bias is that the reader is often compelled to search out the actual history to determine what the real facts actually were.The extent of the bias is, in my opinion, not just unnecessary; it exposes the underlying bias of the author himself."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"First, let me announce my bias: I was born and raised in Alaska.When I saw this novel on the bookshelves when it first came out, I promised myself I'd read it even tho I had never read anything by Michener. Well, some 20 years later, I finally read it. And -- boy! -- do I wish I hadn't waited so long. It's a long book (close to 1,000 pages) and I was so engrossed that I almost lost sight of the real world for the duration.Of course, being from Alaska helps. I could orient myself geographically with little trouble. I had the broad outlines of the history already. And the historical names were almost all familiar to me if not the details of their lives.But what Michener did which I most appreciate about his novel is painlessly impart the details of history by interweaving it so tightly with his colorful fiction that it was hard for me during the reading to separate the two. Yet I'm sure I know what is historical and what isn't. It's a contradiction, I know. And a compliment to this man's storytelling skill.I let out a satisfied \\"whew!\\" when I closed the book a final time and returned to reality. Then I suffered withdrawal symptoms for days, maybe weeks. I found myself gazing wistfully at some of his other large works in the bookstores. Did you know there's no Michenerholics Anonymous? I've just begun reading THE SOURCE. I couldn't help myself."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Alaska is a harsh environment with fantastic resources, and the stories of the people who chose to go to Alaska to harvest those riches make for a compelling, epic novel. The characters vary from the early hunters, to the Russian traders, to gold rushers, to the oil drillers, and on and on, but the theme is clear: Alaska punishes and rewards those who make their lives there.Going on a trip to Alaska? You'll enjoy it much more with an understanding of the history of the Great Land, and there's no better way to absorb history than through great storytelling like Michener's."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"If you like Michener, you'll like it - but it's a long one...

When it did arrive, while it was clean and complete, the pages were so yellowed it could hardly be read. Stated condition was USED - VERY GOOD. Not true. Also, the binding is so close to the printed text that print is obstructed unless you literally crack the spine. Some pages even then it's a real struggle to read text that was close to the binding.

This might be excusable, considering the length of the novel, but the taping quality is very bad. There are many distracting gaps, often as if it was edited in mid-sentence.

Prior to reading this book, I knew nothing about Alaska aside from what I could remember from basic college history courses. I purchased this book to refresh my knowledge as well as to be \\"inspiration\\" for a trip I was about to take to Alaska, as I wanted to learn more about Alaska's beginnings and development. This novel served my purpose, though I understand - from others' reviews - that not all facts are 100% accurate, tainted with personal bias of the author's. (Since I am not an avid Alaska historian nor do I plan on reading another historical account of Alaska, I cannot validate or refute those statements.) Michener's book WAS NOT a page turner throughout - there were chapters I struggled through, while there were others that kept me entertained. With that said, I wouldn't suggest skipping any pages/chapters as they tie in together.

It is so rich and full of character. I can't give a detailed review because I read it so long ago, but I have never forgotten the feeling I had while reading it. On a recent long-awaited trip to Alaska I got to see what I read about, the mountains, the gold rush trails taken by those hoping to strike it rich,the hardships they dealt with. And this is such a small part of the book, it starts at the formation of the land mass that will be Alaska, this is how he wrote. I have read all his books and was greatly saddened by his passing some years ago. I made this purchase to have my daughter discover the joy of Micheners writing and to relive our trip. My Mother passed on the love of this author to me and I am hoping to do so with my daughter.

It's educational, it's funny, it's heartwrenching, it's all too real. Mainly trailing the exploits and adventures of specific families through various generations, we are able to follow the progression of this oft' overlooked and misunderstood chunk of the world from drifting tectonic plate to eventual statehood and beyond. The characters are warm, but the landscape can be cold and threatening. A delight from cover to cover. My only wish is that there had been more adventures on the sea included as I thrilled along with in Chesapeake. Regardless, a smashing tale. Excellent bedtime, vacation time, or stay-at-home sick reading. Thoroughly engrossing. Makes you want to go there yourself."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"By chance, I brought this book to read on a fishing/camping trip. I had no idea how captivating it would be to learn the life cycle of a salmon along with the captivating story line Michener never fails to pull off. By far, this is no simple fishing tale. It is packed with the richest of scenes and fascinating characters. My appreciation for the history and people of Alaska will forever be with me because of this book. There is no one that can duplicate Michener's literary skills, or even that come close. Don't let yourself be intimidated by the volume of the novel for the story is action packed difficult to put down. You will not be disappointed in Alaska."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I really enjoyed reading Alaska. The way Michener always goes into such detail explaining his characters and their struggles is very interesting. The descriptions of the land made me feel like I was right there with all of his characters. It gave me a whole new outlook on the state. I always thought of Alaska as just a cold place but he showed me in his writing how beautiful the state really is. I always learn about the history of the places he writes about. My mother's uncle went to Alaska during the gold rush, hoping to make his fortune so I was able to associate with that part of the novel. I would recommend this book for reading because it is a very enjoyable book to read as well as a lesson in history and geography."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"We plan to make a trip to Alaska this summer. Not knowing much about the history, geography, cultural influences, or indigineous peoples there I purchased Michener's Alaska to advance our preparations. What a fabulous history of this place!

We are really enjoying this book and recommend it highly to anyone who wants to learn more about this territory and its magic.-Suzanne R., Miami, Florida"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Since I was going on an Alaskan cruise in late summer, I wanted some background about this 49th state. I remembered that Michener had written a book about Alaska and wanted to read it. My trip was very much enhanced by the information provided in the book. I believe I enjoyed the trip a little more because of prior knowledge of what had taken place over the years. I am not daunted by a long book if it is able to hold my interest. This was, I felt, a great way to be introduced to the state. Great characters, settings, etc. I feel Michener really did his homework. I purchased this book for a fellow traveler who wanted to read it after the cruise."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"This book indeed makes one want to go to Alaska. Or, like in my case, makes one want to go there even more, despite repeated descriptions of mosquito swarms just waiting for their prey. As usual, Michener gives us a very thorough history of a region, with accurate details and dramatic fictional events. The story starts with the shifting of rock plates, eventually forming Alaska, and ends with Alaska receiving statehood. The only problem I have with Michener's novels (hence four, not five, stars, despite the fact that the book is an excellent read) is that they all follow an identical scheme. Nothing imaginative here in terms of literary form. Great (and recommended) as a start to learn something about a place, though. One of my favorite Micheners."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I just finished this book in preparation for a trip to Alaska in half a year, and highly recommend it for those who want a sense of Alaska's history and culture. The nature of the book is to help people understand the history of the area, its geography, and what daily life was like from earliest times to the present (or at least to the 1980s when it was written). The characters are generally representative of the kinds of people who have lived and presently live in Alaska, showing their differing ideas, lifestyles, and backgrounds with some real historical characters described as well. The different characters and their descendents intersect each other's lives to form somewhat of a plot line, but plot and character development are secondary to showing the geography, culture and lifestyles, etc., of the peoples of Alaska. Michener has creative ways of bringing out explanations of how things worked by having some characters ask others about it, etc., and this he does with such smoothness that it seems natural to the storyline. It is masterfully written, and in the end, one does have a good idea of the history of Alaska and the differing cultures and ideas which have dominated at various times in its past. There are some maps included, and a section explaining which parts of the book are historical and which are fictional, which is very helpful."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I read the book a few years ago and felt the venturesome spirit of the Russian. Neither I realized the Russian reached Alaska ahead of other European colonists until I read Michener's Alaska. The American should be thankful of Tzar Alexander II and their country man Seward to acquire the frozen tundra approximately 19% the pre-1867 USA. Michener's Alaska is a 5-star book by any standard."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"This audio book highlights the best parts of Mr. Michener's famous work on Alaska.Peter Graves is at his best in delivering the story of Missy, Tom and the others in their travels. The audio book makes a wonderful companion for all ages, especially when travelling a long distance.Especially notable is the editing of Mr. Michener's 600 page book to focus on the story of Missy, Tom and the others, while carrying the timeline in an easily understandable fashion.Having lived in Alaska myself, I found the narrative to be refreshingly accurate in portraying much of the history and landmarks.My wife, who has not yet visited Alaska, is looking forward to our cruise, which will pass by the very inlets and landmarks referred to in the tapes. As we will be small-ship cruising, you can bet we will each have our headphones on and this audio book playing in the evenings as we enjoy our visit to these beautiful areas!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I must first disclose that I am a James Michener fan. Well of course this is a great book! It naturally starts out like all of Micheners stories from the VERY begining. It is interesting to note that I read over one third of the book before it really mentions the United States. The descriptions of the freezing cold actually felt like it lowered the temperature. Being a part native American (Hawaiian) I could really feel sympathetic towards the natives of Alaska as they were used and abused. Micheners description of the Salmon is classic, it confirms the author's reputation. Once again Michener makes you feel like you were there, and the story is engrossing. After you read this your going to be like me and want to take at least a cruise of Alaska."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"a quality author in Michener, two great novels at one low price, you cant go wrong here."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I believe that this book is the best book written by James Michener, with Carribean, Hawaii and Chesapeake following closely.

Have fun while you learn."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I read this book several years ago while in the Perian Gulf. It was just lieing around and I was a little bored so I began to read it. That was the best move I could have made. The book is outstanding. It covers from the beginning of Alaska's formation to it's current geograqphical location, and the migrations of humans throught the land bridge of old. Then of the run of the Salmon and their migration. It's extrmemely diverse. Hitting multiple levels of a persons intrest. From the Eskimos to their lawyers and the Ididarod, it's killer"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"This book was an eye opener. I know most characters were ficticious, but the events were real. My heart goes out to the indigenous people and eskimos. White colonialists were real monsters, whether Russian or American. Greed is prevailent, no matter at what cost. The book was awesome. Alaska created history from the being. It really captured me from start to finish, and I long to go a see the cities of Sitka, Juneau, Nome. And visit the Aleution Islands. No one has ever explained to me how the the earths plates moved to form continents and mountains - until now, in plain language. The way James A. Michener tells the story of the wild animals and the sockeye salmon is as though they were human beings. Great Book, Great Read. A treasure."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Every Canadian should read this book as our northern frontier people and the NWMP come out very well in it, especially when you compare it to the chaos that reined in Alaska for so many years after America purchased it. I found this book extremely entertaining and of course the similarities of climate and people in Alaska to our Yukon makes it seem like almost like a history of our northern territories as well. Anyone who is a Michener should not consider their readings of his works complete until they read this book. It's more of fictionalized than a lot of Michener's books, but that makes it even more entertaining."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"A must for anyone planning a trip to the North Land. Even though it is a work of fiction, it describes the social and political attitiudes of the time and gives great insite into our 50th state"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Alaska by James Michener, March 30, 2002Reviewer: Cathy Sweetser from MaineI gave the rating a 1 star since I haven't heard it yet.

I think that you could not tell a story of such magnitude without padding it out with fictional characters, therefore making it somewhat of an epic. Unfortunately I have only read about half of it and then I then went looking for a kindle version of it as I was finding it hard to hold and enjoy as I have arthritis of the hands. I would love to finish it in the Kindle version please."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Given the author, one can anticipate a thoroughly researched, meticulously worded chronological story laced with historical events, and famous people. Go beyond that shallow analysis, and witness a man's passion for storytelling. Absorb his unbounded zeal for a hostile, mysterious corner of our universe and the people who carved it into a habitable land.At a time when the world's attention has been drawn to our 49th state through the shenanigans of Sarah Palin, Lisa Murkowski, big oil, multiple reality television series (Deadliest Catch, Alaska State Troopers, Coast Guard Alaska, etc.), and the US government, we should all strive to learn what makes Alaskans tick. They seem to be filled with an indefatigable spirit, unique perspectives, and childlike openness. The social mores that govern our structured lives have no place in the wide-open frontier of Alaska.Michener discovered those free spirits, those focused, driven personalities, and he painted them against the bold and vivid backgrounds of an untamed land. If you have an interest in Florida, read Patrick D. Smith's wonderful novel, \\"A Land Remembered.\\" Then, read Michener's \\"Alaska.\\" Discover deeply embedded personal characteristics of all mankind that enable simple people to achieve wondrous results while just trying to survive in a hostile world. You will learn a lot about yourself."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Just loved this book and could not put it down... for those who love Indigenous Characters, early history of North America... great reading... I wished there were more like this..."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I just returned from a trip to Alaska and realized I had never read James Michener's book.

There is a lot of historical information in this book that will create a good background of knowledge for me when I take a trip to Alaska in the near future."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"For a guy who doesn't like to read a lot it was interesting to me that I didn't want a 1,000 page book to end! I love Michener's style of bringing you through the eons and across generations, but I often found myself with a tear in my eye when saying goodbye to a character.This book is a great read for anyone planning a visit to Alaska - better than studying a Fodor's guide. You'll learn about the geology, history, and resolve of the people who inhabited one of the great places on the earth."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"James Michener is a true master. I recommend Alaska to every human being on this earth."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Without trepidation i would have to say that this is one of the best books that i have ever read. I have never been there but this book makes me want to go. highly recommend."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Michener has a unique ability for making history come to life in the most interesting of fashions. This book is no exception. I started this book feeling like I knew very little about Alaska and its value. By the time I finished I felt I like an expert on the history and the imense value of &quot;Seward's Folly.&quot;The characters come to life in memorable fashion. One character that I am puzzled by is Captain Michael Healy. For about 40 years he was the law in Alaska, battling pirates, rescuing lost seamen, importing reindeer from Siberia to ease starvation in Alaska. The reason I am puzzled is that Healy is one of the greatest Black Americans, with a &quot;folklore&quot; level history and virtually nobody has heard of him."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Author James A. Michener has conceived and written an epic novel about the land we now know as Alaska. Using his characteristic writing style of starting at the very beginning (in this case, with native people living on the coastland we now know of as Eastern Russia) and then developing the story generation after generation through his rich and interesting characters, Michener tells the complete story of Alaska. The reader learns how Alaska was first settled, what animals first roamed its lands, what the native Inuit people were like in their unique culture and how they survived in the harsh environment, how the Americans bought the land from Russia, how the gold rush happened and what it was like for gold prospectors in the unforgiving winderness, and finally, it tells the story of the multi-ethnic peoples of Alaska, and this perhaps is Michener's strength in story-telling. Michener, as he has done in other novels, again proves his writing has a prophetic nature to it, as the last chapter details an earthquake in the Pacific Ocean that sends a Tsunami wall of water to assault the shore or Alaska, eerily reminiscient of the tsunami that devastated Sri Lanka recently.Yes, the novel is long - over 1,000 pages, but it is still an absorbing page-turner. Each chapter is a mini-novel in itself and tells the story of a particular generation of people in Alaska's development. Michener has a knack of creating and developing characters that are both interesting and believable and this is his greatest strength as a writer. The reader comes to care about these fictious charcters as though they are living breathing realities, and in a sense, the charcters are \\"real\\", as Michener's painstaking research enabled him to form his charcters based on historical personages.\\"Alaska\\" is a marvelous book, and for those that are into long sweeping novels, this is a book for you. It seems that Michener's writing style either fascinates or tries the patience of his readers. Michener goes into great detail in explaining the lives of his characters and some readers are impatient with his extensive prose and are apt to put his books down before finishing them. I happen to love his writing style and appreciate the detail, as it paints vivid word pictures in my mind. Michener is one of my favorite authors, for each of his books takes me to a particular place or culture, and it is as though I am actually viewing that culture, its people, and the land first-hand. I have learned a wealth of information about distant lands thanks to the writing of James A. Michener. These are places I may never visit in my life, but thanks to Michener, it is as though I have been there through his writing.I most certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the land and people of Alaska, or to one who is contemplating a trip to Alaska (the bok makes compelling reading even if you have no intention of going to Alaska!). Once you read Michener's \\"Alaska\\", you will have a tremendous appreciation for the hardships that the settlers endured to \\"tame\\" this great land. I guarantee you will always remember \\"Alaska\\" for the rest of your life.I highly recommend this book!Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"This is the first &quot;thick&quot; book I ever finished. Having put-it-down-itis, I avoided books of great magnitude. Not so in this case. I had attempted to read &quot;Chesapeake&quot; &amp; very much enjoyed the first ten chapters. I liked Michener's style: taking a specific geographic area and tell it's story through individual people occupying it's space, combining fiction with reality. He captured the mystique Alaska holds from the forming of the land masses to the present day.He writes of woolly mammoths being hunted by early man through the mammoths' eyes, and then the following chapter through the perspective of the hunters. Michener conveys the struggle of survival from both sides with great emotion. He follows the speculative history of early nomadic tribes following their food supply across the Bering Strait.Mr. Michener then reveals early voyages from people such as Captain Cook and how they survived harsh winters while their ships were frozen in the Alaskan seas.Then Russian explorers establish military forts and desire to &quot;save the barbaric savages&quot; they discover when they arrive. Following are the bloody battles they fought with them.The book unfolds further with Seward's Folly and the Gold Rush and of how the United States government persuaded some of its more adventuresome citizens into creating a new life in the last American frontier. This book also reveals the continuing struggle between the &quot;progress&quot; of corporations using Alaska's natural resources such as fish and oil and how it affects the Native inhabitants and how companies in Seattle &quot;the gateway to Alaska&quot; took advantage of it's close proximity at the expense of the Alaskan people.The late Mr. Michener writes through the unique perspectives of the characters he creates and borrows from history. If I continue, this will be as long as the book!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I first read Michener's Alaska while visiting my brother in Alaska in 1989, in all I spent 6 weeks there. I have since read it several more times despite its length. I do this because it is a very good book and because its vivid scenery reminds me of one of the most majestic places I have ever visited.If you are not familiar with Michener's style he tells the tale of a particular area from its geologic formation up to modern times. In this he starts his tale and weaves it through the lives of subsequent and remotely related characters.With Alaska, Michener starts with some Mastodans and then works it through the first migrants coming over the ice bridge. From there he covers Russian colonization, the gold rush, and onto modern times.Each generation has its own intricacies and its own stories. All of these stories are highly interesting and blend well together.My only problem with Michener is that he is more interested in the story than the history. With this he takes too many liberties in adapting actual events to fit his circumstances. It is fun to read but it ends there. Do not feel you have gained any great historical insights from his readings."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I purchased &quot;Alaska&quot; by Michener to gain insight into the history and culture of this land. This was in preparation for my family's Alaksan cruise. The book fulfilled that purpose above and beyond. But, in addition, I found myself immersed in the story of this land and its people which spanned thousands of years up to present day. I have not read a book recently where I found myself attached to the characters as I did in &quot;Alaska&quot;. I was truly sorry when the book came to an end."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"This book is among my favorites. I have read most or many of his books twice and always find them to be entertaining and educational. I keep a copy of Hawaii, Alaska, and Texas near at hand.This is a nice 850 page historical novel that gives a very detailed picture of the evolution of a great state. Alaska is one of the last places to have a very clean and unspoiled environment where fish can still be seen to just jump out of the ocean.Michener's books use a common plot formula that starts out by telling a story that reflects and utilizes the actual historical developments and time lines and people of a region. He starts back with the early native peoples that came from Asia. He adds in settlers, bush pilots, fisherman, salmon canning factories, business people, etc. He adds in more characters and phases out others - it is all fiction - as the dates move forward to current times (mid 20th century).When I decided to review this book I was not certain if people were still interested in buying this book but I was pleased to see that there is still interest at Amazon.com in buying and reading this great story.After this read this book I visited Alaska. If you have the resources I recommend a fishing trip to Alaska assuming that you like fishing - or just a wilderness trip. Alaska is cool even in the summers, but the clear waters, mountains and all the unspoiled wilderness and animals make it a special place. If you cannot go, then read this book. If you can go, read this first.Good read and a good gift."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"So I picked up this book because my father-in-law loves Michener and we were fortunate enough to take an Alaskan cruise this summer. You see the book everywhere in Alaska, and I'm a fan of historical fiction.For over 1000 pages, this book is a bit of a dissapointment. When you're finished, you feel as though you know a good deal about our largest state. This was great, but the drawback is that you don't feel like the story has an coherency. To be fair to the author, this would be very difficult to do when attempting to cover the history of a region starting with the dawn of history. How can a writer connect the life of a primitive Eskimo to a modern day one? Perhaps it would have been more manageable to focus on one period of history and tell the story well.The other questionable aspect of this book is the way in which the author seems to \\"cram\\" in as many unique elements of Alaskan life and history as possible. For example, no book about Alaska would be complete without a reference to the Iditerod. Michener rushes this element into the book at the very end with little connection to the rest of the story.All in all, if you'd like a general overview of the region, this would be a good choice. But if you're looking for a well crafted story, you might want to avoid this one."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"As always with Michener, the description of the locale and people is outstanding. This book takes you from the very beginning of the territory of Alaska to the present time. I was very interested in the Russians who settled in Alaska and the environmental issues that were raised even then. This is a long book, typically Michener, but it is divided into sections that allow you to start and stop (if you are able) at your convenience. I like Michener's works because I always learn something, as well as enjoying a wonderful story. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Mr. Michener is known for his lengthy descriptions, but if you stick with it, you will be rewarded with a great deal of historical knowledge about Alaska. I have also read \\"Journey\\" so I know more about Alaska than perhaps I ever cared to know. Michener really brings his writing talents to the table in the final chapter about modern Alaska. The basic issue in the final chapter is the conflict between modern culture and traditional culture. Kendra, a teacher of Eskimos from Utah, ends up having to make a marriage choice between an idealistic lawyer who supports Alaska's traditional or subsistence cultures, Jeb Keeler, and the grandson of a Seattle business executive who works as a scientific worker on an iceberg and ranin theIditarod dogsled race, Rick Venn. Perhaps surprisingly, she chooses Venn, mostly because of his noble behavior in the dogsled race, when he sacrifices his chance to win to aid a fallen comrade.The third main character in the final chapter is Poley Markham, also a lawyer from Phoenix, who attempts to take advantage of the numerous legal problems that arise in connexion with the Alaska Native Settlements Act,making himself instantly wealthy. He is on the side of modernism,unlike Jeb, and with his rather macho personality has a strong side- interest in hunting which he shares with Jeb, and which is the final chapter's main subplot(hunting the\\"The Alaskan Big Eight\\"). There are others --the scientific expert on tsunamis is an important one. The ethical questions Kendra must face in connection with her Eskimo students are touching and are well developed. Michener occasionally uses tragedy if it serves his purposes, as it does here. A suicide and an unexpected death are symptoms revealing many of the problems of traditional cultures.We are also repeatedly told how and why everything is more expensive in Alaska, due to the Jones Act of 1920. The lawyer Jeb Wheeler is finally killed by a tsunami in the climax of the book, perhaps also revealing Michener's views of liberal lawyers.All chapters are similarly developed so that by the end one gets a real feeling for Alaska's traditional cultures, and a lotmore too. On the scientific side, we get geology, anthropology, oceanography, biology, including getting inside the minds of mammoths and salmon. We are introduced to a great deal of Russian colonial history in the early chapters as it relates to Alaska;to a great deal of seafaring lore including the hunt for sea otter and seal pelts, and to the destruction of the Eskimo's way of life by alcoholism , courtesy of an unscrupulous sea captain. We go on several whale hunts and are given details about them and the harpoons. By the time the Americans enter the picture, we are ready for the poor management; all the swindlers connected with the Gold Rush, which gets a thorough treatment, focusing on the Klondike and on Nome. Michener carries the characters from this period, and their progeny, through to the end of the book. There is then a long chapter on the salmon industry which tells us how the industry unscrupulously took advantage of the Jones Act of 1920, which puts all economic power in the hands of Seattle businessmen at the expense of native Alaskans. We are introduced to Sam Bigears of the Tlingit tribe, his daughter Nancy, and to Ah Ting, the Chinese worker who can repair machines but who is ultimately replaced by machines. In the next-to-last chapter we learn of the Japanese invasion of the Aleutian islands during World War II and the building of the Alcan Highway, as well as to the adventures of Leroy Flatch, the \\"bush pilot\\". There are numerous other sub-plots, and we also get a real feel both for Alaska's oceans, glaciers, icebergs, mountains, vocanoes, and earthquakes."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Written in 1998, Alaska is true to James Michener's mode of sweeping epic, historical facts and memorable characters. I personally love books about Alaska and because of its length, I purposely took my time reading it, looking forward each evening to opening the pages and losing myself once more in this special world.This is the story of Alaska in all its glory. From the anthropological details of early animals and human beings, right up to the late 1980s, the main focus is on the last few hundred years. There are the early explorers who were awed by its majesty. There were the first Russian settlements with strong and courageous people. There was the gold rush. And the beginnings of the salmon industry. The horrors of colonialism. The lawlessness. The quest for statehood. And the politics.Most of all though, it is the story of a place. And because the timeline of the book spans hundreds of years, the characters are interesting but somewhat one-dimensional. We follow their family lines, but they come and go, leaving legacies for future generations but never really being developed to their fullest.I loved the book for what it was though, a background to all the other books I've been reading about Alaska lately. Thankfully, the author informed the reader in a chapter by chapter prologue exactly what was based on fact and what was truly fiction. Yes, someone did once ride a bike from Dawson to Nome in the dead of winter. And yes, some of the deeds of the early sea captains were taken from actual records.Again, because the book covers many centuries, there is a limit to how deeply he could go into a theme. For example, I would have liked more about the different native peoples. It's impossible to do it all. But James Michener sure did try.I do feel that this book is a worthy read and I do recommend it. Give yourself time though to let yourself be swept into this wonderful story of Alaska. There's certainly a lot to learn."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"The Best!!! A compelling, brilliantly woven story that explains how Alaska evolved from the days of the mastodons to its current environmental and social justice issues. The BIG PICTURE as only Michener can display it. This book explains the ethnic, geological, zoological, and political roots of *all* Alaska's current predicaments. Very educational and a fabulous can't-put-it-down read into the bargain. If you can only read one book about Alaska, this is the one!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I am a huge fan of James Michener, and I absolutely love his writing style and the way he develops characters. This is the second time reading Alaska, and I enjoyed it as much the second time as I did the first. My only complaint is that it is not available in a Kindle version. My book is is about 8 inches thick, and the print is microscopic, so it makes it very difficult to read and to get through.In this book, Michener goes back to the beginning of time, and explains to the reader how the large land mass we call Alaska was formed. He describes how different groups wandered across the \\"land bridge\\", and the difficulties they felt when trying to settle. It explains Russian exploration, the infamous Chilkoot Pass, and interweaves families of different origins and does an awesome job of tying them all together. My only complaint with the writing is that often times, beloved characters just disappear. One can assume they died, but I wish there was some more finality.Not for the faint of heart, or someone looking for a quick read. For the love of all that is holy, Amazon, get more of Michener on Kindle!!!!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I loved Michener before this book and he has now cemented his place as my favorite author.Why?Because he gives you all the action of an author like Wilbur Smith or Sidney Sheldon yet gives you a deep understanding of the history & culture of the places he writes about.Furthermore his books are easy reading, even though you think a book over 1000 pages could be challenging or a hard slog he writes in an easy to read style. He doesn't ponce around in a pretentious way putting in a heap of obscure long words to try and show how intellectual & clever he is. He writes so everybody can enjoy.Alaska may seem like a boring subject matter, but you'd be surprised how interesting it really is."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I learned so much I never knew about the migrations of people and animals, about the climatic changes in Alaska and about the Russian presence there. I learned a lot I wished I didn't learn about the truly horrific exploitation of native populations, but I suppose that goes with world history.But most of all, this book was a wonderful distraction from daily life. It was, for a short time, my get-away. It's hard to find a good book that just takes you away from thoughts of work and life and Alaska is just such an adventure to get lost in."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Great, expansive rendition in historical fiction of the turbulent History of the great state of Alaska.A must read if you are planning to go or even thinking about going to visit the area!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"One of his best, if not the best. Great characters, ideas and places that will make your mind soar. Loved it."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Mitchner's section on Russian Alaska, especially his depictions of \\"Fr Vassili\\" and Governor Baranoff are so inaccurate that I would not call this \\"historical\\" at all. I quit reading after finishing this section.Baranoff's character was not nearly as noble as Mitchner portrays it, and his depiction of Fr. Vassili and the Orthodox Church is completely inaccurate and the liberties he takes are completely unnecessary. Had he taken his depiction of the church by using other real figures from the 1794 mission, such as Archimandrite Joseph, Fr. Juvenaly, and the Monk Herman, he would have had a wealth of real drama. The Russian Mission often found itself in conflict with Governor Baranoff, who did not end the practice of removing the men during hunting/fishing season, and the Russian missionaries were not out to \\"Russify\\" the native populations. The Russian mission's great legacy in Alaska was the attempts to Christianize the native culture by translating the Gospel and the Russian Orthodox Liturgy into native languages. Their attempts were opposed at every turn by Governor Baranoff, and after Archimandrite Joseph died in a shipwreck,Fr Herman (Canonized in 1970 as St. Herman of Alaska) is still beloved by the Aleut peoples for his efforts to protect them from the abuses of Governor Baranof and the Russian American company, these efforts forced him to flee Kodiak to Spruce Island to escape threats of violence from Russian officials.If you want a better idea of how the Russian Mission actually worked, read Michael Oleksa's \\"Orthodox Alaska: A Theology of Mission.\\"Fr Simeon B JohnsonSt. Nicholas Orthodox Church,Juneau AK"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"James Michener has a style of writing that is superior, but takes some time to get use to. He brings you inside of the characters and you become completely absorbed by the story. I hate to put the book down. You have to stay with the story in the beginning because you will be rewarded in the end. I love the parts where he gives you insights into what the animals are thinking. You see Alaska from all possible angles. He is honest and I love the way he brings the whole history of Alaska together into one book. Do not be intimidated by the size of a book, remember, never judge a book by its cover! This is an excellent read!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I usually only read true history books - not novels. Other reviews said it would help me understand the history of Alaska before we went there on our trip this summer. That was the case.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"I am prejudiced when it comes to Michener novels. I have read most of them and its just a good fit for me for I love history. If you have not read one of his novels, I would suggest you start with Caribbean. Its relatively short and if you like it, you can then graduate to Hawaii and Space and the other great reads. He not for everyone but those who like him, love him. I am finishing up Chesapeake."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Starting all the way back before Alaska was fully shaped until the BIG earthquake in the past century. WOW!!! I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to know what would happen next. Why is Russia so prominent in Alaska? Where did the eskimos come from? All these questions are answered plus you get love stories, bad guys, good buys, great ladies, and descriptions so descriptive you'll want to get a blanket because you'll feel like you are there. I've recommended this book to several friends who loved it and recommended it to others."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Michner writes about places most of us are curious about yet don't know much about. Alaska is our most remote state and this novel gives you a sense what it was like to brave the harsh conditions and establish settlements. I find Michner's characters a varied bunch in that they range from superficial to more in-depth interesting personalities. In general though they seem exist to portray the land in which they reside.It isn't a masterpiece and somtimes the story drags. However it is a good way to delve into Alaskan life."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Another great epic from Michener. You may quibble over whether a wooly Mammoth would have really had those thoughts, but overall it's a highly interesting and informative book."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"Perhaps non-Alaskans are more taken with Michener's portrait of the state than those of us who live here, since we experience its grandeur and special essence every day. Nonetheless, for a cheechako, the author does an admirable job of conveying facts and feelings about the 49th state. While there is always the danger with historical novels that readers will not know where facts end and fancy begins, the historical backdrop is well-researched and essentially accurate.Like other Michener works of this variety, the book weaves the stories of several families over a number of generations, and in doing so illustrates how today's Alaskans often have unusual family trees and complex cultural traditions. Throughout the book he develops some of the same themes that run through the state today, including the struggle to break free from the almost colonial status we once enjoyed at the hands of marginal government officials and outside corporate interests, the pride of being apart and different, and challenge/blessing of a uniquely diverse population.The reader may think that the characters are \\"larger than life\\", but not necessarily so. Alaska has more than its share of vivid, grand, and heroic citizens whose stories could fill many long cold nights. While no substitute for a first-hand Alaska experience, Michener's Alaska-sized novel is a wonderful way to experience the state at a distance, and undoubtedly has whetted many people's appetites to come and see for themselves."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"it's a wonderful book that I have read before and have always wanted to own!!!"},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"\\"Alaska\\" is a well-researched, well-told, 900-page story of the exploration and settlement of our nation's 49th state, with a characteristically Michener-like blend of fact with fiction, breathing life into an otherwise-dry train of historical events: geologic beginnings with \\"clashing terranes\\" a billion years ago, the first human settlers who wandered eastward from Eurasia 14,000 years ago when glaciation raised the polar ice caps and exposed a land bridge connecting present-day Alaska and Siberia, Vitus Bering's exploratory voyages sponsored by Peter the Great in the 1700s, Russia's controversial $7.2 million sale of Alaska to the U.S. in 1867, the Yukon and Nome gold rushes of the late 1890s, the establishment of salmon canneries in Alaska's southeast by profiteering Seattle-based companies in the early 1900s, the government-supported \\"seeding\\" of Matanuska Valley through relocation of starving settlers from Minnesota during the Depression years, the entanglement of the Aleutian Islands in battles against the Japanese during World War II, Alaska's political fight for statehood in 1958, and the impact of the discovery of Prudhoe Bay oil on the lives of North Slope native Alaskans through the 1980s (book published in 1988). True to form, Michener weaves together ostensibly disparate events into a captivating, colorful parade of multi-generational characters, often so endearing that you'll want to cheer and cry alongside these memorable pioneers in their courageous and spirited struggle to eke out a living from, understand and exploit Alaska's harsh and wild, expansive and endlessly enticing, resource-rich and rewarding frontier.Superlatives aside, compared to Michener's \\"Hawaii\\" (published in 1959), I find \\"Alaska\\" to carry a weaker, less hopeful message. \\"Hawaii\\" establishes a powerful, encouraging theme of how cultural diversity--despite our being inevitably encumbered by parochial beliefs, social prejudice and economic avarice--has the very real potential to \\"bear new fruit.\\" On the other hand, \\"Alaska\\" unfortunately fails to lift humanity higher. In their unbounded greed for otter and seal skins, early Russian merchants turn native men into their slaves, while abusing and raping native women. With few exceptions, American whalers are ethically no better, devastating entire native villages through exploitative sale of rum and guns. During the gold rush, lawless settlers from the mainland U.S. selfishly bend mining rules in their own favor, stripping away claims from Norwegians, Siberians, Eskimos and others who got there first. Seattle businessmen extract tons of salmon from Alaskan waters, offering neither employment nor compensation to the native people. Even when oil taxes bring wealth to native Eskimos and Indians, the intricacies of the Settlement Act allow lawyers and accountants from the \\"lower 48\\" to line their own pocketbooks by charging exorbitant rates for professional services, effectively pilfering assets from the native people. Ultimately, it seems that, although natives now have their snowmobiles and opportunities that college education offers, they remain lost between the \\"native\\" and \\"modern\\" worlds, unable to derive adequate fulfillment from either and, too often, sadly resorting to alcoholism and suicide to escape from their emotionally devastating dilemma.In the last section of the novel, the debate between the two lawyers, Jeb Keeler and Poley Markham, while mountain goat hunting, reveals Michener's sentiment: Jeb speaks out for helping Alaskan natives retain their ownership of land and maintain a subsistence lifestyle, while Poley is eager to \\"pick them off\\" for his own personal profit when natives on the verge of bankruptcy become forced to liquidate their corporate assets to pay off accumulated debt. When an unexpected submarine earthquake unleashes a massive tsunami, Poley succeeds in scrambling up the mountainside, while Jeb is consumed by the swiftly retreating waters and washed out to sea, issuing a final cry: \\"Go it, Poley. You win!\\" Interpretation: in with the new and exploitative, out with the old and traditional--whether we like it or not. In the 30 years between the publication of \\"Hawaii\\" and \\"Alaska,\\" did Michener's youthful optimism darken into a more pessimistic realism, or is the ending of \\"Alaska\\" just not as carefully composed? The optimist in me suggests that Michener rushed into delivering a half-baked ending to \\"Alaska,\\" when he could have (and should have!) put more effort into reaching a more profound conclusion. From Michener, the masterful writer of historical fiction, I would expect a message with more far-reaching impact, particularly after all the years of research and drafting that certainly went into the novel's production."},{"Title":"Alaska","review":"An absolutely amazing \\"read\\" that has kept me up too many late nights. Very well written with excellent historical research and such wonderful character development that it is hard to remember that it is fiction.

It really makes you want to find out more about the people and places that make Alaska the wonderful place it is. The characters are well developed and the places well described. This is easily one of Michener's best books. You'll visit Russia, the Yukon, The Aleutian Islands and even Hawaii. You'll meet mystic Shamans, Canadian Mounties, Gold Prospecters and Whale Hunters.

The book is great in that the author covers most of the transport processes as they apply to biological systems and provide numerous references and useful physical property data. Its nice to see how traditional transport concepts can be applied to problems for a system which everyone of us is very familiar with, namely the human body. The only criticism is that the book does not cover heat transfer and its applications to physiological systems. Luckily my professor provided handouts and supplimental material to the lecture. One of the books he used was the fairly old text by Cooney, &quot;Biomedical Engineering Principles: An introduction to Fluid, Heat and Mass Transport Processes&quot;.

If you are old enough to remember the the buzz around Vatican 2 it was quite exciting but not too many knew exactly what it meant and of course everyone was being profoundly impacted by the popular values of the age around them.The book is also an expose of another priest who while reaping the benefits of being a clergy member was not only not living up to the demands of the priesthood but was living contrary to them.I thought this book was well worth buying."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"Like many who are outsiders to Roman Catholicism, the idea of celibacy and leaving vows for family life is a fascinating subject. Some of the details of Catholic doctrine and practice had me rapidly skimming to the pages ahead. But the book is well documented and very well written. Getting to the parts that interested me, the vows, the marriage, the abuse scandals and the children's ultimate confusion on their places in Catholic world are stories made more fascinating by their \\"foreignness\\" to my experiences."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"This memoir by the son of a Priest and ex-Nun is fascinating, as a testament to faith as well as a painful lesson when that belief turns into abuse. Mr. Manseau paints an exacting portrait of his beloved father and mother, and their journey through life, as seen from his eyes. I was personally captivated by the story, when I found myself walking through a familiar set of doors, into a Seminary that I had prepared to attend. Through I decided to continue in secular life, I was hooked into this set of biographies, into the 'path not taken.' Mr. Manseau is very sympathetic to his parent's belief, never judgmentmental or opinionated, almost like an outside observer. His father, an ordained minister, never doubts his mission as a pastor, even against the strictures of the Church that ordained him. Both parents remained devoted to their Catholic heritage, even when it is shockingly revealed that sexual abuse has been a part of one of their lives. The courage and convicitons of his mother and father in spite of this destructive intrusion in their early lives, are a testament to goodness, human endurance and mercy."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"\\"Vows\\" captures the fifties and sixties when the Catholic Church was at it's peak of enrolling young religious who had been brought up on CYO activities, street priest, casual relationships. Families were nieve to the possibilities of priest and nuns doing harm to their children. They also pushed their children into religious life for that would insure them in favor with the Lord.The first years of training demanded blind obedience to the rules of the religious orders without any questioning from the canidates. There was not this great \\"welcoming\\" activity by other religious but one of silence and internal prayer. Idle talk was discouraged and movements about the buildings had to have a purpose.The book details the love that two indiviuals had not only for each other but in doing God's work outside the religious house. They drifted apart from the church for religious restrictions did not encourage the long hours working with youth or persons in need of help. They realized that to do God's will they must separate themselves from religious life.There is a theme throught that the priest still had a longing for being an accepted member of the clergy and goes at great lengths secure or acknowlede his status with church leaders.A must read book that delves into the mind of clerical thinking, personal ambitions and conflict with authority."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"This my second purchase of this book. The first one was purchased over a year ago. However, after reading the book I loaned it to a mumber of people, all thought it wasn't fantastic book. Somewhere along the way the book was lost, therefore I needed to purchased a second book of \\"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son\\" for my own library."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"This superbly written book is hard to put down and deserves to be widely read.The author tells the captivating true story of how his Catholic parents, both having recently embarked on traditionally celibate careers in religious service, found each other and decided to marry.The most fascinating aspect of their decision to marry is that they view their union not as a fall from grace but as a prerequisite for serving their faith effectively.The book is not only a riveting memoir but also an excellent contemporary history of the Catholic Church, especially from the vantage point of Boston - the epicenter of American Catholicism."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"I bought found this book on a clearance table at our local bookstore, I didn't have high hopes, thinking I would get a prude peek into a Nun's or Priest's life. I couldn't put this book down, as a non catholic I expected to be lost in the dogma but the writing and author's personal perspective on the story kept me turning the pages.Manseau provides detailed stage setting and influencing factors as to why his parents followed their callings, and independently gave up their vows. As the Manseau family is affiliated and afflicted by the sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, this book is fair and non judgmental. I must say I wasn't expecting the Momma Manseau revelation and search for justice.I learned a lot about the Catholic Church and one family's tireless faith."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"Having come from a Catholic background as a child, this book was extremely enlightening. Worth the read, especially if you have knowledge of the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"I laughed, I cried, I cringed, I jumped for joy...was I really conducting research for my Master's thesis?Manseau's memoir was one of the thirty or so primary texts I read for my thesis on the spiritual lives of Catholics in their twenties and thirties. While many in this sample were well-written, few were as pleasurable to read as Vows. And no other matched it in potency.In spite of his ostensibly hallowed provenance (as the son of a priest and a nun), Manseau's story turns out to be one told by contemporary young adult Catholics from all over the U.S. (though the bleak Boston backdrop adds a certain pathos to this one). It is the story of a developmental journey from childhood enchantment with the faith, to distance and disillusionment in emergent adulthood, to a post-critical revisioning of one's Catholic heritage in young adulthood.For anyone who is interested in the faith lives of contemporary young Catholics, or who simply enjoys reading powerful spiritual autobiography, Vows will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"I suppose that some of the theological perspectives presented here could seem enlightening - to those who cannot remember 1969 or so. As one who indeed can, the tired, one-dimensional fifth gospel of William Manseau, which his son, however rebellious, seems to preach, is a total bore.One wonders if, during Peter's university studies in religion, he gave serious attention to ascetic theology, the history of consecrated life, or any exploration of celibacy (which certainly has a long history of being seen as valuable in traditions other than the Christian). The constant harping on sex, marriage, children (real or 'adopted' in a figurative sense), sexual abuse, and so forth seemed endless. The idea that the flesh is evil, or that sexuality and the existence of women are denied, was endless - and the idea, for example, that Trappists (for whom the author shows respect, in an attitude at odds with his depiction of most clergy) can pretend women do not exist is ludicrous.The author's bitterness, narrow mindedness, and cynicism is also constant and irritating - one can practically see a sneer on every other page. All bishops seem wicked and phoney. The entry into novitiate, with young women garbed as brides, \\"must have seemed like a joke.\\" (Indeed, it did not. Those too young to remember such actual ceremonies should recall the clear delight in the scenes from \\"Dead Man Walking,\\" which featured films of Helen Prejean.) This apparent \\"American Catholic Church,\\" which one receives the impression was minted in Boston and perfected in the 1960s, eschews and scorns anything \\"Old World,\\" even whilst admitting that European theologians were insightful.The few merits the book has are in the author's describing his confused, personal spiritual journey. One also can feel empathy for one who had an avant garde, \\"revolutionary\\" Catholicism, with liturgies at one's family table, and the pressure of having a father who is trying to make a case for \\"rights\\" to marriage.Religious life, such as that which his mother entered, was tragic indeed if there was no ascetic element - merely an idea of being a workforce. However, the presumption that this was universal, at least in the New England area, seems excessive. (I know nothing of Boston, but one would think that religious congregations may have had some attention to more than America and bricks and mortar.) Mary's case is especially tragic - alcoholic father, sexual abuse by a priest - but there is no positive word in the entire book about religious life (save for the limited respect for the Trappists, which includes no recognition of the value of their vows.)Though the author writes from personal experience with his parents, most of the ideas that seemed revolutionary were one dimensional and clich&eacute;d, and that, combined with the totally negative depiction of priests and bishops, makes this one of the most misleading books about Catholicism I have seen."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"While this book has some interesting content, it just drones on and on. My impression of this book in one word: monotone. We chose this for our book club and not ONE person could finish it. Ouch!"},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"The author clearly has taken too many creative writing classes. This 300+ page book could have easily been done in 100 pages. Unfortunately the author describes every person and object in painful detail. This quality may be good for a crime scene investigator but not here. Also very confusing on how he refers to his parents by their first names in one paragraph and then by Mom and Dad in the next. Some interesting points were made but they get lost in page after page of babble.I could say I was disappointed with this book but in the spirit of the author I will say:I read the book. It was made of paper and had words in it. My Caucasian hands lifted it an opened the book slowly. My brown eyes poured over each word as the hours passed. My reading light was white, white like freshly fallen snow. Hours passed and I continued reading. My brown eyes glistening while concentrating on their subject. My mind absorbing every word. Eventually I finished. I placed the paper book on a brown wood table. The table wasn't a dark brown but more of a honey color. It rested on a floor. A tile floor with a slight gloss. I believe it may have been marble. Perhaps Italian marble at that. And as I sat their in my emerald green sofa I realized. This book was a bit too wordy and thus disappointing."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"Full disclosure: I'm a friend of Peter's and even co-authored an earlier book with him. But that's why you should trust me -- I've seen this guy develop as a writer as only a former collaborator can. I always thought he was very, very good -- but who knew he'd write the first really significant book about American Catholicism of the decade? Vows challenges the Church, no doubt. But it also demands of non-Catholics a reconsideration of how faith, faithlessness, and sex converge; how a story of a scandal is really a history of ideas; and how love and ideology clash and reshape one another.Vows is a smart book on the surface and a brilliant book beneath, a theological treatise well-disguised as a memoir that turns out to be a thriller. His arguments are more subtle -- and more moving -- than a brief against priestly celibacy. They are also natural arguments, which is to say that they emerge for the reader from the flow of a story and not from a didactic declaration. The most stunning achievement of this book is that its intellectual depth is matched so perfectly by its narrative force.The final chapters of the book, in which Peter's mother, a former nun, hunts down the priest who abused her, are as gripping as a crime novel even as they present original ideas about the meanings of vengeance, justice, the Church as an institution, and the Church as an body of believers, prey to all the same weaknesses and failings as the flesh.That shouldn't limit this book to those who think about religion. It is every bit as much a story of a family bound together, uneasily, by its loyalty to an institution that rejects it. It's the story of individual lives amidst the swirl of complicated, often dangerous beliefs -- about God, of course, but also about duty and promises and freedom.Vows is a great and important book."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"Frankly, I didn't expect much from Vows. So many religion-based memoirs end up suffocating the reader with jargon and emotion. Others focus on internal struggles that lead to snooze time.But once started on Vows, I wanted to keep going. Manseau displays a dazzling array of writing skills, moving flawlessly back and forth between his father the priest and his mother the nun, and from present to past. And Manseau has a gift of seeing the broader context of a story about ordinary people: a young man and a young woman, encouraged to \\"enter religion\\" in an era when vocations were higher than they've ever been, before or since, in the US.Manseau reveals the truth behind the numbers. Some applicants felt truly called to the religious life; others had a little help from well-meaning mentors. And ultimately we learn that his mother's early religious history included stories of abuse that now seem all too commonplace.A true storyteller, Manseau emphasizes the ironies of his life. By an odd series of coincidences and mistakes, his parents met in Roxbury and married. They remained loyal to the Catholic church, but their children rebelled. Manseau played video games while pretending to attend services - and grabbed a parish bulletin to take home to keep the peace.The last third of the book presents an unsparing but often hilarious tale of Manseau's encounter with religion during his college years at University of Massachusetts. Manseau should be admired for me keeping awake for page after page of college memories: discarding an archeology major and digging for religion instead of artifacts. He avoids yet another trite \\"religious journey\\" story by focusing on the here-and-now, so that striking moments are presented with irony in the context of the mundane. I loved the story of the college student who complains to a roshi about her sore back. \\"Get a chair!\\" says the roshi, laughing.And of course Manseau discovers Thomas Merton, a Catholic author with unique ties to Eastern religion. If any text could convert Manseau, it would be Merton's Seven Storey Mountain. Instead, Manseau ventures to a Benedictine abbey, where he discovers that monastic life is more about mops and shovels than soulful prayer. His vocation question gets settled in a hilarious episode, previously described in a New York Times Lives column.Ultimately, we get three intricately woven story lines, just as the title promises, and each holds book-quality drama. His mother's horrendous dental treatment creates a vivid image of abuse that's especially horrifying by being so mundane. His father remains idealistic, refusing to give up his priestly status voluntarily. And we get behind-the-scenes glimpses of the abuse scandals that plagued the Boston churches, some involving priests that were seminary classmates with Peter's father.Their children are shaped by their parents' \\"ex\\" statuses. Peter's brother initially feels alienated but later realizes there are advantages when a dad is also a priest. And Peter himself becomes strong, self-aware, independent and open-minded, not to mention an amazing writer.It is hard to imagine Manseau writing future books that match the intensity and sheer brilliance of this one. But I hope he tries."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"\\"Vows\\" is the rare book that manages to seamlessly weave personal narrative with the larger issues of the day. Indeed, it explores perhaps the biggest questions we have regarding faith, identity, loyalty, strength, grace and parenthood, and how one family has tried to bring the answers to those questions into harmony.This is no attack from the outside. Manseau is not an iconoclast for the sake of iconoclasm. Rather he tells the story of the love of his parents and their love of the Church, loving it so much they needed to betray some of its historical dictates in the hopes of creating something even more profound.It also portrays the complexity of the 1960's as period in which individuals were exploring opportunities to make institutional changes through thoughtful, intellectual challenges. This view is often lost among the clich&eacute;s of flowerchildren and stock footage of Woodstock.And lastly, Manseau also pulls off a neat trick, managing to be funny and irreverent without ever losing respect for his subject. Who would think that you could refer to St. Augustine as \\"Mr. Singing-Farts,\\" with all the honor and esteem due a Doctor of the Church?It is an exceptional work."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"For someone as ill-informed about the Catholic Church in the United States as I am, I admittedly picked this book up somewhat naively, thinking it would be an edifying read. Little did I know that it would be an incisive, compelling page-turner with much larger implications.This is a tale of defiance, of resistance to an institution that refused to adapt itself to the changing climate of the 60s, and one man's plight to drag it kicking and screaming into the modern world, if not return it to its original form - where celibacy among priests was optional.The 60s history is captivating. The priest and nun met in the Roxbury area of Boston, during a tumultuous period in which race riots, fringe hippy movements, poverty, crime, alcoholism, and drugs were rife. Both were thrilled to 'bring the word to the streets', however unsavory this could be.This book is not a manifesto against celibacy, but a very moving personal memoir about a family caught in the crosshairs of scandal, borne of resistance to the blind acceptance of tradition and of the unwillingness of the members of the Catholic administration to acknowledge its more 'unseemly' underbelly.This book touched me because of something quite universal, yet increasingly rare: People willing to risk their livelihoods, their personal comforts, even their emotional well-being, for what they believe in. Although it is somewhat perplexing to me that the Manseaus remain proponents of an institution that won't have them or their children, perceived as \\"ex damnato coitu\\", their steadfast convictions and their son's fascinating account have earned my highest respect."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"Peter Manseau's \\"Vows\\" is firstly the story of his family: the reverberating crisis caused by the decisions of his father and mother, a priest and a nun, to fall in love and get married. But through his patient, well-researched, and reflective storytelling, he also manages to employ this fascinating family history as a microscope through which to analyze the persistence of human sexuality within an ecclesiastical body that treats it like a virus. He grounds the reader in the history of the American church, as well, drawing attention to all kinds of ethnic and demographic nuances that, as a non-Catholic, I was unaware of. Manseau's book contextualizes the current turmoil facing the Church. Without preaching or editorializing, he argues persuasively, through the accumulation of passionate detail, that the Church is essentially starving itself to death by refusing the nourishment that people like his parents have to offer--and that its futile attempt to quash the lifeforce amounts, with shocking frequency, to the criminal. At the same time, Manseau doesn't whitewash his parents, portraying them as the human beings they are, and letting his readers feel some of the tension their unusual experience inflicted on his own life. It is a personal story offered generously and bravely, and told with a great deal of beauty."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"It was a fitting choice that this student of archaeology decided to become a writer instead; he has the gift of detailing incidents for the laymen. Peter Manseau recounts his parents' early and current lives with amazing clarity and knowledge. Whoever deserves anonymity, the names are appropriately disregarded but the ones who require citation are properly and strongly quoted. In some parts the language evokes the bitterness felt by the parents and the writer himself. The book is so thoroughly arranged that the love story between the priest and the nun doesn't occur until approximately the middle of the book. As the title hints, the son's own experiences are contained in the writing therefore the later chapters are filled with the information. Peter Manseau is a wonderful narrator. Many times he would capture the reader's attention to the funny side of a happening no matter how subtle it is. It all arrives to a simple conclusion that the \\"people\\" of the Catholic Church are ordinary human beings just like everybody else. They have needs and wants as any other living person. Each of them possesses characteristics not different from their parishioners. Peter Manseau relates the struggle of two individuals close to him who truly believe in their religion but also fighting the law and order influenced by humans that are being imposed on their way of life. They see it as their right to do so. Since the two have a family, the children are also involved in their quandary. This is a viewpoint of the youngest son and it is an interesting perspective."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"A friend of mine is the daughter of a former priest and a former nun. Her family history is what attracted me to this book...however, \\"Vows\\" is very different from what I thought it would be. As its title states, this book is a true story about the author's parents. It isn't a romantic tale of a man and woman who fall in love despite their deep religious beliefs. Actually, there's nothing particularly romantic about the story of Bill Manseau and Mary Doherty, two young people who became disenchanted with the Catholic church long before their paths eventually crossed. \\"Vows\\" details what life in the Boston Archdiocese was like a half-century ago. The book explains how Bill and Mary were both inspired to give themselves to the church, but eventually ended up wanting more out of their own lives. Neither of them abandoned the church altogether: in fact, after their marriage, the Manseaus continued to campaign for the Vatican to lift the celibacy requirement that is imposed on all priests and nuns.The sexual abuse scandal that engulfed the Catholic church several years ago is also a major part of this book. There are some shocking revelations about how the abuse hit close to home in the Manseau family. In spite of all that, however, this book isn't an anti-Catholic or anti-religious manifesto, as one might expect it to be. The author explains the central role that religion played in his family, detailing the ways in which he both shunned and embraced religion at different points in his life. Bill and Mary, who were both treated so poorly by the church in many different ways, never let go of their faith or their desire to help reform what they consider to be serious problems in the Catholic church.I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but I really enjoyed reading it. Without being preachy, the author inspires readers to reflect on their own personal values, family ties, and religious beliefs. There is also a lot of interesting historical information presented in this book, and I learned a lot about the Catholic church (and about religion in general) that I never knew before."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"Vows:The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son was written by the son of an unusual union: a dedicated, radical Boston-based priest whose inner soul-stirrings led him at the height of the civil rights movement, in the late sixties, to choose to marry a spirited former nun. This elegantly told, candid tale is Peter Manseau's highly successful attempt to make sense of his parent's life, faith, church, values, experiences, and deepest yearnings and feelings,as well as his own-- and he does so as a consummate storyteller.He weaves wonderful details of the past and presnt into one seamless storyline, making of it a book that is truly hard to put down. Indeed, along the way he offers us insights into the nature, culture and history of the highly complex Catholic CHurch in twentieth century America, giving us haunting glimpses of both it's undeniable beauty, it's profound,eternal,faith-based mysteries -- and, at the same time, the inhumane, rigid legalistic, dark side of some aspects of the Church, as well.Throughout every chapter, I found myself enthralled, intrigued, and opened to a deeper level of understanding of the culture of the Church, but also, of course, of the beautifully drawn characters he presents, including himself.For he is willing to reveal his own deep struggles with his upbringing, his unusual family, his inner battle with how to remain connected to a church that has caused his family so much pain.It is a book,then, that raises important questions, makes one think -- deeply,for it is sombering,revealing, skillfully crafted, and a story that I think we can all (Catholic or non-Catholic) benefit from hearing. I am grateful that Peter Manseau chose to share it with us, and I can only hope that he chooses to exercise his tremendous gift for the written word through many more books to come.Caroline Joy Adams, author of The Power to Write:Seven Keys to Discover Your Writer from Within www.CarolineJoyAdams.com"},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"When Bill Manseau married Mary Dougherty, an ex-nun, he was still a priest. He believed his marriage, one of the earliest and most publicized of such happenings in the post-Vatican II Church, would help spur recognition that a married Catholic clergy was not only possible, but would raise the sacrament of matrimony to the holy place God intended it to be.The Manseaus enter marriage with the zeal of apostles, working with the poor, and sharing the liturgy - a faith that will impact the lives of their children in ways they did not foresee.In telling his parent's story, Peter Manseau has written a brilliant and illuminating book limning the impact, both positive and negative, that the Church has on the lives of its faithful.It reminds me of those \\"connect-the-dots\\" games we played as children. As the story unfolds, we follow the Manseau family through the labyrinth of Church policy and its theology of a celibate priesthood - dots the Church would undoubtedly prefer to remain hidden.When Manseau's mother reveals that for more than 30 years she has carried the secret of having been sexually and psychologically abused by her parish priest, the scandal of Church power and hierarchical cover-up as revealed in Vows reaches almost incendiary power.Nevertheless, Manseau's tone remains respectful of the Church and of the yearning for belief. I found his own search for faith the most touching and powerful story of all."},{"Title":"Vows: The Story of a Priest, a Nun, and Their Son","review":"Far from being some clich&eacute;d memoir about a nun and a priest leaving their respective orders to marry one another and then turning against their religion, this memoir goes so much deeper than such simplistic platitudes. It provides a compelling fascinating look into what Catholic Boston was like in the Fifties and Sixties, examining the forces that shaped Mary Doherty and Bill Manseau and which eventually led them to take vows, the forces that led them to become radicalised while ministering to the largely poor and African-American community in Roxbury (one of the cities that was struck by horrible race riots in the late Sixties, along with other tinderboxes of racial tension such as Newark, Detroit, and Los Angeles), the forces which led them to give up those vows for vows of a different sort, and the forces which continue to influence their lives, as well as the lives of their children, particularly Peter, the author.Though Boston isn't some monolithic community, there is a huge community of Catholics there, many of them Irish like Mary Doherty's family. It was into this vibrant closeknit religious and ethnic community that Bill and Mary were born and raised in the decades just prior to Vatican II. Religion pervaded every aspect of their lives, with a clear-cut set of rules and distinctions between different groups of people. There was no gray territory in this world, yet they still managed to become influenced by the new European Catholic thinkers who were making waves in the late Fifties. Both Bill and Mary took their religious vows at the age of 17 (five years apart), at a time when the enrollment numbers of novitiate nuns and priests were at an all-time high in America. No one could have foreseen then than within the next few decades, the amount of young new postulants would slow to a trickle. Most of these hopeful novitiates entered fresh out of highschool, going straight from childhood and adolescence into religious life, as opposed to today when young people who may feel the beginning of a call are encouraged to go to college first and spend some time living a life in the secular world, so that they'll know for sure that they really want this life and vocation.The radical changes sweeping the nation in the Sixties, coupled with the breath of fresh air that came in with Vatican II, quickly got around to Bill and Mary. Since they were already living in Roxbury, they had come to see a whole different sector of the population, people with whom they had had no prior experience. Before long they and their friends who were also priests and nuns had devoted their ministries to these poor disenfranchised people, feeling that this was the best way they could live up to their religious beliefs. In the midst of all of these changes, Bill began to feel that he needed to be married to become a full man and a full Christian. To him, the right to be married and to love a woman was a fundamental human right, a right that shouldn't be fully extended to some yet denied to others, particularly since celibate unmarried priests were the exception and not the norm for over a thousand years. He also, perhaps navely, truly believed that the Church would soon allow priests to marry and remain priests, the way they had up until the Middle Ages (things only changed for political reasons), and to radically rethink their teaching on celibacy. Though Mary, like many other women in that era, had left the sisterhood without similar thoughts, Bill never stopped considering himself a priest and was very active in groups of former priests and people working for the ordination of women and the right of priests to be married. Both of them also have never stopped being devout faithful believing Catholics, even after how they had been treated by the Church and many individual Catholics on account of their marriage.In addition to the stories of his parents, there's also Peter's own story of his search for a religious faith and spirituality. By his teenage years, he had grown apart from the faith he had been raised in, as many teenagers are wont to do, and didn't want anything to do with Catholicism anymore. Things began to change when he was a student at UMass-Amherst (my own alma mater, which he attended only a few years before I did; he was there in the mid-NIneties and I went there in the early Aughts). He explored Buddhism, the writings of Thomas Merton, and a number of other faiths before taking a trial run at a nearby monastery. This simple lifestyle really appealed to him and helped him to get back in touch with his own religious roots, though in the back of his head he couldn't help wondering if he really wanted to be a monk and if it seemed so easy and alluring that he couldn't trust it. The fourth story, which ties all of the others together, is the one that swept the nation (in particular Boston) starting in 2002, that of the vast coverup of pedophilic priests who had just been moved from one diocese to another without even warning the new parishioners or punishing these priests. This story ends up hitting very close to home for the Manseau family.Overall, it's a great book for those who are interested in American Catholicism, or Boston Catholicism in particular, how the religion has evolved over the past few decades, and the universal search for a religious or spiritual identity. Instead of falling into the trap of clich&eacute;s or anti-Church rhetoric like similar books might do, this one brings up tough complex questions and issues, many of which don't have any easy or simplistic answers."},{"Title":"Earthly images of the heavenly bride: Women and the Church (Timely essays)","review":"With the controversy about women's role in the Church today,who is right? What is a woman's role in the Church? What is theman's role? Everywhere you turn, someone else has a different message about men's and women's roles and responsibilities in the Church. Whom should one believe? For Christians, only what Scripture, in truth and clarity, says.If you want a clear exposition of what the Bible says, this is the book for you. This book covers nearly every passage related to the subject, and unites a woman's role in the Church into an understandable whole. Never has this re-viewer come across a more thorough, Scripturally unbiased and non-patronizing examination into the subject. But be forewarned, the positions explained are Biblical but not politically correct in today's mindset.Vernon Grieger is wonderful in clarifying Biblical ideas so they are un-derstand-able even to the common layperson. Below is how he clarifies the Hebrew expression EZER KENEGEDO used in Genesis 2:18. Some of its translations are &quot;help meet, suitable helper, partner&quot; and &quot;comparable helper.&quot; Grieger understandably separates the expression into its parts.EZER = helper KE = Prefix indicating likeness NEGED = &quot;in front of&quot; &quot;opposite to&quot; &quot;over against&quot; O = third person singular pronounThe author describes more about EZER KENEGEDO: Thus &quot;what God here said He would make for man was a complemen-ary helper who would both cor-respond to him and yet be opposite to him in nature.&quot; His exegesis says what no translation can--for we have no equal word in English.The book covers the parts played by man and woman in the Fall of Humanity (Genesis 3:4-7), and then later the New Testament roles of men and women. Pastor Grieger, also, does not shy away from what some may feel to be embarrass-ing Bible passages to the modern Church. Let me say as well, his study on the topic clearly shows men's Biblical responsibilities--whether men what to hear it or not!After clearly expressing what Scripture espouses, Grieger asks: Will the Church adopt the &quot;ideology of our times, or dare to reassert and live out the man-woman rela-tionship as&quot; stated &quot;in Scripture?&quot; He asks a fitting question. For men's and women's Church roles are not for us to decide: God has decided for us. Our choice is whether to follow God, or reject His Word by placing our wishes, and reason above Him.Earthly Images of the Heavenly Bride exposes various Scriptural intrepretations used to &quot;prove&quot; many un-Scriptural positions. The book was an eye-opener for me. If I must make a complaint it is this--Pastor Grieger does not cover 1 Corinthians 11:5 in his book. &quot;And every woman who prays or prophesies with nothing on her head dishonours her head.&quot; Some have said if conservative Christians do not enforce this &quot;requirement,&quot; how can they be so biased to enforce the others? Such an argument falls flat, for St. Paul calls such a head-covering requirement a &quot;custom&quot; (1 Corinthians 11:16). The other injunctions, have no such statement. Other than the mentioned criticism, the book may be the finest that you'll find on the subject today. Grieger shows that our Churchly roles are not about rights; they are about the will of God. May it ever be so."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"These three men held on to a hopeless cause and came out victorious. They were without food and water for much of the 34 days they were afloat. The answer to how they did it is probably at the heart of man's will to survive and stay alive. This book is easy to read and the kind of story that motivates one to do the best he can and never give up. It also makes one appreciate what he has a little more. We see that everything can be lost very quickly, as in the case of the downed plane in this book, and that we have to have the mental willpower to survive.

Highly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"Mr. Trumbull did an adequate job of documenting Chief Petty Officer Dixon's narration of their 34-day raft ordeal. The writing is very straight forward with little in the way of colorful prose. It reads almost like a military dissertation. Mr. Trumbull's writing style certainly wouldn't have been mistaken for John Updike's work. The retelling is also indicative of 1940's sensibilities and presentations. For example, the author and Officer Dixon avoided any use of profanity in the book. They alluded to it, but dodged actual usage of \\"colorful adjectives\\" as if they were monks in a monastry. Without question, the three men survived by a mixture of luck and moxie. Their odyssey is so compelling, it was easy to finish this novella. However, the writing is so bland, I would not have stuck with the story if the book had been twice its actual length. The Raft is a fine example of human endurance."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"I read The Raft several times as a teenager and through my young adult years---45-55 years ago!

I was hot, sunburned, thirsty, feeling the sun, the rain, the wind,the salt water, etc. Having now run across the book on Amazon, I can't wait to get a copy and look forward to enjoying it again after all these years.

After reading some \\"amazing\\" books recommended by friends that were fictional but had a strong message, it was a breath of fresh air to read a Navy man's recount of his factual ordeal at sea.The author purports to be transcribing direct from an afternoon's interview with the officer, which explains the laid back storytelling of the account. It reads like an acquaintance telling a story over drinks or on a long car ride. That also explains why sometimes the story jumps a bit, the officer adds in details that he might have forgotten from earlier, or jumps forward to explain how certain early decisions played out.The story itself is fascinating: what real men did to kill time, keep sane, and improve chances for rescue over a timespan longer than a month still boggles my mind. There was not a single page that I did not wonder if I could've had that resolve in their situation. And yet the men do not come across as supermen, instead as simple, average Navy seamen dealing with each day as it comes. It is a story that they feel they could easily have not told and been fine; they are not looking for accolades or book deals, just getting on with their lives and their war."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"&quot;The Raft&quot; is a &quot;No Frills&quot; true story.

In the fictional book The Raft by Robert Trumbull this is a reality.The main character of this story is officer Dixon, who was the pilot of a plane that crashed in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Officer Dixon was a leader of the two other men, Gene and Tony. He was determined to sail the raft and bring them back to safety. He made most of the decisions for the others. The raft was only 8ft by 4-foot, and was only meant for one person. The only supplies they had were a pocketknife and a gun. When it rained out they used their clothes to catch the rain to drink. To catch their food they used their knife and a gun. They caught some fish, and a tiger shark to eat. They had to eat the food raw because they had no way to cook it. Gene had an encounter with a shark. He gets a shark bite on his hand, but he manages to survive. They are not aware that a hurricane is about to hit them.I would recommend this book because it is very interesting, it kept my attention, and it was suspenseful.Dilan McCaffery"},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"I first read &quot;The Raft&quot; in high school around 1955.

The story is interesting enough to tell itself, so I felt that the straightforward writing style was quite appropriate.Although the book was actually written by a journalist, it is written in the first person as if the pilot, Harold Dixon, were telling the tale.The events occurred in early 1942, and the book was also published in 1942. The edition I read was the original, and did not mention John M. Waters anywhere, so I don't know why his name is listed as an author in the 1992 reprint.The fact that this book was written shortly after Pearl Harbor is borne home by the fact that there are several details (such as the location of the island where they washed up) that the author omits \\"for reasons of national security\\". Also, the jacket of the original 1942 edition says \\"When you have finished reading this book, don't just place it on a shelf. Our men need books as well as guns. Books build morale. Send this book today. Average book requires 6 cents postage.\\" They give the address of the 4th Corps Area Headquarters in Atlanta.If you enjoy this sort of tale, you'll probably also like \\"Adrift: Seventy-six Days Lost at Sea\\", by Steve Callahan, a bit more philosophical account of his more recent lone ordeal in the Atlantic."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"I am a high school English teacher and have used this book in my classes for over twenty years.

I must however point out that being the neice of Anthony Pastula and Gene Aldrich that this book is somewhat misleading, basically because it is from one person's viewpoint that had to be the hero.

Not something the hero of his book would confess to I suppose. My Uncle's were also not helpless, uneducated, weaklings as they are sometimes made out to be either. They weren't that GREEN. They also had nothing to do with this book, because obviously, their recounts of their time at sea didn't match Dixon's. They both chose to step out of the spotlight and go on with their lives. For those that did wonder in the other reviews, they not only remained the closest of friends but they became brother-in-laws! Gene married Tony's sister.

It is still a fascinating, true life survival story. But rereading it as an adult I find some interesting questions arise that I had not considered back then. Such as, it seems that Dixon is given too much credit for their survival when in fact it was his navigational errors that led to the ditching of the plane in the first place. The story was told by Dixon to a reporter and it is not surprising therefore that he comes off the best of the three. In the story for instance he always refers to the others as &quot;boys&quot; and tends to downplay their contributions. It is interesting that the &quot;boys&quot; became lifelong friends and had little to do with Dixon after the rescue. I think it would have been interesting to hear their version of the story and compare it with Dixon's. Nevertheless, what these three sailors managed to live through and triumph over, is truly inspirational and fascinating reading. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"In 1942, the American military was heavily engaged in fighting the Japanese in the Pacific theater. After the devastating attack on Pearl Harbor, U. S. and Allied military forces were in full retreat everywhere. The U. S. aircraft carriers regularly sent up patrol plains searching for the enemy. At that time, navigation was not yet precise and radio silence had to be maintained. Therefore, a plane sent out sometimes had difficulty finding their way back.Such a plane was piloted by Chief Petty Officer Dixon and his crew of two, Tony Pastula and Gene Aldrich. Losing their bearings while on patrol, the plane ran out of fuel and splashed down, sinking quickly. It sank so fast that there was no time to recover their emergency rations, so they had little more than the blowup boat and the clothes they wore.For thirty-four days, they floated, drinking the rainwater they could capture and eating what raw fish and bird meat they could catch. Finally, they drifted to a small, inhabited island where the leader had a radio. They were able to send a message out and were rescued shortly after.This book is the story of their ordeal, how they managed to keep everything together as they floated across the Pacific It is a story of survival against the odds and is an uplifting story, one that was badly needed in 1942 when it appeared that the Japanese forces were unstoppable."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"The story is an astounding tale of survival - 3 Navy airmen completely lost ast sea, bobbling in a tiny rubberized raft before the development of more advanced navigational equipment, and more attention to survival kits that came about later in the war.While the narrative does touch on moments of anger and doubt, it is told with a staunch 1940s, WW II bravado that concentrates more on the bravery and resourcefulness of the 3 protagonists. Whereas today, a story of this sort would probably include the psychological and philosophical issues that arose, and the deep thoughts that men in this predicament would undoubtedly experience, the tale comes across instead like a John Wayne movie. The courage and fortitude of Dixon (the narrator) putting the morale of his raftmates above the secret truths he knows - that things might be worse than they appeared (and one has to wonder how much worse they could possibly get!) seems to come up a few times, for example. Very little weakness, very little disagreement, very little real fear is described, or even acknowledged during the ordeal these men suffered.It's a fascinating story, and a tale of resroucefulness that is inspiring, but I'd agree with one of the earlier reviewers that \\"something is missing.\\" I think it's what's hidden under the shroud of what was the style of the day. Bravado. It lacks the vulnerabilty that might might make the story more human, more firightening, more true to life. I believe this is what ultimately keeps you from getting as involved in the characters and events as you might, and feeling that you are really experiencing what happened on that tiny raft, adrift as sea."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"My ten year-old son and I looked forward to story time every night for three weeks until we finished this book.The tale takes you from beginning to end, one day at a time. It traces the emotional and physical waves along with endless waves of challenges. Protection from the sun, wind, and storms, struggling for every drop of water and scrap of food, and overcoming the hopelessness of being adrift, day after day after day after day - it is sobering, but tremendously entertaining.It was astonishing that these men were given little choice of survival gear. They had to make use of the few things they could grab from their sinking plane and the contents of their pockets. To read of the grief over their loss of a safety pin vividly punctuated the dire nature of their situation. Their ingenuity proved who is the &quot;mother of invention&quot; without a doubt.The book was not stiff or sloppy, like many historical accounts of adventure (Kon Tiki comes to mind). It was also a good discussion starter for topics like teamwork, values, and God.Fighting the earth to save your frail, floating, flesh is a timeless story line. There are no human villians, moral complexity, or social considerations outside of their bobbing 8-foot raft. It's a classic.Check it out, or buy a copy for yourself, your kids, and generations to come...."},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"A couple of things to consider:As a 22-plus year Navy man, I beg to differ with some points;1. Chief Harold Dixon was a 22-year Navy veteran, and nearly 20 years older than Tony Pastula and Gene Aldrich.In those days, he would have referred to them as &quot;boys&quot; in either the vernacular, or because of his age difference, or that he held a senior rank. This used to be a term of friendship.The &quot;boys&quot; became fast friends -- speaking from the 1942 version, what do you know that I don't about their later association (or lack of association with Chief Dixon)?2. Dixon's navigation errors did lead to their ditching -- This has little to do with his credit for their survival.He displayed leadership that led to his being awarded the Navy Cross, one of our country's highest honors. This was awarded not on his word, but with considerable input from his fellow survivors. The Navy does not give out the Navy Cross lightly.3. I don't think he comes off any better than the other 2 Sailors, in regards his actions. He had 20 more years of experience and had nearly the same amount of leadership experience, but Tony and Gene acquitted themselves well.The story remains one of the most powerful tales of survival ever told. I also highly recommend it!John Bayer"},{"Title":"THE RAFT","review":"From a literary perspective, as tales of survival go, this one is not on top of my list. There's something missing to the story. Maybe it is the fact that the dramatic element is not there (after all, this is a transcript of conversations that the author had with one of the men). The result is that this reads more like a dry account of what happened, instead of the thriller i was expecting.In any event, it is amazing that these poor men were able to withstand the terrible conditions of their ordeal and live to tell. I was disappointed that only the officer received the medal, while the sailors simply got commendations. Well, the officer is the one who got them lost in the first place!This would be a good book for a teenager, because it reads extremely fast (at a good pace, maybe 2 hours), and it tells a story of extreme adversity and resourcefulness, and there's many youngsters out there that could take heed."},{"Title":"The Gravedigger File: Papers on the Subversion of the Modern Church","review":"Os Guinness, in this work, presents the Church in America and the problems that beset it.

In his rookie season on NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, he won two races, won a pole, and established himself as an immeasurably friendly personality.All of that ended in July of 1993. Landing a heliocopter he had recently purchased at Talladega Superspeedway, Davey was killed when the helicraft looped over and smashed top first onto the ground. Suddenly, the personality that was carrying the sport into the 1990s was gone.Davey's widow Liz grieved the loss of her husband, the father of her children Krista and Robert Grey, but in 1995 she purged that grief and let her heart flow by putting together this poignant photo look at her husband's career.The photos run the gamut - there is the 1961 shot of nine month old Davey using a toy telephone, with a look of &quot;What the blank is THIS thing?&quot; on his face. There are childhood photos and photos of the beginning of his racing career. His first win at Birmin! gham (AL) International Raceway came in April of 1979, with proud papa Bobby Allison looking on.There are some great shots of Davey posing with racecars in the middle 1980s. One shows Davey posing with the #1 Chevrolet with which he made his Winston Cup debut in 1985. There is a 1983 photo of Davey, with Darrell Waltrip, Dave Marcis, and Dick Brooks all grinning at what he is saying during a news conference.There are many shots of Davey hanging out with his best buddy, Brett Bodine. The one on page 73 shows Davey, Liz, and Brett walking hand in hand down Talladega's pit road, almost like little kids.Another favorite is the shot of Dale Earnhardt on a payphone, Davey, Bill Elliott, Bobby Hamilton, Geoff Bodine, and Ted Musgrave all waiting their turn.Davey took up hunting and fishing as a hobby, and one great shot shows him with a 26 pound bass fish that almost looks bigger than him.But the most gut-wrenching shot is at the very end, of Dale Earnhardt, hol! ding a #28 flag in victory lane at Pocono, his face almost ! ashen. More than any words, that shot rams home just how much Davey meant to racing, and how much we so desperately want to know how high he would have reached in his career.There are some minor nits to pick; there's a photo on Page 60 at Martinsville that is erroneously listed as 1992. Not only are the cars pictured of 1993 specs (Kyle Petty's Pontiac sports a flush airdam not allowed until 1993) but the name above the door reads, &quot;Ernie Irvan.&quot; The book has several superb shots of Davey Allison and 1992 champion Alan Kulwicki, killed in a plane crash just three months before Davey's death, but should also have made an attempt to find photos of Davey Allison and Tim Richmond, yet another superstar cut down before his full potential was reached.Noentheless, it is well worth the investment to own this look back on NASCAR's most genuinely charming personality to come out of the decade of the 1980s."},{"Title":"Davey Allison: A Celebration of Life","review":"As a long time Allison fan, it's hard to even see the book.

This a must have item for any loyal Davey Allison fan."},{"Title":"The Fatal Bullet: The Assassination of President James A. Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"When I ordered this book, I thought it was a short textual history of the assasination of President James Garfield. It turns out that this book is in comic book format with the story being told by dialogue and cartoon illustrations. However, I really enjoyed the book and learned a lot about Garfield, his assasin, Charles Guiteau, and Garfield's slow death.Guiteau was basically a loser in life and had even served time in jail. He was constantly skipping out on creditors and and he showed signs of mental illness. He was dillusional and thought that Garfield would apppoint him to an ambassadorship. He literally stalked both Garfield and Secretary of State Blaine in an attempt to secure the appointment. When it was not forthcoming, he stalked Garfield (this was in the days before the secret service) until he had the opportunity to shoot the President.The wound caused a rupture in an artery but an aneurism sealed off the opening so he did not bleed to death. Garfield lingered for many weeks until the aneurism ultimately ruptured and Garfield died. The location of the bullet had not been located and the aneurism had gone untreated. Today, Garfield's condition would have almost certainly been diagnosed through an MRI and he may have survived delicate surgery which would have saved his life.In reading history, we generally get a line or two about Garfield being assasinated by a \\"disappointed office seeker.\\" It was enjoyable to learn more about this event, particularly in such an unusual literary format."},{"Title":"The Fatal Bullet: The Assassination of President James A. Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"This entry in Rick Geary's series on Victorian murders examines the assassination of President James Garfield by Charles J. Guiteau, a megalomaniacal failure at preaching, the law, and almost everything else he had tried. The drawings are evocative of the time and place, and give a clear idea of the events. The lives of Garfield and Guiteau are traced, and Guiteau's mental illness is made quite clear; today, he would almost certainly be sharing a room with John Hinckley. I'd like to see this whole series reprinted: one of them is out of print and apparently unavailable."},{"Title":"The Fatal Bullet: The Assassination of President James A. Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"As a history buff, and a fan of Rick Geary's, I knew I'd enjoy this book, but I had no idea how much! The book tells the paralell stories of President James A. Garfield and his stalker (and eventual assassin) Charles Giteau, an abysmal failure in every aspect of life; indeed, his ONLY success in life was the murder of President Garfield, and he almost botched that up, too. Garfield lingered for months after the attack, dying perhaps more as a result of medical incompetence than Giteau's efforts.Geary's wonderfully cartoony art is reminiscent of claymation; it gives a true illusion of depth and form. He is truly one of the underrated geniuses of the Comic art form. His meticulous research gives us many interesting facts, such as The President being allowed to walk around Washington D.C. unescorted (No Secret Service yet), Abraham Lincoln's son's association with Garfield, and too many others to count.

They are true stories written in a format that would entertain the student reader. I have found out a number of things that I had never learned in my school days from these books.And this book is by far one of the good ones!Another good one is \\"The Murder of Abraham Lincoln\\" that is very well written as well.

Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"This book was interesting to read, and I learned about the history of Garfield, as well as that of his killer. However, as one reviewer said, this book really doesn't follow the format set out by Geary's other books in the series. The story is not unresolved, and it wasn't really a murder. A long slow drawn out death did occur due to complications of the bullet wound.If you're okay with the book story following a different format, grab it and enjoy it. Its worth reading and the only reason I gave it four out of five stars is because I was really hoping for an unresolved case with some mystery to it. Still a good installment in the series."},{"Title":"The Fatal Bullet: The Assassination of President James A. Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"Admittedly, not everyone will be drawn to a \\"comic book\\" version of the events surrounding the assassination of President Garfield. A \\"graphic novel,\\" The Fatal Bullet interlaces the life stories of Garfield and his assassin Charles Guiteau. Geary provides the awkward Guiteau with occasional light touches of quaint, almost humorous, incompetence, and gives Garfield a nervous, darting look, as if catching now and again a glimpse of his doom out of the corner of his eye. Geary's accomplished engraving-style drawings give the project a suitably old-fashioned feeling (Tony Millionaire at his best might give Geary a run for his money, but few others) and a certain deadpan humor concerning the conventional pieties (see Garfield's ascension to Heaven at the beginning of part four) lends the project a welcome slightly subversive touch. Geary has unquestionably done his homework, but for those wanting more on the Garfield assassination Ira Rutkow's beautiful little book on GarfieldJames A. Garfield: The American Presidents Series: The 20th President, 1881should be consulted."},{"Title":"The Fatal Bullet: The Assassination of President James A. Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"On July 2, 1881, President James Garfield, whose term has just begun a mere 4 months earlier, was shot in the back by a delusional religious fantatic called Charles Guiteau. 2 months later Garfield would succumb to the bullet wound and shortly after Guiteau would be hanged.The assassination took place just 16 years after Lincoln's death in Ford's Theatre and the details in Garfield's case pointed to the same mistakes that allowed Lincoln to be assassinated. Garfield had no escort, he walked about Washington D.C. by himself, unguarded. Guiteau followed him on a couple of occasions! On the fateful day, Garfield was taking the train for his holidays, walked through the waiting room with one of his ministers and his two sons, allowing Guiteau free access to stand up from one of the waiting room seats and shoot him as he passed! Amazingly it would take a third Presidential assassination - that of William McKinley in 1901 - for Congress to give the President an official guard, the Secret Service.Geary tells the story in a strange way by comparing the lives of Garfield and Guiteau. Showing where one had a strong will to study and for hard work, and the other didn't, how people (in his eyes) are made either great or not. The story here isn't as compelling as Geary's other book on Lincoln's assassination with the background being less desperate and the assassin Guiteau acting alone on his own bizarre ideas. He was a deeply religious man who believed the \\"Deity\\" had told him to kill Garfield and somehow believed this act would lead to a consulship in Paris. Strangely, it didn't.The other interesting point is the lack of medical knowledge at this time. The many doctors who attended the President didn't think to operate to try and remove the bullet, nor knew how, and in fact due to their many odd choices made the President's injuries worse.A strange but interesting story, Geary's written another strong addition to the Treasury of Victorian Murder series, though perhaps it's not the best place to start. I'd recommend the book on Lincoln."},{"Title":"The Fatal Bullet: The Assassination of President James A. Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"Rick Geary's new book \\"The Fatal Bullet...\\" explores an important event in American history in an unusual yet effective manner.To summarize: the nation, which in recent times had dealt with the horrors of President Lincoln's assassination was once again shaken to its core the summer of 1881. On Saturday, July 2 in the near empty waiting room of a train depot, the twentieth U.S. President, Republican James Abraham Garfield was shot in the back. It would take a grueling two months before the President would succumb to his injury.The assassin, one Charles Guiteau was quickly apprehended. He announced that he bore no ill-will toward the President but that his death was a \\"political necessity.\\" During his trial Guiteau defended himself proclaiming to be an agent of deity. He would go on to state that the President's physicians should bear the burden of his death. He reasoned this because of the fact that they had decided the wound the President had suffered was not, in fact fatal and that he would soon recover. Guiteau was convicted of the assassination by a jury and was executed by hanging on June 30, 1882.What sets Geary's book apart from other historical works is that it was written in a graphic novel. With illustration reminiscent of a comic book, Geary's book sets out to explore the Garfield assassination as well as to take a closer look at the events leading up to this significant point in the two men's lives.Geary examines certain similarities in both lives. Some of these included are in regards to their home regions, the fact that both were the youngest in their family, both considered clergy as a career and that both were drawn to the law and politics.Robert Frost wrote of two roads that diverged in the wood. This would certainly be applicable to the life paths taken by Garfield and Guiteau. While their lives bore some resemblances they each took different paths. Garfield had a \\"happy prosperous life\\" with a strong marriage and a \\"reputation for honesty, loyalty and fair dealing.\\" Guiteau, on the other hand, took the \\"downward path\\" with a bitter and brief marriage and a reputation as a \\"cheat, charltan and hum-bug.\\"Geary's book is very interesting and unique. To take a piece of history put it in comic form and stay true to the serious nature of the event is quite the feat. This book will appeal to those young adults and teens who may otherwise have little or no interest in history. Teachers would do well to include this book in their curriculum."},{"Title":"The Fatal Bullet: The Assassination of President James A. Garfield (A Treasury of Victorian Murder)","review":"I'm a fan of this series. There are good entries and less good entries. I discovered them with the Jack the Ripper volume which I like to read at night before bedtime. There are two aspects of that book I wish Geary would return to. The first is that the crime is scandalous and unsolved (as is the Borden case), the second is that none of the victims was a president!This is really not about juicy, low Victorian murders which I would think is the appeal of a series with that title. Once a president is involved you're into assasinations, which to my mind are a different thing. Curling up with a book about an assasination in which the killer is known & villified for his failings, the victim lingers, and in which all the answers are found before you're done just doesn't hold the same appeal.People who are seeking history seem to like the book."},{"Title":"Rainbow's End: Irish-Americans and the Dilemmas of Urban Machine Politics, 1840-1985 (California Series on Social Choice and Political Economy)","review":"A cautionary tale about the limits of political power, i.e. political power does not bring economic success.a great book, well written, with tremendous lessons for today.buy it. steal it. just get it.colin flaherty"},{"Title":"Sales on the Line: Meeting the Business Demands of the '90s Through Phone Partnering","review":"This book is a breakthrough with doing business over the phone.

If faith without works is dead-how much truer is it that faith without commitment is dead.\\"Henry C.Theissen p.100 \\"Repentance is not a satisfaction rendered to God,but a condition of the heart necessary before we can believe unto salvation.Futhermore true repentance can never exist apart from faith.Conversely we can say that true faith never exists without repentance.\\"The above are just a small sample of the potent comments in this work,also included are comments from these Pastor theologians:Charles Spurgeon,Charles Hodge,A.W.Pink,William Hendriksen,John Calvin,John MacArthur,J.C.Ryle,John Gerstner,John Murray,Walter Chantry and others.'Must Jesus Be Lord To Be Saviour' is an exceedingly valuable contribution to 'The Lordship Issue'."},{"Title":"The Fall to Violence","review":"In The Fall to Violence, Marjorie Suchocki revises Christianity's traditional notion of original sin. Against tradition, via a relational theology, Suchocki views sin as the unnecessary violation of the well-being of any aspect of creation, which indirectly is a sin against God; a horizontal and communal redefinition of sin. She explicates her doctrine of original sin through an evolutionary, relational, and systemic triadic structure, and finishes with humanity's response to sin through guilt, forgiveness, and, ultimately, transformation.Structurally, Suchocki achieves this in three parts. In Part one of her book, Suchocki, in dialogue with traditional and process theologies, provides the fundamentals for her understanding of sin. She begins by explicating and rejecting both Augustine's and Reinhold Niebuhr's definition of sin as the \\"rebellion against God.\\" In contrast to these theologians, Suchocki believes sin is unnecessary violence against the well-being of creation. To further this definition Suchocki uses a feminist critique of Niebuhr to redefine self-transcendence in relation to the finitude and infinity of creation, and she identifies three modes of self-transcendence: memory (past), empathy (present), and imagination (future). Retaining a vertical aspect of sin, Suchocki believes sin has an effect on God. Because God intimately experiences the world, sin against creation is, indirectly, a sin against God. This redefinition of sin also requires a new criterion for sin: the criterion of well-being. Suchocki develops this criterion based on the interdependence of the world and the relationship of the world to God. In Part two, Suchocki lays out her triadic structure of original sin. Using the work of theologians and scientists, she argues that violence is evolutionarily engrained into humanity, and humanity's violent bent is foundational for sin. The solidarity of humanity, where all individuals are interrelated, affects each individual: the sins of others affect us and our sins effect others. Sin also entails an institutional component, where a dominant group influences the consciousness of each generation. As a result, sin can be passed down from generation to generation. With these three components, all of humanity is implicated in sin: All are sinners. In Part three, Suchocki establishes humanity's response to and transformation of sin. The term sin implies human responsibility, and resultantly, Suchocki develops her ontological analysis of guilt and freedom. As each person develops the capacity to transcend sin, that person recognizes his/her failure to transcend boundaries established by original sin (guilt), his/her response-ability to sin (freedom), and his/her responsibility to transform sin. Forgiveness of sin, both personal and social, is willing the well-being of victim and violator in the context of the fullest possible knowledge of the nature of the sin. Forgiveness allows for the hope of well-being for all (transformation), and because God relates to all of creation, God's forgiveness reconciles all things within God's own self."},{"Title":"Magical Chango","review":"Finally, a story about teaching our children values, manners and self respect.

I found the various examples of animals 'doing' mathematics very interesting. Also interesting is the section on street math; the fact that poor children in Brazil preform relatively flawless mathematics in their produce stalls, yet fail the same problems on a formal test. However, I was looking forward to something Devlin alluded to in the introduction: a way we can teach math more effectively. However, after all these countless examples, his solution was presented briefly at the final chapter. Essentially, Devlin says that conceptual math, not rote math needs to be emphasized and real life examples should be utilized more. Honestly, I would rather this have been just a fun math book for non-math minded people than have such an obvious ending. With that said, if I could I would give this book 3.5 stars because it is such an interesting read."},{"Title":"The Math Instinct: Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats, and Dogs)","review":"Although the word \\"math\\" appears in the title, this book is mainly about instinct and psychology. About half the book contains discussions on how animals instinctively do certain things that have some foundation in math. The other half of the book looks at how humans perceive and behave in math-related situations - from infancy to adulthood. The book is very well-written, very clear and easy to read. Those who are math phobic have nothing to fear here; in fact, they would likely find this book very interesting in the sense that they would learn something fascinating about themselves. Other than for those who are math phobic, this book has something for psychology buffs as well as animal lovers. But most importantly, it should grace the shelves of math educators as well as those who are interested in the reasons and possible cures for innumeracy."},{"Title":"The Math Instinct: Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats, and Dogs)","review":"This book offers a very readable overview for the non-specialist, with many fascinating details on how animals use their kinds of natural mathematics. It also discusses the findings of Brazilian researchers on how teenage street vendors who can't handle school math develop their own effective street math techniques. The author makes abundantly clear that many people can't deal with school math because it is presented as an abstract symbolic system. People can learn best, he argues, by applying math in concrete ways. Unfortunately, he stops short at the end of the book and simply enjoins us to practice because that is the way humans gain mastery over subjects. It would have been useful for him to spell out how such practice can best be done and to give examples. I recall an awful pre-calculus course that spent a full year trying to prove a set of theorems, leaving us students with no knowledge of how to apply calculus to scientific, financial, or other problems (this was the last exposure to math for most of the class). We would have learned much better by applying calculus to real problems, then perhaps concluding the year with a bit of theory.

I say the book isn't written that well, because Devlin doesn't do well enough with the more difficult concepts. I say it is a hodge podge because subjects such as the nautilus's shell have nothing to do with the rest of the book; in fact Devlin waits far too long to distinguish between computational skills of animals, such as their navigational skills, and the results of optimization through evolutionary trial and error (bee's hexagonal honeycomb) which has nothing to do with the animal brain's capacity for doing math.Amazingly, a numerical sense has been found to exist in baby's only a few days old, as well as in rats, etc. Brazilian children who could not master arithmetic in school, do great when they need to employ math in the marketplace. When math is abstract and rule based, without making sense, it is hard to learn or apply. It actually uses a part of the brain devoted to language rather than a part used for \\"natural\\" math (which incidentally grew out of the area used to control digits). Devlin addresses teaching math, but surprisingly doesn't have much too say, emphasizing repetitive practice rather than a change in presentation. For example, for reasons Devlin gives, learning 7 x 8 = 56 is particularly hard, so why not teach 7 x 8 = 7 x 7 + 7, thereby giving the idea of multiplication as a quick way to do some kinds of addition, and taking advantage of the kind of techniques untutored Brazilian working kids use in the marketplace?"},{"Title":"The Math Instinct: Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats, and Dogs)","review":"This book was well written, meticulously researched, and thought provoking.

However, there is a causality question inherent in this. It is a simple one, namely \\"Does the mathematics humans create describe the universe as a consequence of the way the universe works or is the mathematics independent of the actions of the universe?\\" This is a deep philosophical question that is at the heart of much of human thought.In this book, Devlin sometimes gets very close to dodging this real issue. The power of evolution is to survive, the creatures that respond in the best way to how the universe works are the ones that survive to propagate. As anyone that has engaged in iterative processes can attest, even a few percentage points of advantage leads to dominance after several generations. Therefore, when a creature reacts the way they do, they are not \\"doing the math\\", they are simply responding to the way the universe works, and the actions of the universe can be described by mathematics.From this perspective, the title and much of the contents are incorrect, albeit interesting. There is no mathematical genius involved in what happens, it can all be explained as a dynamic feedback of repeated and often-deadly trial and error. All of the creatures that did it the wrong way have been punished by having their genetic line eliminated from the gene pool, so what we see now is the descendents of those that did it right. Even though it may be something I have seen before, it is always interesting to see how the appearance and actions of living things can be described using mathematics. So while I strongly disagree with the unrealistic premise inherent in the title, I still enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"The Math Instinct: Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats, and Dogs)","review":"Despite the intriguing title and nice printing paper, this book is very unsatisfying.

Some would say this is obvious, others \\"how do you know?\\", but either way it certainly is not insightful.

The student's progress through the text is fluent and full, and is made so by the accurate and usable glosses that are conveniently placed on the right margin of each text page. The book is light on supporting commentary and ancillary helps, but its up-to-date bibliography makes any such inclusions redundant. The serious student of this important poem will need to advance, however, to Klaeber's still authoritative edition. This is so because the guiding hand of the glossary in Jack's edition will subtly and inevitably direct the student towards the editor's own overall reading of the poem and away from his own. Ideally, one should read Beowulf free of glossary and with only a minimum of attention to commentary. The reader's best friend here will be the unmatched Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Lexicon. The thrifty student may substitute J.R. Clark Hall's Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. Also, try to keep the full OED handy."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A Student Edition","review":"If you are a student of OE who does not know how to begin with OE literature, I strongly recommend this edition to you. The introduction provides the reader with some notes about the manuscript, the style of the poem and some other interesting information together with a bibliography for further reading.The whole poem is edited here in the original (Old English), with no direct translation into PDE. But many marginal notes satisfactorily help us with the understanding of the lines.The shorter poem The Fight at Finnsburh is contained in this volume as well.Finally, a glossary of vocabulary is presented."},{"Title":"Beowulf: A Student Edition","review":"I would recommend this book to beginners of OE study.

Not only because it is written by an insider but because of the unflinching honesty and perspective that can only have been achieved by Dr. Kissi--a Ghanian native who participated first hand in the events described in the book.LDS Church History follows patterns that repeat and upon careful study can be identified and become most instructive. As did the contemporary followers of Joseph Smith, Church members in Ghana went through a period of waiting and testing before they could even have the full benefits of membership--but the benefits came. Early Saints endured governmental oppression from the infamous extermination order of Governor Boggs to the Edmunds-Tucker Act. Ghanian Saints were not spared their own version of persecution, which is referred to by Dr. Kissi as the \\"Freeze\\" a period in which the government attempted to disband the Church. Indeed, there are horrifying excerpts of media accounts that parroted the most virulent strain of anti-Mormon rubbish to a national audience. However, the opposition came to an end--as it always does--leaving an country familiar with the Church, in name at least, and curious to know more. Of course, we now know that Temples have been built and that the Ghanian stakes are growing in strength and in numbers. (My own stake is barely holding on here in Southern California.)Dr. Kissi acknowledges that he and his people have much to learn about procedure but one notices such a scriptural familiarity, doctrinal purity and love of Christ that this reviewer, at least, wonders if the Church in developed countries might not stand to learn a bit more from the Saints in Africa.Highly Recommended"},{"Title":"Walking in the Sand: A History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Ghana","review":"I had heard a lot of good things about this book from quotes from LDS General Authorities, and I was not disappointed.

The book is divided into three distinct parts. The first section centers on &quot;Religion and Ideology&quot;; here, authors look at fractions among Protestant sects during their time period, and the mututally reinforcing ideas of domesticity and religion. The second section is called &quot;Economic Structure and Opportunity.&quot; It begins with a discussion of middle class attitudes towards property, especially as it effects providing income for a family. The other discussion in this section looks at men and women's respective roles in the economy, focusing on men's action and women as the &quot;hidden investment.&quot; The final section, &quot;Everday Life: Gender in Action,&quot; looks at marriage, the respective roles of motherhood and fatherhood, defintion and importance of the home, how gender was registered and finally, middle class influcen in the reform-minded public sphere. Family Fortunes is a big, thick, informative book which is well worth reading for people interested in the rise of the middle class, and social or religious history. Though clearly scholarly in focus it is relatively accessible, and the use many different textual sources helps to illustrate some of the more dense parts of Davidoff and Hall's arguments."},{"Title":"Family Fortunes: Men and Women of the English Middle Class, 1780-1850 (Women in Culture and Society)","review":"Family Fortunes is an account of the rise of the middle class, both as a class and as individuals, in England between 1780 and 1850. The book's focus is on \\"the delineation of gender difference at a time of rapid economic, political and social change.\\" It argues that class consciousness always takes a gendered form and that the sexual division of labor within families was central to the development of capitalist enterprise. This approach rehearses arguments that are commonplace in feminist historiography, but Davidoff and Hall add a significant dimension to the case and hold their reader's attention through a narrative built around religion and ideology, economic structure and opportunity, and an account of gender in action in everyday life. Their section on religion and ideology is particularly informative and the strengths and weaknesses of the book can be ascertained by examining this section's analysis and contentions. (p.13)Religion played an important role in shaping the culture of the emerging middle class. Even though attitudes towards masculinity, femininity, and the family varied among the different Christian denominations, all accepted that the home had to act as the basis of moral order in the immoral world of the market. The family therefore stood at the center of attempts to construct a moral order for capitalism. Indeed the concept of the Christian family was a metaphor for the organization of society. The Birmingham Independent minister, John Angell James, stated that the family: \\"when directed as it should be, has a sacred character, inasmuch as the head of it acts the part of both the prophet and the priest of his household, by instructing them in the knowledge, and leading them in worship, of God; and, at the same time he discharges the duty of King by supporting a system of order, subordination and discipline.\\" By extension, a congregation of believers gathered in a church was regarded as a family. The concept was also applied, through the language of paternalism, to social structures where the servants and laborers of the middle class man were seen \\"as the dependants and children of their father, their master, their guardian.\\" Similarly business partners \\"were in some senses brothers who represented each other.\\" (p.109, p.89, p.21, & W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law, cited ibid., p.200.)For middle class men the church also provided an opportunity to display their worthiness for public office by acting as church officials and engaging in public works. Davidoff and Hall note that by \\"the early nineteenth century the traditional concept of stewardship associated with aristocratic patronage and the devolution of obligations from the lord to his agent was transposed into religious discourse.\\" (pp.73-74)The position the church assigned to women was filled with tension. In an eulogy of a pious Christian woman, James wrote that \\"the same blessed page which proclaims your dishonour in the sin of your first mother, displays the glorious part you are to bear in the instrumentality of saving a lost world.\\" Because of Eve's transgression, women had to suffer. Through childbirth woman suffered and came to understand the nature of sin. At the same time, childbirth opened a road to personal salvation through the link between maternity and salvation established by Mary the mother of Jesus. The need for women to contain their sexuality, through service to the family, justified women's social subordination even if men and women were spiritually equal. Subordination did not imply inferiority but separate spheres of activity. The home and children were women's sphere. Because of the pressures of business men left the moral education of children to women. This situation led to a contradictory position for many women personified in the life and attitudes of Hannah More. In her writings, More confined women to the domestic sphere but argued for the central importance of woman's influence in nurturing morality in an immoral world. She played a leading part in public moral crusades arguing that the home was the only sure basis for a moral nation. More's terrain was the contested ground that Davidoff and Hall see \\"between the recognition of influence [within the home and on children] and the marking out of the female sphere.\\" Women often had to enter the male sphere to provide for themselves and/or their families. But this was an action open to condemnation unless presented in terms of maternal necessity or along religious lines as in the activities of More. (p.115, p.114, p.171, & p.117)Davidoff and Hall comment that religion was the key \\"that could give meaning to women's experience and express some of their aspirations.\\" While this was no doubt true, the authors here come up against the issue of oppressed/oppressor relations. Woman may well have used religion to give their life meaning, and to give voice to some of their aspirations, but the parameters of the discourse of religion ultimately were set by men for men. Women's experience within these parameters may have been rich and fruitful, but their experience was still within a male discourse. Hall and Davidoff are sensitive to this issue, but they offer nothing to move us beyond the impasse of a hegemonic oppressor discourse. For instance in discussing women's philanthropic work they argue: \\"Women may not have been exerting real social power and engineering major social change through their associations, but nor were they simply taking as given the boundaries of female social action.\\" (my emphasis.) What, we may ask, would it have taken for women to exercise real social power? Davidoff and Hall regard the period as one when there may well have been more cooperation between middle class men and women because they were involved in shaping the basis of their identity in middle class families. It was only when this identity was established that the isolated and trivialized nature of the domestic sphere became apparent. In other words women played a part in shaping a middle class identity that debased women's place in society. The authors show how the male discourse was able to override attempts by women to create a position for themselves that engendered respect but the reader is left to ponder whether the situation could have been, or ever could be, different. If the aim of Family Fortunes was only to recount the rise of the middle class this lack of analysis would not be such a serious shortcoming, but given that the authors specifically link themselves to \\"the Women's Liberation Movement and the questions which feminist history has raised\\" the reader is justified in expecting some discussion of the difficulties in moving beyond a hegemonic discourse. (p.148, p.430, p.454, & p.11.)In some ways this criticism is unfair because, in general, historians who deal with the social relations that stand behind an analytical term like hegemony have not confronted the issue of how to move beyond one set of relations to another. The greater the degree of dominance the more likely this statement is to be true. For instance E.P. Thompson's Making of the English Working Class displays some hope for alternative social relations in the nineteenth century whereas David Montgomery's The Fall of the House of Labor is ultimately a grim reminder of the ability of capitalism to gain compliance from American workers. Few historians are as successful as Davidoff and Hall in showing how a shared ideology, and its practice in everyday life, produces hegemonic relations. With the understanding they provide it is possible to ask how real power can be exercised by women and other groups whose interests are marginalized by hegemonic discourses."},{"Title":"Buddhist Religion: A Historical Introduction (The Religious life of man series)","review":"I used an earlier edition of this book and the companion Experience of Buddhism in an introductory buddhism course in college, and found (and still find) both to be exremely useful as overviews and wide-ranging sourcebooks for information about the full spectrum of buddhist practice and thought.

I suspect the book's only one-star rating came from a disgruntled student. This is not a book that dumbs down the Buddhist religion, or attempts to please everyone.

Any one of them would be suitable material for an episode of The Twilight Zone.The six stories are:- I'll Take You Home, Kathleen- Screen-test- I O U- Three O'Clock- Nightmare- BequestEach of these stories contain generous helpings of Woolrich's favorite literary ingredients. Namely; horror, dread, terror and, most especially, suspense.The descriptive prose used by Woolrich is very richly crafted and demonstrates what a stickler for detail he was. Paradoxically, in many cases, this attention to the finer points of narrative artistry did not extend to plot development.

Of greatest interest to the more casual reader are the first two chapters, which give an overview of women's lives before and during the Middle Ages. In the subsequent chapters, Labarge examines the lives of queens, noble ladies, the women religious, mystics, lower-class women, women healers, and women criminals, before closing with a discussion of women's contributions to medieval culture. As the greater part of each of these later chapters consists of a catalogue of particular cases relevant to each category, they are useful to the scholar interested in seeking information to fuel his or her research but can grow rather tedious for the non-scholar (or even the non-medieval scholar). The synthesis with which she closes each chapter is consistently brief and, in my view, somewhat wanting in depth. Further, Labarge's style struck me as occasionally clumsy, almost to the point of rendering her sentences ambiguous. (A stylistic nit-pick: I found her habit of beginning sentences with the phrase \\"As well\\" [i.e. as a substitute for \\"In addition\\"] irksome.) One positive point: Labarge's sympathetic commentary lends some color to her otherwise dry history without adding too great a bias. In short, the range of Labarge's research is impressive, her writing somewhat less so.

Though not as widely known as some of her contemporaries - Harry Stack Sullivan, Karen Horney, and Erich Fromm - Clara Thompson was one of the founders of interpersonal psychoanalysis, or what has become more broadly known as the Neo-Freudian movement. Trained by Sandor Ferenczi, one of Freud's most brilliant students, Thompson helped introduce a new perspective on psychoanalysis to the United States. This perspective emphasized the real interactions between analyst and patient, modifying the traditional Freudian emphasis on history, fantasy, and abreaction in psychoanalysis.This is a highly readable and informative introduction to the various viewpoints in psychoanalysis from its inception through the middle of the twentieth century. For those wishing to understand the history of American psychoanalysis, from one that helped create it - and held \\"deviant\\" beliefs from Freud -- this is an important starting point. For students interested in the \\"technique\\" of psychoanalysis a study of this book is well worth the time.This edition also includes an introduction by the noted psychoanalytic historian and critic, Paul Roazen, to orient the reader. His incisive introduction describes the influences that shaped Thompson, from her initial and controversial analysis with Ferenczi to her later analysis with Fromm (and between these her training analysis of Sullivan).

I can, however, clarify the mistaken assumption that a paperback version would reduce the price, since a cloth cover doesn't really add significantly to a textbook's total cost. The price that a textbook publisher charges a retail operation is based heavily on the cost of developing and manufacturing the book. In the case of this text, I refer in part to the high cost of drawing and preparing almost 250 high-quality, color maps and diagrams, the cost of licensing from Rand McNally the 13 regional reference maps that begin each chapter, and the cost of preparing over 150 color photographs. Furthermore, all the work done on this text, from concept to finished product, is done in the U.S.A.Mr. Wettstein mentions what he has gained from the extensive knowledge of the authors, and by doing so addresses one quality of the text that sets it apart from other books like it. Professor de Blij has travelled around the world for the past 25 years in order to make this book as enriching, accurate, and not to mention, as beautiful as it is today. One can imagine his travel expenses and the enormous energy required of him. Yet, the result of the used book market and the other options Mr. Wettstein suggests,is that Harm de Blij and Peter Muller are not compensated via royalties.Compare the $78.95 with items similarly priced, for example, athletic gear. I cannot believe that the cost of the design, materials and overhead for making sneakers comes close to the investment publishers make, especially with books that depend so much on graphics and photographs. Yet, a pair of sneakers runs close to $100 these days.As with sneakers, our book may become worn with use, but I doubt that you'll ever need to throw it out. With this textbook, one gets a trip around the world that will last an intellectual lifetime."},{"Title":"Geography: Realms, Regions and Concepts, 10th Edition","review":"This is an excellent text tailored for the introductory geography student at the college level. This text infuses excitement with a wealth of knowledge for those being introduced to the field. It is also, however, a worthwhile reference for those who do not require extensive detail on any one geographic discipline or world region. The text is well written, includes excellent maps, and is more than suitable for introducing one to the 'world' of geography.

This type of markup is horrific. I have avoided buying this book now for two semesters due to its obscenely high price. If it only came out in a moderately priced paperback, I would have the option of purchasing it and gaining some of the extensive knowledge of its authors. As it stands now, I refuse to pay into a monopoly which feeds itself on one of the least rich segments of society, the student. I suggest to everyone else considering this book to do the same.

I am constantly looking for materials to give to engaged couples and/or newlyweds. The First Year of Marriage certainly fits the bill.However, as I was reading this I realized that most of the principles discussed in the book regarding relationships could be applied to any couple. My marriage is going on 30 years, yet I still experienced several \\"Aha\\" moments.Ms. Arond and Dr. Pauker exhibit tremendous insight, both through their research as well as, I imagine, a result of their own marriage. They employ sound statistical methods, but even more importantly for the reader, the examples that they use help the average reader identify with the subjects and identify their own potential strengths and weaknesses. Quite often we can see in others what we don't wish to look at in ourselves or in our own behavior. This volume helps us identify personally with these couples and to recognize that there is a little bit of each of these couples in each of us.I highly recommend this volume to anyone who wishes to learn more about the dynamics of marriage. The authors successfully identify some of the common pitfalls as well as some very thoughtful solutions to marital problems. They touch on issues of economics, independence vs. interdependence, sex, intimacy, family and friends (among other things). The target audience is the newlywed couple, but the potential audience is far broader."},{"Title":"Oh, you Tex!","review":"I have read many of Mr. Raines' books over the years, but somehow missed this one.

I have wanted to read his first major English publication, Lotus in Sea of Fire, for over ten years. I finally got to buy it on Amazon and I am so glad I did. In 1966 I gave a talk in support of the Vietnam war in my high school and planned to join the Green Berets (Marine Special Forces.) By 1967, as a student at Wesleyan University I had major second thoughts. By 1968 I applied for classification as a conscientious objector to this particular war. I was denied. I had to change majors from architecture to pre-med to get a deferment due to my very low draft lottery number in late 1968. I became a stronger and stronger opponent of the war from 1968 through 1972.If I had been able to read Lotus in a Sea of Fire in 1967, I would have been instantly a very strong opponent of the war. My arguments would have been much stronger. The clear writing and very insightful discussion of the history and deeper meaning of the war to the Vietnamese peasants, Vietnamese intellectuals, the French, the American right wing politicians would have helped me greatly. These discussions help me now. Combined with my excellent biography of Ho Chi Minh, I feel I can see the war from the Vietnamese perspective much better.Thich Nhat Hahn has helped me understand many things in my life. He has done it again with this book. I plan to share the book with my father. We fought a lot over the war and my decisions about the draft. We have remained far apart in our thinking over the last 43 years. This short but deeply insightful book may help change that.This is a book that will change lives for Vietnam era Americans.Many, many thanks to my wonderful teacher, Thich Nhat Hahn.Cullen Frazer Shipman, M.D.[...]"},{"Title":"Vietnam, Lotus in a Sea of Fire: A Buddhist Proposal for Peace.","review":"This is an excellent history of Vietnam which goes back to its origins and the start of the Missionaries from Portugal and France who went to Vietnam in 1533 and helped create a division in Vietnam which led to France, China, Japan and the US continuing to try and colonize and recolonize their country over the centuries. Its goes up to 1967 and a peace proposal by the author that was ignored by the US and its Ally and puppet, South Vietnam and also ignored by the North Vietnamese.

It is a story of a politic living in fear of itself. A battle of Camelot vs. Evil. Not in some third world country but our own United States. In the 1960's there was a battle for personal freedom and the right to privacy, a civil rights movement that was not defined by color but rather the essence of liberty. Here is a glimpse at that battle and one man who fought it. A sad history, still a great lesson for today and well worth the read!"},{"Title":"The Privacy War: One Congressman, J.

All of these including The Privacy War are well-researched, depthfull in their presentation, and plain out fascinating! As fo the writing, I think the opening of The Privacy War, when the FBI raids Gallagher's home, is among the most riveting I've encountered."},{"Title":"The Privacy War: One Congressman, J. Edgar Hoover and the Fight for the Fourth Amendment","review":"The Privacy War: One Congressman, J. Edgar Hoover And The Fight For The Fourth Amendment by Ron Felber is a raptly involving account of Neil Gallagher's rise and fall in American politics. The tumult of the 1960's is uniquely mirrored in Gallagher's volatile career, which was ultimately brought low by an influx of forces which included the enmity of J. Edgar Hoover, a powerful man who defied presidents and conducted a secret war against anyone who would dare challenge the nation's security apparatus. The Privacy War is very highly recommended reading for students of Political Science and 20th Century American History -- and it is particularly relevant reading in today's political climate of Homeland Security and the rapid abridgements and erosions of personal rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution."},{"Title":"The Privacy War: One Congressman, J.

A revealing blend of biography and political history."},{"Title":"The Privacy War: One Congressman, J. Edgar Hoover and the Fight for the Fourth Amendment","review":"Living now under the &quot;Patriot&quot; Act, with more addendums to it being planned, it is important for citizens and Congressional representatives to revisit recent history. Under the reign of J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI regularly engaged in wire-tapping and secret taping via parabolic microphones. Catching mobsters, right? No, blackmailing members of Congress, destroying careers of public servants, and taking revenge on anyone who opposed the bureau's interests.How did they do it? By planting false information in respectable journals such as Life magazine, paying off members or organized crime for deeds done, and planting evidence to implicate innocent people. This is the story of New Jersey Congressman Neil Gallagher and his nightmarish encounters with Hoover and others in the American intelligence business. Gallagher championed privacy after learning of a young girl being forced to take a lie detector test for a low level administrative job. As Gallagher continued to delve into breaches of privacy over the years, he was astonished to discover massive deceptions carried out by the Pentagon, CIA, and FBI.In one such case, approximately 300,000 children ranging in age from 6 to 12 were given psychotic drugs such as Ritalin without the consent of their parents in a study to determine which drug was the most effective in behavior modification. It was discovered that the U.S. Army was quietly shipping canisters of dangerous chemical weapons by train through such heavily populated areas as Philadelphia. Once at port they were loaded on WWII Liberty ships, taken 250 miles out to sea, and sunk into the depths. Congress and the public were totally in the dark.Of course the nefarious Roy Cohn showed up in Gallagher's life, at first as a friendly, knowledgeable Washington insider, later threatening the successful Congressman with warnings from Hoover. Hoover went out of his way to terrorize Gallagher and his family. FBI agents ransacked their home while they were on vacation, interrogated his daughters while they were in college, and stormed into their home threatening his family at gunpoint. Author Ron Felber does not draw any conclusions, but allows the words of Gallagher and others to cast doubt on the veracity of the Warren Commission report.Felber conducted extensive interviews with Gallagher, cited newspaper accounts, and obtained documents under the Freedom of Information Act in assembling his book. He uses the convention of jumping between time periods to provide background information on the current storyline. It is a technique that can be distracting, but Felber does a remarkable job. In light of the events of today, Felber's book is very relevant and a call to remember that in the past government institutions have acted against government officials and private citizens irresponsibly and maliciously.Invasion of privacy in our current environment has the potential to rise to dangerous, even outrageous, levels. Government secrecy and deception are enemies of democracy.

The factual errors are substantial, namely, page 45 - Rostenkowski was from Illinois not Michigan, page 104 - JFK was shot on Nov. 22, 1963, not Nov. 23rd, page 122 - Mao was not dying, he had 12 more years to live. If Mr. Felber barely did enough research to get these facts straight, how reliable is the rest of the book? Also, can we believe that Congressman Gallagher, with all due respect, recalled conversations from 35 years prior to the interviews with Mr. Felber, to the specificity of quotes in the book?I am ashamed for the Congressman and nearly disgusted that Mr. Felber and his editor felt this should be published in this form.

Lonia investigates and soon discovers she is chasing a lie, and the truth lands her in hot water with local authorities, a ruthless crime syndicate, and her own close friends.Things grow more complicated when Lonia becomes the reluctant guardian of a pregnant young runaway rape victim, who cannot decide to have the baby or get an abortion.These two threads, while seemingly unrelated, eventually come together in a most unexpected twist, and delivers to the reader a no-holds barred ending that will resonate for some time after the last page is turned.In addition, Study in Lilac also paints a vivid picture of life in Barcelona, examining the attitudes, customs, and culture of the people who live there.HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"Study in Lilac: A Worldkrime Mystery","review":"I do not ordinarily read crime fiction but occasionally do so to pick up some local color about a place that interests me.

Each lesson is there to teach you to progress as smoothly and efficiently as is about humanly possible. Park really stresses the necesity of basic drills, practiced properly, to allow the body to learn to 'relax' enough for efficient martial use. Exercises begin with footwork drills, progress to combined footwork drills, and then to basic palm techniques. Later both the combined footwork and palm techniques are combined.Also taught in this book is basic Pa Kua Chi Kung, enough for the beginner to develope a feel for Chi flow and are sufficient exercises for Chi development until the practice of one's martial techniques take over one's Chi work.There is a Volume 2, but it doesn't seem to be listed here at Amazon.com as of this review. This is as good as Volume 1, but isn't needed until you've absorbed everything from Vol.1 (good luck!)Again, if I had to own only one book on internal martial arts I would most certainly make it this one. No art is ever any better than its basics. So, the more strongly developed your basics, the more developed your skill will be. I feel this is the best book from which to learn those basics."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"I am a practitioner of I-Chuan and Pa-Kua in Hong Kong. I have bought almost every chinese Pa-Kua books published in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. This book had been recommended to me many times by my friends, but I was still reluctant to buy it, thinking that not much more could be learned, not to mention my more than ten years efforts in finding and seeing many of the well-known masters both in Hong Kong and China. One very important thing I've learned over these years is that the esoteric teachings of internal martial arts had been developed most of the time by teachers who did not have the real skills but wanted to cheat for more students. I was amazed at how earthly and scientific this book has finally explained the real mechanics for the tremendous striking power of internal martial arts, it tells you which muscles to use instead of the apparent movements of the body. This book teaches in the same way and language of every real masters I've met - no hype, no lengthy discussion at qi(though I do not deny the role of qi in internal martial arts)which could not been verified anyhow, but every instruction is consistent with morden physics and human biology. I'm very happy at the fact that this book is not written by a chinese, which symbolizes the art of Pa Kua has truly been taught and spread to other parts of the world."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"Martial arts in general has two distinct facets: the internal arts, which ultimately tend toward spiritual and theoretical issues, and external arts, focusing upon training and competition. Typically these lead to divisiveness in the martial arts community. Resolving these two sides of the same coin, on an individual level, is a difficult and often frustrating issue.Pa-Kua Chang is a style dedicated to incorporating both of these aspects of the martial arts. Its skilled practitioners can easily confound some of the best stylists from other disciplines. The techniques are extremely efficient and systematic. At the same time, internal cultivation is emphasized as a key to development physically as well as spiritually. Both sides are necessary.This work on Pa-Kua Chang introduces the reader to the many diverse facets of this style. Tradition, theory, internalization, physical considerations, are all interwoven into a complete and self-contained foundational work.Many of the details (read: secrets) one may wish from a martial arts book are necessarily missing. After all, true martial functionality is a social aspect of life, between two (or more) intelligent beings. Exercises and basics are described herein, so that the seeker has tools with which to pursue higher degrees of refinement. Nothing in this work is glossed over, however. Reaching a high level of proficiency of even the basic exercises outlined takes tremendous discipline and dedication. One can seek out further instruction in the interim."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"~I'm finally glad they got Vol. 1 on this website. I'd written a review for Vol.2 awhile ago, but had to imply that there was a Vol.1 to be read, as well. It's been a while, and others have already gotten to it, but I thought I'd plug in my 2 cents...WONDERFUL!In retrospect, there is some mystery here. BaGua, as with many Chinese martial arts styles, is all about your instructor, your instructor's instructor, etc.. Your lineage is key. BaGua has a very complex geneaology, stemming~~ from Dong Hai Chuan (various phonetic spellings) the legendary Grandmaster. In fact, two key branches of BaGua (since Dong Hai Chuan only taught experienced martial artists-- most whom he purportedly defeated in combat) are those that seem very BaGua like, and those that seem Hsing-Yi-ified. Those are my terms. In my experience, you can take the forty or so BaGua styles, and classify them as fairly &quot;pure&quot; BaGua (circular, evasive, fine, intricate), and those that have integreated~~ significant Hsing-Yi principles-- linear, power, direct.Park Bok Nam's style is more pure BaGua in terms of evasiveness, footwork, and hand-techniques. His teacher, the legendary Lu Shue-Tien, is a bit of an unknown... Even in this book, there is no real claim as to who taught Lu Shue-Tien. Other sources I have speculate...That being said, this book is a wonderful, detailed work that describes basic techniques-- footwork, some foot-trapping, and elementary strikes down to the~~ smallest level of biomechanics. How to move your feet, knees, pelvis, abdoman, to generate power, for example. In more detail than in any other book on any other style I've ever read. Superb for anyone who is trying to understand the underlying principles of this art, or even for the advanced practitioner trying to compare this or that, or to glean insights.This is not a forms book. Park Bok Nam gives some simple palm changes that are basically qi gong postures with circle walking. ~~ It's a mechanics book. A superb one.Finally, the lineage is important. BaGua varies significantly from style to style. The techniques can be dramatically different, as can the mechanics at the more superficial level. But I think from a basic concepts level, the biomechanics are all pretty much the same. So this is an insight into one family, not all. But I think confining it to mechanics kept it manageable, and pure. No hullabaloo or flash. And eminently useful.Wonderful,~~ clearly written, adequate pictures (get the videos for better illustration of Park's technique). A must for the martial artist.~"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"This is a detailed and in-depth but very readable book on this still little known form of Chinese boxing, tai chi and even hsing-i still being probably better known outside of China, although none of the so-called internal boxing arts are still as well known in the west as kung-fu.After an introduction and chapter on the history of the art and the exploits of Master Lu Shui T'ien, the senior author's teacher, the writers launch into a discussion of the techniques and philosophy of pa kua. Chapters cover footwork and stepping methods, hand and palm training, body training, pa kua philosophy, the production of chi energy, and a final chapter on pa kua chi kung methods.Pa kua is most known for its unique stepping and footwork and I was most interested in that, and the book has a nice 50-page chapter on it. The descriptions of several stepping and circle methods were very clear and so were the illustrations and diagrams. However, it would be very difficult for someone who hadn't actually seen a practitioner stepping the circle to get an idea of what it's really like from just reading; but as I'd seen it before that wasn't a problem for me.Compared to karate, kung fu and other martial arts, pa kua is most likely to strike while moving or stepping rather than being planted in a rooted or powerful stance. Although I was exposed to pa kua many years ago when I was intensively studying wu-style tai chi and chin na, I was most interested in the stepping methods and whether they could be adapted to the system of knife-fighting and knife-fighting defenses I've developed over the last 25 years, which are a combination of escrima/kali, Indonesian silat, European fencing, and American Bowie-style methods. I'd already incorporated several pa kua turning and stepping methods into the system and was interested in whether the book might show me anything new or different, and I may have gotten a few extra ideas for things that might work, although I was familiar with most of the material from my previous studies.So although my main interest is not in pa kua I still found the book useful as an interesting review of the material, and as I said, may have picked up some things that might be useful in my present teaching and training in karate, kobudo weapons, and the knife.If you're beginner to intermediate practitioner this is still a good book with much good information and I can highly recommend it. Also, the first chapter on Master Lu's adventures and exploits, and his ideas and approach to training (which was very strict in those days) make for entertaining reading."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"I am a practitioner of I-Chuan and Pa-Kua in Hong Kong. I have bought almost every chinese Pa-Kua books published in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. This book had been recommended to me many times by my friends, but I was still reluctant to buy it, thinking that not much more could be learned, not to mention my more than ten years efforts in finding and seeing many of the well-known masters both in Hong Kong and China. One very important thing I've learned over these years is that the esoteric teachings of internal martial arts had been developed most of the time by teachers who did not have the real skills but wanted to cheat for more students. I was amazed at how earthly and scientific this book has finally explained the real mechanics for the tremendous striking power of internal martial arts, it tells you which muscles to use instead of the apparent movements of the body. This book teaches in the same way and language of every real masters I've met - no hype, no lengthy discussion at qi(though I do not deny the role of qi in internal martial arts)which could not been verified anyhow, but every instruction is consistent with morden physics and human biology.

It will crystallize the meaning and substance of movements for students - For teachers it will help forge much better instructors.If you have never practiced bagwa, (Pa Kua, BaGua or Bagwachang, etc.), I would suggest you go elsewhere to learn about this unique system of martial art.If anyone has a question about it, feel free to drop me an email!"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"the absolute best!

It focuses on the linear and circular footwork (the only system in existance that keeps both types of footwork), all aspects of preparing for martial art training and the chi kung for health aspects of training.As an introduction to this lineage of pa kua chang / ba gua zhang, it only scratches the surface of the movement vocabulary, yet goes into much depth in detail about these level one, beginner techniques. With out understanding these level 1 skills, you would not be able to practice and perfect this pa kua chang.Many other pa kua (and even tai chi) teachers have learned from this foundational book, yet don't understand Master Park's martial art. Other styles of pa kua only mention one or two aspects of the martial art. This book gives a great overview of eveything a true and complete internal Chinese martial art training system will require of the interested student.Only someone who knows the different styles and lineages available in the pa kua world can truely appreciate this authentic pa kua chang lineage and curriculum, the honesty and care Miller and Park have taken in keeping this art alive, and Miller's care in carefully translating and puting the oriental culture in to an easy to understand English format."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"I've just started pa kua practice and bought this book in order to use it as a reference, but it became more than that! The examples are relatively easy to follow and the theory behind the art of pa kua is also explained very well. I never really understood the theories of &quot;sung&quot; or the &quot;kung fu body&quot; until I read this book. The examples in this book must be practiced, however, or else it will be of no use."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"I am in no way associated with either Park Nam or Dan Miller, so this is a completely unbiased review. I have been in the Martial Arts for 49 years and have read countless books on the subject. This is by far the best Pa Kua book ever! Usually you find books written by very knowledgeable Chinese masters with the worst English, or by an American who clearly is no master of the art. This book displays the very obvious mastery of Park Nam with the help of Dan Miller who has done an incredible job of presenting the theories in a systematic and thorough manner. The writing is crystal clear and the theories laid out so well they seem almost self-evident. This is a truly stunning book and I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"I've read just about every book on Amazon relating to Bagua.This book literally has been *The Best* in terms of martial coverage and overall understanding. It is very obvious that Lu Shui Tien and Park Bok Nam really truly have an excellent understanding of the internal arts.I've found the footwork chapter to be the most interesting and most useful. It seems that many bagua books (and even teachers..) assume that just by walking the circle you'll gain an understanding of all the evasive footwork inherent in real combat. WRONG! This book really gives you the details to gain a better understanding of applicable footwork, beyond simply walking left or right of the opponent.Literally, my most prized book on Bagua. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants an excellent understanding of real bagua, a complete system."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"what a humble and truthful insight to the life and art of a real Chinese martial art master! love it."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Pa Kua Chan, Vol. 1","review":"Good introduction to Pa Kua.

My hardcover edition is colored in red and desert gold blends and has got a picture on it of a tough-looking hombre, with a star pinned to his vest, firing a pistol with his left-hand and leaning against his horse's saddle and writing a note with his right hand (\\"rustlers cornered Red Gulch HELP sheriff\\").There isn't any story in this volume that corresponds with this picture, but who cares? It captures the flavor of the text well enough.Jon Tuska's collection of traditional Western action stories is immensely readable and made especially interesting by his running commentary. For the most part, these stories were written early in the 20th century as dime novels or as articles contributed to Western periodicals during the Golden Era of this type of story.While all of the tales have the satisfying \\"feel\\" that a good Western action story should bring, it's remarkable to observe that the \\"West\\" is more a state of mind than a geographic point of reference or a specific lifestyle. The stories are set as far east as Arkansas (which I would have thought of as a \\"Southern\\" state, as opposed to a \\"Western\\" one) and as far north as Montana.The characters from whose vantage point the stories are told include the usual assortment of cowpunchers, sheriffs, ranch detectives, pioneers, and gunfighters, but they also include a construction engineer and a banker. And although the era of the \\"Old West\\" is believed to have ranged from sometime in the middle of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th, there is actually one story in this volume in which our hero rides, not a Shetland pony, but one of Henry Ford's battered mountain cars (the villain of the piece, by contrast, is a rich kid in a blue roadster).The one common thread that seems to weave relentlessly through all of these stories is the omniscient presence of the \\"Code\\" of the West. The \\"Code\\" is more easily transmitted to the reader through these stories than summarized by any third person, but roughly speaking, it's a series of directives which mandate that promises be kept, that alliances be honored, that grudges be avenged, that individuals communicate plainly (because the difference between friend and foe might depend on the manner in which the other's words or gestures are taken), that obligations be paid, that rights be boldly asserted or forever lost to those who are bolder, that justice be done, that law be taken into one's own hands when necessary to do justice, that crises of the environment or of the spirit be faced head-on, and that (unless otherwise asked) one not pry into the business of another.On occasion, there is confusion over exactly what course of action the \\"Code\\" requires, such as in the first story of the volume where the protagonist must choose between warning a benefactor about a threat to his life and honoring the mandate that one mind his own business. But most of the time, the \\"right thing to do\\" is fairly clear to the reader.The trouble is that the stories themselves, as entertaining as they are as oat operas, don't quite live up to the billing that the editor gives them as literary devices.\\"There is no other kind of American literary endeavor that has so repeatedly posed the eternal questions - how do I wish to live?, in what do I believe?, what do I want from life?, what have I to give to life? - as has the Western story,\\" Tuska declares.But the fact is that the writers of these stories don't really pose these as \\"questions\\". There's no doubt that the pioneer families in these stories are going to fulfill their manifest destiny by pressing westward and disregarding all excuses to return home. There's no doubt that Jim Laramie is going to overcome his fears and repay the hospitality of the family that has befriended him by facing down the badmen who earlier chased him out of Dodge. There's no doubt that Sheriff Milo Singer's protestations of stupidity and lack of ambition on his own part are facades designed to obscure his relentless pursuit of justice in his territory. The characters in these stories really don't agonize over these issues long enough to be compared with characters in a Greek drama, as Tuska seeks to do.Almost uniformly morose, taciturn, and persistent and reminiscent of heroes from a similar genre, the hard-boiled detective story, the heroes of the stories in this volume always ultimately follow the Code of the West, not because intense soul-searching enables them to decide that \\"this\\" is how they want to live, but simply because \\"this\\" is a role that their respective authors have designated them to fulfill in order to bring the action to a head.These should be primarily regarded as action stories, not allegories, and the heroes within them, for all their courage and tenacity, are as flat as the Arizona desert and more aptly compared to Horatio than to Hamlet.But as action stories, they work very well, and Tuska is to be commended for his choice of stories; for the loving care that he took to choose them and assemble them for this collection; for the biographical information submitted for each author; and for the memorable introduction to this genre that he provides in his forward."},{"Title":"I Came to Love You","review":"Dose Jesus seam like an entity that is out there, who you know about but maybe don't know Him?

It was AWESOME!"},{"Title":"Creative Mosaics","review":"When I first opened this book, I was unimpressed with the projects, in fact I thought some of them were ugly and poorly done, but the more I peruse it, the more I see that some of the ideas can be useful and appealing to some people, especially if one takes the time to tweak the designs and colors, and is sure to do neat work.Creative Mosaics does not use the typical materials found in most mosaic books, in particular glass tiles. There are sections dedicated to applying the following materials: cork board and balsa wood which you paint and cut and apply without grouting between the pieces, clear glass which you paint, broken mirror, marbles and glass chunks, broken ceramic tiles, broken terracotta pieces, rocks, pebbles, shells, beans, seeds, sheet metal which you cut into shapes and apply to glass, wax which you pour into a tray and cut into small squares and apply to candles or wood, tiles cut from colored plastic bottles (interesting use of recycled materials), and paper tiles applied to paper objects. Some of these projects are attractive, others not.There are instructions on how to apply each type of material with photos of additional ideas you might try on your own. The problem with the instructions is that the book was apparently translated from Italian, and the grammar is often incorrect and awkward. In one list of materials, the word \\"Dimensions\\" is listed as a material. What's that? A quote from the section on wax tiles: \\"put the candles at the bottom of the pan...and let the wax melt at a bain-marie\\". What's that? Another quote: \\"clean the pan thoroughly and continue with the realization of the blue wax\\". As in many cases, it's awkward, but I can make sense out of that one.Since my interest lies in glass and ceramic tile mosaic, I will probably never use this book. I would not even use the designs as inspiration for traditional mosaic projects. The one thing that seems most useful to me is the idea of cutting up plastic containers into tiles as a mosaic project for children in art class. I could envision the children applying them to glass jars and bottles to make something pretty to take home."},{"Title":"Call to Glory: The Life and Times of a Texas Ranger","review":"Call To Glory: The Life And Times Of A Texas Ranger collaborative written by Michael and Marilyn Gilhuly is an emphatic, gripping historical fiction novel of bravery, heroism, sacrifice, and a proud way of life.

It covers his career from childhood interests through his racing with BMW in 1975 and includes runs through the famous Trans Am years in Pony Cars, Formula 5000 against David Hobbs, early years in Can Am, driving Ferraris at LeMans for Chinetti and NART, and more. This book held my interest yet was easy to read.

I found it to be a fast read, and I was a little disappointed by the lack of complexity in the character development. I flinched at the way women were characterized in the book, (let's just say that only one of the prostitutes had a \\"heart of gold,\\" and even she came to a bad end.)The good guys were pretty much mostly all good, with little or no dark side. This is especially true of the hero of the story, Dan Ryan. I would have liked to see more complexity in his and other key characters. The bad guys were pretty much all bad, with little or no good to them. One good guy went bad, and one bad guy went sort of good, but more could have been done with that.There were no female heroines in the story except Lou the cook, and she didn't seem to do much more than cook - Calamity Jane was described in way that seemed to dismiss her as drunken, sleazy, parasitic trash. Regardless of what Calamity Jane was and wasn't, it isn't fair to paint such a one-dimensional portrait.There were two rather dubious romantic sub-plots, neither of which had much depth.If it weren't for the sexually explicit passages in the book, the cursing and the violence, the simplistic plot would have made me think it was a children's book."},{"Title":"Tales from Deadwood","review":"Very good reading, a page turner, will definetly leave you wanting to read the other two in the series. My advice, buy the other two when you get this one. Pretty close to actual historical events. Great Read"},{"Title":"Tales from Deadwood","review":"TALES FROM DEADWOOD is the first in a series of three novels featuring a lavish mixture of dime-novel mythology, historical fact, plenty of action, and a whole lot of the Old West, which sums to an original and fresh novel. It chronicles the lives of several men and women who make their way to Deadwood, South Dakota in search of wealth on the newly discovered gold of the Black Hills, including all of the regular players: Wild Bill Hickok, Charley Utter, Al Swearengen, Calamity Jane; and a few new ones as well.Dan Ryan is the central character in the story, and the novel opens with him defending a wagon train from an Indian attack. He, along with the other men in the party, repel the attack, and Dan makes a new friend in the process. He and Bellamy Bridges decide to partner up, and when they finally reach Deadwood they purchase a claim. The relationship between Dan and Bellamy--plus a few whores, a madam, a gambler, and an old general--is the main storyline, but it isn't the only storyline.The other plotline follows Wild Bill Hickok and his entourage as they travel from Cheyenne to Deadwood. Wild Bill doesn't make it to Deadwood before the end of the novel, but Mr. Jameson does an admirable job of painting him as a strong, courageous, patient, and kind man who protects his friends and shows uncommon patience with his admirers.TALES FROM DEADWOOD is not a rip-off of HBO's Deadwood, but instead it is a story that stands on its own merits--the characters are portrayed significantly different, and the storyline focuses on places and people the television series does not. It is a traditional western with enough action, lore, and suspense to please the core readership of the genre, but the characters and simple, sparse prose is done with the economy and expertise that will also appeal to nearly anyone who enjoys a well-told tale.-Gravetapping"},{"Title":"Power Plays: Politics, Football, and Other Blood Sports","review":"I looked for this book because of Rising Tide, a magnificent work by the same writer, and was not disappointed. The author says he's writing about power from different perspectives, from the way athletes marshall power over themselves to the way political institutions work. So this is a collection of things that on the surface wouldn't seem to fit together-- a story on a friend of the author who went to Vietnam, pieces on football players and world record holding athletes originally published in places like Sports Illustrated, and chapters on politics, especially on Congress, Newt Gingrich and the Washington media. As strange a mix as that seems, somehow they do all fit together. And the individual chapters are not only moving, but on occasion extraordinarily insightful. If you think you understand Congress, read this and you'll discover a new world. If you think you understand the media, read this and you'll understand how and why it funcstions as it does at a level deeper than you ever have before. If you think you understand what makes world class and pro athletes tick, read this and you'll see that you didn't."},{"Title":"Power Plays: Politics, Football, and Other Blood Sports","review":"I have to diagree with the other two reviewers. Like them, I bought it because I liked the author's books on the 1918 Flu and the 1927 Flood. This book is a mess, conceived of a way to get random pieces of previously published essays into a book with a common theme. Barry fails badly. Portraits of generally obscure athletes, very brief usually, are intertwined with the horrible Gingrich's attempts to destroy Speaker of the House Jim Wright in the 1980's, (Gingrich later got what HE deserved.) But the book just doesn't jell, at least for me. An athlete trying to be the fastest man in the world for personal glory just doesn't align with a politician trying and failing to do the right thing for America."},{"Title":"Power Plays: Politics, Football, and Other Blood Sports","review":"Like the other reviewer, I came to this book after reading another of Barry's books, in my case his latest, \\"The Great Influenza.\\" (Next I'll try \\"Rising Tide.\\") What amazes me about this writer is he can handle so well, and in such depth, very very different topics. While I found much of the material on sports moving and interesting-- short profiles ranging from a world record holder in track to athletes trying to make it in the NFL-- the core of the book is its take on the political media. He looks at models of crowd behavior studied by a Nobel laureate and applies them to the press corps. It works magnificently.

One of my best purchases so far, I absolutelly recommend it to anybody interested in the derivatives market!"},{"Title":"Analysis of Derivatives for the CFA Program","review":"The book is intended to provide the derivatives analysis portion of the CFA curriculum, and is intended to communicate a practical risk management approach to derivatives for the investment generalist.Derivatives are financial instruments that offer a return based on the return of some other asset. Exchange-traded contracts have standard terms and features and are traded usually at a futures or options exchange. OTC contracts are created by two parties anywhere else. In a futures contract, the futures exchange guarantees to each party that if the other fails to pay, the exchange will. The forward contract is an agreement between two parties to transfer (sell/buy) an asset at a future date at a price established at the start. It is largely a private and unregulated market.A swap typically is like an agreement to buy at a future date, paying a fixed amount and receiving something of unknown future value. The most common use of a swap is a situation in which a corporation, currently borrowing at a floating rate, enters into a swap that commits it to making a series of interest payments to the swap counter party at a fixed rate, while receiving payments from the swap counter party at a rate related to the floating rate at which it is making loan payments. The floating components cancel, creating a conversion of the original floating-rate loan to a fixed-rate loan.And on it goes, with lots of detail on valuing and use of derivatives."},{"Title":"The Success Book","review":"Some say author John Randolph Price is too &quot;new agey&quot; for their taste, but this reviewer finds his style to be a combination of old-fashioned prosperity writing, and pep-talk.Now, granted, you have to be in a certain kind of mood to be receptive to a message that tells you that you should ignore the &quot;effects of this world&quot; (what your life is right now) and KNOW that you are ALREADY a success. Sometimes it's hard not to believe the evidence of your own life.Still, there is hope and guidance in his words. He explains the time-worn but true concept of &quot;you are what you THINK&quot;, illustrates the concept with some examples, and then goes on to give you a 60 day program of meditation to help you change your thoughts about success. (The 60-day Program is very spiritual in nature.)That 60-day program is the real strength of this little book.

Well, pop-up books, and books with flaps that open and tabs that can be pulled.Out of the dozen or so books we have in this category, this is the one that impresses me most. Each page has either a single big mechanism to play with, or many pop-open doors and drawers to explore.The theme is one interesting to may children, a mechanic's shop. Illustrations are colorful, and have rich enough detail to let you explain to a child what the various tools are and what they do.The book is short enough that I can describe page by page what it has.1) A car on a hydraulic lift that can be raised and lowered by rotating a wheel near the botom of the page. Set in a typical looking mechanic's commercial garage2) A workbench, complete with moveable drill press, openable lunch box, openable drawers with wrenches, and an openable cabinet with drawers filled with screws. Also has a few vices, a hydraulic jack, waste bin, etc. [see picture]3) A car with the engine being removed. A cleverly constructed chain hoist lets you move a flap up and down repeatededly to raise and lower the engine, just like the level for a real chain hoist! [see picture]4) A wheel balancer with a wheel to spin to balance the wheel.5) A body shop with two sliding doors that can be slid open to either side revealing two body workers working on a car, and a third who can be seen by opening that car's door. Doors within doors!6) A paint shop with a folding curtain that folds when you pull a tab to the side, revealing a car and two men dressed up in body suits and respirators spray-painting the car.7) view of the back of a car in a service pit with a man underneath, when you open the trunk of the car, he pops out of the pit and you can see the engine is smoking8) an old car whose turn signal is a flag that pops out when you pull a lever down, and a small tractor9-10) A carry-on tow truck with a dented car on its flat bed. The tow truck has a crane that moves when you pull a tab. opening the truck cab reveals a pop-out driver. You can open the toolbox on the side of the truck, or slide the car all the way down the ramp on the tow truck until it's resting partly off the page.Pro:+ great book if you have a toddler who likes mechanical things and/or pop-up books+ some of the most clever mechanisms I've seen in a pop-up, I enjoyed playing with them too :)+ detailed drawings with nice colors+ relatively sturdy as far as these sorts of books goCon:- None relevantHighly recommended."},{"Title":"The Faith of Our Fathers","review":"If there is any Catholic book to read this is the one!

Glorious Cats is a brilliant collection of both poetry and prose, and a favorite with both of us.It is a great joy to sit down with a child with a book of fluffy cat pictures and be able to read aloud poems like Tolkien's Cat on the Mat,\\"The giant lion with ironclaw in paw,and huge ruthless toothin gory jaw...\\"Or Martha Ostenso's Chinese Cat,\\"...Were you a Favorite,Ages ago,Who purred at an Emperor'sOverthrow?\\"Or wonderful prose excerpts like this one from Charles Dudley Warner, \\"The poet who wrote so prettily of him that his little life was rounded with a sleep understated his facility; it was rounded with a good many.\\"And Paul Gallico's essay on the Mystical Cat, \\"Black Magic, white magic, good luck and bad, a hundred superstitions covering every aspect of human life and condition, are ascribed to the cat.

His defense of free trade is no less relevant today. In fact, with the nonsense we are hearing about trade from political and activist quarters - it is probably even more important today."},{"Title":"Economic Sophisms","review":"Frederic Bastiat was not an economic theorist in the sense that he did not make any original contribution to economic theory. His claim to fame rests on the success he achieved as a pamphleteer, an exposer of economic fallacies and as one of the foremost champions of free trade on the European continent. That in itself is an achievement that is worth the admiration of anybody who is a supporter of free trade. For even though, the defects of mercantilism and the advantages of international trade, ala comparative advantage, had been established by the doyens of economic theory such as Adam Smith and David Ricardo, protectionism was still reigning supreme in Bastiat's own country, France during the nineteenth century. And that is precisely what he has tried to expose in his book \\"Economic Sophisms.\\"Unlike Milton Friedman's \\"Free to Choose\\" or \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" or Henry Hazlitt's \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" which deal with a large variety of applications, Bastiat concerns himself solely with trying to combat the menace of protectionism through a series of arguments that are both witty and satirical. Occasionally he also shows how a conversation between two parties having differing opinions on protectionism might evolve. For example, in one of his chapters, he shows how a tax collector might justify the exorbitant collection of taxes to a vineyardist who moans the loss of his wine as taxes whereas in another chapter, he conducts a thought experiment as to how three different merchants might conspire amongst themselves to pass legislation advantaging each one of them in their respective industries. Contained within this book is the famous satirical parable known as the \\"Candlemakers' petition\\" which presents itself as a demand from the candlemakers' guild to the French government, petitioning the government to block out the Sun to prevent its unfair competition with their products: a parable that has made its way to the most elementary economics text book.The central theme of Bastiat's economic ideology could be summed up as: All economic decisions should be made with the consumer in mind. Instead Bastiat alleges that protectionists and their advocates in the legislatures look only at the interests of the producers and fail to see the unintended consequences of their actions on consumers and even on other producers. Protectionism is the original sin in the sense that protectionism in one sphere begets calls for protectionism in yet another till we have a complicated, convoluted system of collecting tariffs, providing subsidies resulting in uniformly high prices and scarcity instead of abundance which would have resulted if he had allowed free trade in the first place.Would I recommend the book to somebody else? No because even though it makes for a fun and easy read,a) The book almost exclusively focuses on trying to make the case against protectionism and in favor of free trade andb) Also because many of the arguments made in the book are part of popular wisdom today and therefore might be seen as superfluous in some sense. Instead if one is interested in exposing popular myths and voodoo economics, especially those coming from the left, then I would suggest reading Henry Hazlitt's \\"Economics in One Lesson.\\" That one is truly an arsenal for the libertarian."},{"Title":"Economic Sophisms","review":"This book is 150 years old, and yet many people do not understand its lessons even though it is easy and fun to read. It is fitting that my 1964 FEE edition of this book has an introduction by Henry Hazlitt. Hazlitt's \\"Economics in One Lesson\\" is more analytical and less humorous than \\"Economic Sophisms\\" but the two are classics in introductory economics.Bastiat's starting point is that desirable economic decisions come from viewing voluntary exchange through the consumer's eyes rather than through the producer's. For example, the \\"negative railway\\" highlights the fallacy of adding barriers to productivity in order to increase the costs of transportation. By breaking the tracks from France to Spain, the City of Orleans and its hotels, boatmen, and porters benefit since goods need to unloaded and moved to a new train and passengers are made to disembark. This looks good for producers but terrible for consumers. Especially since following this logic would mean that every city along the tracks should also tear down the rails!The genius of this book is that Bastiat does not need lengthy discussions of externalities and production frontiers to get his point across. Through the simple illustrations, the reader learns these concepts anyway even without being formally introduced to them."},{"Title":"Economic Sophisms","review":"Fredric Bastiat explains what is wrong with the misleading view of economics being taught today.

Sarah Katherine's views on all the aspects of the work, from the highs to the lows, is refreshing and sometimes a little shocking. I was forced, during my reading, to feel a little uncomfortable at times because of how her words pierce the veil behind some of the darker aspects of her customers and how they can treat people. I've heard contra opinions and views, but I was happy to hear such an honest, unvarnished view of people and their needs.

'Indecent' was sent to me with the idea that perhaps we would have Lewis come to Hysteria to do a book signing. When I received the book I really did not know what to expect, and I actually began reading the book not expecting to connect with it (I'm not even sure why). But from the moment I opened the book to the moment I finished it (a mere few days later), I was entranced. The subject matter is obviously of particular interest to me, but even if it hadn't been I think my reaction would have been the same. 'Indecent' is smart, honest and important. It's important because the ideas that Lewis explores are at the crux of sexuality, society, repression, gender roles and how those concepts shape and affect men and women- whether they are in the sex industry or not. And everything else aside, Lewis is an incredible writer. I think she could write about anything and make it fun, interesting, witty and thought-provoking. She's a natural. The way certain scenes are described I literally felt like I was there; smelling the same smells, feeling the same emotions, touching the same things. You can't really teach the natural flow this book has- someone either has it or they don't. Needless to say, I hope Lewis continues to write and I'm excited to have her come to Denver for a signing."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"Sarah Katherine Lewis does a good job portraying the life of an adult industry worker.

A very good book and a definite must read for anyone interested in the adult industry."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I loved going through this woman's journey. I couldn't put it down. Definitely gets graphic at times, wouldn't let anyone under 13 read it. It definitely lets you take an intricate look into this lifestyle."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"Very interesting book, and very well written. This is a side of the world I new nothing about and was always curious. The author was totally honest and straight-forward about everything she felt and encountered. There were even times throughout the book I was in complete shock. But that kept me reading more of the book...to see what she would be doing next and what venue she would be working at.Overall, very entertaining, honest and eloquently written. Highly recommendaka; vegazshowgirl"},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I've been reading Sarah's online journal for a couple years now. When she mentioned she was writing a book on the topic of her encounters while doing sex work, I knew it was going to be good. Having read some of her former rants and experiences, I couldn't help but enjoy her cynical but accurate outlook on the whole topic.This is not one of those feminist man-bashing books. Far from it. The industry writes itself without her having to dive out of her way to further drive her points home. Gender is not the issue here as much as the behavior and culture of the industry and those who thrive in it is. All sides are examined in the book. The customer, the employee, men and women all get a turn beneath the tip of her pen.Sarah takes us behind the scenes from being a new and naive performer at a lingere model job, and up through her travels of working as a dancer on Bourbon street in New Orleans, and in a massage parlor or two here in Seattle, and doing porn for magazines and videos. It's her keen observation and her way with words that really makes you understand what it's like. She nails the psychology and motivations of the customers and workers and has no cognative dissonance about what she's doing and why she's doing it, Being so blunt as to call the customers 'cash machines' and herself and the workers 'pussy machines' boils it down to the common denominator. She doesn't pretend to be anything more than she is: Capitalizing upon the emotional and physical needs of her customers in an industry that eats both sides up.You'll never think of sex work, from the customer or the employee side, the same way again.Perhaps of all the humorous and curious terms among the 300-some pages is the term 'bleach cobra' which had me howling with laughter. You'll have to read to find out...Definitely worth it. I agree with other reviewers that it's a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"The good part of this memoir is the insights toward her work and the various and interesting co-workers she encounters along the way. Also a highlight is her unquestioned intelligence. The negative parts of this book is her unabashed hatred of men and all their effluvia. With her smarts she could easily find a field where her intelligence and ability to read and understand people would be of benefit. I recommend the law."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"\\"Indecent\\" is an autobiographical account of the author's experience as a sex worker over a period of ten years. The work she has chosen involves performing erotic shows for men by stripping, using sex toys, and otherwise aiding in her client's masturbation fantasies. She also engages in some erotic massage. She does not engage in actual sex with her clients, and thus, this is not a book about prostitution. The narrative is entertaining, and at times funny. It's an easy book to read.That's pretty much where the content ends. Most of her narrative expresses her deep distain and loathing for her clients, and she continually degrades them throughout the book. Strangely, the author misses the glaring reality that she is a willing participant, and equally degraded, by her own standards, in her performances. We are only told that she likes her line of work because it empowers her as a woman.She does not seem to develop any insight, or to grow as an individual through her experience. We are told nothing of her own life: her friends, family, love life, or the impact her profession has on her personal life. The vignettes start when she goes to work, and end when she leaves. We are left wondering who she is as a person.\\"Indecent\\" is a mediocre example of a growing genre of books about the personal lives of sex workers. More worthwhile choices, such as \\"Whip Smart,\\" are more worth your time."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"Sarah Katherine has a vivid writing style, conveying the sights, sounds, and even the smells of a scene. This autobiographical snippet of her early life as an adult sex worker is an interesting read, although her perspective is certainly jaded. Her experiences at the scummiest dives and the sleazier characters of the business are all unsurprisingly negative, and they've left her with a complete and total revulsion of all men in general. Having felt repeatedly victimized by men, she takes pride in her reciprocal victimization of them. Still, it's still interesting to read her take on patrons, including the \\"relater\\" types that just try to be sweet and simply want to talk to a pretty girl, with the misguided fantasy that she will be enlightened and run away with him. I'm sure there are dancers who appreciate that type, if only as a brief respite from the usual scum, but her description is a reality check: the goal of the club and the dancer is to get as much money as they can from each mark. And even the nicest of relater types is ultimately just another source of revenue. At times, the writing gets lost in side discussions and disjointed progressions, and the final chapter definitely seems forced and pointlessly extraneous, but overall the style keeps you eager to read what happens next. Although forever typecast by her tattoos and punk style, she's certainly no \\"Belle de Jour\\" styled courtesan, and her experiences reflect the harsh and negative reality found on the lowest ends of the business. But overall, it's still an interesting read."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"The day I received your book in the post, I sat down with it at 7, intending just to read a couple of chapters. Suddenly, it was 10, and I was done with the book -- I hadn't eaten, hadn't drunk, hadn't gone to the bathroom, I just read it all straight through. I could _not_ put it down. Damn, but it was a good read! It's not a 'stripper with a heart of gold' story, nor is it 'my sob story about how I was victimised by the sex industry.' It's about a sex worker as a real person, and I didn't feel preached to or insulted by the work, as I have by some others.The only fault I could see with the book was that there wasn't enough of it!"},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I love reading books about other women's perspective of the sex industry. Being in the industry myself it's kind of like a secret circle that only other SW understand so I was able to laugh out loud and nod my head in agreement and disbelief.

Very entertaining, moved fast and not a lot off fluff all filler."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"This memoir was one of the best I've ever read!

I'd rate it higher if I could. I loved the book. It was exactly what I was looking for.I was interested in a book written by a female adult sex worker based on her experiences in the sex/porn industry. That is exactly what this book is and does and it does it in highly graffic detail. It spares no punches. It tells it like it is. There can be no doubt from the stories in this book that the author's \\"been there and done that\\". I learned a lot.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it to others. It's a great read."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I found the writing witty and sharp. Definitely an insider's look into the sex industry, the one thing I think is missing from the book is more information of the author's personal life. There was very little information about her family, friends outside the industry, or a significant other. I also wondered what she did with all the money. If someone is making several hundred dollars per day, has no car, kids, pets, and rents an apt, you'd think there would be something to show for it, yet it seems like the author is always broke. A great read but I felt that the author kept readers at a distance just like she did her customers."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"This is the first of the 'stripper books' I've read that takes the reader into the grind of the daily existence of a worker in the sex industry. There are no pretensions on Lewis's part. She's in it to make money, and she lays her mercenary nature out there for the reader. To her, each customer is simply a bag of money to be shaken loose of as much of its lucre as possible. The writing is funny and charming. Lewis enjoys what she does, even if there are bad days, and it shows."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for HireI somehow stumbled upon this book by linking from book to book on Amazon. After reading about both the book and the author, I realized that I had to have it. I literally drove all over the city until I finally located it at a bookstore. I immediately took it home and dived right in.Yes, this book is sometimes crass and at times I let out little yelps of disgust over some things I read (the glass peep show booth \\"cleaning\\") but in all honestly thats what kept me turning the pages. You can completely relate to this woman and what she goes through - its all very real and very believable. The only downfall is that it wasn't long enough and that it ended at all! I could have kept on and on reading her tales of sex work and never gotten bored. I have since started reading her LiveJournal.If you are easily offended I suggest you skip this title - but if you have an open mind and are curious about the life of a real sex worker this book is definately for you!"},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I heard about this book from the Modern Times bookstore newsletter, but opted to stay home that night and then Sarah popped up on my ipod. Apparently she did a lecture for the Poly Sci 179 class at Berkeley. She was so unapologetic, honest and charming, I knew I had to pick up the book. This book is an easy read and really funny.. Here is the kicker, it also made me feel about myself. Yes, that sounds cheesy, but she constantly states that she is not the average body type, but there is a market for everyone. Coming from someone who makes a living with their body, that is somehow reassuring. Even re-reading that statement is looks dumb, but I don't care, it's honest. Hilarious, tough, charming, extremely witty. Her industry/social/personal analysis is insightful and never preachy. She doesn't pretend to have all the answers, actually she doesn't pretend to have any answers. I just loaned my copy to a friend on the strict condition that he bring it back. I recommend you go buy your own. I also recommend you take a listen to the podcast."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"Ms Lewis takes us with her on an adventure that many of us would never dare go. Curious and cautious I opened this book. Why? You know why.I could not put it down until it was done.Why? Ms. Lewis tells her story with compassion, honestly and an intimate sense of self about her experience in a world, that although improved, still doesn't offer many options for a working class woman. This is the story of one woman's way of staying alive. The utterly amazing thing is that she hasn't sold anything of herself. She is a rare women who knows her worth. The authenticity and honesty of this tale will keep you captivated until the very last page."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I recently purchased and read this book, and am frankly a little disturbed that an editorial review would accuse Ms. Lewis of being disingenuous. That's a strong word, for a writer so straightforward, material still so taboo in everyday living and a narrative as honest as this one.Sarah-Katherine Lewis gives us a raw, truthful look at ten-plus years in the sex industry. I never felt as if she were holding back, from her descriptions of revulsion at a close-call sexual assault incident with a customer, to her vivid and frank discussions of her first days as a sex worker, to addressing body issues vs. pornography.That a National Merit Scholar-turned-sex-worker couldn't possibly be comfortable in her own body, couldn't possibly get a good night's sleep after 'peeing herself' on camera, or couldn't be a positive role model for women by being truthful and encouraging other women to embrace their own femininity is exemplary of the misogynistic umbrella under which our culture continues to operate. This isn't a book about a hooker/stripper/etc. who steps off the dancefloor and \\"finds her way,\\" but yet it IS - on her own terms. Sarah's redemption, her \\"own way\\" comes in the form of self-awareness, and through her blatant and sometimes overwhelming honesty about actual life events, she encourages the reader to find his or her own truths.If those truths challenge taboos and end up being a little alarming, I would suggest the reader try something a little more - Dickens."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"After waiting and waiting I was overjoyed to see the ubiquitous brown Amazon box hit my doorstep! I've been reading Sarah-Katherine's livejournal for years, and to see this book come to fruition I felt strangely proud and so, so excited.It's all real and it's all there. It is thoroughly entertaining and unabashedly honest......there's no sugar coating and this isn't a romanticized account of the sex trade. Everything is vivid and coarse, beautiful and horrifying at the same time. This is truly a job, but she approaches it almost as an undercover reporter, making her almost the Donnie Brasco of stripping, peepshows, etc.The characters and places are all lovingly described, even the ones that the author doesn't love. This book makes you a VIP to what is really happening behind the velvet curtains and plexiglass windows."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"This is a very sad book about Sarah Lewis' addiction to the sex industry. I think her to be in a love/hate relationship with her chosen profession. She despises her clients and yet can't wait to take it a notch higher. One can't help to think that she has performed (and deep down really enjoys) things well beyond those she has admitted to in this book. I feel very sorry for her because her future is no question...and I think part of her is begging for help. She needs to get out of such a horrible business, seek therapy, and turn her life around."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"A wonderful read.

That's the aspect that makes her seem slippery, and addiction is well known to keep you working at a career you need to be high to perform. It's one of the most notorious and famous things about it. 12 step meetings are full of sex workers and bar tenders who after a certain point are told that if they want to get clean and sober they're going to have to find another profession. Most don't want to give it up for the power and attention it gives them. And the very good reasons it gives them to use.SK is much better and more talented than she knows.

The author's perspective definitely reminded me of some of the women I have worked with as a pro domme -- punked out girls who first learn how to be femme when they realize it can earn them some cash, but who really have no passion or natural inclination for the work. She describes some pretty raunchy, degrading situations she gets herself into, seeming to not have any respect for her clients or herself as she performs acts that are completely unerotic and even disturbing to her. It's an us versus them approach that has very little sympathy or understanding for the men. She even describes picking clients pockets while lapdancing them! In my opinion, you get back what you dish out. If you expect sex work to be disgusting, despicable work then it will be. Definitely not my experience with it. But we each have our own story. This one was like rubbernecking a car wreck -- unpleasant but hard to turn away from."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I bought this book at the bookstore by my office, and as is the case with all books I buy that I'm interested in, I started reading it immediately when I got on the train to come home. When I turned the page to the new chapter with its gigantic headline \\"Real Live Horny Girl Next Door\\", it occurred to me that the guy standing right next to me was reading every word over my shoulder and was now convinced I was a freak.The author should probably take that as a compliment - I don't really care if he thinks I'm a freak, and he obviously cared enough to leer over my shoulder for my 45 minute commute home.I wouldn't refer to myself as a prude in any sense of the word, but I admit I blushed a little bit as I started to read it. The language is necessar - after all, I can't describe my day at work without using the words \\"computer\\" and \\"rendering\\" (I work in 3D modeling at an architecture firm), so how could the author describe her job without a variety of different words of male genitalia? After you get past the first few pages of your own potential embarassment, all those \\"cock\\"s and \\"pussy\\"s are just words, as they should be, and the book reads smoothly. When describing a sexual act, it's easy to resort to overromanticizing on one end or an incredibly base vernacular on the other, channeling online erotica writers everywhere - thankfully our author doesn't do that for a second. Her job is her job, and she describes things just as they happen. It isn't sexy, but it isn't repulsive. Some people wait tables, she pretends to masturbate for money. We all put in our hours to make our rent, and this is no exception.The book doesn't have any real conclusion, which seems to make a certain amount of sense as the writer is a blogger. It's more of an opportunity to glance into ten years of her life, as if you're reading the diary of a woman coming into her own and becoming comfortable with herself. It was a quick read and could be accomplished in a couple of open afternoons. The writer's style is easy to get into and offers a blunt, straightforward view into what it means to be a woman in the adult entertainment industry. If you're looking for smut, this isn't it, but if you're looking for an intelligently written account of a job few of us will ever experience, this is the book for your Saturday afternoon."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"I had to read this book since I have lived in Seattle for a year and a half now and I find it interesting to read about all the hidden places in the city!This was definately a good read. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next and it kept me turning the pages but that was the only thing that made me give it four stars. To begin with, one thing I didn't quite understand was the naming of the chapters. All are named after songs and while some bear a slight resemblance to its contents, most do not. I am also not quite sure that I bought into the whole \\"It's okay for feminists to do this work because we get paid and thus have power\\". People get paid for working at McDonald's too and probably get about as much respect. The author also claims that she feels just great about herself and her work but that sounded hollow next to the more than frequent passages where she graphically describes her murderous rage toward her customers. I totally felt the depressive vibe that permeated this book. Nowhere does the author talk about having friends or family and it seems that when she is not working in the sex industry, she is at home watching television. The author is at pains to describe that she keeps her work personality seperate from her real personality but readers are not permitted to see that other reality, we are only led from seedy joint to seedy joint. Maybe in writing about the sex industry, she keeps her game face on. There were obvious passages where the author was conflicted about her work and I think that went a little way towards adding to the reality of working in such an industry. I also appreciated her humor, intelligence and the candid way in which she approached life in general."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"This is a book about someone (Ms. Lewis) who has chosen to be part of a life style that a large percentage of average people would not look upon favorably (or worse.) But it is also a book that helps one understand the why's and who's of being a sex worker, and the fact that sex workers are human beings with feelings much like our own.I loved this book, couldn't put it down. I related to Ms Lewis from a father's viewpoint. From beginning to end I was with her. The book so wonderfully describes her various feelings from when she began until the present. In a business that most people consider very negatively, she has accomplished a lot on her own. Her intelligence, independence, courage, the dangers, the concerns, her strong feelings, they sure do come through in the book..Ms Lewis style of writing carried me along from experience to experience. It is fascinating to hear about the various places she has worked and the people she worked with. It gave me such mixed feelings of knowing what one goes through and realizing that underneath it all is a woman who wants and needs times of love and closeness and caring.The book is beautifully written, never doubt it. Every so often she'd have me laughing at the way she described something. Throughout the book she conveyed how scary it was each time she applied for a new job, how unsure of her abilities she was at times. It was very interesting to learn of what goes on in various types of sex work as I have never before heard in such detail.Most startling and yet something that one might not be surprised about if given some thought is the way the author feels about her clients/customers......... realizing that for the sex worker, it is a job, one that pretty much requires shutting out the feelings that one in love would have.I am really glad I read this book for it let me understand that those we might avoid are just as human as we are, just as wise, just as caring."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"It may be strange to call this book fun, but aren't we all fascinated in the behind-the-scenes of the adult industry?

From the peep show to the \\"release massage\\" we get to peek into a forbidden world from the sex worker's point of view.Lewis doesn't spend a lot of time boo-hooing about her past or circumstances that brought her to adult work. Instead, she expresses a true curiosity that let to a career that, while it has its definite downsides, is a career that gave her freedom and allowed her to be true to herself.I want to know what happened next!"},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"Lewis's insistent voice mesmerized me instantly, modulating with skill between straightforward and smart, funny and angry, analytical and lyrical. Her memoir takes us through ten years in the sex industry, from her beginning as a wide-eyed \\"new girl\\" in Seattle to her stint in boozy New Orleans in the last few months before she evacuated for Hurricane Katrina.As a narrator, Lewis is engaging and empathetic. As a commentator on the lives of sex workers, she's open and incisive. *Indecent*'s final judgment of the sex industry isn't simple-minded or single-sided: Lewis presents the conflicted sentiments of a stripper towards the (empowering; degrading; freeing; narrow; challenging; mindless) job that pays her rent with honesty that's as fascinating as it is clear-eyed."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"The PW review above is ridiculous -- could the reviewer really have thought that a sex industry professional dishing about the realities of her job was going to be a work of \\"titillating erotica\\"?Ms. Lewis describes what it's like to make a living by creating and selling fantasies. The truths she tells here are hilarious and fascinating, sometimes sad. (I can only imagine how dismaying they'd be to the people who pay to believe those fantasies!)

While there are many unanswered questions (aren't there always in biographical books?) this book does a remarkable job of laying it on the line and being a good story.

Most were while I was in college and were located in the infamous Boston \\"Combat Zone\\", which has since been redeveloped into \\"respectable\\" property. While in the establishments, I must say the last thing I ever thought about was how I was perceived as a customer. The author of this book, however, made me realize how I was viewed, and it isn't pretty.Reading this book, I came to realize that the women who work in this industry do so for a number of reasons, most of which never enter the conscious thoughts of average males. The book made me realize, for the first time, that these women were not there because they were too stupid or lazy to do \\"real\\" work, but rather because they enjoyed the freedoms the jobs provide. A number of other reasons surfaced in the book, but you'll have to read it to find them out.The book was a fascinating transition of a young woman from a barista at a coffee house into a proud, dignified worker who controlled her own fate. I highly recommend this book so as to get a look inside the industry, but also to see how young women can work in an industry, known for exploitation, without being exploited."},{"Title":"Indecent: How I Make It and Fake It as a Girl for Hire","review":"This was a great, very well-written book.

My Sandcastle","review":"&quot;Is it Bedtime Yet?&quot; has been a lifesaver for me. It's calm, tranquil melodies, coupled with it's soothing relaxation techniques have more than proven to be an unbeatable combination for lulling my daughter off to sleep. Before I discovered &quot;Is it Bedtime Yet?&quot;, our nightly ritual of going to bed, was a constant struggle of wills. Now, I can simply put the tape on, and in a mere matter of minutes, my daughter is sound asleep. You could almost say, that &quot;Is it Bedtime Yet?&quot;, has become the equivalent of a nighttime teddy bear for my daughter. My hats off...to this wonderfully effective tape."},{"Title":"Is It Bedtime Yet? My Sandcastle","review":"My 6 year old had insomnia. He had trouble relaxing when he laid down at night, so he had trouble falling asleep. The longer it took for him to fall asleep the more anxious and frustrated he became. It would sometime take him 2 hours to finally fall asleep, which would leave him exhausted in the morning and us very frustrated. I bought the tape thinking it probably wouldn't work, but it was worth a try. THIS TAPE IS AMAZING!!! Our son now falls asleep within 10 minutes of lights out and the tape on. The soothing voice, soft music, hum of a train and faint train-station sounds is very relaxing and soothing. He won't even try to fall asleep without it, and it works EVERY TIME!!! Our lives have been so much better--restfull and less-anxious--since I bought this tape."},{"Title":"Is It Bedtime Yet? My Sandcastle","review":"&quot;Is It Bedtime Yet&quot; answers its own question. It is definitely a pleasant bedtime for young children and their parents, that is, when this delightful audiotape is played. As a parent of two, I found the tape by accident and, after many playings, I was happy to discover it offered on Amazon.com. Given my positive experience with the tape, I though that I would pass my strong recommendation onto Amazon.com shoppers. Simply stated, &quot;Is It Bedtime Yet&quot; is an audiotape relaxation/sleep aid for young children. Based on my experience, the tape works well with children of about 3-11 years old. A female narrator with a very soothing voice talks, one-on-one, with the young person listening. There are no elaborate &quot;stories,&quot; as such; there are various vignettes where the female narrator talks, in a very relaxing manner, to a young listener. An important element of the tape is its sound, as the tape features relaxing backgrounds of nature sounds-- beach, forest, etc. While the tape may not put someone to sleep, it will very likely slow the tempo of a little one who may have had a very busy day. I found that the tape worked beautifully for kids-- and adults-- not only in a bedroom situation, but in a car (e.g., on a family trip-- in my case, it worked to settle everyone down in a midday situation, reducing the noise level appreciably for a considerable period!). I would strongly recommend &quot;Is It Bedtime Yet&quot; for any parent of pre-teen children, especially given its low purchase price. Speaking of its price on Amazon.com, I must admit that I was shocked to discover that Amazon.com customers could buy the tape for much less than I paid for it. Well, that's your good fortune! The &quot;Is It Bedtime Yet&quot; tape would be a perfect gift from grandparents to parents-- and a perfect gift for grandparents who do some babysitting. An &quot;investment&quot; in &quot;Is It Bedtime Yet&quot; may pay you dividends as a parent for years to come! You and your kids will love it!"},{"Title":"SONNETS","review":"William Shakespeare is best known as a playwright. When you think of Shakespeare, you automatically think of plays -- \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" \\"Macbeth,\\" \\"Hamlet,\\" etc.But he was also a poet of considerable skill. And while he sprinkled his various plays with poetry and songs, his poems are best appreciated when they're read all by themselves -- particularly the cluster of brilliant \\"Sonnets\\" that he penned. These works just have a unique, hauntingly vivid flavour of their own.Each sonnet has no title, and is simply identified by numbers. And while Shakespeare's love poems are the best known of these works, he addresses different themes in theme -- old age, writer's block loneliness, the cruelty of the world, sex, beauty, a mysterious rival poet, and Shakespeare's own complicated romantic feelings (love that \\"looks upon tempests and is not shaken\\").And these poems are absolutely lovely. Some of these sonnets are pretty well-known (\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?/Thou art more lovely and more temperate\\") but most of them are a little more obscure. They have vivid metaphors and imagery (\\"let not winter's ragged hand deface,\\" \\"gold candles fix'd in heaven's air\\") and hauntingly lovely passages (\\"What is your substance, whereof are you made,/That millions of strange shadows on you tend?\\").And these sonnets really give you new insights into Shakespeare as a person -- he feels uncertainty, passionate love, unhappiness, lust and quirky humor. But while it's obvious these sonnets were deeply personal, they can still be appreciated on their own, particularly as love poetry.William Shakespeare's \\"Sonnets\\" are rich with meaning, language and atmosphere -- the Elizabethan English takes a little deciphering, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"SONNETS","review":"Just received it today (7-12-2010). Sweet little book, would tell others about it, the nice little size allows me to carry it in my purse. This is my first book of Shakespeare, I'm more mature now, and can appreciate these types of fine literature."},{"Title":"Religion and Politics in German History","review":"This is a highly recommended work for it's depth of insight between the continued relationship of the waning Mediterranean power of Rome, and emergence of the persistently condemned yet shadowy Germanic peoples. Accordingly, with their fearful intrusion, the ancient world ceases to be of an inherent, relatively cohesive amalgamation. Its horizon would henceforth be rent wide open from the north.Frank Eyck gives a more positively involved picture and charts the development and interrelationship of the Holy Roman Empire with that of the Papacy. As factional violence in Rome made the seat of St. Peter's vulnerable, Leo III relied on the presence of Charlemagne to secure his position as Pope, resulting with the coronation of Charlemagne as Roman Emperor by the Pope in 800 A.D. A Western Emperor of a Holy Roman Empire that was once beyond the pale would be a counter poise not only to the East Roman Empire, but of the Pope himself. This act unconsciously created a dualistic, volatile embrace between secular and spiritual spheres of jurisdiction. The Universalist claims between Pope and Holy Roman Emperor, between the overlapping temporal and spiritual affairs, or religion and politics, were to clash and resonate through the centuries to come.Parallel to this, Eyck takes us within the German principalities themselves, where internal power struggles often kept Germanic Emperors absent from Italian affairs. Eventually, in order to assert Papal independence more fully, German involvement recedes and is replaced by the removal of the Papacy from unsafe Rome to Avignon. Consequently, the Papacy became even more constrained under French Kings than absent German Emperors.Genealogical tables help in the delineation of the Carolingians, Saxon, Salian and Staufen dynasties, as well as Luxemburg, Hapsburg and Hohenzollern. The sheer scope of this book continues to take us through the Reformation and beyond to the beginning of the French Revolution.In the end, looking back down the distance that has been travelled, the positive transmission of classical culture through a vigorous, more and more fully absorbed Germanic culture with many original elements of its own, acted as a conduit to the middle ages and gave European history a sense of \`continuity' as well as transformation. Eyck's consistent inner German perspective makes that journey a rare experience for any reader interested in the development of not just German, but European history."},{"Title":"The Complete American-Jewish Cookbook: In Accordance With the Jewish Dietary Laws","review":"I have many cookbooks, but this is the one I always return to. I've been using it for almost 3 decades, and hope to use it for many more.It's not a kitchy book, nor is it filled with complicated recipes.This cookbook has the pure basics of cooking kosher food, and even when I feel like experimenting and making up a recipe, I often refer to it to see cooking times for certain items, like meat, rice, etc.as well as suggestions for what spices go well with whatfoods.It has loads of recipes, several for each type of food and is good for the beginner and also for the more experienced cook. I've been looking for this book for a while, and plan to order one for both my daughter and new daughter in law.

I don't know about you, but too many cookbooks these days are about \\"boutique\\" cooking, with glossy pages and strategically sprinkled caraway seeds and artistic squirts of wasabi-lime sauce.But not this gem.This is a cookbook that encourages you to make new things, regardless of your budget/access to gourmet specialty shops/ Julia Child-like ability. This is an everywoman's cookbook, and is best suited for \\"real people\\", yet gives experienced and creative cooks the inspiration to shine.

The basic recipes allow for a great many variations without getting complicated."},{"Title":"The Complete American-Jewish Cookbook: In Accordance With the Jewish Dietary Laws","review":"This book is truly timeless. . . . .My mother had this book while I was growing up (I'm 48, it is 2003 as I write this) and it was the most used cook book, or maybe, book of any kind, in my conservative-Jewish home.I bought this book when I got married, and my wife and I have used it and worn it out over 26 years of marriage. It is the most used cook book in my orthodox-Jewish home.My daughter got married last August. At my wife's suggestion, I am buying two more - one for my daughter, who lives in Israel, and one for my son for whenever he gets amrried (We'll keep it sealed so it stays new until then.)"},{"Title":"Point of Departure","review":"I am an English teacher and I use this book with grades 9-12. The stories hit home for many of my students, as they are all coming-of-age pieces. I often refer to character development (what do his/her actions say about him/her as a person?), moral dilemmas, and teenage issues that are still relevant today even if the story appears to be dated to my students. We also focus on how the character's perspectives change from beginning to end, and what internal and external conflicts the character has to deal with.My favorite story is \\"The White Circle\\" -- as it is the most shocking story for the students to deal with, and it is also short enough that we can read it and discuss it in one class period."},{"Title":"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star: A Traditional Lullaby","review":"My youngest son has suffered from severe asthma ever since he was an infant and he's almost 20 years old now. Some of my most painful memories are of watching him struggle with the torture of this disease when he was very small, and feeling the awful helplessness a parent feels when they have done all they can and still the suffering continues. When my son was at his sickest we would snuggle close and I would rub his back and quietly sing &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star&quot; to him in a slow, soothing voice. Sometimes I would need to sing it for a long while before he could finally relax enough to fall asleep. I had to learn all the verses besides the familiar one and I had to make up several additional ones, too! As he grew older I continued to sing it when things were bad. When he was sad or in pain or facing a tough time, he would cuddle up and ask for a back rub and &quot;Twinkle Twinkle.&quot; I think he was 18 the last time I sang it and he was suffering heartbreak rather than asthma. Well, to get to the point, this book does complete justice to the special song that has meant so much in our lives. It has all of the verses and they are very beautiful. Sylvia Long's lovely illustrations show little animal children dressed in cute clothes like sweaters and blue jeans as they sit together on a country hill gazing up at the diamonds in the sky. Then we see each of the children go to their own homes where their loving parents cuddle them off to bed. They have such cute and colorful jammies on. The love between a parent and child shines throughout this little charmer just like a twinkling star. I love it!"},{"Title":"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star: A Traditional Lullaby","review":"As a parent, this is one of the books I find I actually enjoy reading to my kids over and over again. The verse is soothing and a nice way to wind down before bed time. The illustrations are beautiful and interesting. They are full of details and patterns that hold your attention on each page. They tell a story of their own. My two-year-old daughter loves seeing all the bedtime rituals the animals pictured in the book are doing with their families in all their own homes. I think this book made her enjoy singing \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" a little bit more."},{"Title":"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star: A Traditional Lullaby","review":"Sylvia Long seems to find a way to make every drawing on every page have hidden detail. My two and half year old kids love to sing \\"Twinkle Twinkle\\" but this little book makes it every more special. They like the sub-story of the fox lighting the lamp posts and the animal-children going home, eating dinner, and getting ready for bed. Most of all, they notice the detail in the animals' PJs or dinner plates and want to talk about that just as much as read the rhyme.As always, a fabulous book from Ms. Long."},{"Title":"50 Relatives Worse Than Yours","review":"\\"50 Relatives Worse Than Yours,\\" by Justin Racz, is a cleverly designed work of humor that catalogues 50 different types of annoying or embarrassing relatives--Buffet Loiterers, Holistic New Age Aunt, Power-Hungry Hosts, Family Newsletter Publisher, Glory Days Dad, The Computer-Illiterate Generation, Slutty First Cousin, Religious Zealots, The Force Feeder, Cheek Pincher, The Vegan, and more. Each profile features an illustration (generally a photograph), as well as characteristics of the type that are broken down by category. Some of the categories used throughout the book are the relatives' mottos, typical gifts they give, their secrets, the benefits of having them, and the drawbacks of having them.Racz's humor is occasionally rude, cruel, or repellent, but I found the book undeniably entertaining. And I imagine that the average reader will recognize some of these types in his/her family, or in other people's families. As a bonus, the 51st entry is labeled \\"Your Relative\\"--the reader can supply an illustration and characteristics for a type of irritating relative not covered in the book. A good book to reference around holiday times, when you are likely to run into some of these types."},{"Title":"50 Relatives Worse Than Yours","review":"I read this book after reading 50 Jobs Worse than Yours by the same author. Fifty jobs is so hilarious that my expectations were high for 50 Relatives, maybe unrealistically. The format of the two books is similar. In 50 Relatives, 50 generic family types are listed with picture and six descriptive categories such as profile, gift, motto, fame, benefits, secrets, drawbacks, or gift. The problem with this book, for me at least, is that too many of these relatives are already in my family and are not worse than mine.My favorite relatives in 50 Relatives are: the cheek pincher (just like an aunt of mine), the force feeder (my grandmother, my father, etc,), Uncle Stan the camera man and his endless poses, the gold digger, and the slutty first cousin, one of whom I did not have in my family.Anyway,50 Relatives has its funny moments, is easy to read, and fun to share. I will concede that many of the pictures are a hoot. If you're deciding between 50 jobs and 50 relatives, get \\"50 Jobs Worse Than Yours.\\" Just be forewarned. You might even find yourself in this book."},{"Title":"50 Relatives Worse Than Yours","review":"One of the funniest books I've read in a long time.

Hilger & Scott Connors","review":"I found these stories interesting primarily because of the vivid descriptions of the worlds that Volmar and his crew encounter. Sadly, there is very little to the stories other than that. There is really not much contained in these stories in the way of plot or character development. All three stories employ the same formula; the crew is stranded or captured on an alien planet, they encounter nightmarish flora and fauna, and then they escape. I liked the stories for what they are, but if you're looking for stories that contain an actual point (other than to freak the reader out with weird descriptions), these are probably not for you."},{"Title":"Red World of Polaris: The Adventures of Captain Volmar. Edited by Ronald S. Hilger & Scott Connors","review":"Fun, exciting and marvelously imaginative, The Red World of Polaris will not fail to delight fans of pulpy Golden Age exploration and other campy Gernsback retronauts. If you liked Forbidden Planet (the movie) or John Carter of Mars, this will provide a new series of interplanetary adventures where the planets and their strange inhabitants are the protagonists and where the humans are just hapless victims. Apparently had a strong influence on HP Lovecraft, since this is the book from which he derived the Shoggoths. Too bad this collection is so short, but the full CAS collection from Night Shade Books should make up for it."},{"Title":"Night Roamers and Other Stories (European Short Stories Series)","review":"\\"Night Roamers and Other Stories\\" is a collection of \\"discovered\\" stories from the Nobel Laureate Knut Hamsun. There's probably a reason that most of these stories had to be \\"discovered\\" but they all have the stamp of the unique author. The title story starts us out and it is a fairly decent snapshot of a night on the town as seen by an observer; not a participant. \\"My Traveling Companion\\" is another standard Hamsun story about a deranged traveling companion. Hamsun's world is full these types of people. \\"On Tour\\" is another Hamsun-style account of all the pitfalls that happened the author on tour. Despite a good example of Hamsun paranoia, I thought that the story was too long and too trivial. \\"Bad Days\\" can be described the same way. Likewise, the story \\"Sin\\" deals in great detail about a young girl who stole flowers from a cemetary. There may have been a message there but it must have passed me by.Hamsun seems to have travelled a lot in his career. The closing story, \\"A Fragment of Life\\", paints a boring, self-indulgent picture of a spoiled young man who seemed to have left home in search of better partying. On the basis of his travel stories, Hamsun was a pretty good observer of his surroundings so I don't see \\"A Fragment of Life\\" as autobiographic.There is a good detailed account of each of the stories by Lars Frode Larsen who gives the history of each story and other related trivia.I have down-played the quality of \\"Night Roamers and Other Stories\\" mainly because I've read a lot of Hamsun and most of it better that this. Hamsun reminds me of a slightly disturbed yet brilliant nerd in college who can be quite amusing so long as you keep him away from your other friends. Hamsun may have focussed on a lot of trivial scenarios in \\"Night Roamers\\" but, with his talent, he can make trivial seem quite unique."},{"Title":"Creole families of New Orleans,","review":"I would recommend the book to anyone doing research in Louisiana, particularly in New Orleans.

Written by Alfonso Caso, who directed the findings at Monte Alban and was the former director of archeology in the National Museum of Mexico, the man knows his history. The Aztecs and all their rituals , including the Gods and calendar are explained in easy to read language. The text is not overburdensome with highly specialiazed jargon but is eloquent and to the point. This book is an easy read. The illustrations are worth the price of the book alone. They are by Miguel Covarrubias, one of Mexico's finest illustrators at the time, and he does a fantastic job depicting the colorful Aztec world. An essential book for anyone intersted in exploring the Aztecs."},{"Title":"Bear, Man, and God: Eight Approaches to William Faulkner's the Bear","review":"Found this in my library while doing research on Faulkner.

Both Zoe and Ethan decide to give their marriage of convenience a chance to become something deeper as they settle into domestic tranquility in Whispering Springs, Arizona.Zoe's peace of mind suffers a severe setback when she senses some disturbed psychic energy, the kind that she felt in the mental institution. While Zoe worries that she might be going crazy, her friend Arcadia who also lives in Whispering Springs finds herself in danger from the husband who once tried to kill her. She has something he wants and Grant will use any means to retrieve it. He muddles the works by making it look like Ethan is the target and if they don't discover the truth soon Arcadia will find herself in deadly danger.TRUTH OR DARE is Jayne Ann Krentz at her very best. Her quirky characters include a Feng Shui psychic interior decorator, a body guard that looks like a skeleton and two cute children who play matchmaker for their mother. They make this work of romantic suspense a delightful reading experience. There are three different couples and several sub-plots that lead into the main storyline that adds a sense of family to what is essentially an action oriented tale. Ms Krentz's talent continues to grow and change in amazing ways that will please fans of this talented author.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Ms. Krentz's latest is another chapter in the Whispering Springs saga, as interior designer Zoe Truax and her new husband, Ethan, try to make a go of their fledgling marriage. While Zoe competes with fellow designer Lindsey Voyle for a decorating gig, her psychic powers lead her to some disturbing conclusions, as she witnesses some negative energy in a model home she is helping design. Several plotlines carefully mesh together, as friend Arcadia fears that her supposedly dead husband may find her, Zoe searches for the source of her psychic episodes, and Ethan becomes the target of a murderer. Yet readers will not only be attracted to the smoothly transitioned story line-the characters are both believable and likeable, making this second Whispering Springs novel(after LIGHT IN SHADOWS) a must read. One can only hope that Ms. Krentz's literary pursuits will include more novels in the Whispering Springs series."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I enjoyed watching the relationships (friendship, familial, and marital) of the various characters introduced in Light and Shadows continue to develop. Both Whispering Springs books are \\"keepers\\" and I have enjoyed them enough to have not only purchased the hard copy, but the audio and e-book editions as well."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"JAK was never the most complex author around. We know this. But her latest book has me worrying about the deterioration of her talent... or what the publishers consider fit to put into hardcover.Was this a book written for adults? JAK's sentence structure, while never complex, borders on simplistic in this book. With lines like \\"Daria looked very happy\\" and \\"he could feel the positive energy of happiness in the air\\" I was beginning to wonder if she'd decided to write a novel for twelve year olds and then threw in a few less-than-spicy sex scenes to please the romance fans. She's also developed this annoying habit of bringing the reader up to date on things that happened only a few pages ago, filling in the gaps of her characters thought patters as if a rational adult couldn't think the situation through.The plot is boring, with too many strains to follow and not enough emotion to make me care whether Zoe and Ethan stay together - in fact, the only hint of excitement in the story was the bit concerning Arcadia's supposedly dead husband, and that was over so quickly you had to wonder why she put it in at all. This novel didn't seem to have a point, save that the preceding book was rather good, and she felt it needed a sequel. But this isn't a sequel. It's an afterward, at best.Add one star, I guess, if you can get this from the library and not shell out the money for a hard cover. I feel like I've been burned and certainly won't be paying for any of JAK's future efforts."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I had never heard of this author before and picked this book on cd up at the library. It moved at a snails pace, the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery - but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters - finally when something does happen by the 8th cd - its anticlimactic. And althought he main character continually talks about being psychic - she never once has a premonition, other than feeling \\"spiderwebs\\" when she walks in a room. I couldn't wait for this book to end, and I will probably never pick up another book by this author, even though other reviewers say she writes good books. I kept wondering if it would be better, if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd. That didn't help matters."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I elected to listen to the unabridged audio version of this book. Boy, it was full of fluffy dialogue that had nothing to do with the &quot;plots&quot;. A few action scenes squeezed in between boring interaction between the characters. It got painful to listen to every detail the character did while speaking. Do we really need to know that she opened the car door, took the grocery bag out, closed the car door, walked 3 steps to the green gate, etc. It went on and on. Maybe actually reading the book wouldn't have been so bad.Or maybe I should have listened to the abridged version. It could have been condensed to 2 discs!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"First off I have to say I'm a long time JAK fan and have ALL her books. I was quite disappointed in this book I was bored silly I really didn't care what happened to them. It's so bland!!!I can't say I liked Light in Shadows alot it was ok. I truly truly hated the eclipse bay series I really think she should not do trilogies or series I'm sorry but she's just no good at it.I actually was getting very disappointed in her books to the point where I considered not buying them any more then she seem to come back and I was enjoying her books again but the last 2 certainly is making me wonder. I am a VERY loyal reader and while I won't say I will completely stop buying her books yet I would certainly consider buying the hardcover books. I'm not sure if she will do another book on these characters I for one sure hope not?????"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This book was wonderful and I highly recommend it.

Jayne Ann Krentz picks up right where she left off in Light in Shadow. Zoe and Ethan Truax are still trying to see if their experimental marriage will work, all the while working on their respective careers as interior designer and private investigator. Zoe's friend Arcadia begins to ge the feeling she's being watched and the romantic thriller takes off. The pacing in this novel is a little off--the main conflict is resolved with about 50 pages left of the novel, and suddenly, there is another conflict that wasn't really hinted at earlier. That, though is my only complaint about this enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"... because there IS no center.

Zoe's fellow escapee from the psychiatric hospital Arcadia Ames is also feeling out of sorts. She has also assumed a new name trying to escape the husband trying to kill her, and she feels someone is watching her. Zoe is still hiding her psychic abilities from Ethan. Ethan is still trying to deal with the death of his brother. Everyone is ill at ease.I didn't enjoy this book as much as the first one. I was hoping Ethan and Zoe would solidify their relationship, but they didn't. As long as Ethan doesn't believe Zoe is psychic, they can never be truly happy. I was hoping for some event or something to happen that would convince Ethan of her ability."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I adored JAK's Light in Shadow - the first in the Whispering Springs Novels. The characters were crisp, witty and it was JAK at her best.This is not.Not that it is bad. It's just this is in the pattern of her recent trilogies of books. One really good and then two weaker continuation of the same story. I really hoped since Light and Shadow was so strong that she would break that curse. I love JAK - she is one of my favourite writers, but I do feel let down by these weaker part 2 and 3 of her JAK and Quick efforts of late. Only the Eclipse Bay books were as good all the way through. In paperback, maybe you would grump less, but at hardback prices her fans deserver a little bit more.When we last saw the Whispering Hills gang, it was just a month early. Ethan Truax, PI, had married Zoe Luce to stop Zoe's brother-in-law from trying to pop her back in to the high-priced Candle Lake Manor Psychiatric Hospital. The bluff had worked and the mystery - who killed Zoe's husband - was solved. Zoe's fellow escapee from Crystal Lake - Arcadia was now living with Harry, Ethan's PI friend. Neither Zoe or Arcadia had mental problems, but Crystal Lake specialised in hiding rich people's &quot;embarrassments&quot; - for enough money they quietly keep the problemsome relative away from prying eyes. However, in Arcadia's case, she was actually hiding from a husband, and deliberately checked herself into Crystal Lake. Grant Loring tried to kill her. She figured her husband would never look for her at an institute for the mentally ill.Arcadia suddenly fears, Grant's still alive - not dead from a skiing accident as reported - and that he has now decided to come after his wife who has too much information on him. She fears her &quot;new&quot; identity has been compromised.But the whole gang, for one reason or another is uneasy. It's November, the month Ethan's brother was murdered, leaving Ethan, Bonnie, his sister-in-law, and his two nephews dealing with the grief. Ethan also is concerned about his marriage. He jumped at the chance to use the excuse of protecting Zoe, when he really wanted to marry her. Now, he fears she may be having second thoughts. Zoe is having seconds thoughts, but not because of love. She loves Ethan, but he refuses to believe Zoe is psychic, just chalks up her &quot;gift&quot; to good intuition. She feels if he cannot accept WHAT she is how can he love her? This is a sticking point, especially when she starts running into &quot;spider webs&quot; of dark emotions somehow connected to Crystal Lake. But those worries, take a back seat when someone tries to kill Ethan. Is it connected to his brother's death? Connected to Zoe's stay at Crystal Lake? Or the con man that Ethan exposed?Frankly, this books is a pleasant read, with some really fine JAK's humour, but on the whole, she once again has too many story lines going all at once - to hide there is not much of a mystery (Smoke and Mirrors problem). The romance between Zoe and Ethan gets pushed aside as it become the &quot;Gang's&quot; Story. It's like JAK has lost the heart to write romance, so she covers it with food, food and more food (Quick's Don't Look Back's Problem).This is enjoyable, diverting, and will please fans, but they would do well to wait for paperback. Then you won't feel so let down.The same complaints I see from other readers concerning her last half dozen books - thin mysteries, too many story threads and not enough romance on the leads - seems to be a trap JAK is falling into over and over again."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I adored JAK's Light in Shadow - the first in the Whispering Springs Novels. The characters were crisp, witty and it was JAK at her best.This does measure up to that book. Not that it is bad. It's just this is in the pattern of her recent trilogies of books. One really good and then two weaker continuation of the same story. I really hoped since Light and Shadow was so strong that she would break that curse. I love JAK - she is one of my favourite writers, but I do feel a wee bit let down by these weaker part 2 and 3 books. Only the Eclipse Bay books were as good all the way through, in fact got stronger as they went. In paperback, maybe you would grump less, but at hardback prices her fans might feel they deserve a little bit more.When we last saw the Whispering Hills gang, it was just a month early. Ethan Truax, PI, had married Zoe Luce to stop Zoe's brother-in-law from trying to pop her back in to the high-priced Candle Lake Manor Psychiatric Hospital. The bluff had worked and the mystery - who killed Zoe's husband - was solved. Zoe's fellow escapee from Crystal Lake - Arcadia was now living with Harry, Ethan's PI friend. Neither Zoe or Arcadia had mental problems, but Crystal Lake specialised in hiding rich people's \\"embarrassments\\" - for enough money they quietly keep the problemsome relative away from prying eyes. However, in Arcadia's case, she was actually hiding from a husband, and deliberately checked herself into Crystal Lake. Grant Loring tried to kill her. She figured her husband would never look for her at an institute for the mentally ill.Arcadia suddenly fears, Grant's still alive - not dead from a skiing accident as reported - and that he has now decided to come after his wife who has too much information on him. She fears her \\"new\\" identity has been compromised.The whole gang, for one reason or another is uneasy. It's November, the month Ethan's brother was murdered, leaving Ethan, Bonnie, his sister-in-law, and his two nephews dealing with the grief. Ethan also is concerned about his marriage. He jumped at the chance to use the excuse of protecting Zoe, when he really wanted to marry her. Now, he fears she may be having second thoughts. Zoe is having seconds thoughts, but not because of love. She loves Ethan, but he refuses to believe Zoe is psychic, just chalks up her \\"gift\\" to good intuition. She feels if he cannot accept WHAT she is how can he love her? This is a sticking point, especially when she starts running into \\"spider webs\\" of dark emotions somehow connected to Crystal Lake. But those worries, take a back seat when someone tries to kill Ethan. Is it connected to his brother's death? Connected to Zoe's stay at Crystal Lake? Or the con man that Ethan exposed?Frankly, this books is a enjoyable read, with some really fine JAK's humour. On the whole, she once again has too many story lines going all at once - to hide there is not much of a mystery (Smoke and Mirrors problem). The romance between Zoe and Ethan is pushed aside as it become the \\"Gang's\\" Story. Maybe it's a transitional period for JAK. That passion for writing romance seem to have lost that brilliant spark. She covers with extra story threads, lots of chatter about food (yes, we know JAK doesn't like meat!!) food, food and more food (Quick's Don't Look Back's Problem).This is enjoyable, diverting, and will please fans, but they would do well to wait for paperback.The same complaints I see from other readers concerning her last half dozen books - thin mysteries, too many story threads shifting the focus from the leads - and the biggest zinger - not enough romance. This book just seems to anti-climatic after the first brilliant Whispering Springs tale which I adored."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"&quot;Truth Or Dare&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Light In Shadow&quot;.Many of the characters from &quot;Light In Shadow&quot; return and there is a lot going on in this story. A) Ethan and his family deal with the third anniversary of his brother's kidnap and murder, B) the growing attraction between Ethan's sister-in-law, Bonnie and biker, bookstore owner, computer expert Singleton Cobb, C) Ethan looks into solving the old mystery of writer Walter Kirwan's death and missing manuscript, D) Grant Loring, Arcadia's husband, is trying to eliminate her, E) Zoe must deal with a person from her past, F) Can Zoe and Ethan make their marriage work?, G) Zoe has interior decorating competition in the form of Lindsey Voyle, H) Is Nelson Radnor's wife having an affair?This is just a little of what is happening in this very busy novel. The story is so busy that there is very little time for romance but the author does a good job weaving the story that you really don't notice it. Now that Ethan and Zoe are married, there is a different approach to the romantic segment of the book.The writing is fast-paced, easy to read and precise. All loose ends are tied up with a heartwarming finish except one tiny issue that dogged Ethan and Zoe throughout the book. You will have to read it to find out what it is.I was delighted with this very entertaining read. I would like to read more Whispering Springs novels in the future."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This may not be JAK at her absolute best, but it is still a very nice sequel to Whispering Springs. There were enough good characterizations and plot turns to keep the reader engaged, and personally, I enjoyed it a lot. The best part about the book was a very accurate portrayal of how lack of direct communication and misunderstandings can affect relationships, and she illustrated this very well.Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Like a raft caught in a strong current, JAK's writing carried this reader along on a fascinating journey full of mystery, romance, companionship and good fun. I enjoyed the many story lines, woven together. I liked getting to know the 'old' characters better, and watched them wrestle with different angst than the typical romance. (The chapter with Singleton talking with Jeff about his murdered father was particularly poignant.) I laughed aloud several times. All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend a few hours."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"After reading the negative reviews on this book I tried to keep those complaints in mind when I sat down with my copy. I have to say that, for me, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. JAK delivered on all accounts as far as I'm concerned. We get more insight into Ethan and Zoe's relationship, which is beautiful and steamy as they share their insecurities. Ethan having been left by 3 previous wives causes him to question how long before Zoe does the same. And Zoe, knowing Ethan isn't big on the psychic \\"woo-woo\\" thing is afraid that he'll never fully know/accept her differences. Previous characters share in the story but not the \\"spotlight.\\" That can be annoying, I know, but these are characters that you love to hear about and that also carry major roles in this Mystery and in no way detract from the story. I also love the fact that we follow a multitude of Ethan's cases. Some intertwine, while others are an added layer of interest. In my opinion you can't go wrong with this author, she is very talented. This is a romance/mystery mild on the suspence, not at all like Karen Rose or Anne Stuart darker novels. JAK is what she is, in my opinion always enjoyable."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"The main characters and plots are well developed. Zoe and Ethan Truax continue to develop their relationship despite their differences in just about all areas. Ethan refuses to accept Zoe's paranormal abilities as anything more than intuition. While she tries to find ways to keep him safe and improve his health. The sub plots in this sequal are wonderful. The relationship that develops between Arcaida Ames and Harry Stag is heart warming. The book was funny. A must read for a Jayne Ann Krentz fan."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Even when she is not at her best, she's better than many of the authors out there. I enjoyed this book, as I have enjoyed so many of Ms. Krentz' books and hope she continues with the story of Singleton and Bonnie."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Newlyweds, Ethan and Zoe Truax work at their marriage amid the various mysterious happenings. This second in the Whispering Springs series, has various plot lines and scintillating characters. The two work at their marriage and at the same time try to protect their friends. Krentz has written a winner. She has decided to flesh out the main characters, much to this reader's liking and I hope that she will write a third novel in this series. Thank you for an enjoyable read over the holidays."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I know this is supposed to be intellectual fluff. The book equivilent of TV to be read when you don't want to be challenged, and I accept it as such. I don't know if she has just gotten complacent, ran our of time, or what?I have read several of her books under one of her other pseudonyms Jayne Castle, and I expect better writting and story development. If you like this type of book try reading Orchid, After Glow, or After Dark, published under that &quot;other&quot; name instead."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"One of four books I'm reading. Very good book like all of her books so far. I recommend it to by sister, nieces and friends. They visit just to read and snack."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Great second book. It's nice to see where a relationship goes after the romantic ending. This story had several layers of creepiness, suspicion, mistrust and outright doubt that the marriage would work. Even their dreams were forboding and held the spidery taint of something not quite right. I love the conversations about what it means to really be crazy and what it takes to accept the quirks of the one you love. Fun, slightly scary, and a little on the dark side, this book is a great second book in the series."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"The StoryZoe was in need of help from a PI, she just happened to walk into Ethan's office. The ended up in a whirlwind romance and were married shortly after. Zoe and Arcadia escaped from a mental institution where they were wrongly placed. Arcadia has been hiding from her murderous ex-husband and Zoe is hiding from her ex-inlaws. Now someone is stalking their group. They aren't sure who they are after, but one thing is certain - there is danger! Ethan tries to find out what is going on and who is after them. Together Zoe and Ethan will get to the bottom of this using Ethan's PI skills and Zoe's psychic ability.ThoughtsI was hesitant to read this book, but I'm so glad I did. It wasn't what I expected at all! I loved all the characters, very well written! I really liked Zoe and Ethan, their relationship is perfect. They complement each other very well. Their marriage was a convenience at first, but now it is turning into something real and deep. The mystery and psychic hints are intriguing and interesting. I couldn't put this book down."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Received excellent Service. Ordered book on Friday and received it in the mail on Monday. Book was in very good condition. The seller did an excellent job. No hestitation to use his seller again. Very Pleased."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Overall, it was fair in entertainment value, but I never read any of her previous work in this series. So to find two women living in a small town after they escaped from a mental institution was implausible at best. I was occasionally confused since I did not know the back story. It wasn't as exciting or romantic as I had hoped, so I would pass on this one."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"After \\"Light in Shadow\\" I had hoped this would have more mystery and substance and romance, but it was light on all three. If this is the first JAK book a reader has picked up, they will surely be disappointed. I picked this up used and cheap at a local bookstore so it was even less than a paperback. I enjoyed the humor and subplots and \\"sub\\" romances but felt too many storylines made for lack of the usual detail and suspense in other JAK books.This is good for light summer reading and some fun. These characters, Zoe, Arcadia, Ethan, et al are better defined in the \\"prequel\\" and this time some of their motives seem strange. I did enjoy getting to know Singleton Cobb a bit better but other than his character the rest were shallow unless you had read the previous book. I'm not going to describe the plot as there are several but enjoy!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I love JAK and have read quite a few but the sequel to Light in Shadow is not as good as the usual Jayne Ann Krentz books. Somehow Truth or Dare lacks the \\"suspense\\" and romance that is usually in her books. Ethan Traux is good as the Private Investigator and \\"strong\\" guy. Zoe Luce as the psychic didn't do so well. Ethan and Zoe solve the mystery and save Arcadia Ames but the book lacks the pace. A one time read for me."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I could hardly wait to get my hands on this book once it came out in paperback! The sequele to Light in Shadow, Truth or Dare rapped up all the lose relationship strings. Arcadia's 'deciesed' husband showed up and her relationship with Harry finally cemented. Bonnie and Singleton movied further along in there progressing relationship and Eathan and Zoe finally solidified there marrige.Jayne Krentz's book provids twists and turns that just when you think you have the protaganist nerrowed down she unfold some new clue that makes you second guess yourself.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"JAK used to be an auto-buy for me and though I was hesitant about her earlier book, Light In Shadow, it did turn out a little better than I expected. Not so with Truth Or Dare. JAK finished Ethan and Zoe's story just fine in Light In Shadow and if she felt it needed more, then it would have been better to lengthen it with a couple more chapters. I expected this book to be about Arcadia's story but no such luck. It was Ethan and his baggage dragged around even longer and Zoe's insecurity over her marriage and husband making me cringe.I saw no reason for writing an entire book just to continue Ethan's and Zoe's story. I was expecting a new suspense plot but there wasn't. Arcadia's character was also inserted as if JAK happened to remember she was in the previous book and so merited a casual inclusion.This book was lacking in everything that had made JAK one of my favourite authors. I have no idea why and hope she returns to her old form. This hardback is going straight to the USB!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Another enjoyable JAK novel. She knows how to interweave the scenes of everyday life, including some intriguing subplots. Keep writing and I'll keep reading. It may not be the most intellectual read, but it is definitely a fun time!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I picked up this book at a Friends of the Library sale. What an enjoyable find! I was intrigued and caught up in the story of phschic Zoe and her at first pretend but now real (she hopes) marriage to private investagator, Ethan Truax. The two are settled in a town called Whispering Springs and have an interesting mix of family and friends.This book was interesting enough that I have now ordered its predacessor,Light and Shadow, and the follow up novel, Falling Awake."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Reviewers here have panned this book in comparison to other of Krentz's efforts, but I don't have that particular prejudice. As a fairly new Krentz reader, I found this book just the right companion for a boring evening alone. The quirky characters and dialogue made me smile. Descriptions of the locations were riveting and logically presented so that action is easy to follow, and the story moved right along. What's not to like? Krentz doesn't pretend to be a literary novelist. Thank goodness!A year or so ago, I wrote a very negative review of my first Krentz book, Summer in Eclipse Bay, which I felt was so bad I didn't pick up another of her titles until now. Glad I did. This one is in another league altogether. A nicely balanced book. Very entertaining!"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Maybe I should have read \\"Light in Shadow\\" first, or maybe I shouldn't have read the flyleaf, because this bestselling novel did not deliver the suspense, intriguing subplots and romantic twist that were luridly promised.Many of the supporting characters are two dimensional for most of the book, and then suddenly beefed up in a few paragraphs at a suitable time to enhance whichever tangent the writer was angling for at the time.The main characters all have dark or unhappy pasts, which they bear either stoically (most of the men) or hysterically (most of the women), and even though there are some good parts peeking through the cobwebs, it rambles around all sorts of other space-filling things, and when you get to the ending, everything wraps up at warp speed, not even pausing for a coherent thought.As a romance it fails miserably, because there's nothing even vaguely rapturous or tempestuous in there. As a suspense novel, it does a little better, but the ending drags it down considerably. The jury is still out on the intriguing subplots, because I seemed to have missed them completely.If you have enjoyed other books by this author, and are having a slow afternoon, maybe this book will serve to pass a few hours, but wouldn't be the best choice if you've got other stuff on your to-read list. It's a 2.5 star effort at best.Amanda Richards, February 5, 2005"},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Jayne Ann Krentz and all of her literary alter egos have always been hit or miss for me and this book was most definitely one of the misses.The beginning promises some dark paranormal thriller mixed with Krentz's generally heavy duty romance, but the book fails to deliver either. Instead, it's a muddled mishmash of characters who never gel on the page; instead of focusing on heroine and hero Zoe and Ethan, the author distracts with supporting characters that I couldn't have cared less for.Zoe's supposed to have big angst from her time in a psychiatric institute and her ability to literally read the walls of a house. Both could have been devices to ramp up the drama, but instead Krentz can't get a psychological grip on Zoe and winds up turning the character into a confused and lifeless cariacature. Ethan gets the same short shrift: what could have been a deep, dark and sexy character is instead insecure and disrespectful and not all that sexy.The mystery is so convoluted that there's no way for a reader to be engaged in solving it. The clues come and go, red herrings that don't make sense keep popping up and just when you think the story is moving along, bam - Krentz switches gears to one of the incredibly boring subplots involving the supporting characters.I hate it when authors push out books for the sake of having something on the shelves. Truth or Dare feels like Ms. Krentz's editor wanted a contemporary paranormal book (and a sequel to an existing book) of a certain kind and rushed this into print even though the author herself didn't have a cogent storyline for it. Every single aspect of it seems rushed and as if the author herself didn't care much how it came out; if she doesn't care, the reader won't either."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Average is the word for this book. Like others I eagerly await the release of any new JAK, this one is disappointing. The characters are wooden, the speech stilted and the plot virtually non-existent. Why write this in the form of a trilogy at all? all of the content of this book would have made a good 2 chapters at the end of the previous one, thus finalizing the tale of Zoe and Ethan Truax and the other inhabitants of Whispering springs without the added expense of yet another pricey hardback. As far as I was concerned this was much too formulaic and totally without the finesse in her older books."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"Krentz created the characters on paper and then did not bother to breath bring some life and character into them. She used to be one of my top 10 authors that were a must buy, now don't waste your money. It's like someone else is writing her books for her, where's her editor and publisher? You don't even like the characters they are like paper dolls, no depth at all. i am was very disappointed in her last 3 books. She used to write real hot romance, a class act."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This book was hard to put down. It really pulled the reader in. Very few slow spots. I highly recommend this book ."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"This book is so far from Krentz's best romantic novels (Grand Passion, Absolutely Positively), that I would have believed it written by some other romantic novelist because it was so predictable and boring. The heroine has this \\"amazing\\" ability to tell where people have been murdered, but there is no way for her to use this ability to try to solve crimes & contribute to her husband's detective business. Her husband is a private investigator who somehow manages to stay afloat financially, since he spends most of the book picking out color schemes for his home (Ochre or gold, ooh, the mystery!). There are a couple of romantic subplots where friends of the couple who have previously been unlucky in love suddenly discover each other & decide that they're perfect for each other. At the end of the book, you end up with a clumsily-plotted attempt to kill one character, a bunch of references to some nutty mental institution where two of the characters were held captive, three soppily happy couples dancing in the sunlight and one majorly bored reader who wishes she had picked another book for her weekend read."},{"Title":"Truth or Dare","review":"I reached page 150, and NOTHING HAD HAPPENED YET!!! Except for lots of pizza dinners between the characters. I had thought this book would be solely about Arcadia, whose story I thought was a logical sequel to Light in Shadow. Instead, it was an epilogue, with more blathering on and on about how Ethan and Zoe (surprise, surprise!) still haven't trusted each other enough to share their inner-most secrets after a whopping 6 weeks of marriage. This story actually underscores how little Ethan and Zoe have in common, which is typical of this author's heroes and heroines.

I was really hoping this would be a better read then the Ben Fong-Torres bio, but boy was I wrong. I appreciate Jessica Hundley's effort, but this \\"bio\\" is made up at best and sheds no light on the Southern Gothic story that is Gram & the Snively clan. The writing and research are sloppy and lazy. She tends to use clunky, overly dramatic descriptions often (\\"Gram looked out at the upturned faces; a hundred eyes watched as his hands played and watched his face as he held a note in his throat. Something that had been inside him suddenly slipped together again. He felt his lungs and his cheeks go hot. He smiled, gazing into the pale face of a girl in front for just a moment too long, felt her surrender, saw the boys and their envy, and for the first time, felt whole.\\") Ugh. Gram says and thinks a lot of things in this book. He also winks, smiles, stares at himself in the mirror, thinks deeply about things, etc.Important facts are downplayed or left out (we don't find out that Gram Connor is immediately adopted by his stepfather and becomes Gram \\"Parsons\\" until way into the book -- he's just Gram until the \\"oh yeah, forgot to mention\\" moment); the Connor clan and his relationship with them is barely mentioned, etc.Also, editing is pretty terrible, especially in a book about a musician --we're treated to Arthur Conley's \\"That's Alright, Mama\\" & Bourdeleaux Bryant's \\"Love Hurts\\" (it's Arthur Crudup & Boudleaux Bryant). At one point, even Gram's little sister Avis (\\"Little Avis\\") becomes \\"Little Avril\\" on page 190. Some accepted facts are wrong -- in Fong-Torres' book, Bernie Leadon sings the hymn \\"Farther Along\\" at Clarence White's funeral, a very poignant and touching moment. In this book, it's not Bernie but Gram, who \\"sick in his guts and sad to the core\\" starts to sing \\"an old hymn\\" as others join in, \\"fill(ing) their lungs with their grief.\\"I really, really wanted to like this book. What I can't fathom is why Jessica Hundley decided to make most of it up. What this amounts to is a fairy-tale fanbook with only some basis in the truth. How about some interviews? The Snivelys are still in the citrus business in Florida. I'm sure there are some Connors still around in Tennessee. Emmylou, Road Mangler, Bernie Leadon, Hillman, McGuinn, James Burton, Roland White, Merle Haggard, are all still alive. Why not travel to Winter Haven, Jax, Waycross, Tennessee, etc., and get the feel for what Gram experienced? What's with all the \\"fan\\" interviews? Who cares?Unfortunately, what this book does is turn Gram into a semi-fictional character who somehow became an influential musician. Simply making up words and thoughts for Gram does nothing to highlight the complex and troubled character he must have been. It only makes me wish Jessica Hundley had written an actual biography and not a book based on a true story. It hurts me to say this because I admire the fact that Ms. Hundley wanted to share a story and seems to truly love the subject, but the book is pretty terrible -- in many ways, it's her story, not Gram's. Get Ben Fong-Torres' book instead."},{"Title":"Grievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons","review":"I really enjoyed this book and found it the most user friendly of all the books written about country rock legend Gram Parsons. It presents him in a realistic light, warts and all. He was a remarkably talented young man who had it all. Unfotrunately the one thing he lacked was self-discipline and that ended up being the end of him. Nonetheless, the musical and social/personal journey he had in his short life make for great reading.

Perhaps not, but his fascinating and tragic life still makes for interesting, if not compelling reading in the hands of talented writers. Jessica Hundley and Polly Parsons' \\"Grevious Angel\\" will not supplant Fong-Torres' \\"Hickory Wind\\" as the main reference source on his life. Their book is not based on the same extensive research as \\"Hickory Wind\\"; however, \\"Grevious Angel\\" does contain numerous text boxes of usually one to three page duration which contain testimonials about Parsons' influence or first-hand accounts of the man himself. While Hundley and Parsons do portray Parsons as a musical visionary, they do not understate, nor excuse, nor glorify his terrible substance abuse and reckless lifestyle, which resulted in his untimely demise. Overall, the book is likely to appeal to younger or recent fans of Gram Parsons, rather than the old timers, who probably know his life triumphs and tragedies in greater depth than the account presented here."},{"Title":"Grievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons","review":"besides the cool pics in this book.... the author has seemed to have forgotten that u can not make up things in a biography... she puts her own thoughts into the book as if they were grams... the book is very inaccurate... the author doesnt even have a bibliography its like wikapedia u can not trust it... do not buy it... twenty thousand roads by david n meyer is the best and most accurate bio on gram and it comes with a very detailed bibliography so u know its real and not some dumb opinion from a moronic author... shame on jessica hundley for wirtting this book.."},{"Title":"Grievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons","review":"The Ben Fong-Torres book is much more thoroughly researched, and doesn't rely on the ridiculous invented dialogue that Hundley imagines went on between Parsons and his friends.If GP was as shallow and moronic as he's portrayed in this book, he could never have written and recorded the beautiful, moving music that he left us.In addition, Hundley interviews anyone she can think of, including her own friends and people who never had anything to do with Parsons.WTF?"},{"Title":"Grievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons","review":"Definitely worthwhile for any Gram Parsons, Flying Burrito Bros., ISB, Byrds, etcetra fan.

A keeper!"},{"Title":"Grievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons","review":"I loved this book, with its trippy, subjective syntax and its hard-edged look at Gram Parsons, one of the distinctive singer-songwriters of the postwar era. What a life he had, however short, and the music he made continues to inspire us and to make us a little weepy. Partly, as Hundley and Parsons show us, Gram always felt a little disconnected himself, for he was an orphan at age 18, and his best memories of his mother were always colored by her \\"Glass Menagerie\\" fondness for alcohol and lost dreams and Southern gentility, while the father was the same sort of dad Gram himself grew up to be--good in the short haul, but sort of impatient.It's sad about the drugs that seem to take over, but even before becoming a drug addict he's sort of a jerk, spoiled and self-indulgent in the way of the boy who's always had more money than anyone else in his class at school, so he could buy himself out of any scrapes his charm couldn't extricate himself from. The story of the Burrito Brothers' train ride throughout the continental USA, staying at the best hotels and wasting millions of dollars of the record company's money, is a real rock legend, but it isn't very pretty really when you look at the facts. You can get only so much mileage out of being a \\"trustafarian.\\"Thiss book makes one wonder why there isn't a comprehensive biography of Brandon de Wilde (one of Gram's first friends in New York). Surely Brandon, one of the great child stars who grew up to be a young leading man, and who died of drugs early on, had an even more interesting life than Gram? The glimpses we see of him here, and his attempts to establish a foothold in the music business, are fascinating. Likewise I never knew that Gram helped Peter Fonda record a single--love to hear that one!Maybe I'm dense but I couldn't figure out if the dying, melancholy Gram, old before his time at 26, actually had an affair with Emmylou Harris or not. Is it perhaps still a huge secret 35 years later? The prose of GRIEVOUS ANGEL dances around the details of this \\"intimate friendship\\" but surely enough time has gone by, water under the bridge, for the truth to emerge. If not, just say so in one simple sentence, instead of vague romantic prose poems about the intimate bond the two of them shared. You'd think she was the widow from the way Jessica and Polly write about her."},{"Title":"Grievous Angel : An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons","review":"Why is this book written as if the author had a direct line to Gram Parsons' thoughts and feelings? Why does she feel the need to fill in the gaps with happy little thoughts and asides? It's truly dreadful. Interviews with too many obscure musicians/fringe dwellers.

I loved the pictures and interviews. I understood this was a daughter's heart but I didn't understand how the author got inside Gram's head and described how he was feeling or thinking. When I would read those parts the word \\"opinion\\" would flash in my head, and if you are reading a biography the word \\"fact\\" should be flashing. Even still, I liked the book. I've read three biographies of the man and I still don't understand why people including myself are fascinated. He was an alcoholic and drug addict, things I grew up in and an despised. But lets be honest everyone who surrounded him was living that lifestyle. I loved the songs Hickory Wind and In my Hour of Darkness and he had a hauntingly sadly romantic tone in his voice but what was/is the pull...I can only conclude it is spiritual. So the book is worth your time if only to get that overall view of the dimensions of a person.

Today, I purchased as many books illustrated by Mercer Mayer that I could and hope that his works are never forgotten and live on, at least in my family."},{"Title":"East of the Sun & west of the Moon","review":"With amiable writing and lavish illustration, Mercer Mayer has brought this beloved Norwegian fairy tale to life for young children everywhere. The original fairy tale told the story of a poor farmer's daughter, and her quest to find an enchanted prince, who was whisked away to a distant kingdom to marry a hideous troll. The kingdom was so far away that it was somewhere east of the sun and west of the moon.Mercer retells the tale in a way to make it more appealing to modern children and their parents, so the prince has now been transformed into a frog in Mercer's version, not the ferocious bear of the original that modern audiences would find somewhat disquieting. The changes generally work for a children's tale, and Mercer adds some nice touches - for example, early in the tale, he gives a sense of the medieval world that the girl grows up in, with its courting youths and its distant kings.What really drew me to Mercer's tale, however, were the illustrations. Magical and yet conveying a strong Scandinavian flavor so fitting for this tale, these watercolor illustrations captivate the eye and evoke a strong sense of wonder. The strange, magical creatures depicted in the illustrations are amazingly well done. Consider, for example, the depiction of Father Forest being as an enormous tree with gnarled, wooden feet and hands, two enormous eyes that stare down at the maiden in a fatherly and yet god-like way, and a nose that is formed from the large, broken bough. Conceptually, this depiction of Father Forest is nothing new, but the execution of it is simply amazing. There is also a Salamander in its fiery cave, who is depicted as somehow both enormously old and yet child-like at the same time, and the North Wind, who is characterized as a powerful, god-like being with long, streaming hair and beard and power hands.Most compelling of all, however, is the depiction of the farmer's daughter, who is given an enormous range of emotional expression in the illustrations from just the subtlest changes to her eyes. The changes might be subtle, yet they are powerful nonetheless, instantly conveying happiness, bitterness, sorrow, fear, weariness, and bliss. Children will be drawn to her immediately, and to the fantastical, magical world in which she lives."},{"Title":"East of the Sun & west of the Moon","review":"GREAT Book, definitely a story of a young girls perseverance.

However, this is not the first transformation that the US Army has undergone, and if history is any judge, it won't be the last.William Odom has captured the essence of the tumultuous transformation of our Army during the period between the two World Wars in his superlative treatise After the Trenches. The transformation of our Army during the inter-war years was as profound as the transformation we are experiencing now. If you are looking for a guide that explains the importance of doctrine, weapons, and organizations to transformation, you must read Odom's After the Trenches.Imagine the challenges facing the US Army of 1919, one year after the end of the War to End All Wars. The years 1914 to 1918 were years of profound and dramatic change. The methods of warfare that the Army had practiced before the Great War had been completely overturned. The Army went into World War I with a tradition that was largely formed from the frontier Army of he Indian Wars and the brief fighting in the Spanish American War. Armed with revolvers, sabers and wearing campaign hats in 1914, the Army finished 1918 wearing tin helmets and armed with gas masks, machine guns, rapid firing artillery, airplanes, and tanks.True to our American tradition, after the Great War, the Army was largely disbanded. Only a small corps of professional soldiers was retained during the period from 1919 to 1939. In that time, however, warfare continued to change. In the meantime, Germany studied the lessons of the Great War, improved on the methods and weapons of WWI, and transformed its doctrine and training.This historical appreciation is what Odom brings so masterfully to print in After the Trenches. The author explains the evolution of Army doctrine throughout this period and traces the intellectual action of an Army trying to find its way in a brave new world. He describes how the thinkers of that time guarded their uniquely American approach to war and rejected many of the European, and particularly the French, concepts that grew out of the horror of the trench warfare.In the inter-war years, the US Army, guided by men such as General John Pershing, Hugh Drum, George Lynch, Frank Parker, and Lesley McNair tried to balance technology and the human dimension of war, and came up short. Rapid changes in the methods of war during the interwar years changed military doctrine form one \\"built on infantry-artillery coordination to one based on a highly mobile combined arms team.\\" Army doctrine did not keep pace with these changes. With few men, little material, almost no funding, and no maneuvers during the years 1919-1939, it is not surprising that Army doctrine was so inadequate. Bureaucratic hassling, friction between the branches of the Army, and an inept doctrinal development process combined to create a situation that was so bad that the Army failed to coordinate a combined arms doctrine up to the eve of World War II. With the German victories in Poland, Norway, and France at the outbreak of WWII providing a blueprint for doctrine, the US Army raced to catch up. In the end, our Army paid a price in blood for its inability to transform more rapidly.The lesson that Odom provides us is that this period of rapid change almost left the Army unprepared for the kind of combat that was to characterize World War II. Odom clearly shows in After the Trenches that the single most important reason US Army doctrine lagged so far behind was the Army's institutional deficiency to employ a tightly-run, well-coordinated doctrine development process. He provides us with a very valuable precautionary story, one that is well written and thoroughly researchedNow, imagine the challenges that our Army faces today, more than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War. As Odom points out in his conclusion: \\"Establishment of an organization dedicated to monitoring and accommodating change is the most important element in successful modernization. This organization must address weapons, organizations, and doctrine to avoid the same calamity that befell the Army from 1919-1939. With that in mind, anyone involved in the transformation of today's Army will find After the Trenches an account worth studying."},{"Title":"After the Trenches: The Transformation of the U.S. Army, 1918-1939 (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"In this book Odom sets himself up as a true groundbreaker. Many historians have looked at the interwar period (1918-1939) from a European perspective, seeking to find the start points for military success or disaster depending upon the nation under study. Odom is the first to conduct an in-depth analysis of the American Army during this period without dwelling on the mere artifacts of technology (specifically the tank and the airplane) but rather upon the heart of any military organization, their doctrine. Right now and for some time to come this is the single best source to examine how the United States military, and specifically the Army, experienced and viewed this period of important changes and developments. Odom sets the bar high and places himself on a par with such classics of military doctrine studies as Doughty's Seeds of Disaster and Winton's To Change and Army. In light of the striking parallels between that period and the present day, no professional can safely claim to understand the factors at work in either period until they read this book."},{"Title":"After the Trenches: The Transformation of the U.S. Army, 1918-1939 (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"This is a very good book about a very narrow subject that would probably not interest general readers. Yet for professional and amateur military historians, for military professionals, and anyone interested in the affairs of the U.S. Army this is a fascinating book. General Odom (U.S.A. ret) is a good straight ahead writer and excellent scholar. In this book he tackles the important but often overlooked issue of how the army developed tactical and strategic doctrine prior to its mobilization prior to WWII. He demonstrates how the Army Field Service Regulations (FSR) for 1923 incorporated the lessons the Army learned in WWI and accurately measured the state of military technology after the war. The FSR for 1923 pretty well established U.S. Army Doctrine for the next sixteen years. The revised FSR issued in 1939, incredibly was essentially the 1923 FSR with very few concessions to the military technological revolution that had occurred between 1923 and 1939. General Odon chronicles the reason for this stagnation and along the way provides some illuminating insights on how the Army coped with the nearly complete neglect from the rest of the U.S. Government during the period. One area this reviewer found particularly interesting was the important, at times almost dominant role, the Army Schools System played in the efforts to build a modern military doctrine. The Army War College and the Command and General Staff College in particular showed a good deal of intellectual vigor even in austere between the war years. On the other hand, the War Department General Staff appears to have been virtually ineffectual in doctrine development. Perhaps the most amazing phenomenon of the inter-war years stagnation was that somehow the U.S. Army was still able to develop an officer corps that could not only manage the most massive mobilization in American history at the start of WWII, but were able to lead those mobilized forces to victory. In the end it would seem that it was the men not the doctrine that was important."},{"Title":"After the Trenches: The Transformation of the U.S. Army, 1918-1939 (Williams-Ford Texas A&M; University Military History Series)","review":"Many readers who lack a deep professional interest in military doctrine may be put off by a book with the word in its title, fearing it will be a dry, abstract, and labored tome on military theory. That is true of some books, but not of this one. The author, a distinguished U.S. Army infantry officer with a history Ph.D., has really produced a history of the entire development of the service between the world wars. It makes a fascinating and often pretty colorful story, and it does a great deal to explain the Army's successes and failings in World War II.Odom shows an army essentially paralyzed and left in a state of suspended animation from which it was aroused only on the brink of war. Remembering the agonizing difficulties of raising, training, and equipping a mass army after America's entry into World War I, the Army's leaders and their civilian masters placed first priority on an expansible force. At the same time, shortsightedly pennypinching Republican administrations in the 1920s and the first FDR administration's absorption in the Depression kept military expenditures and manning meager. The handful of Regulars who remained after meeting needs for deployed forces in China, the Philippines, the Canal Zone, Hawaii, and on the Mexican border were scattered across America to train Guard and Reserve forces. What little money the Army had for R&D; and equipment procurement went almost entirely to an Air Corps with little interest in supporting the ground forces it wanted only to break away from. With widely scattered forces, no modern equipment, and no money for \\"luxuries\\" like transportation, the rare exercises amounted to little more than musters.Deprived of the stimulus of real-world experience in the field and muffled by senior officers and civilians unwilling to hear critical or even novel views, the Army's officers were left with little but their memories of World War I to guide them, with the natural result that the service remained backward-looking. Had the United States been drawn into World War II in 1939 or 1940 rather than late in 1941, it would have found the Army catastrophically unprepared -- not simply in terms of manpower and mat&eacute;riel but in ideas about how to organize and fight. Bad as the Army's condition was in December of 1941, it vastly better than it had been two years before.All of this is made vividly clear in this well written and well structured book. Some may feel that the author pulls his punches a little bit with respect to the responsibility of the Army's own leaders. As he makes clear, they found themselves in a very difficult corner. But I think it is fair to say that they could have prepared the Army somewhat better had they been more willing to make and defend painful tradeoffs within the limited resources they were granted. (For instance, unmentioned by Odom, the Army spent relatively substantial sums on construction of buildings in the mid to late 1930s -- badly needed, to be sure, but how badly compared to other things?) Still, Odom provides us with much of the information needed to make up our own minds on these issues.I found this book both valuable and enjoyable. I would recommend pairing it with David E. Johnson's _Fast Tanks and Heavy Bombers: Innovation in the U.S. Army, 1917-1945_ (Cornell U. Press, 1998), which complements it in many ways. Hopefully, Odom's publishers will follow the lead of Johnson's in issuing an affordable paperbound edition. When they do so, they might consider dropping the \\"doctrine\\" from the subtitle; it will still be strictly accurate, and less likely to confuse non-professional readers.Will O'Neil"},{"Title":"Menz Insana","review":"Menz Insana is my all-time favorite graphic novel. Found this title in a bargain bin, and I consider it as my number one find. It is a humorous love story in the realm of the insane between skinny, balding Menz (a pharmacist who resembles Pinocchio) and the stunning and sexy Jaz, who wants to go back to the realm of sanity to find out who she was before insanity. The plot takes a shocking twist when she DOES find out who she was, and her relationship to Menz in the real world. The Mental Plane is a place where people can just shrug off society's norms and be themselves. Fowler makes a humorous analogy of the Mental Plane to Dante's \\"Inferno\\", where there are different levels of insanity which can be visited via an elevator. And who can forget the other inhabitants of the insane world such as the adorable Squid Baby (\\"Cigars all around! Not you, Squid Baby!\\" Aww...), the couple's arrogant, hormone-raging neighbor (\\"Neighbor?? We don't even have walls!\\") Mr. Bull, and tons of others. The characters are ridiculously funny, the conversations full of razor-sharp wit, and John Bolton's art is just simply amazing. Menz Insana is brimming with intelligence: light, quirky and funny on the surface, but it leaves the reader reflecting on the line between the sane and insane, good and bad, and the pressure of today's society on people's minds. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Menz Insana","review":"Christopher Fowler and John Bolton give us here a phenomenal comic strip. It is centered on the mental world in which people can really be free, themselves, without any restraint from society and from their own personal censorship. We are ourselves and free only on this mental level that lies beyond real life. Real life is grey, drab, sad, full of norms and predigested behaviors. The mental plane is free, full of colors, full of adventures. Everything is possible and we meet there the strangest beings we can imagine, all those who have left their bodies somewhere in the real world to live the freedom of their minds. But somewhere there is a myth : the desire of those liberated souls to go back to the real world and see their real bodies. They discover then that in the real world they live a life of total alienation, often pent up in some asylum, whereas on the mental plane they can be free and experience feelings that would be impossible in the real world, because on the mental plane they accept any absurdity as being freedom and real being. Yet, in a way, generally catastrophic from a social point of view, the mental state they are in on the mental plane, can free their social bodies and beings in real society by some supernormal, extranormal intervention. The drawing is creative and rich in colors and strange forms. On the mental plane everything is possible, and the drawing assumes this freedom to produce a vision of real freedom in insanity. We long for the possibility to be there and finally get rid of all our restraints. Even if life on the mental plane is only possible if our bodies are still alive in society, somewhere, in a way or another. A fascinating world that is given a tremendous force by a very creative language.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Book of Theanna: In the Lands that Follow Death","review":"I purchased this book some four years ago, when I found it in the Death & Dying section of a local bookshop. I had no idea what I was about to read.The author of the book is Theanna Lonsdale, deceased wife to widower Elias Lonsdale, who writes through her husband in the manner of that otherwise often laughable New Age invention, \\"channeling.\\" Reader beware: in the case of this book, the result is a voice of such breadth and astonishing vision that you may find yourself at a loss as to how such vivid, warm and living wisdom could be speakable at all.Upon her death in the late '90's, the now-deceased Theanna speaks of her transmigration into subtler dimensions, in a Dantean-like tour of heavens and hells that left me quietly transformed by her reports in a way I still have not been able to quite come to grips with. Among her many meetings are included meaningful encounters with Rudolph Steiner, a most heartbroken and despairing Jesus Christ, and \\"The Lord of Death,\\" with whom Theanna engages in a spiritual battle that leaves her immune to hell and able to tell about it, and many other beings and cosmic realities besides.What Theanna has returned to Elias to say to the world is that this world, this Earth, is spiritually \\"blasted\\" and ready to give way to its spiritual rebirth. In the meantime, the drama that must play out is the difficult exhausting of the possibility for life upon it, with all too much in the way of human suffering, amidst a burgeoning birth of spirituality in its midst nevertheless. According to Theanna, we are here to navigate this bifurcation and find our way into the future against its heightening drama.The quality of articulation that Theanna displays about the subtleties of spiritual suffering defy the rarest dharmas I have personally encountered. Though I cannot say one way or another whether Theanna is really a living being or not, the razored edge of fresh truth that flies off these pages leaves me more in a state of informed wonder than any kind of skepticism I could otherwise muster.Most importantly, Theanna's voice itself acts as a strengthener to the soul, encouraging us to withstand our greatest suffering here and to value it as such. Part of why we are here, she says, is to carry the most destructive information about this dying planet beyond its lifespan (and our own), and to take the imprint of its failure (at the hand of mankind's historical condition of being overrun by the demonic) as primary information to carry with us beyond our stay here, in order to share it outward into the wider reaches of the cosmos -- yet untouched by the particular and devastating sorrows that our now ours to endure for as long as we are here.Where has such a radically honest and yet altogether affirming wisdom as this ever been made available at large? Trust me, this book is at least as alive as it sounds, and well worth the read. Buy it used for a dollar or two and just read the first page....I only hope that it may inform your trust in our place here on this brutalized earth in this unbearable time a fraction as much as it has informed mine, and encourage you thereby to hang on and hold out through whatever lies ahead -- for the sake of everything that lies beyond.From the opening pages of this extraordinary book:\\"A Personal Note\\"Our hope and dream is that we can encourage each willing reader to follow a path of destiny that is truly your own. We do not think of death as just the final curtain. It is instead the opening act into the next realm.

Although its examples may be dated, the author's message is even more true today than it was in 1977. That message is that technological change has forced us into more and more situations for which we have little or no relevant experience. Things that were once the province of science fiction are now affecting the lives of ordinary people. Biological breakthroughs like in vitro fertilization, gene splicing, and cloning are raising legal and social questions which have no precedent. No wonder nothing seems to work anymore because our past experience has not prepared us to deal with situations no one has ever experienced before. The book may not exactly be reassuring but it does make the point that we shouldn't be so hard on ourselves if things don't seem to work anymore...because things have changed!"},{"Title":"A reading of Hegel's Phenomenology of spirit","review":"Quentin Lauer is one of the best writers on Hegel.

It's not my favorite Steinbeck story, but it is a great story told well. Sorry it took me so long to get to it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As I was reading The Winter of Our Discontent there was something about Ethan Hawley's character that reminded me of Willy Loman, Arthur Miller's tragic hero in his play Death of a Salesman. In Miller's work, Loman is a salesman who has lost touch with reality, and always is after what success is about, as he imagines talking to his dead brother Ben to try to get the answers to life. A man who was probably most successful in his daydreams than real life, Willy Loman might be considered an underachiever or loser by some, but there is a certain sympathy we carry for him. I bring up this character because Ethan, in The Winter of Our Discontent, has some of these same qualities, although he is not established like Loman (even in his own musings or dreams), and more glaringly, he is not as likeable or forgivable. Ethan also strives to gain a piece of the American dream, as he comes from strong family roots in New England, and works as a clerk in the town's local grocery store. Feeling the pressure from his wife and two kids, he wants to move upward in the world and be able to provide the wealth and comforts that make a father a success. He wants to carry on the family legacy with pride, and attain the status that makes him a success in his own mind. In this way, Ethan Hawley is a man with ambition; however, Macbeth was ambitious too. The crisis of conflict that Hawley ultimately experiences is that he gives in to moral standards to become \\"someone\\" in the world, which means setting aside morals, friends, and conscientiousness in hopes of attaining this status. Much like a Shakespeare tragic hero, or Willy Loman, he continues onward, attributing all things to fate, but ultimately has to come face to face with himself.Hawley makes several key decisions that ultimately affect those close to him negatively. He loans money to his childhood friend Danny, a town drunk, to supposedly help him get some help with his drinking, but knowing full-well that he will drink himself to death with the money. He also gets him to use his own property as collateral if he shouldn't pay it back. His boss, who once gives him the advise to \\"look after number one,\\" is deported after Ethan reports him to authorities; once this take place, the store becomes Ethan's, and he is no longer \\"just a clerk\\", but owner. Hawley also has plans of robbing a store in his mind, and is only stopped just short of doing this. One ironic aspect is when Ethan's son, Allen, plagiarizes on his \\"I Love America\\" essay and is scolded; just as Ethan has cheated the system to get ahead, his son has followed in his footsteps, yet only his son gets reprimanded for it. Ethan seems to legitimize his own actions: \\"Strength and success--they are above morality, above criticism...In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught\\" (187).Unlike many of Steinbeck's novels, this one uses a good deal of inner character monologue to reveal the protagonist's train of thought. In that way, the writing style is not typical of the simplistic narration that Steinbeck often uses, and sometimes there is more to what Ethan is thinking or doing than it actually seems. Some have both praised and criticized Steinbeck for using characters to project aspects of human morality, and The Winter of Our Discontent, his last novel, is no exception. While I didn't enjoy this novel as much as some of his other stuff, there are flashes of exceptional writing. For any Steinbeck fans, this is a novel that is a bit different than the others in that we are taken away from the California setting, and into the character's point of view."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"A very good story, well written.

In the end, he discovers that by meeting these expectations, he is unable to remain true to himself."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I read this book since it had been selected by my book club. It sounded interesting: the story of a man whose family background tells him he could have, should have been more than a grocery clerk and how a moral man reacts when presented with not-so-moral opportunity in a seemingly corrupt world.I was expecting a story that would grab and hold my attention. While the central conflict was eventually revealed, the various tangents the narration wandered off on became too distracting to really enjoy the central core of the story. Perhaps the biggest disappointment of all was the ending. I won't give away any details, but suffice it to say that when I reached the last page on my Kindle I had to go back and see if I'd missed something. It was not only abrupt but Ethan's actions seemed out of character."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I will be anxious to hear what my book club has to say, it was a sad ending. The author did create a very interesting character."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This was John Steinbeck's last novel and the one that won him a Nobel Prize for Literature. Most people acknowledge that this was not his best work (in my mind not up to the standards of East of Eden or Of Mice and Men), but as with the Academy Awards, sometimes an Oscar for lifetime achievement is merited.The story is set in an old whaling village on the tip of Long Island (think Sag Harbor), where we find Ethan Allen Hawley, descended from an illustrious local family and recently suffering from financial reverses so severe that he has taken the menial job of grocery clerk. Day after day, Hawley is bombarded by reminders of his families prosperous past and the relative poverty in which he finds himself, most annoyingly by his wife, son and daughter.Throughout the novel, Hawley plays the nave, unambitious simpleton, while at the same time engineering his return to prosperity and riches through a series of cold blooded, calculating and ruthless maneuvers. Relatively entertaining and worthwhile, it nevertheless fails to measure up to some of Steinbeck's better work."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck wrote this novel in the days when American Grocery stores were 94% independent single-owned stores. The hero isn't much of a hero, just a man struggling with the pressures of economic success in contrast to his moral beliefs.With over 90% of the grocery stores today being multi-store operations, we see in this book the beginnings of the Madison Avenue economy we live in today, and what has been lost in the process.At least Hawley struggled against the tide, where today it has become almost chic to lack morals, fool consumers, be the trickster guru, or market a ton of air in attractive colors and graphics.Steinbeck shows us it should be a struggle, and indeed it will be a difficult one in a cultural setting where rationalizations (&quot;It's only a crime against money - afterall!&quot;) eat away at the social requirements of honesty, decency, and respect for your fellow men and women.At the end, a symbolic clue leads the reader back to a previous chapter and obscure dialogue. Left to ponder what this really means."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Discontent was required reading in high school and has lost nothing in the past 40 years. Ethan Hawley and his story was relevant in the fifties and is even more so today. I've never met a Steinbeck book I didn't like but this one has to be my favorite. Maybe it's because I know more than several Ethan Hawleys and Steinbeck's portrayal is dead on. Although I can't believe the Nobel committee waited until 1962 to award Discontent the prize for literature (what about Of Mice and Men and East of Eden)? this novel surely deserved it.This is a novel that bears rereading every five years or so. If ever an author chronicled the lessening of American standards and the downward spiral of a man's moral integrity, it was Steinbeck!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"A thoroughly decent and ethical man is influenced by but not swallowed up by the ubiquitous soft corruption in his hometown. Throughout, a novel about bedrock morals and the test that modern times gives them. A much slighter, smaller story than \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"The Grapes of Wrath,\\" this later novel probes some of the finer intellectual notions the others do not."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Reader seeking to identify fictional people and places here described would do better to inspect their own communities and search their own hearts, for this book is about a large part of America today--PrefaceWritten in 1961, these words are as pertinent today--perhaps even more so. A social protest novel like THE GRAPES OF WRATH, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT tackles the moral corruption that Steinbeck perceived in America during the era of the quiz show scandals in the late 1950s. Reflecting on the recent corporate and plagiarism scandales, readers today will have no trouble relating to Steinbeck's setting. Just as importantly, however, readers will have no trouble identifying with the book's characters.Named for the famous speech of Richard III, WINTER takes place during a period of peace following a protracted conflict. Like Richard Gloucester, Steinbeck's protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, gets ahead by betraying a brother. Driven by the demands of his wife and children that he acquire more money and public prestige, Hawley cheats his closest boyhood friend out of land coveted by developers. As with Richard's attrocities, each bad deed leads to more (and worse) deeds.But whereas Shakespeare depicts evil as flowing from the depraved character of Richard, Steinbeck attributes his hero's shortcomings to society itself. As with his other books, Steinbeck portrays human beings as naturally good individuals corrupted by their economic and social surroundings. This idea is debatable to say the least, but there's no question that Steinbeck makes a good case. Reading Ethan's reflections on his own community and witnessing the consequences of all types of greed is like watching QUIZ SHOW, the Redford film depicting the same era.As with his other works, WINTER is full of characters respresenting various sides of socieity but having sppech and habits that defy any stereotype. Like GRAPES, Winter combines the best of literary naturalism and romanticism. But even more than GRAPES, the plot and characters of WINTER continue to be \\"about a large part of America today.\\""},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"i was amazed by this short steinbeck novel. it is simutaneously entertaining and thought-provoking. This story of the moral, emotional and psychological journey of Ethan Allen Hawley leaves the reader inspecting their own understanding of themself. The dialogue is at times witty and light and at the same time laden with meaning. I really enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This novel was one of Steinbeck's last, and delves heavily into themes of disillusionment with one's country and one's lot in life. While The Grapes of Wrath was arguably a more heartbreaking book, in that novel, at least the characters still cared and still maintained ideals. In this book, the character of Ethan Allen Hawley has lost hope for the future and lapsed into a great abyss of depression and despair. In this way, Steinbeck seemed much more Hemingway-esque than he had in his earlier, and in my opinion greater, works of fiction.While I did not enjoy this book as much as earlier works like The Grapes of Wrath, there is still much to appreciate in this tale about an American patriarch who has lost his way. Ethan lives in New Baytown, a fictional New England town, with his dissatisfied, materialistic wife, daughter and son. Both children are writing an essay regarding why they love America, though only the son is able to finish it--and he does so by plagiarizing speeches by Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln. Ethan's family was once well-to-do but lost their fortune with speculative investments after WWII, relegating Ethan to working as a grocery clerk at the store he once owned. His boss is an illegal Italian immigrant who encourages Ethan to be less generous with the customers.New Baytown itself is a major character in the novel. The entire town operates within a realm of corruption. Yet things have operated that way so long that no one remembers it is corrupt anymore. All of the major and minor characters are seriously flawed--Margie Young-Hunt, the town seductress and witch; Mr. Baker, the greedy banker; Joey Morphy, the bank clerk who describes the perfect way to rob a bank. Gradually Ethan realizes that the only way to be happy is to get money. The only way to get money is to bend his own moral standards. And once he bends his moral standards, he is more miserable than ever.This short novel is delightfully written, with superb dialogue and clever references to religion and American history. It is basically an indictment of America's materialistic lifestyle as it entered the 1960's. I enjoyed it very much on that level, but did not feel it withstood comparison to Steinbeck's earlier, more emotional novels. This story was more allegory than novel, which is fine--but which one should keep in mind while reading this little gem."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"When reading Steinbeck it is easy to understand his prominence as one of the great contemporary American writers. He takes a human or societal flaw and dissects it page by page and the reader cannot but help thinking how real and how commonplace Steinbeck's characters and situations are. In \\"Winter\\" the author centers on the greed and lust for material riches that was prevalent in America of the late1950s and early 1960s. Ethan Hawley, the protagonist, is a Harvard-educated man of once-prominent social standing who through the misfortunes of his whaling captain father is currently the clerk in a grocery store his father once owned. The present owner, an Italian immigrant, is the target of hostility for the simple reason that he is foreign.Ethan Hawley is a man pushed by the desires of his wife Mary and his two children, Ellen and Allen. This middle-class family yearns for a more upscale life than Ethan can provide. A television, new curtains and furniture are some of the material possessions they long for. Because Ethan cannot provide them he makes a decision that incorporates the worst elements of greed and avarice. He embarks on a well thought-out plot to illegally obtain the money necessary to give his family the luxuries they desire. And so in lies the crux of this story...what happens to a man that forsakes his morals for the happiness of his family?There are many supporting characters that flavor the book. Most notably Ethan's childhood friend Danny, now the town drunk, and his wife's best friend Margie who apparently is the town's most popular call girl. There is also the banker, a teller, and Mr. Marullo, the immigrant grocery store owner, whose tragedy becomes Ethan's triumph.When accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature for this novel, Steinbeck stated that a writer is charged with exposing our many grievous faults and failures, with dredging up to the light our dark and dangerous dreams for the purpose of improvement. Readers will certainly see a generation's most obvious faults and failures and have Ethan Hawley's dark and dangerous dreams exposed. Interestingly enough, the materialistic greed exposed in this novel is still very real nearly fifty years later."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"&quot;The Winter Of Our Discontent&quot; is not Steinbeck's best, but it's really a good read and you can't go wrong spending a few hours reading the works of this master of American Lit!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This was my first Steinbeck novel. If this is not his best (as the critics say) then I can't imagine what the others will be like. This is easily the best book I've read this year. Excellent piece of writing. The events of this book are in no way exclusively American, the message it conveys is a global one."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"We obviously weren't paying very close attention when books like this started emerging from the Eisenhower years. They are all dire warnings of where, not just our lives, but our very souls are heading as we walk the grim path of increasing affluence and keeping up with the Joneses. Beautifully and sensitively drawn, this portrait of Ethan Hawley's conversion to guerrilla capitalism and its consequences is nothing less than a must-read for every American who has been tempted to trod the same path. Take a half star off, though, for Hawley's (and other characters') male chauvinism which really gets to be a drag along the way (and I'm no big feminist)."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck's early novels, particularly \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are well known for packing a walloping emotional punch. Over time Steinbeck style and tone evolved. His move from California to Sag Harbor, Long Island probably had as much effect as age, experience and changing times. His last novel, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" shows Steinbeck continues to have strong views on America's social currents and his writing reflects the more subtle corruption of society that he sees around him.As the books are so different that had I not known ahead of time that this was a Steinbeck novel I would not have guessed it. Gone is the heavy use of vernacular and voice of the oppressed underclass unable to catch a break. In its place is Ethan Allen Hawley, the grocery clerk from the 11th generation of a once proud and wealthy family. Hawley is smart, glib, somewhat superficial growing cynical of his increasingly trapped middle age.Steinbeck sees Hawley's small town is perhaps a metaphor of the American society was so worrying to him. Businessmen are double dealing. Elected officials take a little bit on the side. And everywhere is the potential for a little shoplifting or infidelity. Through humor and wit much of this is glossed over but as the portraitures grew deeper it's more apparent that few in Steinbeck's world are capable of doing right. Their moral failings are central to his story.Overall the book was worthwhile, The characters are interesting and original and for social criticism this is ahead of its time. I found Hawley to be a strangely inconsistent character. He quotes latin, sites verse in Old English and in other ways is presented as potentially a deep and reflective person. But he is unaffected by his war years unnaturally detached from his wife and children using way too much humor. It contradicts with his later motives and actions which ultimately lead to a series of plot resolutions that seem to fall a bit short but I would say these are minor flaws for a story that illuminates its time with originality and freshness that remains for the modern reader.NOTE: Susan Shillinglaw's forward is quite helpful but I'd suggest it as an afterward as the plot giveaways were more than I would have liked."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"After reading Of Mice and Men, The Red Pony, and The Pearl in high school, I was not an admirer of Steinbeck, but when I picked up The Winter of Our Discontent as an adult, I was awed by the author I had once shunned. Steinbeck's keen sense of character and a mastery of the language carries this novel from first page to last. The story revolves around Ethan Hawley, a descendent of proud New England stock whose life seems betrayed by circumstances as he struggles to provide for his family. His wife Mary urges him to be more ambitious, and his restless teenage children exhibit signs of being morally corrupt. When Ethan decides that his ethics no longer matter in this demanding world, he enters his own compounding crisis.In perfectly rendered language, Steinbeck explores the themes of two Americas - the old Puritanical and morally staid one, and the one where every man fights for himself. The corruption in New Baytown is rampant. Issues about privilege and entitlement, family values, skewed priorities, flagging morality, and work ethics simmer underneath. Steinbeck's depiction of Ethan and Mary's marriage is witty, biting, and affectionate, demonstrating both his humor and his talent for dissecting domestic issues as well as the grander, social ones.A fine novel by a recently underappreciated author, The Winter of Our Discontent is worth every minute spent with it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"To any of you who are considering reading this book, the following points may be helpful:* Of all the Steinbeck novels I've read, I consider this one to be his wittiest, funniest and most intelligent. The dialogue is great and the main character (Ethan Allen Hawley) may be my favorite Steinbeck character of all-time.* This book focuses on thought rather than plot. We are taken on detailed journeys through Ethan Hawley's mind (in fact, some of the chapters of this book are written in the first-person rather than the third-person, such that Hawley speaks to us directly). What we are shown are the motives and means through which a conscientious human being trades a life of good deeds for a life of deception and acquisitiveness, and the result is jarring.* As indicated above, however, this book is NOT plot-driven. Therefore, some readers may not like it as much as, say, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; or &quot;In Dubious Battle&quot;. Do yourselves a favor and read the first page or two of the book before buying it. If you are drawn into the dialogue on these pages, you'll probably love the book - it represents the general tone of the novel throughout, though toward the end the book gets much darker as Ethan's abandonment of his morals and the consequences thereof are driven home to the reader.This truly great novel will stick with the reader long after the last page has been turned. Read it - I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"\\"The Winter of our Discontent\\" was published in 1961, just before Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize in 1962. The story is set in the late 1950s in New Baytown, a small (fictitious) New York -New England town which, Steinbeck tells us, had flourished during the whaling days of the mid-19th century. The main protagonist of the book is Ethan Allen Hawley. Ethan (\\"eth\\" to his friends is descended from early pirates and whaling captains. His family had lost its capital through speculative business ventures during WW II and Ethan, with has backround and his Harvard education, is reduced to working as a clerk in a small grocery store he once owned. Marullo, an Italian immigrant, owns the store and calls Ethan \\"kid\\".For a short novel, the book includes a wealth of characters, many of which I found well described. There is Ethan's wife Mary who is impatient with the family's impoverished lots and eager for Ethan's economic success as well as the couple's two children, Allen, who is writing an essay called \\"Why I Love America\\" and the sexually precocious daughter Ellen. We meet the town banker, Mr. Baker, a bank clerk and a friend of Ethan's, Margie Young-Hunt, twice married and the town seductress, and Danny Taylor, Ethan's childhood friend who has thrown away a career of promise and become a drunk.The book describes the deteriorations of Ethan's life as he gradually loses his integrity and succumbs to temptations to lift his life, and the lives of his family members, from its materially humble state to a state consistent with Ethan's felt family heritage and education and with the desire of his family for material comfort. The story is sad and told in a style mixing irony and ambiguity that requires the reader to reflect and dig into what is happening. The story ends on a highly ambiguous note with Ethan's future left in doubt.The book describes well the lessening of American standards and values. The book seems to attribute the loss to an increasing passion for commercial and economic success among all people in the United States. Juxtaposed with the economic struggle are pictures of, in steinbeck's view, what America was and what it could struggle to be. I think the images are found in religion (much of the story is, importantly, set around Good Friday and Easter and these holidays figure preminently in the book), and in America's political and cultural heritage. In the old town ofNew Baytown, America's history figures prominently with speeches from American statesment such as Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and Abraham Lincoln tucked (suggestively) in the family attic. The book is set against a backround of New England whaling and reminds the reader inevitably of a culture that produced Melville and a work of the caliber of Moby Dick.The most convincing scenes of the book for me were those where Ethan ruminates his life in his own mind and compulsively walks the streets of New Baytown at night. I was reminded of Robert Frost, a poet of New England and his poem \\"Acquainted with the Night\\" which begins:\\"I have been one acquainted with the night.I have walked out in rain -- and back in rain.I have outwalked the furthest city light.\\"Steinbeck captures much of the spirit of this wonderful poem.The plot of the book seems contrived at is climax and depends too much on coincidence. The characters, and their inward reflections on themselves, the descriptions, the setting, and the theme of the book, mingled between a love for our country and a sense of despair, make the book memorable."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This is a frightening book, with more real horror than ten of the standard fare. By detailing one man's sliding morals, it holds up a mirror to everyone, as we all have faced similar decisions between doing what is right and doing what is convenient. And facing ourselves can be truly horrifying -- especially whenthe collective result of everyone's decisions is clearly evident in the ethical morass of today's world, from a President trying to re-formulate the English language to the Enron financial fiasco to wide-spread cheating on exams at our military academies.For this novel Steinbeck decided to remove himself from his normal California setting in favor of the East Coast. By doing so he availed himself of a milieu where tradition and 'old money' set the standards for acceptance into 'society'. Ethan Hawley is a man whose family used to be part of that 'society', but due to bad financial decisions he now finds himself clerking for an immigrant who owns the grocery store he himself used to own. With a wife quietly but constantly chiding him about her desires for a better life, to be able to hold her head up in society, and two kids constantly clamoring for more things, Ethan finds himself at a crossroads between a rigid moral code instilled in him by his aunt and grandfather, and providing a better life for those he loves.Told partially in first person in spare but very effective prose, the road that Ethan spirals down is brilliantly portrayed, from his 'sermons' to the groceries, to his internal 'conversations' with his grandfather, to the seemingly chance happenings and conversations in his little town that spawns an idea and method for robbing the local bank, to his 'dropping a dime' on his immigrant boss, to his betrayal of his alcoholic friend Danny. Each action and decision proceeds logically from the previous one, each one more step down a path with no end, a path which Ethan continues to tell himself that he can abandon with no lingering aftereffects at any time. Each point is meticulously plotted, with all the proper items set in place before the action, and the choice of time, setting, and materials is rich in irony, a sure mark of an author fully in control of his subject.The ending is deliberately ambiguous. By the time I reached that point I had been so drawn into Ethan's character I found that his final decision was tremendously important to me. Each reader ultimately must draw his own conclusion about what Ethan will do, but regardless of what answer the reader reaches, no reader can remain unaffected by this book, and will find his life richer for having read it.Steinbeck was one of the great American writers. His Nobel prize was richly deserved, and this book, while not as well known as his Grapes of Wrath or East of Eden, is certainly one of the reasons why, rivaling his other works in power and insightful looks at American society, just as valid today as when it was written, and peopled by a very living set of characters."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book is amazing in a very specific and unusual way. It chronicles the slow slide, not to the depths of immorality that come to mind when we use that term, but merely to one step down on the morality ladder. There is not a mountain of difference between the man on page one and the man who stands on the beach on the final page, contemplating suicide. He has committed no crime, has resisted cheating on his wife, and has tried to save the life of his drug-addicted friend... the tiny difference lies not in the things he hasn't done wrong, but in the things he didn't do quite right. This difference is all the difference in the world. Steinbeck's power is in his portrayal of the nuances that make up personal experience. Where Grapes of Wrath was a powerful epic, the depths of poverty the characters endured enabled us to keep the experience at a distance, since few of us will ever know such poverty. The Winter of Our Discontent allows us no such respite. Each of us experiences temptation on a daily basis, and the risk of moral poverty that we all face and either resist or become accustomed to, is at the heart of this book. The final page is, oddly enough, a mystery, though this fact can easily escape you. All the members of my family read this independently, and only when we discussed it several years later did we find that we each had interpreted the end in different ways. Does he commit suicide or not? We were firmly split, and the wording Steinbeck uses is ambiguous. The answer is in the story that emerges from you as you read the book. Perhaps the most subtly powerful book you will ever read, if you are willing to allow it to affect you."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I liked this Steinbeck offering. I liked the fact that it's about small town morality, and ultimately society's morals too. The narrative raises questions about our attitudes towards the mundane and the everyday humdrum things like friendship, honesty, ambition, deception, fidelity, sex, family, avarice, petty corruption and to those of us who fall between the cracks.Okay, so that may sound very traditional and staid, perhaps it isn't sexy enough, but that's exactly why I admire Steinbeck's work. He writes about the real and our day-to-day lives and in this novel he highlights questions of morality through the story of failed businessman Ethan Hawley and New Baytown in late '50s early '60s America.I found it a compelling read, it wasn't an obvious story to tell and so I never really knew where the story was going to turn. It grabbed me with some clever structure and brilliant characterisation. I was particularly struck by the finely observed relationship between that of the protagonist and of his wife Mary, \\"My Mary\\".Steinbeck's power for social realism shone out, describing the life of New Baytown and its occupants in minute detail and through it showing the quiet nobility of ordinary working people. It reminded me strongly of similar evocations in his masterpiece, The Grapes of Wrath.This is a quirky and deceptively well-written book, with snappy dialogue, memorable characters and an intellectual seriousness lying behind the seemingly innocuous events. Recommended."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As social commentary on the &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot; as it manifested itself in small towns in the coastal U.S. this is as good as it gets. In stunning prose and articulate style, we are taken into the world of the mind of a man who was born into a world where he never felt he belonged. Upon returning home after becoming a decorated war hero, the protagonist discovers that running the family businesses is a different ballgame. After losing the &quot;family farm&quot; but keeping the house, this Ivy league literature graduate pines away tending shop for a successful Italian immigrant-entrepreneur. Then one day he snaps and the story really begins. Having taught several classes on political science and political economy, I can honestly say this is one of the best expositions of the pervasive power of capitalism to drive a good man to do &quot;ruthless&quot; things. Never black and white, Steinbeck portrays an endless array of ethical dilemmas while keeping a nail-biting dramatic tension throughout. To the reader who chooses to put oneself in the character's shoes, there is much to be gained from an honest reading of this slim volume. I can see why the Nobel committee considered this book to have put him over the top in earning the prize in 1961"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Nobel Prize committee mentioned THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT in awarding the 1962 Nobel Prize for literature to Steinbeck--and in so doing touched off a critical backlash against both the novel and Steinbeck's entire body of work. The novel had not been popular with American critics or American readers, and the author was savagely attacked as \\"past it,\\" his current works dismissed as irrelevant and his earlier works as overrated. Steinbeck was so humilated that he did not publish another novel in his lifetime.Part of critical reaction was due to the novel's structure, which jumps from third person to first person narrative and from character to character in an extremely jarring manner--and which in terms of plot seems prepared to run off in a dozen different directions but never actually does. But it may be more accurate to say that the bedrock of critical animosity was the nature of the story itself: an unflattering tale of America at its most hypocritical and corrupt. Given the tenor of the times, it was not a portrait that American critics or the reading public cared to embrace.Ethan Hawley is a descendent of a notable New England shipping family--but the advent of petroleum products destroyed the whaling industry and the family fortune declined. As the novel opens, Ethan is a clerk in the very grocery store he once owned. His wife Betty loves him, but is embarrassed for him; his two children, hungry for the luxuries of the small town upper class, are less discreet in their sentiments. At least Ethan has the satisfaction of knowing that he is a man of integrity ... but one day, for no significant reason at all, his eyes are suddenly opened to the truth. He can have it all. But there is a price to pay: his conscience.Steinbeck's works frequently deal with the struggle between personal integrity and worldly success, but THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT is quite unlike his other works, for instead of painting the battle in broad strokes Steinbeck explores a gray area that gradually darkens to black--and suddenly ends the novel on a slightly ambiguous note, leaving the reader to wonder if Ethan will fight his way out of the darkness or merely strive to protect his family from knowledge of it.Perhaps more so than other Steinbeck novel, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT requires a careful reading. Yes, the structure is jarring, and yes the plot seems to run hither and yon, but at the same time these elements actually mirror the disconnected nature of the characters in a way that becomes increasingly disconcerting as the book progresses. And while there is no doubt that the book is deeply flawed, there is no denying the author's power, a power that seems to arise as much from his failings as from his virtues. As always, Steinbeck takes great risks in his work, and part of the pleasure in reading one of his novels is in seeing how well the gamble pays off.I would not place THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT in the first rank of Steinbeck novels--but it certainly did not deserve the scorn heaped upon it in the early 1960s and which continues, to a certain extent, to dog it to this very day. Memorable, provocative, powerful, and recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"If I had never read so many of his other works, I would probably rate this fine classic five stars. I rate it just under four and a half stars solely because I don't think it quite compares to \\"East of Eden\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". These are times in which I wish Amazon had a ten point scale rating system instead of five. How can I honestly give this novel the same rating as the two above referenced classics? Yet, please don't get wrong, I did thoroughly enjoy this book, especially the second half. What I love most about Steinbeck is that he is truly an American through and through. Which makes him very easy for me, an American, to identify with. I also enjoy the fact that he was an artist that lived among the people (just like, and arguably even more so than Mr. Hemingway). This is a very attractive trait, in my opinion, when it comes to writing the dialogue between the characters. Steinbeck has the language and the mannerisms of the common man down to a tee.Three quotes I would like to add here. The first quote, will be the best I can think of when it comes to defining the story of Steinbeck's hero in the novel - Ethan Hawley. The second two quotes are two of my personal favorites from this novel, while they also aid in re-defining the book's main message.\\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\" Mark 8:36\\"Any man of reasonable intelligence can make money if that's what he wants. Mostly it's women or clothes or admiration he really wants and they deflect him. The great artists of finance like Morgan and Rockefeller weren't deflected. They wanted and got money, just simple money. What they did with it afterward is another matter.\\" (p. 45)\\"Strength and success - they are above morality, above criticism. It seems, then, that it is not what you do, but how you do it and what you call it. Is there a check in men, deep in them, that stops or punishes? There doesn't seem to be. The only punishment is failure. In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught.\\" (p. 187)I am huge Steinbeck fan, and I have read quite a bit of his work. In \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\", he has definitely created in Ethan Hawley a main character that I myself can relate with like none other. I have just become a husband and father. I work in the world of real estate (not as a broker or agent) in the Silicon Valley in Northern California (a.k.a. hades, everlasting fire, nether world, etc...) where attempting to be a man of morality, a man with principals and ethics, is not very easy to say the least. Especially when you are the only breadwinner and you live in one of the most expensive towns. Like Ethan, I am plagued daily by temptations that could easily make me richer and 'more successful' such as kick backs, black mail, cougar women (i.e. Margie Young-Hunt), shady deals, etc... yet, so far, I have been able to hold my ground. For those of you who haven't read this fine novel, that is what you must now find out for yourself. Will Ethan, after years upon years of being Mr. Nice Guy, a man who is going nowhere fast as a grocery clerk, a man that can barely manage to make ends meet for his family, will Ethan finally throw in the towel and join them? God knows he has the pedigree, the smarts, the wherewithal to be a success, the question is whether or not he wants to sell his soul to do so.Fans of Steinbeck's I can assure you that you will find this novel more enjoyable as long as you don't have the expectations of it being in the same league as those two above referenced classics. I still easily put this in my top ten favorites of all his work. My two only knocks (which are in no way a deterrent for reading this) are one, the lack of character development for everyone but Ethan and Margie, you really only get to know the other characters on more of a superficial, less than penetrating level. Which was a bit disheartening, because I really wanted to get to know some of these people more than he allowed me to. The other knock is that much of the book's plot was a bit too transparent for me. I was almost able to forecast everything that was going to transpire in the novel after reading the first forty pages. However, those are two very minor distasteful details when you consider who the author is. John Steinbeck could write a story about professional fly swatters stranded in a desert and still make it interesting. So I hope you all enjoy another little treasure from one of America's greatest twentieth century writers and definitely one of my personal favorites. Damn it! I really want to give this five stars!ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"i had a modern american literature class this last semester and our prof gave us a choice of four steinbeck novels: grapes of wrath, east of eden, travels with charlie, and the winter of our discontent. i chose 'the winter of our discontent' and i was so glad i did. this is one of the finest examples of american literature i've ever read.the novel itself starts out a bit slowly and i was afraid i wouldn't enjoy the novel. it's only in chapter four that steinbeck really hits his stride and shows why he's one of the crown jewels of american literature. i don't want to spoil it for anyone, but trust me, the prose is absolutely rapturous. i found myself constantly underlining sentences and paragraphs. pound for pound, steinbeck rivals oscar wilde in clever witticisms and aphorisms.on the surface, yes, 'the winter of our discontent' is a novel about a middle-agend man coming to terms with the new american lifestyle and its accompanying materialism, but it's much more than that. it's a novel about family, love, morality, temptation, corruption, death and ultimately about life, and how our lives are infinitely connected, one to another. like most great literature, we're able to see ourselves in the book's characters.unfortunately we live in an era where 'hip' writers (like david eggers) receive undue attention. consequently, american literature seems to have taken a few steps backwards in quality. not too many of our modern day writers really know how to *write.* fortunately, we still have steinbeck to show us what's right about our literary past and show us what quality literature looks like--there's a reason the man won a nobel prize."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Wonderful story! In being written by John Steinbeck, it would have to be. Criticism: too much detail; on and on about one particular thing; very distracting"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I had never before read this last of Steinbeck's novels and thoroughly enjoyed it. The moral struggle of Ethan Allen Hawley mirrors that of many people in today's society and government. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"You may have read this when you were young. But it is a wonderful re-read as you get older. I could hardly put it down. I re-read 3 of John's books this summer and what fun! They relate to today as well as when they were written."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck wrote this book to address the moral degeneration of America. I don't believe there was such a degeneration, I believe this is the way humans have always been.Regardless, Steinbeck never passes on the opportunity to teach us something about ourselves. These lessons range from insightful domestic truths to bigger, more easily identifiable truths about what motivates us to make our decisions. He doesn't allow his readers to rationalize or gloss over Ethan Hawley's decisions despite Ethan's own attempts to do just that.His grasp of different characters make me smile as I relate to myself and the people I love, and the dialogue between these characters is witty and more fast-paced than any Steinbeck book I can remember.Some gems:\\"No one wants advice--only corroboration.\\"\\"In poverty she is envious. In riches she may be a snob. Money does not change the sickness, only the symptoms.\\"\\"She gave the best of herself because they demanded nothing of her.\\"\\"You wouldn't be so worried with what folk think about you if you could know how seldom they do.\\""},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This novel of the financial struggle of one man's family was written in the late 1950's, but it is even more relevant today as it details the Hawley family, once a pillar of society in their Long Island community. But now the family's breadwinner is reduced in status to a grocery clerk: sweeping floors, stocking shelves, waiting on impatient customers, while he attempts to feed his family of four. It is hand to mouth, paycheck to paycheck. In a town rife with corrupt politicians, bankers, businessmen, and citizens, Ethan struggles to maintain his honesty as he sees others become rich through dishonest means. He decides to abandon his honesty policy and puts several plans of action into motion: taking a bribe, ratting out the store's owner to the Department of Immigration, taking advantage of an alcoholic boyhood best friend, and robbing a bank are all on his agenda. At the same time, his young son wins a national writing honor, which turns out to be based on plagiarism. Ethan, feeling his own dishonest plans corrupted his son, then considers suicide. The economic woes of the family are mirrored by today's stressful times. Steinbeck has laced his story with rich characters and detail. This is Steinbeck's last of sixteen novels. Quite a few, such as \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Cannery Row,\\" deal with the human struggle to survive. He's an expert at depicting this battle. The title is taken from the first two lines of Shakespeare's \\"Richard III.\\""},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"*No spoilers*If you're reading these reviews and still haven't made up your mind to get this book, hopefully I can give you that one final push - for or against it.When I started reading the first chapter, my first thought was, \\"What prompted me to read this?\\" It reminded me of required reading in high school, but without the distraction of good-looking classmates. But I persevered. And I was immediately rewarded with excellent characters, memorable descriptions of time and place - without being overly wordy - and one-liners that truly need to be read to be appreciated.As I am writing this review, I realize there were a lot more characters than I realized. This is a testament to Steinbeck's writing that I was never confused about how a character fit into the story. If you've ever wondered \\"How well do I really know someone?\\" or \\"How well do I know myself?\\" then you are in for quite a treat since this seems to be woven into every relationship in this novel. If you get the chance to discuss this with a book club, you'll probably have a field day! Also for the book club, the Penguin Classics version has explanatory notes and a 22-page introduction by Susan Shillinglaw, though I personally had no use for this.In a 280-page book, it would be hard to duplicate the inner thoughts of the characters, the descriptions of inanimate objects, motives and family history that stick with us after we read 'The Winter of Our Discontent'. Perhaps I have read others like this, but none come to mind.Finally, I wanted to add some quotes from the book that showcase Steinbeck's wit and thoughtfulness. This was what really kept me focused and smiling as I read. From the 'Penguin Classics' paperback edition:p.5(Mary, Ethan's wife, sends him to get some eggs for the children. Ethan jokingly retorts.)Ethan: \\"Why two dozen?\\"Mary: \\"For dyeing. Allen and Mary Ellen asked specially. You better go.\\"Ethan: \\"Okay bugflower - but can't I just go up and beat the hell out of Allen and Mary Ellen?\\"p. 72(Ethan is discussing the old days of pirates and their search for gold with his son, Allen)Allen: \\"I wouldn't mind that. I'd get the gold and bring it home. I guess they won't let you do it any more.\\"Ethan: \\"No - it's bigger and better organized now. They call it diplomacy.\\"p.149(Ethan's young daughter, Mary Ellen is chastising Ethan for not listening to her, then leaves the room)\\"She lounged away, a baby-fatted volupt. Girls kill me. They turn out to be girls.\\"Since I promised no spoilers, I will end here and encourage you to try this book for yourself."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Ethan Allen Hawley was a man who had it all; money and more importantly status in their small town community. A person's ego is carried into their profession, the amount of money they earn and their social status. And it is one way to climb up the ladder. But it is another matter to fall from the ladder, as if one has fallen from the grace of God.When I was 14 I picked up this novel and I had read most of Steinbeck's classics of my own volition. But this one was so sad, and the protagonist, Ethan could not catch a break.So he went from high society to managing a grocery story. And he had to eat crow at the social events, with people feeling sorry for him as he owned so much and lost it; he felt like hiding under a rock.He had an affair because he felt he had nothing to lose. Similar to his suicide attempt, life just kept on beating him down. But it was not life beating him down; he had an inability to cope with life's situations and to adjust. He had a job, could put food on the table, had a fine family. He had to work on his thin skin and needed to try to go out on his own to become an entrepreneur as his father was in years past. But it was his decision to choose not to try. He did not realize how much his daughter really loved him by replacing the razors in his pockets with her special rocks. But could he man-up and accept what life had given him?These actions would help him focus on the positive instead of focusing on the past failures. But all he wanted to do was feel sorry for himself; enough to leave a widowed wife and orphaned children without financial means. He was selfish even to his death.I enjoy Steinbeck as he wrote about people in California along the coast. He wrote of the people suffering in the Grapes of Wrath, a moral struggle between two brothers in East of Eden, Of Mice and Men, which culminated in one friend having to kill his mentally slow best friend, before the mob would tear him apart for touching a young woman. The there is Cannery Row and As I Lay Dying. This is just a small sampling of a large body of works.I would recommend The Winter of Our Discontent, as it brings the reader into the world of Ethan Allen Hawley and his trials and tribulations. Steinbeck does not write to fill the book just to meet publishing criteria - when it is done it is done."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"\`The Winter of Our Discontent' is a slight departure for Steinbeck in that this isn't set in the Salinas valley or California. It has a different feel to his past novels with the themes of human greed and also with a slightly different style to the prose and yet it still has the splendour and amazing technique that Steinbeck is famous for, and which I've grown to love. You still get his lush descriptions, and turns of phrase that encapsulate a feeling or scene in a few perfectly chosen words. The story itself is completely absorbing and as with all of his novels, once you start reading it is very hard to put this down. Written towards the end of his career and when he was living in New York with his last wife you can see the influences of this change come out in his writing, but this in no way detracts from the overall feel, if anything it adds to it. If you've enjoyed any of his past novels then this one will not disappoint and if you're new to Steinbeck I wouldn't recommend this as your first try (maybe Grapes Of Wrath or Cannery Row) but you should definitely come back to it at some point soon. Well worth a read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"One of my very favorite novels is EAST OF EDEN, so I was especially curious to read this, his last novel. I couldn't devour it fast enough. The story of WASP-y Ethan, Mary and their small suburban town immediately gripped me and I was thoroughly captivated by Steinbeck's style of prose. The dialogue crackled with wit...the descriptive passages and storytelling all insightful and artistically composed. A real pleasure to read.The disturbing course on which Ethan embarks, though both personal choice and circumstance, gets a little muddied in Part II but nevertheless my intent interest remained. I was born shortly after the time in which this is set (1960), so many of the references and mindsets rang so very clearly to the way I recall from my childhood.

I found Steinbeck's observations of the American life in 1960 dramatic, yet the problems described are not very different from today's. The main character, Ethan Allen Hawley is a very difficult who lives in an anguished status in this contemporary world. He is deeply committed to his ancestral inheritance and his wife and children,he values honesty and morality, yet betrays his best friend to achieve what some of the important town folks have achieved, status and money.

He has conclusively demonstrated the impossibility of creating material success in a capitalist system and at the same time having sound morals. Ethan realises that his cotownees are unwilling and unable to recognise the all-pervasive, evil American values preventing them from being better people. This saddens and frustrates him. His challenge is to find a way to retain his integrity while accommodating the desires of his family and the expectations of the capitalist system he finds so oppressive. He cunningly nearly achieves this, with little compromise, though he saw his friend from school-days as a casualty of his actions. In the end he feels his conscience is sullied, leaving any future for him fatally devalued, in his eyes. No wonder so many Americans didn't like it. A brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Having recently read the over-hyped \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzen, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" proved an excellent respite from all the drivel that's being passed off these days as modern masterworks. Steinbeck is amazing."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"We're not given a real protagonist. The author cares more -- much more -- about the sacred cows of his language and metaphor than about character. Ethan Allen Hawley is a Harvard graduate and a scion of old money who goes to work as a clerk in a grocery store because his father has squandered said old money. This is in 1948, and we meet him 12 years on, still in the same grocery store, still doing menial labor, in 1960. A college graduate was still a rather rare commodity in 1948, certainly a Harvard grad. Why on earth would such a man be willing to sweep floors and stock shelves for 12 years? We are never told. Why does he suddenly awaken and become ambitious in 1960? (this is the Easter metaphor -- the old Ethan dies and a new one arises) We are never told. Why does his ambition coincide with moral depravity? We are never told.He is not only a Harvard grad, he is impossibly witty, glib, and, all of a sudden, street smart. No such person would have sat still so long, any such person could have made money in 1948-1960 without cutting corners morally to a significant degree, and no such person would be surprised that cutting corners morally in pursuit of wealth would make him feel so bad that he might not be able to live with himself.Steinbeck wanted to make a statement about the sad state of morals in 1960 America, but immorality was not unique to that time, or our time, or the late '30s (Grapes of Wrath), or the Roman Empire or the Russian Steppes or anyplace or anytime else. Immorality is the oldest story in the book, so if you want to talk about it through characters, there is no reason for doing so other than simply as an excuse to write good characters, but Steinbeck fails to do that. Margie and Joey, friends of Ethan, are also like him: ambitious and impossibly perspicacious and witty, yet somehow stuck in dead-end lives year in and year out in a dead little town. It's a silly, tiresome book, micro-smart but macro dumb dumb dumb."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I liked The Grapes of Wrath, so I decided to give this Steinbeck novel a whirl. While the book did delve deep into the characters and their personalities, the characters are completely boring and the book was a snooze fest. In fact, several times I found myself reaching for this book when I was having trouble getting to sleep some nights. Worked like a charm.The subject matter is drab, and the characters are less than enchanting. You can tell from near the beginning of the book that this \\"moral man\\" (Ethan) is eventually going to decide that succeeding in the world is more important to him than his ethics. Surprise, surprise, another fool sells his soul in the pursuit of wealth.Steinbeck is known for being a master of the English language, and I won't argue with that. The use of words and phrases in this book are obviously brilliant, however, that is ALL this book has going for it. I agree with how one other reviewer described this book as \\"a silly, tiresome book that is micro-smart, and macro-dumb, dumb, dumb\\"."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Winter is another of those books more easily appreciated at the age of 20 than at 50. I loved it as a young person, care nothing for it as an older one. I was disappointed to discover that fact. As a Steinbeck lover I'm tempted to believe Winter of our Discontent was a book written at a time when the writer was in a state of abject depression. The book lacks the usual penetrating characterization, the solid plotting and the rapier wit found in his best works.Here, Steinbeck's character, an old 'founders' family descendant, finds himself in a moral turmoil. He struggles and comes up lacking in his own eyes. The struggle then evolves with a different type of challenge: to continue to live, or to choose death as an alternative to imperfection, of being a flawed human being."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"In an example of what great writing can be, Steinbeck has created a modern morality tale of sorts.

I do not call this work a poor one; in some ways, it begs to be argued, it does stand out as a master-work. But it suffers fundamentally, that is, instinctively. In effect, Ethan Hawley has too many instincts that we find to be right (a heavy-handed, narrative utilitarianism not so insistent in Steinbeck's best work), but that are actually wrong (and morally wrong -- narrative epiphanies -- but, curiously, convictions of Ethan's long before his present woes in the novel). But some will say it is the point! That Ethan, to satisfy his worldly instincts, ignored his moral ones. If it is then the ending is appropriate but nothing more, the novel a long-going morality tale. I do not call it as simple as that. Yet, In the meantime, is Steinbeck-on-canvas reaching frantically for his old colors, finding them gone primary, and, as if by persistence alone, gamely imitating the best, life-colored attributes of his own far-previous writing -- his brilliant ability to create life-blood characters and a setting that a meaningful narrative, like seconds, can move carelessly through. I do not fault him! His book is thematically ambitious and thus rewarding -- untrustworthy dialogue and character devlopment/correspondence, notwithstanding. A person that I know and whose opinions are valid disagreed with me outright, so it could be that I am projecting here. But I urge you to read anything Steinbeck has written from say, mid thirties to mid-forties (b.1902), and compare it, in texture and tone of voice, to this, his late novel of the finance quandary. I really think you will note a difference."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I order many, many books from Amazon and this was the first time I was disappointed. I knew the book would not be in perfect shape, but I didn't expect it to fall apart from the first time I opened it. Each time I opened it to read, more pages fell out. Very disappointing. The book did come quickly and was packaged very well."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck comes forth with his usual superb character development as expected. What was unexpected was how relevant his question remains today. Is everyone dishonest in business? Is that what it takes? What happens to an honest man when he tries to get ahead?The story is set in the typical small American town. If you have ever watched small town politics, you know the cast. Except for Ethan. He is unique because he is honest. He is also \\"a failure\\" because he is honest. He has a wonderful wife - never openly begrudging and always accomodating. But then he has two kids, both of whom want to know why he isn't rich or when he will be. They are the future, as children naturally are and the question plays out between them too. Then there is Margie. Like a carbon copy of the perfect wife, she is the perfect \\"confidant\\" if you get my drift. As a woman, the contrast between them begs study. But it also pushes the fidelity angle too as Steinbeck goes into her relationships with various men. Like Young Goodman Brown (Hawthorne, I think) who goes to meet the Devil fearing what various people would think only to find out that they are all already there, Hawley questions of morality go there too.But the true grit of this, for me, is the honesty factor. When being asked by his family when he will be rich, one of his responses is that there are two kinds of money - no money and not enough. It will never be enough. At what point do you stop \\"bending the rules\\". Do you \\"bend the rules\\" to get a house and security and then behave as an honest and decent man? Or do you then have the \\"not enough\\" kind of money and have to keep going. Is to be rich necessarily to be dishonest? And in the return to honesty and decency, will the money be lost?This is an excellent book - and always will be. As long as we keep doing things we wouldn't \\"normally\\" do to make money, i.e. trade off our family and values to do this or do that. Are we being who we want to be? Are we striving to be the best spouse, neighbor, parent or does business come first? And, if so, why? Is that really success?"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck's last work of fiction, 'The Winter of Our Discontent', examines the 'moral flabbiness' of post-war America, particularly that of the late 1950's. Its stated question, posed by the main character Ethan Allen Hawley in a first person monologue, is whether an ethical man can set aside his principles, do what is required to advance himself in the world, and then, objective reached, reclaim those principles without suffering moral damage. That Hawley does eventually convince himself to attempt such a 'moral holiday', to prove for himself that it's possible, and the results he obtains is the crux of the book - but from its melodramatic set-up to its engineered ending, it seems as though Steinbeck were shouting out his subject's terrible relevance on every page.I nearly put this book down before I finished the first chapter. It begins with several pages of dialog that sounds artificial and too special, followed by a character sketch of Hawley as he interacts with the same townspeople he'll have to deal with during his 'holiday'. This blatant foundation seems amateurish, and I can't help but think of the last Steinbeck book I read, 'To a God Unknown', which, while it had its faults, had an intrinsic vitality to its spare prose and a calm, evocative pace that is lacking in this much later work.In the book's third chapter, Steinbeck changes his point of view, and Hawley begins to address the reader in the first person. At this point, I did get somewhat drawn into the story, and once his machinations come clearer, there is a bit of tension to their resolution. Unfortunately, the necessity of having the story impart a lesson trumps a realistic, though probably ambiguous, ending, and instead concludes with Hawley frantically out of character.'Winter of Our Discontent' isn't as terrible as I've probably made it out to sound, but it is disappointing in relation to other Steinbeck novels that I've read. In this Penguin Classics Edition, Susan Shillinglaw writes a perceptive, and positive, introduction that contextualizes 'Winter' with Steinbeck's life, and also catalogs some of the references to the outside world that gives this novel an extra layer of texture and nuance; however this still fails to overcome its melodramatic air. In that sense, 'Winter' is reminiscent of 'East of Eden', and readers who enjoyed that Steinbeck work may also find 'The Winter of Our Discontent' to their liking."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"\\"In business and politics a man must carve and maul his way through men to get to be King of the Mountain. Once there, he can be great and kind - but he must get there first.\\"The title of this book is a link to Shakespeare's Richard III - which opens with \\"Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York; and all the clouds that lowered upon our house in the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\\" This is (future king) Richard celebrating an upturn in his family's fortunes - basically saying that our dark days are behind us (winter) and the future is now turning bright. It begins his accession to the throne, which he briefly attains, through murder, manipulation, and treachery.The Winter of Our Discontent's main character, Ethan Allen Hawley, makes a similar shift to achieve material desires. At the start of the novel, Ethan is a moralistic, but ordinary, man. Like his father and grandfather before him, Ethan is fair and honest in a world that has increasingly become materialistic and corrupt. He is married with two kids, working as a clerk at a grocery store his family used to own. He failed early at business - losing the grocery store and what was left of his family's land in the town (except his house) - which created a chip on his shoulder that everyone in town seems to want to wedge deeper. His family harps on him about their lack of money and status in the town. The town banker questions what Ethan is doing working as a clerk. Ethan's boss stresses business prowess and the need to \\"look after number one.\\" A local vender even offers a bribe and kickback to Ethan for some business, as \\"everybody's got a right to make a buck.\\" Ethan is an outlier in the town his family essentially founded - as the old is constantly being moved out for the new, and Ethan is stuck looking into the past.Ethan begins to tire of being the town doormat - and like most of the town before him, begins to break down and rationalize that morality is relative. He asks if \\"the eaters (are) more immoral than the eaten? In the end all are eaten - all - gobbled up by the earth, even the fiercest and the most crafty.\\" He questions what one gains by being a moral individual, when we all share the same fate. With the help of an opportunistic amateur fortune-teller, Ethan rebuilds himself in efforts to capture the respect of and successes of those around him - like a snake \\"changing its skin, part dusty and ragged and part fresh and new.\\" He falls in line with those around him - letting his animalistic nature control his behavior.He is able to make this change naturally, and he gains success and wealth outwardly but finds that he has morally depleted himself in the process. He manipulates his childhood friend, now a drunk, into giving Ethan his (very valuable) land in exchange for enough money to drink himself to death. He reports his boss (the grocery store owner) to the government as an illegal immigrant, so he can take back ownership of the store. He even contemplates robbing a bank before fate intercedes. All these actions are rationalized by Ethan, as \\"all men are moral, only their neighbors are not.\\" These actions let him achieve the wealth and status that he feels he's been missing, but he finds it unsatisfying given what he had to give up. Ethan realizes that even in a relative world, there are still acceptable and unacceptable moral standards for oneself.Ethan is finally both taken over the edge and then brought back by the future - his children. His son, Allen, has inherited the same moral standards of those around him, having plagiarized his essay in an essay contest. Ethan is disgusted - and at this point realizes his hypocrisy - that while he has justified immorality within himself (due to relative moralism), he finds the same behavior in others detestable. His daughter, Ellen, saves Ethan by representing moralistic hope in the future - a light that has not gone out, and in the end, Ethan puts his own needs aside in order to provide hope for the next generation.A good story that underlines what Steinbeck considered the \\"moral flabbiness\\" spreading from corporate America to everyday American life during the 50s (and 60s). Through Ethan we experience the collapsing of a moral man into the relative morals that has overtaken everyday life. The message Steinbeck is sending is a relevant one - that no matter what relevant morals are prevalent in society, it is up to the individual not to fall into a relative moral trap, but to be guided by a constant set of absolute morals.The weakness of the novel is in its characters and relationships, which are lacking in my opinion. The novel's characters, beyond Ethan, are trivial and not well developed - seeming to only be there to prove a certain point. Part of this probably stems from the fact that most of the book is told from Ethan's point of view - but even he appears to be lacking something, specifically in his relationships. His only connection is with his past - he has no connection with his wife or his kids - their interactions seem contrived. The only connection he makes is at the end - through the talisman, with his daughter - but it seems like a reach given their prior lack of depth. The relationships lacked to me - maybe this was how Steinbeck envisioned Ethan, but I thought his character (and others) could have been filled out better.A lot of criticism of this book also stems from comparing it to his other works (mainly Grapes of Wrath) - which I have not read, but now plan to. I think that is a little unfair though - this book stands on its own, depicting its period with universal moral themes, and delivers its intended message."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book is a perfect way to become deeply enveloped in the psychology of a loveable man grappling with the temptations of corruption, greed, and adultery. The characters are vivid and personal, and often we are privy to their most intimate- and amusing- thoughts. Steinbeck is a master of recreating the essence of a culture, and he successfully creates this New England town which remains steeped in its own quaint history despite the increasing infringements of modern life. As with much Steinbeck, it is the characters and the culture that make this short novel great, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I like Steinbeck a lot and I admire his ability to adeptly write about so many different themes in his various novels. Out of all of his books, I think this is one of the least known, which is really too bad. Steinbeck's prose and descriptive ability never falters; he makes the book come alive but never overwhelms the reader with detail. The variety of characters (another one of Steinbeck's traits) usually would seem like too much for this relatively short novel, but each one is memorable, adding another layer, another necessary part that makes this novel work so well. This book's themes, especially the theme of whether it's worth it to sacrifice ideals in order to get ahead, are applicable to this day and age and ensure the timelessness of this novel."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"A powerful novel, with a plot that most can relate to. Ethan Hawley, the main character struggles to provide for his family. Comes from a family of successful business men, until The Great Depression hits his family hard and he must start from the bottom, working as a produce market clerk. He feels that he must own up to his name that has been made by his predecessors. He is confronted by opportunities that question his integrity and common sense.What I like about this novel is that present day situations arise which grabs my attention and makes me think. Ethan, married with two children, thinks of his family first, because all he wants is to give them what he feels they deserve. He would sacrifice his own happiness to make his family happy.I also can relate to how he sometimes feels disappointed by how his life is panning out, but doesn't forget all the things he should be grateful for. I strongly recommend this novel to all who love to read. Whether you can relate to it or not, it will make you think, and help you appreciate some things that are taken for granted."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"If you are ever asked what five books you would recommend to someone who knew nothing about America to introduce them to what it means to be American...like say...on the Foreign Service Exam ;-) this book had better be on that list. The Grapes of Wrath is the Masterpiece that gets all the attention but this novel shines even in the shadow of one of the key pieces of American literature. I have rarely been &quot;moved&quot; by a novel the way that I was with this book. It forces you to read it at its own pace and to let the story unfold around you. It is a great book and one that deserves to be read time and again. Read it yourself and then give it to your children. This book will speak to your soul."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Simply the best book I have ever read. Steinbeck illustrateshow easily a very moral man can stray from the path ofmorality and how this straying can affect everything aroundhim. Steinbeck also beautifully and grippingly writes of howthe realization of this can crush a man's spirit."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book reads like a howl of pain from a man who did not like where he saw his country headed. Sadly, no one was listening.Ethan Allen Hawley is a Harvard educated descendent of New England shipping captains. In years past, his family was one of the most important in town. But now times have changed &amp; after his father lost most of the family fortune &amp; Ethan himself lost the family store, he is reduced to being a grocery clerk in the employ of an immigrant, Mr. Marullo.Ethan's wife, Mary, and his two children, Ellen and Allen, push him to better the family's lot. Mary, for instance, wants him to invest the $6000 she inherited upon her brother's death.The town vixen, Margie Young-Hunt, provides a powerful pull to kick over the traces &amp; run a bit wild. She sends a representative from a food wholesaler to Ethan &amp; he is offered a kickback if he'll buy from them.Meanwhile, Danny Taylor, his childhood friend &amp; now the town drunk, holds a piece of property that developers are desparate to get ahold of for their planned airport. The local banker approaches Ethan for help in getting the property away from Danny.In short order Ethan is narcing on neighbors, betraying Danny, taking bribes &amp; planning to rob the bank.The ease with which the morally upright Ethan slips into a life of scheming and crime is not particularly believable. And I'll leave it to others to question the likelihood of a college graduate turned grocery clerk (lawyer/technicians shouldn't throw stones.)However, Steinbeck had clearly perceived the general decline in morality that was occuring and accelerating as the nation entered the 1960's. As Ethan considers his schemes, he says, &quot;A crime is something someone else commits&quot;. Here's his description of the year 1960: it was &quot;a year when secret fears come into the open, when discontent stops being dormant and changes gradually to anger. The whole world stirred with restlessness and uneasiness as discontent moved to anger and anger tried to find outlet in action, any action so long as it is violent.&quot;Steinbeck manages to paint an extremely bleak portrait of America &amp; where it was headed, but it's hard to argue that he was wrong. He offers only two rays of hope. At one point, Ethan recalls the words of his grandfather, &quot;Only in a single man alone--only in one man alone. There's the only power--one man alone. Can't depend on anything else.&quot; This nearly biblical incantation offers the way out of the predicament that Steinbeck has forecast. Each man must take responsibility for his own actions.Then when Ethan has reached the end of his rope &amp; considers suicide, a simple action by his daughter draws him back from the edge &amp; he determines that he must try to help her, &quot;else another light go out.&quot; I found this to be somewhat too little too late, especially as his daughter has already gotten up to no good.I did find one thing remarkable about the book. Steinbeck may well have been the last of the significant traditional novelists. It is such a pleasure to read a straightforward story that doesn't resort to magical realism or interior monologue or other modernistic artifice. At one point, Ethan says, &quot;A man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading, for a story has as many versions as it has readers. Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure. Some pick out parts and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of predjudice, some paint it with their own delight. A story must have some points of contact with the reader to make him feel at home in it. Only then can he accept wonders.&quot; Compare this to The Way of All Flesh, where Samuel Butler stated that he didn't care if anyone ever read his books or to James Joyce's completely inaccessible works.It seems to me that this novel may stand as the demarcation of the end of a moral and a stylistic era.GRADE: B"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This underrated book presents the classic moral dilemma which pits the desire of the main character to live a moral, simple and decent life against the pressures from outside influences to obtain material wealth and standing through means which would cause him to give up the morals he holds most precious to him. This is the type of novel that all people should read after they have entered the workforce and can reflect on their own lives. Steinbeck leads the reader through the main character's thoughts and finishes this personal journey with an ending which will have readers turning back the pages to see the events which preceded the conclusion. I read the last chapters several times and each time was moved.The reason why this novel is underrated is that while it lacks the size and power of some of Steinbeck's other novels, such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\", \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"East of Eden\\", I often reflect upon the lessons of this novel years later in my own life. For this reason, it is my favorite of all of Steinbeck's novels. Like all of Steinbeck's writings, it acccomplishes its goals with a concise economic prose, which serves to emphasize the message of the novel. It is a novel of significant moral effect and it should be read several times during a lifetime to remind us of the difference between right and wrong and the significance that our actions may have on the lives of those around us and on ourselves."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"For many years, I have had books thrown in my face and told what they mean and what exactly takes place. But I, as a 1990's teenager, like to have the power to think for myself. John Steinbeck's The Winter of Our Discontent is a perfect example of what to read. In it there is a profound story, but also the freedom to perceive it anyway you like. Ethan Hawley leaves his morals at home almost every morning for a month, and you get to decide what he thinks, knows, and how he feels. If you love to think and have the power to end a book how you see fit, I extremely recommend Steinbeck's The Winter of Our Discontent.

If you like Steinbeck, you will love this book"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"First, I will state up front that John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. In this novel Steinbeck atypically writes about life in a town in the east, one somewhere on the lower New England coast. The depth of the characters, a Steinbeck trademark, is present here in spades. His protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, is one of the most thoroughly well written characters that you can find. His wife Mary, his boss Marullo, his friend at the bank next store Joey-boy, his wife's friend Margie Young-Hunt, his kids (maybe especially his kids)... are all so vividly displayed that it's easy to forget that this is a fictitious town filled with fictitious people. The subject matter easily matches the character's depth... the difficulty in a modern world, full of all kinds of pressures, to remain moral and honest in the face of an easier way out. (Although written in the early 60s, the relevance to current headlines is obvious). Suffice to say that Steinbeck is one of the great writers of all time and all his copious skills are on display here. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Hawley family is \\"Discontent\\". Ethan Hawley is working as a grocery clerk in the store he previously owned. The store now belongs to Marullo, an Italian immigrant who tries to teach Ethan what makes a successful businessman. Even Mr. Baker, the banker, has advice for Ethan: he tries to teach him how to be a good investor. It seems that everyone has an opinion on how Ethan Hawley can bring respect back to his family name. His wife is restless and doesn't like the fact that they are poor and living in a town where they were once respected. Ethan's son wants to go on television and get rich quick, his adolescent daughter is too secretive for his liking.Steinbeck's protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, is a moral individual who has always done the right thing. This novel is set in New Baytown, a fictitious town near Long Island, a town that operates within a realm of corruption. Yet things have operated that way for so long that no one remembers that it is corrupt anymore. Ethan's family feels that he is too ethical for his own good. He has to choose between his current morals and adapting the definition of his morality.Steinbeck captures a nation that is growing economically but bankrupt morally. Where this novel differs from other fall from grace novels is that the central character observes himself as a third party and slides down the slippery slope knowing full well the consequences. Steinbeck offers redemption in the form or Marullo, on being deported he gives the grocery store to Ethan Hawley. This happens just when Ethan is about to rob the bank.A short novel worthy of praise addresses moral questions that really make you stop and think; the dialogue is brilliant.The characters are clever and witty, but at times I found the plot was very slow."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck shows true artistry of dialogue in this book set in New England in the 1950s. The protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, conveys every bit of his is misfortune (or missed fortune, as the case may be) and everyman, grocery store clerk persona in his words along with something deeper, darker, and perhaps undetectable to one who isn't privy to what haunts his mind at night. He is a delightful character, despite his self-indulgence. Although the plot is slow and relies heavily on somewhat unbelievable coincidences, the story is chock-full of brilliant dialogue. You can practically see the scenes in black and white in your mind with a Jimmy Stewart-esque Ethan tapping out the language in a beautiful staccato song of times gone by."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"We all know the difference between right and wrong, but the temptation to commit something that is wrong to make things more right is incredibly strong. That is what Steinbeck main character here has to deal with. Every where he turns their is another temptation to do something and many times he almost gives in, but the decent soul always wins out; well almost always. He does commit somethings that maybe weren't the best things to do, but... This is a fine book, well written and everyone should be able to identify with these all to real characters. The setting is a small town in the east, the kind of town that we have seen in movie after movie, but in all these towns, just as in real life, there are things that are not altogether wholesome going on. This couls be set at anytime, anywhere and still be as true to life as it is. This is a book that should be read."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Having read many of Steinbeck's books and thoroughly enjoying them, I have been looking forward to reading \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\". The initial tone Steinbeck sets in the book is odd. The main character possesses none of the typical characteristics which mark a Steinbeck main character. Ethan Hawley is hard to like at times because of the strange things he says and does. But in reality, Ethan represents every man. Often not likable, but real.Steinbeck paints vivid characters in this story as he does in his other works. Ethan Hawley finds himself working as a clerk in the store his family once owned. Despite a heritage of wealth, his family has fallen on hard times. A fortune teller suggests this will soon change. When the store's current owner is deported, Ethan regains in possession of the store. The owner gave the store to Ethan at a cheap price because he is an honest man. Despite an apparent influx of wealth on the horizon, Ethan's other problems linger. His daughter merely wants him to be around. His son's fortune of winning an essay contest evaporates when he was found to have plagiarized. Danny, who is like a brother to him, may not have been rehabilitated from his alcoholism. The fortune teller lusts for him. The whole town seems to have fallen into corruption. His wife seems to be the last remaining sane person left.As one would expect from Steinbeck, this book does not have a happy ending. The end is quite depressing, much like reality can be. Steinbeck has a gift for painting reality. While far from his masterwork, this story holds its ground."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This is a beautifully written book ~~ and my second Steinbeck book. A friend complained to me recently that she finds Steinbeck a depressing writer ~~ I disagree. He writes realistically of the views that society has on one another and of the world. Steinbeck writes convincingly of people and this book is no exception.The book focuses on Ethan, a descendant from the Pilgrims and of the whaling captains, reduced to semi-poverty by working for an Italian immigrant in the grocery store he used to own. His wife, Mary, complains of not having money to spend as well as his two children. Beset by memories of how it used to be, Ethan begins to look for a way to solve his problems. This book focuses on that attempt. Ethan is a lovable character ~~ he defuses every serious conversations or whining with humor, oftentimes at the expense of his good self-will and pride.It is a journey into one man's soul and it's soul-wrenching as well. It makes you stop and think ~~ and you don't dare to criticize anyone because you're guilty of the same feelings of despair and defeat. Ethan struggles to find a way to deal with those expectations and dreams of his loved ones and still keep his pride. But it comes to a conclusion that he can't have both.This may be a smaller book but one still grabs at your soul and your mind. It's a perfect addition to any serious reader's library.1-3-04"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"A Review of The Winter of Our Discontent by John SteinbeckThis is my favorite book by John Steinbeck. The life of Ethan Hawley, the main character, is simple and complex. He is a working-class man with a blue-blood lineage. In the small town in which he lives - his name rings of history and power - his ancestors were the founders of the village and basked in the glory of their status and wealth for many years. Not so for Ethan. He now lives in the shadow of his great name - no longer having the funds or status to support his legacy.The real story of this book, for me, however, was the clash between his status and the material wants/needs/demands of his family. This is the America conundrum - regardless of how well we do financially - there is always more stuff (bigger, faster, shinier, newer) waiting around the corner - contentment is elusive. Ethan is bombarded daily with the wants of his children - from the latest cereal they'd seen on TV to stories of the vacations their neighbors had recently taken - all followed with - \\"can we...?\\" Of course Ethan wants to provide these things for his family - he simply doesn't have the means or the opportunity to do so.Then opportunity presents itself. To seize it, however, Ethan must trade his morals and ethics for profit. He takes advantage of a \\"friend\\" and profits greatly - enabling him to finally provide the many goodies his family has craved. We do not learn much about the family after the fact - the impact this action had on Ethan, on his relationships with his family or the community. We assume he profited and \\"lived happily ever after.\\"The real question, posed by Steinbeck throughout this story is: What would you do to profit - to attain the American Dream? Is the cost worth it? Is the \\"dream\\" worth it?All of us are asked to do things in our jobs and in our daily living that challenge our personal morality or ethics. Corporations do many good things, but also, as economic engines, they often do things that are pro-business and anti-people: mass lay-offs, off shoring, out-sourcing, questionable environmental ethics, and manipulative tactics to gain position or market share. People are at the levers of these acts - people who must make decisions that are gut wrenching on a human-scale, but smart business and of great benefit to stock holders.Everyday, we purchase millions of dollars of products that are produced in factories that would violate every labor law we have here in the states - yet we are able to purchase it cheaply, which is helpful when one is on a limited budget.I guess I find it important to know, and understand, the complexity of a global world. There is much good, and much bad. Are we to simply accept the bad and strive for our own personal gain? Should we focus on those we help - our employees, stockholders and customers - and ignore those who may suffer as a result of our behavior? It seems that all human activity has some negative and positive outgrowth - perhaps the best we can do is the best we can do.This is, perhaps true on a global level - we can feel for the woman who worked to make the five-dollar t-shirts we are buying at Wal-Mart - but can we, individually, change this system? I don't know. To a large degree, I think, we are all individuals stuck in a monstrous-global economic machine that exists outside of any ethical or moral code. The name of the game is - profit. I am all for the free market - 100% - however, I do not like to see, nor do I celebrate and entity (private or public) that serves itself first, often at the expense of the individual. The Leviathan-state (or Corporation, or any organization) rarely benefits those it professes to serve.It seems much more complicated, however, on a personal level. The real question is: What would you do to your neighbor to attain the brass ring? That is what Steinbeck presented with perfect clarity - the dramatic change between the Puritanical culture that had passed and the new age of economic ambition and material want. The old Ethan held to the Golden Rule - Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do To You. The new Ethan held to the Gecko Rule - Do It To The Other Before They Do It To You.The future for such a culture seems bleak.This book is an excellent meditation on personal ethics. It is definitely worth a tumble.Peace & God Bless!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Out of print in Italy luckly available somewhere else, I and my 18 years old boy appreciated very much. A must for who wants to understand the US citizens."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I was pleased, but not enraptured. Whereas \\"East of Eden\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\" provide the reader with beautifully rich characters wrapped in poetic narrative, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" offers an expanded cast encased in a comparatively mediocre prose.Ethan Hawley--grocery store clerk, heir of a small town American legacy, father, husband, and friend--is the books sole intriguing character. Tempted by greed, lust, violence, and crime--through which he skates unscathed-- Ethan's struggles lead to his near suicide which is prevented by love for his daughter and a desire to see his name thrive.Ethan's relationship with and attitude toward his children is where this story shines. This alone makes it a novel worth reading. He is brutal in pointing out his children's flaws, but constant in his love and devotion towards them.Overall, not my favorite Steinbeck, but it was surely interesting. The few brilliantly poetic sentences interspersed in passable prose kept me reading.Yes, I will deign to give this book a completely subjective letter grade: B+."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Winter of Our Discontent was quite typical of Steinbeck's writing. It was rather descriptive and tried to dissect the human psyche. This particular book studied the effects of compromising one's morals. It was pretty good and definitely worth reading, especially for any Steinbeck obsessors (like me hehe). For those who want to get a feel of Steinbeck's writing, but don't feel like investing enough time to read Grapes of Wrath, this would work as a decent substitute."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Only bad thing in that book is atempt to answer the question.May be it is the most powerful of all Steinbeck books. May be only one of them, where author do not really know the answer.Of course, he is trying to answer. While Dostoevsky in same situation forced his hero to commit murder, Steinbeck forces world to teach hero a lesson. But he have enough taste to live hero with gains from his crime."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I recently listened to a Steinbeck book for the first time on an audio book. I liked it a lot so I went to my own bookshelf where I have several Steinbeck books (all unread), one being the Winter of our Discontent. I had started to read it in high school years ago but never finished it. I found The Winter of Our Discontent to be interesting and thought provoking. If you're thinking about whether to read it or not, my suggestion is read it. I think you'll find it worth the read."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Although the title portends a setting of bleak winter, the main plot activities take place in the heat of summer. The winter of discontent resides metaphorically, in the soul of the protagonist. Steinbeck is in great form here, and his character development is superb, most especially with the two women in the novel, who are finely drawn, studied, mysterious, fascinating. The last couple of pages, while inevitable I suppose, were sort of a let-down, and the children in the novel beg a deeper exploration. But these are smallish concerns. This novel is a fine one, open & easily accessible if one is looking for a quick read, yet also filled with philosophy, symbolism, & enough \\"opaqueness\\" to withstand deep inquiries & graduate-level studies."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I read this book for American Lit in college. Since then, I have read it 3 more times. There is something about the main character and what happens to his life that is just so very....haunting."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck? Oh, right. Steinbeck. THE Steinbeck. I can imagine the man sitting in his study on the eve on his sixth birthday. He opens that letter from his publisher, or maybe James Dean. Whoever. It's the letter same letter he's receiving for the millionth time:::John, East of Eden was... It was... Gosh! I've just got no words, man. But then again, that's you're job. Really though, you've really done it this time, the pinnacle of your literary carrier. You're golden, now just kick back and have a martini, maybe give the kids a call. Anyway you can take it easy and die in peace \`cause I happen to know that Governor Schwarzenegger is going to make an awesome speech about you in like, 50 years when he adds you to the California Hall of Fame... ::Yeah maybe he's getting pretty old at this point, but he's a writer. He doesn't like playing bingo. He doesn't want to move to Florida and sit on his ass day, he wants to write, even if he's loosing steam.I think Steinbeck's biggest mistake with this book was simply writing some of the world's most brilliant literary fiction, beforehand and not afterward. He kindof sets himself up for some pretty rigorous criticism.Ethan Hawley, admittedly, is a pretty interesting guy. His wit matched with an offhanded and loving sense of humor keeps his interactions with anyone, and sometimes even anything (the cans of produce at the Marullo grocery store, the surreptitious jury of his own subconscious) upbeat with a jolly sort of humor that adds flavor to his constant moral introspections.The rest of New Barrytown though, I couldn't seem to shake the eerie feeling that I'd landed inside a really well written 1960's sitcom. Even Margie, the town floozy, seemed antiquated, repressed, compelled or bound by the book's own courteous tone. The whole reason I love Steinbeck so much is that he usually gives narrative priority to the modalities of commonplace human life before a book's higher social or political motivation. (in Cannery Row he spends nearly an entire chapter delineating mankind's prehistoric relationship with frog hunting) I felt that here, too often, I was getting \`American capitalism breeds immorality' smeared around it my face so much, I couldn't see though to what was actually going on, i.e. a portrait of life and money in a very interesting town.Long story short, it's a good read, but nowhere as good as some of his others. Unless you just have to have it all, I'd recommend first sampling the Grapes or the Mice or the Cans."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As one who loved The Grapes of Wrath and Of Mice and Men, I was excited to revisit Steinbeck after quite a few years. Reading this book was simply painful. I didn't like the characters, the prose seemed to drag, and it just didn't ring true. I never accepted the premise, that Ethan would change from a good and decent man to a deceitful one who turned on his friends and colleagues. Most of all, I didn't care what happened! There was the occasional brilliant phrase but I was so bored that I could barely appreciate it. I must have read a different novel than all of your other reviewers."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This price is OUTRAGEOUS for a Kindle book!!! It should be much less for one I can't even share with others!!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Winter of Our Discontent, Steinbeck's final novel, doesn't read much like early Steinbeck. But, contrary to many critics, that's not entirely a bad thing. A lot of early Steinbeck read like faux-Hemingway, and while the first couple chapters of The Winter of Our Discontent read like faux-Sinclair Lewis (at least he was imitating a better author by this point), after that he seems to find his own voice and later the stylistic similarities to his masterpiece East of Eden emerge...though by the end this is a rather unique novel, even among Steinbeck's own oeuvre.The Winter of Our Discontent follows Ethan Allen Hawley, a down-on-his-luck grocery store clerk who decides to put morality aside temporarily in order to gain wealth and power, after which he intends to resume his former incorruptible ways. But in the end he learns this is too high a price to pay and is nearly destroyed by it.Exceptionally well written (perhaps Steinbeck's best in that regard), and with fascinating, complex characters and an interesting story (if you stick with it, though it has its ups and downs), this is the kind of book that you feel like you need to read at least two or three times to fully get a handle on. But after my first reading, I'm provisionally rating it four stars and declaring it my second-favorite by Steinbeck, after only East of Eden. Skip The Grapes of Wrath and read this!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This novel is amazing. The way Steinbeck shows the thoughts of Ethan Allen Hawley is wonderful. The look into the human mind makes this book a classic."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This was my first Steinbeck novel and it was amazing. It real made me think about what I believe. It's so realistic and anyone that has opinions on life should read this book. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I have read a lot of Steinbeck books and this book is one of my favorites. I loved the Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden, but there was something about this book that made it my favorite. It might be because of the prose or the theme of the book,I really think it is the combination of the two. I think that it hits home with the middle class morality."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book was not the masterpiece that The Grapes of Wrath was in my eyes but it had its own charm and meaning that I feel shows the value of Steinbeck's writings. I thought the story was believable. I also think that the portrayal of the conflict Americans face when it comes to morals and values was also very well done. I do reccommend this book to both Steinbeck and non-Steinbeck lovers alike because it is an excellent and interesting read. I plan on reading it again a few years from now, only after I re-read the Grapes of Wrath again."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is one of the greatest novelists in American history and all of his work deserves reading. But The Winter of Our Discontent is far from his best work. Even his shorter works such as Mice and Men and The Pearl are better. The basic plot is trite and overdone in literature. A \\"good\\" man is tempted to compromise his morality for personal gain. The story itself drags as the characters spend a lot of time talking and musing. There is relatively little action. Even the ending is murky. Read it if you must, but read other works by Steinbeck first."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is easy to teach, but he's not much fun to read. \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" is over-laden with religious symbols and metaphors that have little meaning rather than to be just present. The plot seems contrived and artificial: the protagonist's transformation from saint to manipulator is too sudden, and isn't quite believable.Nevertheless, the main themes of this book -- the corrupting power of money, the diabolical ways of the rich, the sacrifices of good individuals -- are even more relevant today than they were fifty years ago."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This book didn't knock me out as did other Steinbeck works, but it had enough to say about double-dealings, the battle between contentment and seeking more from life, and social interactions to make it ring true. It is a comforting slice of life in a time that brought back memories to me of my own childhood, especially the views of a small town in the early sixties. The plot had some moments that threatened credibility and some of the characters were cliches, especially the cops, the drunk, and the banker who should come with his own evil music cues. Furthermore, I found Margie Young-Hunt to be a bizarre invention - a classy town skank who is embraced by the town's women as a trusted friend and part-time sooth-sayer and men as, well, a classy town skank, but she is arguably the most interesting character as well. The book picks up greatly towards the end after you suffer from a bit too much meandering and overly eager exposition. Not a starting point for Steinbeck, but a good place for further exploration."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I've read this book again and again, and each time I realize why this is my favorite novel. The dialogue, descriptions, and prose are so wonderfully constructed that the reader is left to ponder how John Steinbeck ever thought to write such a magical story. It's a tale of man's soul, of morals, of the mind, and of family. If you can find a flaw in this book, I'd love to hear about it. It's perfect."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is a genius and a master of the English language. Please make sure to include this novel on your list of 'must-reads'. It will not let you down."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I love this book. I am only 16 and still in high school and my incredable english teacher made us read of mice and men and I loved it so much i went and read this it is stienbeck is now my favorite author his work is just amazing if you have more than 2 brain cell you can grasp the feelings he is trying to express. my only problem is that every book he writes ends with every one dead? what is that about?"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Winter of Our Discontent showcases John Steinbeck's trademark understanding of human nature in a unique East Coast venue. My reading of this book was particularly well-timed; I was completing my education and job hunting. Ethan made me realize that the quest for money, power, and prestige is dangerous when it involves the sacrificing of one's happiness, morals, and values. This book is all about the danger posed by our society's defining success by monetary achievement. Human nature is funny: it is just when we achieve happiness and stability that we find something else to covet -- the endless cycle that makes so many unhappy when they reach their life's end."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"As an avid reader of Steinbeck's works, DISCONTENT blew me away. While lacking the development of a breadth of characters, as we see in EAST OF EDEN and GRAPES OF WRATH, Steinbeck really captures the human spirit in the character of Ethan Hawley.While not as descriptive in the same way as other Steinbeck novels, he makes up for this with great use of language. However, there is no lack of description, and one gets a true picture of what is going on. This book is a quicker read than other novels of similar size, such as THE WAYWARD BUS, and is well worth ones time. It is an incredible experience to see the mind of Ethan Allen Hawley at work."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The Winter of Our Discontent is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Had it not been for Steinbeck's already intimidating library of classics, this novel would have definitely gone down as one of the most important of the 20th century.The wit of part one is nothing short of amazing. I actually found myself laughing uncontrollably a few times, which is an extremely rare occurrence when it comes to good literature.Ethan is both one of the easiest to love and easiest to hate characters at different parts of the story that I've ever come across. The transition from honest working man to greedy businessman is done perfectly. His final confrontation with Mr. Baker was one of the most exciting climaxes in recent memory.The entire ensemble of characters alone would make this an instant classic. Steinbeck then goes as far as to create dozens of themes and potential discussions, all the while effectively making sure the plot was not forgotten.I can see how some would see it as boring at times. Part two goes much faster than part one, which is probably due to the plethora of off-topic discourses in the first part and the equal amount of dialogue in part two.I wouldn't suggest starting with this if you're trying to get into Steinbeck, but it shouldn't be the last title on your reading list. If it seems to drag on at times just stick with it. I will most definitely be reading this time and again."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This Steinbeck novel mesmerized me when I was young; it was my favorite \\"morality\\" book. But now that I'm older and I've read it again, I'm not so sure where it stands. I loved its cerebral but playful style, similar to Steinbeck's East of Eden, and I took as gospel the book's revelations about the ethics and reality of business. The story takes place in a small New England town, but it's meant to apply to the world at large.On a second \\"older\\" reading, I feel that I have discovered why this book is an \\"overlooked\\" classic, which makes me wonder how Steinbeck's acknowledged powerhouses - Grapes of Wrath and East of Eden - would fare on a second reading. The Winter Of Our Discontent is still cerebral and playful, it's still a good story, but now it seems too clever by half. It's almost as if Steinbeck tried to put The Great Game into a small town and it doesn't quite fit. The characters are clever and witty, but none of them, not even the main character, Ethan, is truly fleshed out. The characters seem to represent ideas rather than people, or they exist merely to advance the plot. People are divided into two camps: those in the know and playing the game and those not. Ethan is an exception; he is a good man who is aware of the game but stays out of it and protects his family from it. But the price Ethan pays for goodness is to be meek and almost poor. Once Ethan begins to feel pressure from his family to rise up from his ethical but lowly station in life, he decides to get in the game, and he plays like a master. Ethan doesn't overrationalize his decision, but he is quietly desperate, making it feel a bit false and overplayed to me, especially at the conclusion when Ethan's ambivalence overwhelms him (I can't say more about this without giving an important part of the story away). In other words, The Winter Of Our Discontent seems like an oversimplistic moral story with undeveloped characters. It wasn't as \\"deep\\" as I remembered. I wasn't able to know or like any of the characters; I could only follow the plot, which, as I said, is still interesting enough.Now I have the challenge of finding a new favorite morality story, one that is deep, true, compelling, and a great read. No, don't tell me about Ayn Rand! Any other suggestions?"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I probably would not have picked this book to read on my own. I was assigned it in an English Literature class at Santa Monica College. I loved it. It is timeless piece of literature. I give this book as a gift to anyone who has ever paid a fortune teller. It is a perfect example of how a seed can be planted. I give it 10+++++++++++++++."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"The moral decline of the nation is reflected in the inner struggle of Ethan Allen Hawley, resident of New Baytown, a sleepy New England town about to expand its tourist industry. Ethan, who lives in a house built by his forefathers, is a clerk in a store once owned by them. He has not lived up to the family fortune and promise, as a descendant of pilgrims, pirates and whaling captains. It seems as if he has found a sort of contentment, is in love with his wife, loving towards his two kids and spouting sermons to the canned goods in the early morning. &quot;A reflected cathedral light filled the store, a diffused cathedral light like that of Chartres. Ethan paused to admire it, the organ pipes of canned tomatoes, the chapels of mustard and olives, the hundred oval tombs of sardines.&quot; He has the Place as well, an escape where he can be alone and take stock. And he needs to take stock, because the pressures of others-- his family, the town banker who is plotting for the overthrow of the local government, and the town fortune-teller and promiscuous divorcee, Mrs. Margie Young-Hunt who has her designs on him as a &quot;back-up plan&quot; of sorts -- they all want him to desire more for himself. They want him to reclaim his family's fortunes, to pursue money and rise in position. Marullo, the owner of the store, tells him how business really works: &quot;'Business is money. Money is not friendly. Kid, maybe you too friendly--too nice. Money is not nice. Money got no friends but more money.'&quot; Within the same day, Ethan resists a bribe by a traveling salesman to switch his meat vendor and take a kickback, being told that &quot;everyone does it.&quot; Even his friend Danny Taylor, who is now the town drunk, holds himself in higher regard than Ethan because of his lowly position as store clerk.Between Good Friday and Easter Sunday, a plan begins to form in Ethan's mind to change his situation and the vague outline of it is slowly revealed to the reader. He wonders if he can have a short moral lapse, set the rules so ingrained in his being aside for a short time for a large, temporary gain. Will he be able to carry out the plan? Will he be able to live with himself afterward?Steinbeck's characters are interesting and memorable. Joey Morphy, aptly known as the Morph, turns into what he needs to be, often saying things he suspiciously &quot;heard from a friend.&quot; Then there is Margie Young-Hunt, who is indeed a hunter. She sets a bit of a trap for Ethan, who never trusted her despite her being close to his wife. He calls her a witch, and by the end of the book, I did wonder if she had cast a spell over him. Ethan's grandfather, Cap'n, has long since passed away, but to him Ethan still loudly recites the rigging of the ships in the harbor. He is also haunted by Aunt Deborah, whose moral fiber runs deeply ingrained in her nephew.This is a very different Steinbeck than Of Mice and Men or Grapes of Wrath. It is rich in its use of dialogue, with both interior and exterior conversations. This book is superbly written, complex yet a &quot;page-turner&quot; in its suspense. It is clear why it is considered an American classic."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Published in 1961, a mere year before Steinbeck received the Nobel Prize for Literature, *The Winter of Our Discontent* is the culmination and thematic summation of a Great American Author, the resultant craft of a man who, over the course of his career, concerned himself with the American Ideal and the American Reality, despaired at stagnancy and loss of character, and ever fought the rising forces of material obsession and moral capitulation; it is a masterwork, albeit a slow-going and rather depressing one at that. Steinbeck would never again produce a novel of this scope and social-penetration, nor need he try: along with *Grapes*, *Eden*, and a few other contestable entries, the man had made his mark upon the literary zeitgeist: with *Winter*, he had fulfilled his promise ten-fold, delivering a powerful fable of loss, despair and (potential) redemption.Ethan Hawley is a deeply troubled man. A Harvard graduate and veteran, he has settled for the path of (dis)contented mediocrity. Forced to work as a clerk in the store his father owned - and lost, due to shady speculations during World War II - Ethan continually ruminates inwardly on the past, the present, and the rather-dim looking future; he is haunted by the daunting specters of his wild, whale-hunting ancestors, an imposing legacy he feels inadequate to challenge; he endures beneath the crushing weight of perceived - and socially imposed - *failure*. The ghosts of the ancestral dynasty are ever on his mind, while the concerns of his immediate family threaten his strongly-inlaid yet increasingly fragile moral bedrock - for his wife and children resent the poverty of the Hawley misfortune, the wife constantly giving subtle hints as to her personal shame, unable to \\"hold her head up high;\\" and the children, pining for the creature-comforts the productive 50's began to bestow (a television, new car, etc.), which the lack of solvency denies them, begin to slide into pubescent angst and experiment with the relative-morality ethic seemingly prevalent everywhere beyond the Hawley domain.In a sense (as several of the negative reviews on this page have pointed out), one feels Steinbeck has crafted a too-perfect foil in Ethan: he is almost *too* good, *too* straight-laced, and thus a rather \`easy' contrast to the various corrupting forces the author perceived in the United States - and wished to combat, via the artistic craft. And yet, and yet... there is more than enough psychological meat in the text to justify the technique. Ethan's character is complex, and complexly drawn - the reader is given the clues, well early on, that the seed of temptation actively writhes to undermine the protagonist's staunch moral code; the presentation of such is done in a way both obvious and yet subtle, for we know what will happen but wonder (and hope) that events might force these carefully-laid plans awry. Nearly the entire novel can be thus seen as a slow, achingly certain capitulation of the primeval American standard - that is, honesty and self-reliance, coupled with integrity - and the key, then, is in making the main character likable and sympathetic in his torment. And Steinbeck succeeds marvelously, not only in Ethan but in those around him, who alternatively tempt, encourage, repress: Mary Hawley, the loving yet anxious wife; his son Allen, already succumbing to the irresistible forces of corruption; bank-manager Baker, epitome of fat-cat syndrome; Danny, the childhood friend-turned-alcoholic wastrel; and Margie, the most vivacious and vividly-drawn, the fallen-woman & town comfort, grown desperate as the years march on... Steinbeck has the way, as with all masters of word-smithy, to fashion a character within the space of a few lines, and make them seem *real*: someone you've seen before, or perhaps known intimately.Again, I stress that *Winter* is not an easy read: the phrasing is deliberate and dirge-like, alternatively evocative and experimental (~while avoiding the excess of stream-of-consciousness); the atmosphere of New Bayton - and Ethan's inward ponderings - is gloomily suppressive, a miasma of failure, discontent, addiction and existential angst. Even as the time-table of the novel enters into spring, then summer, the cold shadow of *Winter's* desolate, desperate themes linger on. No, not an easy read - but, in passages, a beautiful one, and well worth the effort undergone. It is Steinbeck's final masterwork, a thousand-year gaze penetrating the cozy illusions of the fifties and accurately predicting the turmoil of the upcoming Aquarius decade.Five Stars."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"John Steinbeck is one of those writers who get in your face, who engage you in passionate conversation, if not downright argument, almost as soon as you turn the first page. I read this book in a paperback version, printed in 1962, whose dogeared cover featured an angry young man in tie and shirtsleeves, seated; a sleazy cigarette-smoking blonde, standing behind him with her arm over his shoulder; and another woman, younger and more wholesome, profiled in the rear. I loved this book and found it laughable at the same time, and the fact that I couldn't wait to finish it and write this review is, I think, a testimonial to its singular kind of greatness.What kind is that? The greatness of perversity. Although Steinbeck meant this book to be a stern-browed statement on How We Live in America, Today -- as if tomorrow would never come -- forty-odd years later \\"Winter\\" is a remarkable antique, a pitch-perfect evocation of its much-ballyhooed era. Here are all the usual fifties tropes: neighbors all knew and spoke to each other, every kid had a mom and a dad, families stayed put for generations, corner bank, corner grocery -- and here is Steinbeck happily blowing them all to smithereens, reveling in the locals' hypocrisy, corruption, and xenophobia, having a splendid time steering his virtuous hero -- one Ethan Allen Hawley, something of an UberW.A.S.P. -- around various tempting and lethal shoals, pullling off a grandstanding switcheroo ending in which the hero's fate remains unclear till the last sentence.So why was it laughable? Because Steinbeck's ripsnorting righteous exposure, of course, is as worn-out as the plasticated happy-days delusion it condemns. \\"Winter\\"'s world is deader than Dickens, buried under so many layers of historical effluvia -- electronics and mass media, computers, feminism, relativism in all its forms, the end of the Cold War -- that even those old enough to remember those times groan aloud over this Ozymandias of a novel. Was there really a time when a man could talk nonstop in graduate-level literary references to a wife who appeared to have the I.Q. of a chipmunk? After I identified the 13th Shakespearean nugget in the one-sided banter of overeducated Ethan and his acorn-brained wife, I found myself wondering whether the right medication might have made Steinbeck more ready to edit himself (for the record, I doubt it). Would the nation snatch up as an instant celebrity a fourteen-year-old boy who'd won honorable mention -- honorable mention! And one of five at that -- in a patriotic essay contest? Was there actually, and did I live in, a time when the federal government would -- on an anonymous tip -- dispatch agents to hunt down one -- one! -- illegal alien? (I must admit I bonded at once with the grocer Marullo. He was after all the only ethnic in the book, and like Steinbeck's diverse Californians magnificently rendered). And was there ever a town mattress as friendly and presentable and prescient as Margie Young-Hunt? Why, this gal sleeps with every man in town, from the not-so-picturesque local drunk to the police chief, and no doubt the dogcatcher; and upstanding Ethan and his doe-eyed wife leave their CHILDREN with her for the weekend.Steinbeck's rendition of the Hawley children -- actually teenagers -- remind me of Timothy Leary's remark, made in the early 70s: \\"the genocidal hatred of a generation for its young.\\" Allen and Ellen Hawley are nasty brats, but their parents barely seem to notice their existence, and when they do, it is mostly to plot an escape from the troublesome offspring. There is, throughout the novel, an almost palpable antipathy on the part of Ethan Hawley toward his son. Allen is unpromising, to say the least, but one wonders what he and his sister might or might not have been, if someone had bothered to love them, or at the minimum make their acquaintance.The tight-lipped coldness of these people ... UberW.A.S.P. is an understatement. These people eat ham and cheese with butter AND mayo, they wash down onion sandwiches with bottles of milk. Ethan Hawley drinks a martini and straight away praises the brew as a \\"sacrament.\\" Here we have men and women who don't argue; they just fold their lips like Jo in \\"Little Women\\" and retreat into another room, or a drunk night. By the ethos of this novel, or that of the culture it purports to represent, it is better to be drunk in public than to display sober emotion. In some ways, Steinbeck's New Baytown's as exotic as Bhutan.The book works anyway, and I repeat I loved it, in large part because Steinbeck took such loving and inspired effort in its construction. Hawley's genealogy, the DNA cross he must carry, is its own potentially fascinating, if not entirely original, story. His motives and actions are consistent, as well as psychologically sound. The narrative/P.O.V. switches are seamless, and in fact I barely noticed the shifts from third-person to first and ] back again. While in good old reliable Steinbeck the reader always knows where he/she \\"is\\" -- no somersaults in time, no leapfrogging back and forth in the mode of Joyce or Conrad -- those who seek will discover envelope-pushing aplenty. Withheld information, delayed description, shell games with various characters, all testify to Steinbeck's monumental storytelling power. Dated and ridiculous as \\"Winter\\" may be, the novel is not about its setting in space and time. Ethan Hawley may be an annoying and motormouthed snob, but the reader wants to like him, wants him to end with some money in his pocket and some pride in his arid heart. Steinbeck, the writer, gets into your face; his characters creep deeper, and stay there."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"When John Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1962, many felt that this book was what reminded the Prize committee of Steinbeck's greatness. Like all of his books, short stories and non-fiction journalism, this is very well written, has developed characters who readers will recognize and presents a useful moral at the end. This might be his most modern and recognizable story, however.Ethan Hawley is the well educated scion of a prominent Long Island family that has fallen on hard times and has lost its place at the top of society. Ethan is known throughout the community for his honesty and integrity, but there is pressure from everyone--his family, his boss, friends and local big wigs--for him to sacrifice his morales to earn a better living and make a name for himself. As he struggles with the temptation of a big pay day, he develops a plan which will destroy his own standards of decency, but will elevate his family back into the prestigious position he thinks they deserve.The story is well told and engaging, plus it gives readers a great opportunity to decide whether the modern society Steinbeck sees is really worth the price it costs. I would highly recommend this book to Steinbeck fans or people who enjoy good writing and stories that make them think."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Had Steinbeck not also written such works as Of Mice and Men, East of Eden, as well as The Grapes of Wrath, Winter of Our Discontent would be a much better known book. On par with the books previously mentioned, Winter is an engrossing study of a man and his society. The story focuses on a middle-aged man and his family, a family that used to have much greater financial and social status. He is an honorable and philosophical man, who must wrestle with the loss of status and the obvious hypocrisy he sees around him. We watch his character gradually change as he questions himself, planning acts and then questioning them. We see as highly charged an emotional moment as Steinbeck ever wrote when, during a confrontation, our hero informs his adversary that \\"You'll feel better, sir, when you have got used to the fact that I am not a pleasant fool.\\" His children show the two possibilities for America moving forward. This book is worth serious study."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"If you were forced to read \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" in high school, and a few years have passed, it's worth going back in for another read. The story is an American classic. A common grocery store clerk, Ethan Hawley, is shamed by his lowly status in a small town where his family name was once held in esteem. Believing that wealth and power will bring back that respect, Ethan sets in motion a series of events designed to return affluence to his family and political power to himself. Of course, the scheme has its victims, including those against whom Ethan is seeking revenge, and ultimately Ethan himself.Published in 1961, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" was Steinbeck's last novel. Some may criticize the book for its lack of subtlety. To be sure, the key theme -- the moral corruption of America -- surfaces throughout the novel's pages, and permeates many of its characters. While it may be true that Steinbeck avoided his usual nuance in crafting this story, to me this doesn't take away from the enjoyment of reading it."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Having read much of Steinbeck in my youth, I lately read one book I missed. Wow. This is a masterpiece in my view. Put it on your list, for sure. You will probably reread the final couple of chapters. You can also write your own ending."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"After writing East of Eden, JohnSteinbecks productivity in writing fiction tailed off. He seemingly had said what he wanted to say in his fiction.The novel about modern france was one of his weakest but he rebounds with his best post Eden novel, The Winter Of Our Discontent. Ethan Hawley is the clerk at a New England grocery store .The building once belonged to Hawleys family but the fortune has been lost andEthan s now a Harvard graduate working as a store manager. The scenario is rather implausible if you think about it a Harvard grad managing a small city grocery.However Steinbeck quickly gets you into Ethans mind and he does it in such a compelling you believe it. The story is about how motivated by a fortune predicted by a good friend of his wife leads Ethan to listen and pay attention to the world around him and conclude that ethics and morality do not mix well with business. Ethan does nothing illegal or criminal but he does things that are ethically and morally dubious. The last scene is deliberately ambivalent does Ethan kill himself or not In looking at moral poverty and how the consequences of being self aware of ones moral deterioratioc coupled by a desire for personal integrity for at one point it was Ethans most prized possession Steinbeck creates another 5 star classic if not as good as some of his other novels. I call it the weakest of his 5 star novels because of the implausibility I mentioned earlier but consider it a classic despite that flaw"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"This is a very easy read. Steinbeck lays a moral foundation through the characters and develops each of them well. He shows the weaknesses of humanity through the lens of the story. In a nutshell this is a very good, well written, story of hope and possibility despite decadence, greed and corruption within all of humanity."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I was strolling the bookshop at the Monterey Bay aquarium and saw that book that I hadn't read in many years. I am recommending it, because as a seasoned adult I was able to get a whole different reading experience from it, this second time around!"},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"In \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\", Steinbeck has us step into the shoes of an individual that I would guess is of a pretty rare breed: someone whose immediate ancestors had wealth, significance, & pedigree but all of which was recently lost, reducing this person to scratching out a living paycheck to paycheck. Ethan Hawley spends a lot of time deliberating on the greatness of his heritage and its contrast with his current situation as a grocery store clerk barely making ends meet for his wife and two children. In the course of the novel, Hawley devises a way to augment his finances even though by so doing he must justify a breach of his high moral standards. But as we learn, there's a price for everything...This is a really well written book that reads quickly. It has a more profound impact than its length of under 300 pages would indicate. I read this a couple months ago and the details are already fading, but certain scenes will remain with me I'm sure. The sad ending of course. The no-nonsense banker / businessman Mr. Baker discovering Ethan's plan. Ethan's last meeting with his drunkard old friend Danny. Ethan's foiled bank heist. A few others.In truth I'd give this 4.5 stars, if only because Ethan himself is a pretty annoying character since one can never tell if he's joking or serious. Everything else, very well done. Highly recommended. This is a serious book for adults, not light reading for kids or teens."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I recommend this book for numerous reasons; a good story, a good reflection and Steinbeck is a genious with words. This is a book written by a man with experience, one who has the ability to look backwards in his history and plumb the youth, to look forward into the mirror and see the inevitable changes time wroughts and to look future with hope and despair, in short Steinbeck's main character Ethan is a metaphor for the human condition and a glimpse into the man behind the words."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"Steinbeck had this book in a different fashion than I found the many others I read of his. I have always found him to be a literary god at creating character clashes (in each and every other of his I read). I loved how he had the characters interact. Althuogh this book was different. It was changed in that one character clashed with himself as much as everyone else&#8230; I was expecting maybe a lower personal ranking to his other books, but I found it just as good, and literally beautifully written. The book not only is fun to read (and im not that much of a reader) but I found its moral lesson very agreeable and useful to societies commonly immoral business habits.i suggest it to be read... though sometimes hard for some of us non readers to keep up with such deep thought, it is none the less a great read and understandable..."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I like this Steinbeck novel because it suggests ideas about morality, but requires the reader to further those ideas allowing the reader to form a relation with Steinbeck's ideas. I found this novel to be more insightful and thought out than a few of Steinbeck's other novels, notably Cannery Row. While Cannery Row and even Of Mice and Men pave a definite internal path for the reader, The Winter of Our Discontent allows the reader freedom to expand his or her mind on the ideas of morality standards and temptation.Overall, The Winter of Our Discontent reminded me of how much we, as humans, are saturated in a greedy, free-riding society. Steinbeck's story implies that maintaining one's morals within society is an impossibility, but the novel also challenges me, and other readers, to prove that wrong."},{"Title":"Winter of Our Discontent","review":"I loved this novel because of Steinbeck's mastery with images and words. Things like how he described the leaves of a tree that sprang too soon, too trusting of spring, only too be blown away when winter didn't quite leave. Or of using Easter and Resurrection to describe Ethan's transformation.I thoroughly enjoyed this Steinbeck's work of prose because of the way he described the inner conflict of Ethan Allen Hawley, using almost-perfect allegories and allusions.In a larger sense, Ethan's struggle to be true to himself while trying to improve his station is an allegory about America. This book reminds me a lot of THE GREAT GATSBY."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"This books is an incredible resource for modern couples who wish to establish and maintain a meaningful relationship. It is not filled with pop psychology \\"quick fix\\" solutions, but pragmatic advice that nurtures equality, respect, love and co-creation of a beautiful context for relationship.Three of the main premises of this book is the observation that successful couples tend to: 1) Feel all of their feelings; 2) Speak all of their truth; and 3) Honor all of their agreements. This is a simple formula, but as a psychology professional who talks to a lot of people I have found it to be effective, but difficult for many people in practice. Nonetheless, I agree with the authors that a healthy relationship is impossible without this foundation and I think the authors are correct to stress these points.I also like the discussion on withholding (lying by omission) and how this leads to eventual withdrawal and projection. This is not something most people like to look at, but a lot of problems are created by resentment that flows from unexpressed feelings and needs. This often gets unconsciously projected onto the partner or others and ultimately undermines the relationship. I give the author's credit for facing this dynamic squarely.The next section of the book talks about the nine traps of unconscious loving. This basically points out commonly occurring patterns in relationships that result from unconscious projection or being run by our internalized psychological scripts from childhood. It is useful because it will help you to identify unhealthy patterns in your relationship that may be unconscious. The invitation here is to uncover and examine dysfunctional beliefs that may be running you without your awareness.The section after the one above is called the seven steps to co-commitment. This outlines a practical approach to creating a great relationship together where no one is disempowered, co-dependent or acting from addiction. This section includes the three premises I mentioned at the beginning of my review and others such as learning to love yourself, claiming creativity, learning to live in a space of continuous positive energy, etc.The next sections of the book cover conflict resolution, positive communication and how to keep your past from intruding on your present. This book also contains useful activities and exercises that help you to practice and eventaully embody the skills that are discussed.This is a wonderful book for any couple. I recommend it very highly!"},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"No, nothing new. Which is precisely what makes this so good. This is the stuff of time-tested common sense, the stuff of that inner voice of wisdom, the one that is always trying to steer you in the right direction, even as you kick and scream and resist, intent on remaining on the old path of repeated and repeated and repeated cycles. We repeat them until we learn the lesson. Resolve the dilemma. Solve the puzzle.If the Hendricks message is to be boiled down to one catch-phrase, it would simply be: \\"wake up.\\" It is not so much about change, as it is about living with our eyes open, fully aware (conscious) of why we do what we do, how we feel while we are doing it, and which way we will go next. Instead of moving through a fog, we instead make conscious choices.If we can add one concept to that catch-phrase, it would be the concept of accountability. Relationships, and not just romantic ones, tend to bog down most when we get busy issuing blame and pointing fingers. Hendricks proposes that we are all, each and every one of us, to be held accountable for our own lives. No victims, no martyrs. And co-dependents, out with you. A satisfying relationship is one that takes place between two people who make a 100 percent (each) commitment (nothing less will do or failure has room to enter) to themselves and to each other. It begins with a promise to be authentic to ourselves and to always tell what Hendricks calls \\"the microscopic truth.\\" Our lives are what we make them. And if we don't like our lives, well, it is up to each of us to make the necessary changes. We must be honest with ourselves above all, but we must respect our mates with utmost honesty as well. It is the only solid building block that holds up a strong and satisfying relationship.One might balk at the wrongs done us, and oh the pity parties we do enjoy, when we are lied to and cheated on and our backs wear the footprints of others. But consider how far one gets in improving that situation when busy whining \\"I'm a victim! poor sap me!\\" and when one instead takes a moment to consider: how did I manifest this? How have I taught others to treat me? Have I made my personal boundaries clear? Have I offered and insisted upon honesty? Have I rescued my mate from the natural outcome of his or her bad behavior, thus robbing them of a learning experience? Have I been true to myself and expressed how I feel? It is not about letting our mates off the hook for bad behavior; that's dishonest, too. We hold our partners fully accountable, too. But it is a realization that we are not merely innocent bystanders in the soap operas of our lives. The sooner we understand our own part in the drama, the sooner we can enjoy true intimacy and equality with a mate we value and who values us.I read this Hendricks' book as I recently read \\"Conscious Living\\" -- with relish. I like the idea of being accountable for my life; it keeps the reins for my happiness in my own hands, after all. And there is so much more to see and enjoy when I make a decision to live my life with eyes wide open. My beloved is sharing this book with me. We are each reading it with a highlighter in hand, noting what resonates. Much has been learned already. I look forward to what new levels we might reach in this most basic if not highest human longing -- to walk shoulder to shoulder with our best life friend, empowering ourselves and each other to be the best we can be."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"I have read and re-read this book and have found it to be the best book on building &amp; healing relationship I have seen. Clearly distinguishes the subtle ways we sabatoge our relationships, then sets forth a clear new paradigm of being conscious creators with powerfully concieved steps and commitments, and excellent exercises for transforming oneself and others from victim to creator inside close relationships. Well organized, Conscious Loving is a stand-out contribution. Just the simple step of constantly &quot;Claiming Creativity&quot; has made a huge difference in my relationships."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"After two divorces, it took reading this book to uncover the destructive patterns which plagued those relationships. &quot;Conscious Loving&quot; helped illuminate the underlying causes of those patterns so that I could lovingly accept responsibility, AND make new choices. My partner and I have both read the book and find that we are healing old wounds, and experiencing the deep intimacy we'd always craved -- but had never before achieved. I highly recommend that you keep a journal while you read this book to capture the revelations that are sure to follow."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"The book is good in talking about couple communication. They do a good job discussing principles in relationships as well as pitfalls/pitfall management. I think that their resolution of the intimacy/autonomy is correct, but I think that they oversimplify that dilemma itself. Only other problem that I have with the book is that they overemphasize parental influence and the need to go back to your past to solve unhealthy behavioral patterns. Their concept of &quot;co-commitment&quot; is interesting. What I find curious, though, is that they assume that it is simple to become &quot;co-committed&quot; and that couples are either co-committed or co-dependent (a little too black and white for me). If a couple has some unhealthy patterns, then that does not mean that they have a dysfunctional relationship (but according to them, the relationship would be dysfunctional). In their defense, I think they present extreme examples to emphasize their principles. They rightly promote the need for accepting responsibility for one's own actions but do not point out the impact of chemical imbalance and mood disorders."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"I am a psychologist and have read many books about intimate relationships, and this one ranks among the best. In addition, I recommend If It Hurts, It Isn't Love (Spezzano) and the Mastery of Love (Ruiz). These are among the best, in my opinion, because they are easy to understand, inspiring, and insightful. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"The Hendricks reveal the blocks to intimacy and happiness in human relationships. They expose problems as opportunities to explore our own blind spots. I have read this book several times over the last few years and give these methods complete credit for the joyous, fulfilling relationship I have had for the last three years. The book shows you how to be honest, take responsibility for yourself, and explore the core perceptions that sabotage your happiness. I have recommended this book to friends more than any other book I have read. If you want to get past your cycles of blame and pain, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"Without doubt, this is one of the greatest works I have read on the art of relationships and loving. This book (which I have read a number of times) emphasizes the beauty and necessity of telling the &quot;microscopic truth&quot; a value that we as a society are not taught to embrace. I believe that Gay and Kathy have successfully demonstrated what it means to be in a &quot;conscious&quot; relationship, as well as providing examples of the precise moment when couples enter into an &quot;unconscious&quot; relationship. You will find yourself easily wanting to read more as you apply their methods to your daily life and find that they work!"},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"This is one of the all-time greats, a book for people in relationship who have already done some solid work on themselves, and have a good amount of self-awarenessMany couples get caught in a cycle of unresolved conflicts and don't know how to get out of the anger and into intimacy. This book can help, by bringing attention to historical, often unconscious, forces that generate anger and resentment. If you are for cognitive solutions (changing the way you think), behavioral solutions (changing what you do), family dynamics (change anyone in the family and the whole system changes) or simple problem-solving, this book is not for you. There are other excellent books and methods for those approaches! A first part of couples treatment is determining which approach is right for that particular couple.Within many couples lives a tendency for \\"unconscious\\" loving. By unconscious loving the authors refer to people in relationship who tend to react to each other emotionally, without becoming aware that the emotions coming up have more to do with the past than the present.This book introduces the \\"upper limits problem,\\" in which couples on the mend encounter greater closeness than they're used to and then unconsciously sabotage themselves to restore old problems. This and other concepts are quite powerful, and are offered with methods to overcome them.The book has many practical exercises. The more intense ones are best done with a therapist, others can be done at home. In the first exercise, The Harmonizing Process, one member of the couple breathes consciously to a 4 count. The other watches and harmonizes his/her breath to the first. They take turns. After awhile, they sit side-by-side and place hands on each other's backs, close eyes, and do mutual harmonizing of breath. Try it. If it does not feel intense, try adding eye contact to the breathing. The exercise is designed by the authors to build a feeling of unity in the couple. I use this as a tuning-in exercise before difficult discussions.Practicing therapists and couples counselors will find this book offers solid ideas for practice. This book is best for couples where both people are willing to take responsibility for problems, and works less well when blame is prominent. Couples needing access to unconscious motivations and who need to work on projections will be helped by the approaches described here.The authors Hendricks are not to be confused with the other Hendrix, Harville, the couples therapist who emphasizes a method for discussing difficult topics."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"For those of us who are trying to create / co-create a deep, intimate, meaninful relationship, this book is an incredible resource.

It is worth your time."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"When I ordered this book, I did not realize that it dealt with love within marital relationships and not love in general, as in the book \\"Love for no reason\\" by Marci Shimoff, but nonetheless I was by no means disappointed once I got into it. I have learnt much from it - it provides material that I have not found elsewhere.We learn how to transform co-dependent relationships into co-committed relationships.Co-dependence is \\"an agreement between people to stay locked in unconscious patterns\\". Co-commitment is an agreement to become more conscious. When we are co-dependent, we do not have relationships but \\"entanglements\\". Co-dependence is \\"an addiction to control and approval\\". A co-committed relationship is one in which two or more people \\"support each other in being whole, complete individuals\\".In our quest towards achieving co-committed relationships, Gay and Kathlyn Hendricks take their basis in their own long-standing relationship. They too have had problems and issues and they here show us how they worked through them.There are three main patterns of behaviour seen in co-dependent relationships - withholding, withdrawal and projection. Withholding is \\"when you keep inside you things that should be expressed\\". Withdrawal is when \\"you pull back from contact\\". Projection is when \\"you attribute to another person something that is actually going on at an unconscious level within yourself\\".Examples are provided of unconscious deals made by those in co-dependent relationships: 1) Let's both agree not to look into certain areas of our lives 2) If you don't change, I won't either. 3) Let's focus our attention on alcohol (or food or drugs) instead of solving our problems. 4) If you do all the thinking, I'll do all the feeling.The authors identify six core commitments essential in transforming co-dependence.: 1) I commit myself to full closeness, and I commit myself to cleaning up anything in the way of my ability to do so. 2) I commit myself to my own complete development as an individual. 3) I commit to revealing myself fully in my relationships, not to concealing myself. 4) I commit myself to the full empowerment of people around me. 5) I commit to acting from the awareness that I am 100 percent the source of my reality (a basic one in my opinion). 6) I commit myself to having a good time in my close relationships.Moreover, three fundamental requirements are 1) Feel all your feelings 2) Tell the microscopic truth 3) Keep your agreements.The book is packed with psychological insights, or perhaps rather disclosures leading to such on the part of the reader, together with detailed information about how to work with oneself and one's relationships.We are given valuable questions to aid us in discovering what action to take to expedite the process of transforming our lives:1. What feelings have I separated myself from?2. What relationships have I felt incomplete?3. What do I need to do to complete them?4. What agreements have I broken and not cleaned up?5. What have I said I would do that I have not done?6. What have I agreed not to do that I have done?7. What communications have I left unsaid?8. What have I started and not finished?9. To whom do I owe money?10. Whom do I need to forgive?11. To whom do I owe appreciation?Part Two of the book is composed of useful activities for transforming your relationship.The authors provide a final insight: once you have begun to tell the microscopic truth to each other, saying what you want directly, and experiencing and expressing your true feelings, you may begin to see that all your issues are really one - how much positive energy can I handle? This matter of having difficulty in dealing with positive energy is gone into in detail throughout the book.To sum up, this is a well-written, deeply insightful book that will transform your relationship with your partner, if you read it and follow the authors' advice, carrying out the suggested techniques. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"This book has really helped our marriage.

How many times do they have to tell you how important it is to read the book? HELLO! I am reading the book. Stop telling me how and why it's so damn important that I read it. I get it! I bought it! I'm reading! You had me! So get on with it already! Man, did they just have to fill space or what? It's VERY frustrating. I'm sorry, I'm not 5, I don't need to be repeatedly told why I have to do this over and over and over and over and over and over again. This message is repeated in nearly every paragraph. Is there any meat to this book, or just a bunch of propaganda about how much I HAVE to read it and do it?! Can we just get to the POINT so I can do that? I'm trying, trust me, but I just can't get past HOW VERY DARN important it is to do whatever it is they can't come out with. Holy cow. I'm exhausted. If someone has an idea about a chapter I can skip to where the BOOK actually exists, please let me know. Otherwise, mine is free to someone with ENDLESS patience who needs to constantly be told how much they NEED to READ THE BOOK AND FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES. Nevermind what the principles are, you'll never get there."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"This book has caused the most growth I've experience in 43yrs. In tandem with the Basic Instructions Before Living Earth(BIBLE), I've not been more encouraged toward facing those 'demons' that have resided in me for so long; caused so much pain; damaged or ruin the lives of other people. It has been as a direct result of the techniques of the Hendricks, that I have faced the demon's of CO-DEPENDENCY...and have moved toward really living life to the fullest!! I have gained so much in a very short time. One of the best things about this paradigm shift, is that I can go back time and time again, to check and reinforce the principals and techniques...which makes me stronger and stronger! It has affected me in such a positive force that I've recommended it to not only friends and family, but to anyone I basically come in contact with - and being in the Career Counseling field and as a professional Musician, I come in contact with all types of people. And I just want people to KNOW...that any conditioning that causes &quot;us&quot; to limit our potential of being the very best that we can be as a &quot;human being,&quot; not only destroy's the individual, but our society as well!We MUST LEARN TO BE BETTER PEOPLE - LEARN WHAT CAUSES US TO ACT/REACT TO CERTAIN THINGS. LEARN TO BUILD &quot;HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS FOR OURSELVES, WHICH CONSEQUENTLY DEVELOPE &quot;HEALTHY CHILDREN!&quot;I started with the Bible, and I'm still in the Bible - now and forever. My next on-going project of self-assessment lead me to Stephen Covey's &quot;7 habits&quot;...from there, to &quot;Don't sweat the small stuff&quot; and now &quot;Conscious Loving.&quot; I feel like I've just come across some choice steak!My significant other and I were cresting to desolving our &quot;entanglement&quot;(as it were), I was fairly into the book...dealing basically with myself while trying to keep the relationship going, as Co-Dependent as it was. Then lights started coming on! I finally got her interested in the book; n! ot for me or us, but for herself! We're going into counseling now... as part of our Conscious agreement to a Co-commited relationship...not an entanglement!!! That's a positive about the relationship, but it's really about YOU, the INDIVIDUAL!! REALLY BEING THE BEST YOU CAN BE...REALIZING YOUR FULL POTENTIAL!Thank you so much for re-teaching me HOW TO LIVE!!"},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"I first read this book over ten years ago. Recently it has come up in my life again (I just sent this URL to a new \\"friend\\" :) ), and I just had to write a review to counter whatever the hell that \\"one star\\" is about.This book changed ME. I've been applying it's principles all these years - not just to romantic relationships, but to family, work, and everybody else. It not only freakin' works, but it will bring more personal joy to you IN GENERAL.The only regrets in the last ten-plus years has been the times I've forgotten these principles.They (Gay and Kathleen Hendricks) laid out the core of this book on their website, which I discovered today (when I sent the URL to the...guy..), and it pretty much is the book in a nutshell. Look under \\"about\\". www.hendricksinsitute.com. Thank you Gay and Kathleen!If you're far from the place they're asking you to be, you're not going to get it just from the web page. If you're searching and close, however, you'll get it right away - it's like epiphany after epiphany. In re-reading them, I was surprised at how many of the 7 Principles I have been applying (somewhat imperfectly) to this day.There are a bunch of exercises in the second half of the book, but that's never been my thing. If you're more of a kinesthetic (experience) learner, though, get the book because the exercises looked pretty good (I guess).Heavens, I don't know what else to say - except that this book and The Road Less Traveled are the only self-help/psychology books that I didn't think WEREN'T just a smattering of dressed-up common sense, padding, and bull.NinaPS:I know this is my first review. I swear I'm not a shill.

The terms 'conscious loving' and 'co-commitment, though they sound a little jargonish at first, turn out to be very meaningful in the end... 'Conscious' meaning that we don't go to sleep in the relationship department - ever - and co-commitment turns out to be the opposite to co-dependance, which if you don't know what it means then you would be well-advised to learn, before you abdicate your own sense of judgement in yet another doomed relationship."},{"Title":"Conscious Loving: The Journey to Co-Commitment","review":"This book describes the voyage from co-dependence to co-commitment.

Yet, no murders similar to those described in their book seem to have occured there or elsewhere.

The original text was completely based in fact with some dramatic license mostly in the dialogue. The murders were real, although some anachronisms were present. However, the book was basically rewritten by the publisher without the consent of the author and greatly fictionalized. Even worse, the publisher did a poor job of this, hence the comments that the kidnapping did not ring true. The book is still valuable for its insights into the moral dilemnas of doctor-patient confidentiality, if you ignore the obvious Hollywood intrusions of the misguided publisher."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I'm puzzled as to how this book can be described as non-fiction.

What more is there to a story beyond names, events, locations and chronology?The most infuriating aspect of the book was Dr Obler's obsession with remaining &quot;objective&quot;. I was puzzled as to what exactly he meant by &quot;objective&quot; and eventually reached the conclusion that for Dr Obler it was synonymous with &quot;very, very stupid&quot;. As the evidence began to mount that his client was a serial killer, Dr Obler valiantly and &quot;objectively&quot; pushed such thoughts from his mind.

The doctor claims to be operating under a high code of ethics, but then he turns around and writes this book for everyone to see. If this had been a true story, and I doubt that it is, someone was sure to recognise the identity of the killer. As far as I know, there was no killer even remotely resembling the &quot;soda pop slasher&quot;. Also, his repeated references to the female detectives &quot;red hair&quot; and &quot;long legs&quot; made this book read like a sub par fiction thriller. My advice to anyone interested in this book? Skip it and read John Grisham for real thrills or go to the NON-fiction section for some TRUE, true crime"},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I've read many true crime books. This is my first review. I'm writing it because this book is so terrible. Its the worst true crime book I've ever read. The best true crime books read like a suspense novel in that you follow the investigators as they search for clues as to who is the killer. You're interested because of the \\"solving the mystery\\" factor. Ann Rule used to write this way and Carlton Stowers is very good.In this book you are told from page one who the killer is.I actually agree with many of my fellow reviewers in that I think this book is fiction but because it would never sell as fiction it was falsely labeled as \\"true crime\\" to help sales.The real title of this book should have been \\"I am a guilt ridden psychologist who must protect the confidentially of my patient even if I know they are murderous serial killers and even if they attack my children, my financee and murder half a dozen people.\\"I'm not going to waste any more time on this book. It was HORRIBLE!!!I just keep thinking if the 9/11 terrorists had went to this guy and told him they were going to hijack 3 planes and crash them into buildings and showed them proof of this act they were about to commit....he would do the right thing and keep it a secret because of the honor of his profession.Then he would be praised by all his fellow psychologists.I think this so called \\"Doctor\\" is more screwed up than this serial killer.Why does anybody ever go to these seriously disturbed people for treatment I'll never know. I didn't mean the serial killer either.PS If you want to know my secret for finding the very best true crime books look at the back cover and see if it was chosen as a Book Club selection or see if the book has won an Edgar Award.Then buy it.This book I will sell used for penny. On second thought I think I'll throw it out the window when I'm driving tomorrow."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"This book was filled with so much speculation and fantasy that I had a hard time believing it was a &quot;true&quot; story. Psychologists do have a fine line to walk when it comes to confidentiality, but there are laws that mandate when a therapist should take precautions to enusre the safety of the public as well as the patient."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"Poor psychotherapy! Yet another book about a psychologist who is so screwed up it's impossible to see how he could help anyone. First of all, I don't believe for a second that this is a true story. The bad guy is standard sex killer fare. And if he's as bad as described, and a sociopath, there is no way he just suddenly as able to control his impulses - sociopaths have an extremely high recidivism rate. There are so many ridiculous things in this book. I'm pretty sure any therapist who treats patients has to have his own therapist, but this guy is apparently a total loose cannon. The group therapy session was laughable - people throwing each other on the floor and threatening each other physically? What kind of practice does this guy run? His ethical dilemma is confusing - he says he's almost positive the guy is the killer, and that he's allowed to report someone who is a danger to others. Obviously the \\"dilemma\\" is drawn out for the sake of writing this book. The dialog is clearly fictional, and that of his gf is so stilted I laughed out loud. The scene where he stares down the bad guy, and the scene where the bad guy said \\"you're the only one who can help me,\\" or cage him up, or whatever, was pure ego on the doctor's part. The funniest part was the scene where he kept talking about how much he missed his kids while he took them to a basketball game they didn't want to watch (but he did!) and thought about his patient the entire time. At the end he still missed his kids - no wonder, since he didn't pay the least bit of attention to them. His parenting throughout is abysmal. He doesn't seem to have any other patients. I could go on and on and on, but what a waste of time. The only reason I finished the book is because I wanted to see how much further into ludicrousness it would sink, and it sunk to the very bottom. This guy should lose his license, and be barred from writing another stupid book that makes therapists look bad. There really are therapists who are great. This guy is not one of them."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"As I read this book, I assumed that eventually Dr. Obler would resolve his inner conflict regarding patient confidentiality and turn his psychopath patient in to the police. I was horrified when I reached the end of the book and learned that he DID NOT! I find Dr. Obler's behavior despicable and his actions infuriating. The bottom line is this: Hiding behind the cloak of patient confidentiality privilege, this arrogant S.O.B. (I'm referring to the Doc) placed his career interests before that of protecting the public. While he &quot;struggled&quot; with his conscience, a half dozen people were murdered -- and all because he was afraid of losing a few patients. If I were seeing a therapist, and that therapist broke confidentiality with one of his/her patients becuase the patient was a SERIAL KILLER, I would commend the doctor, not &quot;fire&quot; him! I have a hard time believing this story is true. Dr. Obler should be in jail."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I gave this book two stars because of how dumb Dr. Obler was. Dr. Obler is a psychologist who is evaluating a new patient named Devon. During their sessions, killings start to happen. Dr. Obler expects Devon is the killer. Dubbed &quot;The Soda Pop Slasher,&quot; the killer used broken glass to cut up his victims. Dr. Obler had numerous chances to go to the police and tell them who &quot;The Soda Pop Slasher&quot; was. Instead, he chooses not to so he can keep his license as a psychologist. By doing this many more murders were committed by the slasher. In the end, in my own opinion, no one wins because this Devon person is still out there."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"The only thing I could conclude after reading this book was that they say truth is stranger than fiction, but, in some cases, truth is more stupid than fiction! Did Dr. Obler ever hear of an anonymous tip to police? Did he ever consider that the &quot;privilege&quot; he had with the killer did not extend to his family and friends who were also being tormented? How naive and arrogant can Dr. Obler be to even think that he has &quot;cured&quot; a serial killer? Just ludicrous!Having worked with violent crime victims for years, I can only say that instead of being praised for his ethical behavior, Dr. Obler should be shunned for his utter disregard for humanity."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"This book does seem more like fiction than non, but I loved it either way. It was a good read no matter how you look at it. The book had an interesting story line, and the fact that it was based on a true story made it all the more interesting, even if one doesn't believe it as truth. (...)"},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I thought this was a wonderful book because, aside from the moral issues involved, from the aspects of psychiatry, the intelligence in the method used to turn this psychotic individual into a non-murdering member of society is fascinating to say the least. Dr. Obler attempted to use the process of transference so that the subject could sublimate his homicidal compulsions into more productive activities. Considering how many of these people are loose in society, Dr. Obler did the right thing. I would probably feel differently of I was a close family member, however. I hope Dr. Obler writes many, many more books because this, in my opinion was some of the best reading I've done in a long time."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"The closest this comes to being a non-fiction work is if you could pass it off as &quot;docu-drama.&quot; And even then, it would be a pathetic excuse for docu-drama.The supposedly &quot;ethical&quot; headshrinker does things like:1. Fail to pursue commitment for a patient who is clearly a danger to others. 2. Fail to call the police and report a kidnapping and assault committed on the woman he supposedly loves by a patient who has been stalking her. 3. Brings a dangerous and unpredictable patient into a therapy group and unleashes him on the hapless patients who trusted him to provide them with a safe environment.He also interferes with a police investigation of brutal serial murders.All this is supposedly in the name of &quot;professional ethics.&quot;The author also misrepresents the idea of patient confidentiality. Professionals who are working with the same patient get releases all the time to discuss their findings with one another. There's nothing the least bit unusual or ethical about it. In fact, it's standard oprating procedure when taking on a new patient to request releases to get his records from anybody else who has treated or assessed him.The author is clearly hoping that he can bamboozle the reading public behind a phony wall of professional mystique.If this story is true, the author belongs in prison as an accessory to murder, and should be drummed out of the profession for inexcusably putting his ego ahead of his responsibilities to the patient and to the public."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"While it is extremely questionable that this book is non-fiction, it manages to fail either way. If it is, indeed a true account, the author's \\"ethical and moral dilemma\\" is the result of his own fuzzy morals. He is content to chat weekly with a man who appears to be killing folks in his spare time, that is, between \\"therapy sessions\\" with Dr. Obler. His overconcern with patient confidentiality and \\"loyalty to his patient\\", overide the long standing requirement that therapists have to report such knowledge. Not until the probable killer seems to be focusing on the good doctor's family does Obler suddendly decide to reconsider his ego-driven moral stance. By then, numerous people have perhaps needlessly died, at the hands of a monster. If this is a work of fiction, instead of \\"A true story of professional privilage and serial murder\\", as advertised on the book jacket, then it is contrived and sappy. It contains such laughable content as, \\"a steel edge in my voice\\" and \\"I gave him an approving smile\\", which underline the need Dr. Obler has to embellish his standing and status in the field. This from a therapist who passively conspires with a sick patient, while striking up a romance with another patient who came to group therapy to save a relationship. All in all, though, it may be worth it to purchase this book, especially for aspiring writers or therapists. It is good primer as far as technical and ethical pitfalls that should be avoided if one is to be succesful and honest."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"Dr. Obler comes off as condescending even though he's not a very astute judge of character and apparently has some codependency issues. He's not at all suspicious when a charming weasel of a colleague calls to pawn off a suspected serial killer patient. Instead Obler has such faith in his skills (keep in mind there is no cure for psychopathy) that he eagerly takes up the challenge.It was very frustrating to read this warped incoherent account. From the background descriptions the story seems to shift decades every now and then. Despite glaring evidence Obler just can't be sure that his patient, Devon, is \\"really\\" a serial killer. Obler becomes obsessed with their \\"relationship.\\" Devon it becomes his raison d'etre. Obler sits back and watches with what appears to be depraved indifference, or schadenfreude, as Devon commits one murder after another. Obler's only concern seems to be getting inside Devon's head and learning how to win his respect. Obler continues to use the excuse of his doctor-patient confidentiality for not turning in his favorite patient, his alter ego. In fact, such is the doc's affinity for Devon that even when he starts accosting and threatening the doc's family he still can't bring himself to make that anonymous call to the police or have one of his family members do it, since they're not bound by any confidentiality rules.It appears that the hackneyed detective (i.e. she's beautiful but tough as nails GAG!) also suffers from room temp IQ syndrome. When Obler comes to her like a schoolboy asking; \\"just suppose the killer really were a patient of mine?\\" she manages to figure it out. Well, who wouldn't? She gets in his face and confronts him, which probably wasn't a bright idea given Obler's protectiveness of his patient. Sidekick, Obler of course sticks to his \\"confidentiality\\" guns and doesn't dare rat out his murderous patient. It never occurs to our hard boiled detective gal that since she has a basic description of the guy all she has to do is have someone stake out the doc's office to find this guy.In the end we witness the doc's righteous indignation when the police finally arrest the wrong man. Well, actually his concern appears not to be that the wrong man is going to prison or that several people were murdered with his with his passive complicity but the realization that now he'll never get rid of Devon. At this point the honeymoon stage of the relationship (the excitement and thrill of the mystery killings) has worn off and Dev has become a real pest.If you are looking for a good psychodrama novel to read I suggest William March's The Bad Seed (not the movie) or some Dean Koontz novels. I also recommend (non-fiction) Without Conscience: the disturbing world of the psychopaths among us by psychologist Robert D. Hare."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I just finished reading Fatal Analysis. I am an PhD Candidate in Counseling and have been studying forensic psychology on my own for quite some time. Dr. Obler's story certainly appears to me to be fiction. I hope so. His \\"ethical issues\\", while they must be recognized, are certainly not meant to straight jacket our own common sense. A creative shrink can always find an indirect way to pass on life preserving information. As for his relationship with his \\"girlfriend\\", our ethical standard is to never date or have a sexual relationship with a client past, present, or future. If a professional counselor chooses to after therapy has been terminated, the standard waiting time is no less than two years. But again, it is strongly discouraged for many reasons, primarily for the mental health of the ex-client. In addition, what is his motive to now come forward and admit all this? I see no other rationale except financial gain. And for anyone who has done any serious study in forensic psychology (and I'm the first to admit I'm not specialized but I am not without substantial education in that field), the current understanding supported by masses of major research is that the type of sadistic sex killer Obler describes cannot be controlled outside of confinement or death. They are, in fact, the worst of the worst. If this story is true, which I doubt, I have absolutely no doubt that the soda pop slasher has killed many times since his last confrontation with Dr. Obler."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"Let me get this straight--Dr. Obler allowed his patient to threaten his children, stalk and break into his fiancee's apartment, exposed his other patients to a serial killer in group therapy and he wants to be the HERO of this tale? Please! Most ludicrous of all is that he expects readers to believe he somehow convinced a vicious psychopath to stop misbehaving and become a lawyer! How did this book get a non-fiction classification? If this book is even half true, than Dr. Obler needs, at the very least, to have his license revoked. At most, he needs to be prosecuted for obstruction of justice. He also owes an explanation to the families of all the victims that were murdered while he was protecting his professional reputation."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I agree with all of the points made in Christina Dunigan's review above and would only like to add the following:1. In addition to the other ethical violations articulated, the protagonist of the book casually mentions that he met his present girlfriend when she and her then fiancee came to him for treatment in connection with a sexual problem. Somehow, she ends up dumping the fiancee and dating the therapist. If this is really \\"non-fiction,\\" the New York Medical Ethics Board should look into the facts of that matter as well.2. The protagonist's belief that the therapist/patient privilege would be sufficient to quash a subpoena for his records is not credible. After the therapist discloses to the police that he knew that the slasher's female victims had their vaginas sewed with surgical thread, any judge who wanted to stay on the bench would have compelled the therapist to disclose the name of the patient who disclosed that information to him.3. How is it exactly that the therapist reasons that it would be an ethical violation to disclose the identity of a serial murderer/rapist/kidnapper to the authorities, but it there is no dilemma involved in writing a book about the entire matter for his own financial gain? Perhaps this is addressed in the later chapters of the book -- I had to stop reading when the protagonist failed to report his girlfriend's kidnapping to the police.... The ONLY reason I bought it is that it purported to be a non-ficition or true story. It's too implausible even for fiction."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I was attracted to this book for its alledged non-fiction psychological slant to serial murder. Instead I got a fictional hero who was neither the self proclaimed keeper of all professional ethics nor a brave hero. It was a semi thriller but not credible. This doc not only kept his therapy confidential, but allowed disturbing criminal behavior to occur before his eyes and to his most beloved people. Beyond believe. Call it fiction and leave it at that. Illogical fiction but totally fiction. Check the book out of the Library and leave it at that."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"I cannot imagine that this stuff really happened-- and if it's pure fiction, it is not very good. Is this, perhaps, a new marketing ploy? Take a third-rate novel and claim it's true to attract readers?"},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"If you believe this book, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to sell you. How could the good doctor parade his ignorance before the public like this? He keeps getting dumber and dumber as the story progresses. I think Devon actually killed him and took his place."},{"Title":"Fatal Analysis","review":"As a person with a Master's Degree in Forensic Psychology, and who has worked with several violent offenders, I am greatly disturbed by Dr. Obler's book. His ultimate decision to sacrifice innocent victims rather than risk his career is morally reprehensible. Certainly it is more repugnant to allow a murderous psychopath to remain in sociey than to break doctor-patient confidentiality. My suggestion to Dr. Obler would be to research the Tarasoff case, where the Supreme Court ruled that if a therapist reasonably believes or should have reasonably believed that the patient is going to kill someone, he/she has a DUTY to report what the patient has discussed with him or her.My hope is that this story was just sensationalized for publication. If this is the standard moral caliber of forensic psychologists, who make decisions regarding whether a person is dangerous to society, I think I might consider pursuing another career."},{"Title":"PATTON AND HIS THIRD ARMY","review":"The inaccuracies are certainly due to the close proximity of Gen. Wallace to Patton and the fighting instead of Eisenhower and the grand decision making. Overall, it is a quick read and very interesting. Since it was written in 1946, it definitely preserves a lot of the genuine feel of the times (Germans are referred to as Heinies) and depicts the general American attitude toward the Germans at the time of war. There are definitely more comprehensive studies out there, but this 200 page book addresses from the ground level the entire life of the Third Army and is definitely a great intro to the topic."},{"Title":"PATTON AND HIS THIRD ARMY","review":"THIS BOOK COVERS PATTON IN DETAIL ABOUT HIS LOVE FOR HIS BELOVED 3RD ARMY.IT SHOWS HIS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE GERMAN ARMY.HE KNEW THE BEST WAY INTO GERMANY.HE HAD A GENERAL ABOVE HIM THAT WAISTED TIME ON BRITISH GENERAL MONTGOMERY.ITS SAD THAT HE PAST AWAY SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR.CHUCK PRIDGEN"},{"Title":"PATTON AND HIS THIRD ARMY","review":"General Wallace's memoir of Patton and the Third Army was released quickly, in early 1946.The first edition of 1946 was published by Military Service Publishing Co: hardcover in cloth with dustjacket; 231 pp. With a fold-out map, about 9 other maps, photographic illustrations, and 7 Appendices."},{"Title":"PATTON AND HIS THIRD ARMY","review":"This book will never pass muster as a \\"serious academic work\\" because of who wrote it [a key staff officer] and because there's no criticism of Patton. But, of course, that is also why is is so important. It's a validation of his leadership qualities, why he was the most effective field general since Grant, perhaps surpassing Grant in that category. [To those who don't know, Sherman, no slouch himself, praised Grant as Napolean's better at that level of command, and his comments are on very solid ground.]The book is a \\"fresh\\" view, written in warm blood, just slightly cooled from battle. It's a good insight into leadership qualities and the impact and resulting response on those who were led. It's a \\"real\\" account of why the 3rd army performed so well [but doesn't pretend to be the whole story]. Clearly the author is not 'objective', NOR SHOULD HE BE. This army was one of the best in history because of one man, and to see the effect of his leadership [on this level of that army] is a valuable insight and lesson.It's also a limited perspective on the rather mediocre strategic leadership above the 3rd Army."},{"Title":"Epic Proportions - Acting Edition","review":"When I'd heard reviews of this play during its Broadway run, most reviewers either loved or hated it. It's not as bad as has been said, and actually reaches into hysterical in many points. It tells the story of 2 brothers who come to be extras on a Biblical epic [filmed] in the 30's in the Arizona desert, and end up both falling in love with the Assistant Director in charge of the extras, and become the director and star of the movie, \\"Exeunt Omnes\\". The 3 principals are supported by an ensemble of 3 actors who play everyone from an Egyptian Dancing Girl to Executioners to Hollywood costume designers. I would have to rate this script high for performability and for the humor in it. The characters are written strongly, and have very distinct personalities, and the story is entertaining, with some interesting absurdist touches, and I would recommend this to anyone who likes a sly comedy that can be outrageous at the same time."},{"Title":"Epic Proportions - Acting Edition","review":"This is truly a wonderfully written and hilarious comedy. It's a very short play, performing at around an hour and fifteen minutes, but every moment is packed with laughs, action, romance, suspense or pandemonium.Briefly, the play is about an epic movie being filmed in the desert of Arizonia in the 1930's. Two brothers, Benny and Phil become extras on the set and both fall in love with Louise, the Assistant Director of Atmosphere Personel. Everything that can go wrong pretty much does. Toss in a lot of scene-stealing secondary characters like a prima-donna Queen of the Nile, a psychotic special effects man and a Coco Chanel-type costume designer and there's nothing but great stuff going on every second.The writing is excellent and flows very well. There are lots of great one liners and many terrific repeating gags that just get funnier and funnier. Brilliantly, the writer never pushes these more than the magical number of three times. If I had to compare it to something everyone might know, it's similar to what you would get out of Mel Brooks, only cleaner. There is a little cursing but it's easily left out if desired.This is a light, fluffy comedy. There are no morals or meanings. It's just a sit back and enjoy the chaos kind of event. And for those of you who like happy endings, it does have one. Louise is delightfully matched with one of the brothers and things work out well for everyone. (With the exception of the other Assistant Director. However, as he is the mean character in the show, I don't think anyone cared very much.)From experience, I know that our audiences loved it. I have also heard that some schools have done it for competition one-acts with great success. In order to keep the momentum, we chose to perform without an intermission, which I also feel worked well.I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a light comedy."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],q={key:0},W={key:1};function R(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",M,[(t(!0),a(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",W,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const D=u(E,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-389c6907"]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/56.md","filePath":"people/56.md"}'),B={name:"people/56.md"},P=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{F as __pageData,P as default};
