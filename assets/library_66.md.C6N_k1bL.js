It not only taught them about medicine in the past, but also the struggles one has to face in life. The world is a big place, filled with many possibilities. Overall, a wonderful story :)"},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Shadow of a Bull demonstrates the need for young people to follow their own dreams rather than the dreams placed on them by parents or other adults.This has been a favorite of mine for many years.--Marge"},{"Title":"Shadow of a bull","review":"Spain's ancient fascination with bulls can be seen in the Celtiberian bull sculptures in Guisando, Avila, which are thought to be made in the second century BCE. Practiced by many ancient cultures, bullfighting became an integral part of Iberian culture, and was immortalized to Western audiences by Ernest Hemingway (Death in the AfternoonandThe DANGEROUS SUMMER).Polish author Maia Wojciechowska held numerous fascinating jobs including an undercover detective, a motorcycle racer, a translator for Radio Free Europe, and finally, as a female bullfighter, and Hemingway said that Maia knew more about bullfighting than any other woman, so she is amply qualified to take on the immense task of making Spain's bullfighting culture and history accessible to a younger audience.In Shadow of a Bull, originally written in 1964, Manolo Olivar is the young son of the famous torero Juan Olivar, who was fatally gored by a bull. Juan was the most famous matador in Spain, bringing glory to the small town of Arcangel, and now everyone expects Manolo to fill his shoes by becoming an equally talented bullfighter. The book has aged well, and minus any references to computers or cell phones, could take place today.Except Manolo has a major problem: he's a coward and hates the very idea of bullfights. This would actually be funny, if it wasn't such a serious matter in 1960s Spain. A man's honor was of utmost importance, and to be labeled a coward when you're the son of Spain's most famous matador...Manolo secretly wishes to study medicine, but is forced into digesting hours of bullfighting history and technique and practicing bullfighting moves with young bulls in secret (it's illegal to practice on bulls before they enter the ring for the first time). He's so traumatized by this that he wakes up screaming at night, but he knows that he can't disappoint the entire town by bowing out of his first corrida.Shadow of a Bull is about bullfighting; not the gore, perhaps, but the skill, the delicate moves of a talented matador, the history behind its traditions and the large role it plays in traditional Spanish culture. Wojciechowska makes these numerous small details fly by without becoming bogged down in technicalities or minutia, even for someone like myself who has no experience with bullfighting (as a vegetarian, I refused to attend bullfights, either in person or televised, the two times I lived in Spain). A glossary of bullfighting terms is also included as a handy reference, and the text has a sprinkling of Spanish expressions.Manolo's story is a common enough one of an adolescent struggling to find his place, to live up to his father's reputation, and to discover his path. He is a likeable enough protagonist, although more aggressive boys who read this will likely label him a sissy (or worse).More importantly, Shadow of a Bull is a priceless travelogue on 1960s Andalucia, of the quirks of small-town life in rural Southern Spain (the endless gossiping of old men who do everything together), of flamenco and fiestas and dry, hot summers punctuated by bullfights. This was still the period when Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist, and the town's poverty is a testament to those lean years (for maximum historical value, read Shadow of a Bull at the same time as James Michener'sIberia, also written in the 1960s, for a comprehensive overview of life in Spain under Franco).Fans of bullfighting and Spain will enjoy this book, although it is more about the moves and pomp and circumstance rather than action inside the bullring. Wojciechowska draws a riveting portrait of a typical Andalucian town captured in time, and of one boy's struggle with who he is expected to be and who he is that still speaks to modern readers."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"Have you ever had that feeling when you try to like something so much and you try and try and in the end you feel disappointed? That's exactly what happened to me with \\"The Second Assassin\\".I love II World War fiction, after reading the previews for this book I was sold. The book has a great sense of people and places, you are transported \\"there\\", there is no question that Hyde's research is top notch, the attention to detail is unbelievable. But the plot moves to slow, it fails to engage the reader, you find yourself reading to finish the book rather than because you are enjoying it.Summarizing, an OK book that could have been much better."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"If ever fiction depicts history in truth, this tale does it! Christopher Hyde's amazing research gives him material for an eye-opening story about the royals in the pre-War II era and politicians who have been awarded loyalties that may never have been deserved. Because of the details, he takes readers through every moment of the taunting tense-wracked plot with a camera's precision. Many Canadians will be disheartened to read the common characterization of their beloved Queen Mum who finally passed away this year, but the representation sounds like the most truthful insight into a family that is now seen as quite dysfunctional. From my own research for my Second World War novel, I was appalled to see how callously Churchill and King George VI dispatched his real cousin--a young woman--on a fool's mission to bring the nuclear scientist, Niels Bohr, out of Denmark and her subsequent betrayal, capture, torture and supposed death. Thus, I believe the picture Hyde paints of the conspiracy to assassinate the young king and queen on American soil to deter the U.S. from helping Britain and entering into the war against Hitler. What's more appalling is that men like Lyndon Johnson, Allen Dulles and old Joe Kennedy supported and were involved in that conspiracy, and had it been successful, how different everyone's lives may be today. \\"The Second Assassin\\" gives weight to the theory that there was a second shooter at Kennedy's assassination. Since Hyde's use of historical facts to bear out this earlier attempt, it makes sense that men who had the stomach to do it once were capable of such treachery again--particularly when history finds that Johnson was responsible for escalating the Viet Nam war when Kennedy had made it clear he was going to wind it down. To think that Allen Dulles actually went on to lead the CIA is absolutely chilling. It also makes you wonder about whose God and country our military lay down their lives for. After such research and disillusionment, it is difficult not to become very cynical about our political leaders at any time. An excellent story!"},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"This was a book that was hard to put down. In 1939 a group ofpowerful men are determined to keep America out of a war withHitler and Germany.This group enlists the services of a professional killer to assassinate the King and Queen of Englandwhile they are on a tour of America. This would forvever poisonrelations between America and England.Thomas Barry,a ScotlandYard detective and Jane Todd a photographer are aware of thisconspiracy and are trying to stop it by catching the assassin. The assassin,John Bone is very good at what he does.You have somehistorically significant people come up in this story.Allen Dulles,Joseph Kennedy,Lyndon Johnson,and Frank Sinatra are mentioned in this story. This is a good book that you will enjoy. Buy it and read it."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"The meticulous historical research that has gone into this thiller is deserving of 5 stars, but the storytelling tends to eventually drag on to its climax... You might find yourself missing chunks of prose in an effort to &quot;get to the good part!&quot; Nonetheless, it is a commendable work well worth a read!"},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"As someone who loves writers like Ludlum and Jeffrey Archer, I must admit that I had some trepidation when I picked this book up before a recent trip. However, the book turned out to be well researched and detailed (two things that I value), and well written as well. My only complaint is that it wasn't quite as addictive as the best that Ludlum has to offer, but it was definitely close. This book is well worth reading-pick it up!"},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"Christopher Hyde (Hard Target, Black Dragon, etc.) is one fine writer, and this book is no exception. This is an historically based, conspiracy, chase novel. Based on a plot in 1939 (just before Hitler would invade Poland), to assassinate England's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth while on a visit to Canada and America, the purpose is to divide England and America to keep America out of the coming war. The story is well told, interestingly detailed with period charm and color, and filled to overflowing with real life people in both cameo and primary roles. These real people give the story an authenticity that reminds one of all the players in the Kennedy assassination -- from a young congressman named Lyndon Johnson to a very young unknown singer called Frank Sinatra, and others of that pre-war time.With an Afterword by the author that brings the players up to date with their fate, and an Author's Note that tells of the amazing historical realities of the story, this \\"what if\\" novelized historical thriller is very hard to put down.It is unfortunate that Christopher Hyde's novels are mostly out of print. After this one, you'll want to search used book stores for his backlist...."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"The story builds nicely and Hydes historical research serves him well. He paints a vivid picture of the people and places of the time and develops very plausible characters. However, as the story progresses and the pace of events picks up, the novel fails to match; continuing its elaborate description of everything and everybody it encounters. This is mildly frustrating and I almost skipped several paragraphs, but didn't because I was sure the plot would thicken still and I would be swept along in a novel rich in political intrigue.Not true; from here on the plot deteriorates into a type of Hardy Boys mystery. The characters, which were skilfully moulded from the events of the time, give unlikely performances as the novel contrives to provide a dramatic climax.I think that the effort spent on the excessive descriptions would have been better spent in enriching the plot.People interested in historical political intrigue would definitely enjoy books by James Ellroy, particularly &quot;American Tabloid&quot;.For a consise and riveting account of America's &quot;Lend Lease&quot; programme read &quot;Stalin's Silver: The Sinking of the Uss John Barry&quot;."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"This book takes you back in time to 1939. The plot is straight forward enough - assassinate the King and Queen of England on AMerican soil and prevent any chance of an American entry into the next war on the side of the British.There is an extraordinary amount of historical detail built into the story. The lines between fiction and history are sufficiently blurred to cause one to think about the implications of what you are reading.For example, one of the most thought provoking moments is the inclusion of a Texas Congressman by the name of Lyndon Johnson. It is unclear as to the extent of his complicity in the plot, but it seems certain Mr. Hyde tripped over something in his research for the project.A very good read!"},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"In the summer of 1939 a group of high-level conspirators band together to ensure Germany's victory in the impending war. Their plan is to assassinate England's King George VI and Queen Elizabeth when they arrive for their planned tour in the US, thereby destroying any hope of an American-British alliance. John Bone is the Irish assassin hired to complete the plot. Pursuing him is are a female photographer and London detective, as well as a supporting cast of diverse and likeable characters.THE SECOND ASSASSIN is a thoroughly researched and well-written historical thriller based on actual events. It is brimming with detail, riveting suspense, and real-life figures who lend a degree of authenticity to the storyline. The author painstakingly recreates the pre war era with meticulous detail and panache. Hyde delivers a bone chilling thriller worthy of 10 stars!"},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"If you're looking for an exciting, interesting and informative thriller that will take you back in time to the years preceding the U.S.'s entering WWII, I very much recommend The Second Assassin to you. The story is based on the planned assassination of the King and Queen of England in 1939 during their trip to the U.S. The plan was to destroy any hope of an alliance between Great Britain and the U.S., thus ensuring victory for the Nazis in WWII.Hyde is meticulous in his research and is terrific in describing this period with accuracy, charm and lots of color. Further, Hyde's suspenseful thriller is loaded with real-life characters, about which he provides interesting and many little-known facts (at least to me) that enables this book to rise above the average historical thriller. Of particular interest to me (and I think will be to you, too) were the \\"factoids\\" Hyde provides about Lyndon Johnson, Allen Dulles, John Cardinal Spellman, Joseph Kennedy, Franklin Roosevelt, Vice President Garner, Postmaster Farley, Frank Sinatra -- and, of course, the King and Queen of England. Regardless of the accuracy of the historical details described , The Second Assassin is a book that will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want to read on and on. My only reason for giving this book 4 1/2 stars and not a 5-star rating is that a few of the clues and planned next steps of the \\"bad guys\\" just seem to fall into the \\"good guys/girl's\\" hands just a little too easily. Putting this minor detail aside, as well as the difference between a 4 1/2 and 5 star rating, The Second Assassin by Christopher Hyde is well worth reading and one that should be near the top of your to-be-read list.If you can find a copy, you might also enjoy A Gathering Of Saints, by Christopher Hyde. This book, published in 1996, like The Second Assassin, is a work of fiction based on historical fact during WWII.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"great book!!

It is not a fast read since there is so much detail. Characters are interesting and the premise is very plausible.

The movie-makers missed an opportunity in not filming \\"The Second Assasin\\" for release this year.I found the book a rather simple story dropped into a rather amazing set of turbulent historic fact, if Hyde is to be believed - and I have no reason to doubt him. The combination has won the book well deserved praise. I did not find myself convincingly transported into the cultural atmosphere of 1939 while reading this book, despite the fact that almost all the characters smoked pipes or cigarettes. A lot of the time it felt like a much later period. One of the lead characters, Jane Todd, had a personality that could have fitted her comfortably in the period the book was written - 2000s, not 1939. I could not quite relate to her as a 1930s typical female journalist/photographer - but then I'm too young to have had any experience of the 1930s so maybe I'm doing Hyde an injustice.I think reviewers here have over-rated the book a little but up to a 4-star is certainly merited."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"I love the main character Jane in this book and I really like the author. Its a pretty good book, but if you are looking for a really, really good book from Christopher Hyde, you should read \\"The House of Special Purpose\\". It has the same main character (Jane) and a better main male character then the Second Assassin. Overall, this is a good book and a good read, with pretty good characters and plot."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"As a longtime fan of Christopher Hyde's, I was disappointed to find this entry tedious and plodding. I was bored by one of the main protagonists, Jane Todd, girl reporter, and only moderately interested in her Irish detective counterpart, Thomas Barry.The hunt for John Bone, super-assassin, who has been hired to kill the King and Queen of England on the cusp of the US's entry into World War II, was not enough to hold my interest. Bone was not sifficiently evil to raise suspense. The subplot concerning a ranking IRA member was tedious and Bertie and Elizabeth, the victims, were portrayed awfully enough that one wished for Bone to succeed.Especially disappointing was witnessing Hyde's giving in to the mores of popular fiction and allowing Todd and Barry to become romantically involved. I am used to Hyde following less predictable and crowd-pleasing paths.I understand the author has taken yet another step in the direction of Selling Out - he brings Jane Todd and another character from another book back, making them recurring characters. If it works for him, I'm glad, but it is not something I'm thrilled to see.This is a competently written and occasionally entertaining book, but not one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"This book what else can I say, is a really good book, one of my favs. Original, thought provoking, conspiratorial assassination adventure through 1938. I will read this book again, and again. Best of Christopher Hyde's body of work. Highly recommend that you order a copy today.The historical facts blended with fictional finesse blended the facts and fiction along near invisible lines, left me seeing conspiracies everywhere. I think he must have taken some initiative from Oliver Stone's JFK."},{"Title":"The Second Assassin","review":"I picked this book up at an airport hoping it would at least be mediocre.

There are sidebar articles about such things as \\"Interpreting the Miracle Stories\\" and \\"Testing Prophesy.\\" As one further inducement, there is a fine article called \\"Interpreting Revelation's Violent Imagery\\". All well worth your time and attention. Also, the authors include \\"Figures\\" that show summaries of The Sermon on the Mount, Apostles Listed in Scripture, Comparative Chronology of the Passion and Form of Greeting in Letters. These are all tremendously helpful study tools.The meat of the book offers insights on the verses of Scripture. The Introduction does an outstanding job of setting the tone, describing terms such as \\"Testament\\" \\"New\\" and the realities of the formation of the cannon.

And lately the notes in my well-used NIV study bible began to seem a very narrow way of looking at the text. A pastor recommended this commentary, and I've fallen in love with reading the bible again. I now most often read from a bible with no study notes, and *after* I've read and opened myself up to a book, story, chapter, or verse, I look at the notes. Sure, I could have done that with my old study bibles, but somehow the format made me feel obliged to read every note. As an added bonus, my new (non-study) bible is a lot lighter and easier to carry.I don't agree with every note in this commentary (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but I trust the authors' scholarship and am willing to hear what they have to say.

This is one of the best, can't wait to read the next one. Dr.Kacie Crisp"},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Although \\"Strange Affair\\" is Peter Robinson's fifteenth Inspector Banks novel, it is my introduction to the extremely human, complex man and law enforcement professional who is Alan Banks. I wonder where he has been all of my life since he is just my type...of character, that is. I prefer my men/friends, in real life, to be less disturbed - and in this novel Banks is coming out of a deep psychological depression. He has become \\"withdrawn and taciturn,\\" with little energy for work or social life.Apparently, in the previous book, \\"Playing With Fire,\\" (which I just ordered), Banks' idyllic cottage in the Yorkshire Dales, as well as all of his possessions, were burned to the ground by an arsonist, including his extensive CD collection. It's a well known fact amongst Banks aficionados that he is a music lover of some discrimination. Banks was home at the time the crime was committed, sleeping. If his ex-lover and colleague DI Annie Cabbott, along with DC Winsome Jackman had not pulled him from the flames, I would not be reviewing \\"Strange Affair.\\" Banks is presently living in a rented flat near the remnants of his home, supervising its reconstruction and convalescing.This excellent police procedural/mystery opens with the murder of a young woman, Jennifer Clewes, on a stretch of dark country road. She had been run off the Yorkshire highway and shot, once, in the head. In the last few months there had been two other incidents where young women were driven off the road and murdered, although they had both been brutally raped and strangled, not shot. What IS most unusual about this case is that Ms. Clewes had a piece of paper in the back pocket of her jeans with Inspector Banks' name and address on it. DI Cabbott is troubled by this and tries to contact Banks, to no avail.That's because the good Inspector is prowling around London trying to find his younger brother Roy. The two had never been close, even as children. As a matter of fact, Banks thinks Roy is a shady character with few scruples. The evening Jennifer Clewes was killed, Roy Banks had made a rare phone call to his brother and had sounded frightened, as if he were in trouble. He had not been seen or heard from since the call. Suddenly Alan begins to take an interest in the details of his brother's life and learns his sibling is not as one-dimensional as he thought.As Annie and Alan pursue their separate investigations, (really fascinating stuff), Jennifer's murder and Roy's disappearance seem to be connected. The storyline alternates between Banks in London and Cabbot's, et. al. investigation(s) in the dales. While much of the novel involves solving the crimes, there is also a lot of discussion about the past - Banks relationship with Annie, their intricate personalities, how their individual lives have changed in recent months...and years. As I wrote above, I have not read any of the other books in the series but was not at a loss for information. As a matter of fact, about a third of the way through, I felt that the characters were old friends. The proof of how much I enjoyed this is that I just purchased Peter Robinson's two previous novels.By the way, \\"Strange Affair\\" is a song title by Richard Thompson, a British singer-songwriter that Banks hears at the beginning of the story and it keeps running through his mind:\\"This is a strange affairThe time has come to travel but the road is filled with fearThis is a strange affairMy youth has all been wasted and I'm bent and grey with yearsAnd all my companions are taken awayAnd who will provide for me against my dying day?I took my own provision but it threw me and wasted awayThis is a strange, this is a strange affair.\\"What can I say? His brother is missing...before he got a chance to really know him, he lost his CDs and he is depressed...but things do improve. I really enjoyed this book, the writing style, the plots, subplots, characters. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Robinson has fallen into the quagmire that awaits the author who has started A Successful Series. This novel is forced, artificially prolonged, sometimes trite, and leaves the reader frustrated that she/he wasted so much time for so little payoff.Alan Banks is on holiday from his police job, and he gets a worrisome message on his answering machine from his prodigal brother Roy. Alan is a good fella, so he goes around London trying to find Roy and find out what prompted the phonecall. Meanwhile, the entire police force is trying to get ahold of Banks because a murder victim had his address in her back pocket. For at least half the novel, Banks plods along looking through his brother's life, completely unaware of a related investigation that his sometime partner/sometime lover is leading. It is ludicrous to think Annie Cabot and Banks couldn't have communicated with each other for all that time. The novel could've been much shorter except for this forced detour.We don't even have an idea as to why the woman was murdered (in the first chapter) until the last 20 pages of the novel. So the intervening pages are just \\"Gee, why did that happen? Gee, who could've done such a think? Gee, who's that man in the photograph?\\" The plot doesn't really advance--it just circles the airport waiting for an open gate wasting fuel. In the meantime, the reader has long wished she started a different book and left Banks and Annie Cabot to slosh along in their petty problems.The title is corny and unfitting for the novel, and this book falls into the trap of making a mystery based on human rights groups' pet project. In summary, this was just plain boring! Banks and Annie make no progress in character development. You could just skip this novel and not miss a beat in the soap opera this series has become.

STRANGE AFFAIR has so many twists and turns and false leads that readers find themselves so totally absorbed in the novel that they will finish it in one sitting just to find out who killed [...] and why. Peter Robinson is the master of the English police procedural with tantalizing, exciting and totally believable works.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Stories involving police procedure and rogue investigations are pretty common, so this title is an imprecise descriptor of the contents, which partake of both. Robinson is a very solid author who takes great pains to develop the inner life of his characters, which makes his books -- this one included -- interesting and satisfying to read.We start with a murder in Yorkshire that is investigated using standard police methods by Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot. Simultaneously, Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is roused from his depressive convalescence by an uncharacteristic cry for help from his estranged brother. Banks soon is on the trail of a missing person whose life, we come to see, is intertwined with that of the murder victim. The mystery aspects of this book are developed exceptionally well, and the quality of this novel is enhanced by the attention the author pays to the psychological aspects of his characters and their interrelationships. That said, the book does suffer from the author's attempts throughout to deal with the sequela of the previous book in the Banks series. If you haven't read the books in order (as I did not), then you're probably getting more information about the Cabbot/Banks relationship than you really need or want for purposes of appreciating this story. If you are a series reader, then this soap-opera-like reinforcement is probably welcome. I could have done without.Alan Banks is a worthy member of a proud fraternity of British police detectives, and those who especially enjoy this sub-genre will not be disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"\\"A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity\\" Proverbs 17:17. How prophetic that Peter Robinson starts his fifteenth novel, \\"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense\\" with a quote about friend and family. Detective Chief Inspector, Alan Banks has received a phone message from his brother Roy requesting \\"Help, It may be a matter of life and death.\\" I found this novel in Amazon's top 100 list, and since I love great English mysteries I picked it up. What a find. Oh, I love this new series.DCI, Alan Banks, is a man who is driven to find the truth, and a man who does not feel the need to follow rules of law and order.His brother has called and has now gone missing. A young woman who is found shot to death in her car, Jennifer Clews, has Alan's name and address on a piece of paper on her body. What is this all about? Detective Annie Cabbot is about to find out. Coincidence that Alan and Annie are ex-lovers and have left their relationship in tatters? It makes this all the more interesting. Past history is hinted at, and some of it updated so if you have not read the previous fourteen novels you are still in the picture.DCI Alan Banks starts the investigation of finding his brother, and interviewing all of those who may know something about the sometimes shady work Roy was known to pursue. Alan is recuperating from a fire in his home that was started by a lover of DI Annie Cabbot. In the meantime Annie is investigating Jennifer Clewes murder, and the connection between Jenn and Alan's brother Roy. In the background is another investigation of several young women who were attacked at night on lonely roads in Yorkshire. The investigations take us into London and back to Yorkshire, and the colors, tastes and sounds of the UK are brought to life by Peter Robinson's imaginative writing. It has been said that Peter Robinson is incapable of writing a dull sentence! The trio of investigations all come together,and the findings of conspiracy, corruption, murders and mobsters bring these mysteries to a singular fantastic conclusion.At first I was leery of another DCI who was a tough guy that loved his whiskey. But DCI Alan Banks is a man of his own. The complex characters that surround Alan Banks all have their own peccadilloes and are brought to life in this suspenseful and evocative mystery. I have found a new friend in DCI Alan Banks and plan to read every one of the other fourteen novels. A great new mystery-suspense and this may be of the best new British novels. A true find.

In recent books, Banks has suffered some traumatic experiences, particularly at the end of the previous book, Playing With Fire . It seems to me that Peter Robinson has written Strange Affair as a sort of bridge to future Inspector Banks books and is one that will appeal mainly to the devoted fans of the Inspector Banks series.The fire that destroyed his house and put him in hospital 4 months previously has also affected DCI Alan Banks psychologically, sending him into a depression that he has trouble fighting through. When the story opens he is on an extended holiday which is interrupted when he receives a phone call from his brother Roy, who sounds as though he may be in some trouble. Alan and Roy have never been particularly close and Roy has always sailed close to the wind as far as his business dealings were concerned, but when Banks can't get in contact with him, he grows more than a little concerned. With nothing better to do, Banks sets off for London to find out what could make his brother sound so nervous.Back in Yorkshire, DI Annie Cabbott has been called to a murder scene on a quiet stretch of road where a young woman sits in her car, having been shot in the back of the head. It's bad enough find a murder victim on your patch, but is even more perplexing when absolutely no motive can be found for the killing. But the clincher that really attracts Annie's attention is the piece of paper found in the victim's back pocket with Banks' name and address written on it.The bulk of the story takes place in London with Banks' attempting to trace his brothers last known movements and Annie investigating the background of the dead woman. The focus of the story alternates between Banks and Cabbott and it soon becomes apparent that the two cases are connected: it's just a matter of time before the coppers from Yorkshire bump into each other in London.The majority of the books in the Inspector Banks series deals with police solving crimes by following a set of procedures, hence the description police procedural, and a great deal of each book is devoted to the crime itself. While Strange Affair contains an investigation that follows this style, the main focus is on the characters, their pasts and the way they have been affected by them. Banks goes through a re-evaluation of his life thanks to the disappearance of his brother and through the reaction of his parents. Annie brings to mind a couple of failed relationships, in particular her former relationship with Banks and the one that ended disastrously in Playing With Fire.Once Banks' state of mind has balanced itself again we are able to focus on a darn good mystery that ties Roy Banks in with the Yorkshire investigation conducted by Annie Cabbott. From a slow, careful and rather introspective beginning the story swells to an outstanding conclusion full of emotion that tests both Banks and Cabbott's self control.DCI Alan Banks reminds me a great deal of Ian Rankin's Inspector John Rebus. Both men prefer to work alone, reluctant to share their theories with their colleagues. Both are driven by their need to see justice done, allowing the job to take over their lives to the detriment of personal relationships. Heck, both men have a female subordinate who is the source of sexual tension to one degree or another. Both series are outstanding police procedural series featuring interesting, fully fleshed out characters.Peter Robinson has put a lot of effort into his characters, developing them painstakingly over the past 14 books and it continues in Strange Affair. Banks' past is hinted at as part of the explanation for his depression and a newcomer to the series could come along and enjoy this book, picking up on the tidbits from the past and perhaps even finding their interest piqued enough to go back through the series and see how Alan Banks came to become a Detective Chief Inspector."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"I've read almost all of Peter Robinson's Inspector Banks books and have never been disappointed. This one is no exception. This is without a doubt one of the most suspenseful, intelligently written series of mysteries on the market. Just one note: Normally, a reader can pick up any book in this series and have no problem with references to past books. However, I would recommend reading \\"Playing With Fire\\" prior to \\"Strange Affair\\".

We are still in touch with all of his emotions, his taste in music and food and all of the other personal items that make him so real.Each year around this time, I find myself elated to receive his latest and then angry that I have to wait another year for the next. Between Peter Robinson and Ian Rankin, each February and March give me a priceless literary gift."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Just when you think that all of the truly intriguing plot lines have been taken, along comes Peter Robinson. \\"Strange Affair\\" left me a little breathless and full of admiration for Robinson's ability to weave a complex story around the brittle and edgy Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his sometimes love interest Detective Inspector Annie Cabbot. In reading fiction, I get really tired of babysitting flawed characters who are written with the expressed desire to add quirkiness, but Banks and Cabbot are not gratuitously damaged and they make bad decisions that seem logical in the light of how humans are wired. In this case, a beautiful young woman is found in her car on a deserted stretch of road with a bullet in her brain and Alan Banks' address in her pant pocket. Is this murder tied to two other similar murders in the same region? And why in heavens name does she have Banks' address on her person? The answer won't be forthcoming because Banks is on holiday in pursuit of his own demons, namely an estranged brother who has left a desperate message asking for help and then disappeared. This journey takes Banks to London and submerges him in the shadowy and unexpected world of his brother's business dealings and situations where he has no authority and no backup. While Banks is trolling the underbelly of London's stock speculators and arms merchants, Cabbot is following the trail of the dead girl back to London and trying to reach Banks through his relatives before an official APB must be issued to find him for an explanation of his connection to the dead girl. The clock is running and Robinson does a masterful job of weaving the parallel stories as they get closer and closer to each other and then collide with a tremendous crash. This is something like the 15th book in this series and it is well worth it to go back to the beginning. My favorite was \\"In a Dry Season\\", which sported one of the most unique plot lines I can ever remember. The one to avoid is Robinson's first book entitled \\"The First Cut\\". It is completely original but a little unbelievable and not nearly as well written as his subsequent work."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"STRANGE AFFAIR is Peter Robinson's 15th book featuring Yorkshire Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks.

Banks colleague (and former girlfriend), Detective Inspector Annie Cabot is called on to investigate that case.Robinson has written another winner in his excellent Banks series. The novel is well paced and suspenseful without getting confusing. The characters of Annie Cabot and Banks continue to evolve slowly with each novel. Banks is rather depressed throughout this book after the fire that took all his possessions and his home at the end of PLAYING WITH FIRE.

He follows the usual sub-plots:- personal problems of inspector Banks,- personal life of his co-worker and former love interest, Annie,- life of some new recruits or younger detectives,- nasty crime with complications,- simple and clear prose, with- a happy ending, or at least some closure for the case.Those are all positive and the reader will not be disappointed. As a bonus, Banks is involved with his brother in London and aging parents, so there is a slight change of pace.The complaints or main complaint that I have is that the novel is a bit too close to a formula, so it lacks mystery. The writing is clear, compelling, but nothing special. I have a bias because I had just finished some wonderful stories by Chekhov - and the difference is dramatic. Robinson goes into the small details of Banks life including every meal, the menu, what he drinks, etc, etc. After a while that is all a bit tiring. Also, the evil characters are a \\"cardboard cut-out\\" figures without much life. We do not see many chances taken with the writing or the plot - it follows that tried and true formula. So, it is a book written for commercial sales with the Bank's theme.If you love the Banks formula you will enjoy the book, but there is an element of deja vu. There are worse ways to kill a day.

Fans of Patricia Cornwell should take notice of this author's series. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"While reading, I alternated between wanting to rush through because the story was just that good, and wanting to read slowly, taking every word in, because the writing was just that good.This book excels in all areas: plot, characters (and character development), sense of place, suspense, dialogue, and atmosphere. It's a police procedural that will make you feel, cheer, shudder, and think."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"As if life hasn't thrown him enough curveballs lately, Banks' holiday is interrupted by a mysterious phone message from his estranged brother Roy, who, as they say \\"turns up missing.\\" Banks being Banks, he places his depression firmly on the back burner and sets out to discover what's going on in the life of his wheeler-dealer sibling. Chapter by chapter, this investigations becomes more and more complex, as several seemingly unrelated events and crimes prove to be very much related indeed. Along the way, he learns that there's more to Roy than he ever suspected.Peter Robinson is a gifted writer whose skills include the creation of 3 dimensional characters, the development of intricate and believable plots, and the genuine understanding of human emotions. It is remarkable that in a series with as many entries as this one, the central character continues to change and grow as we follow the twists and turns in his life and career. Robinson's many awards are well-merited.I won't throw out any spoilers by discussing the outcome of Strange Affair, but readers will find a similar theme, just as well handled, in Donna Leon's Fatal Remedies."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"I would have been in love with Peter Robinson's STRANGE AFFAIR by virtue of the title alone. Anyone who names a novel after a Richard Thompson song is deserving of accolades. But it becomes quickly evident that Robinson is not showing off, in some hipper-than-you'll-ever-be sense, by name-dropping a somewhat obscure song by an artist who, in his own words, has a small enough following that he doesn't have to worry about catching a helicopter to his next gig. No. Listen to the song on the First Light CD, by Richard and Linda Thompson, as you begin reading this novel, and you'll find that the music and book fit perfectly together from first note and page to last.Indeed, STRANGE AFFAIR, after a brief vignette, begins with British police inspector Alan Banks hearing the song by happenstance in a pub, an incident that remarkably enough has ties to his past. Banks also has no way of knowing that within a few minutes he will receive a telephone message that will irrevocably change his life. Again.Robinson, if I may take a moment to say so, is absolutely brilliant. STRANGE AFFAIR is his fifteenth Banks novel. Though the books in the series are connected sequentially, they also are written so that one can jump into the series at any point and be brought up to speed fairly quickly and painlessly. This is a difficult task for a writer, particularly with a character such as Banks, who has, to put it delicately, a history. So it is that, if you are reading Robinson for the first time here, you will learn that Banks is still in a bit of shock after having his home burnt down by Detective Annie Cabbot, Banks's professional partner and former lover. The fiend is still on the loose (and no, they don't catch her in this installment).Banks is trying to cope with his myriad losses and is going through the motions of life when he receives a cryptic call for assistance from Roy, his younger and wealthier brother. When Banks arrives in London pursuant to his brother's summons, he finds Roy's fashionable home to be deserted. While nothing immediately appears to be amiss, Banks discovers that his brother is more, and less, than he ever suspected.Meanwhile, Annie Cabbot is investigating the mysterious shooting death of a young woman on a highway. Her death is made all the more puzzling by the fact that a clue discovered at the scene of the crime seems to link her directly to Banks. While Banks is looking for his brother, Cabbot is searching for Banks, and each of them is carrying potential keys to the puzzle of a larger mystery.Robinson's narrative pace is steady but not rushed, thus building an internal urgency that is almost excruciating by the time Cabbot and Banks finally do connect. As the pieces of the story slowly fit together, the reader learns more about Banks, a bit about Cabbot, and some more about how the world works. The climax is redemptive of sorts but uncomfortable, and all the more real for it. It is illustrative of Robinson's genius --- yes, genius --- that he can introduce a character central to the impetus of STRANGE AFFAIR within the last twenty pages and do it without a bit of strain or feeling of overreaching, simultaneously making the character --- who we barely get to meet --- the most memorable in the book. That, I would submit, is superior writing.Peter Robinson was named the 2004 Bouchercon author of the year, and STRANGE AFFAIR is a solid demonstration of the elements that won him that accolade. This is a work, and an author, that simply cannot be missed.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Is it my imagination, or is DCI Banks beginning to resemble Morse in some ways? In recent novels he has become more of a loner, despite his passing involvements with different women. And, speaking of women, Banks does have his problems. Long time and recently ex-girlfriend Annie puts in an appearance in this novel as do other characters known to devoted readers.The crimes in this book are mostly resolved with police procedures, so it isn't one of those \\"warm cosy mysteries\\" I love so much, but Robinson, unlike some of his contemporaries (American mystery writers are worse) includes no gratuitous violence or sex in this novel, making it something I can read before bedtime.The plot is complex with more than one crime and more than one criminal, although in the beginning, the police think a serial killer may be loose. The moral of the story is that women should not go driving late at night, especially alone and on deserted roads - stick to the Interstate or Motorv way as the case may be.The locus of action is a family planning agency, where late night events are suspicious. The mystery revolves around \\"late girls\\". Are they late with their period, late in their pregnancy or late at night? Annie and Banks soon get to the bottom of the mystery with the help of many other police officers.What I like about Robinson's book is the following: 1) the editor did not Americanize the text so that we have SOCO not CSI teams, and people are \\"collected\\" not \\"picked up.\\" If I want to read American slang, I have Stephanie Plum Thank You. Also, Robinson is allowed to write in a somewhat literate manner. Why must editors assume folks who like mysteries are illiterate? Why can't leaves susurrate? - Hey some of us remember our Latin!! Another thing I like about Robinson's writing is the development of female characters. He may be the first male mystery writer I've read whose females I can appreciate (the title says it all). This is the first time I read a mystery novel written by a male that made me cry. I can't tell you why, but read it and you may have the same reaction. Although I had few clues about the nature of the deceased, the reaction of his loved ones was powerful."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"I think one of the things I like best about Robinson's series featuring DCI Alan Banks of the North Yorkshire CID is that they're unusually true-to-life in their structure. That is, Agatha Christie and P. D. James and most other writers of \\"detective stories\\" have always followed a certain pattern. The murder takes place, the author quickly introduces the reader to a clutch of suspects, and says, in effect, \\"one of these people dunnit.\\" Even Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch books tend to work that way. But the narrative in Robinson's novels follow the process of the investigation. Clue A leads to Clue B, red herring (always a reasonable one) leads Banks astray for awhile, Banks or one of his colleagues (most often DI Annie Cabbot, lately) makes an intuitive leap or gets lucky, and the bad guys finally go down. Or at least they're identified; in the book before this one, _Playing with Fire,_ the bad guy got away and the cops are still looking for him. But in this present first-rate story, the who and (especially) the why of the crime don't become clear until very late in the book -- and it works.The victims this time out include a young woman who is shot with a .22 on a quiet roadside between London and Eastvale, and the investigators quickly discover Banks's address in her back pocket. What is his connection with the dead woman? They'll have to wait a bit to find out, because Banks, presently taking a week off, has been phoned by his estranged brother, Roy, who definitely sounded frightened, and who then disappeared, and Banks has gone off to London to find out what's going on. Roy, a very successful entrepreneur, often sailed a bit too close to the wind in quest of profits and Banks is half-convinced he's up to his neck in something shady. But as he prowls around Roy's empty house, and talks to his neighbors and his ex-girlfriend, he begins to make some personally unsettling discoveries that don't fit in with his long-held suspicions regarding his brother. Then, of course, a second body turns up, also shot with a .22, and Banks's life is forever changed. Meanwhile, Annie is pursuing her own case and keeps just missing connections with Banks, but the two investigative threads will eventually merge. (And there's even a third matter being worked on by the thoroughly unlikeable DC Kevin Templeton, with a walk-on by Susan Gay from the earlier volumes in the series.) Then there are the personal story lines that grow and change and develop in the background from one book to the next, including Banks's failed marriage (and the baby Sandra has just had with her new husband) and his awkward relationship with Annie Cabbot, with whom he had a brief affair. (Banks can be a bit of a bastard at times, and Annie can be hard to deal with for her own reasons. Will they reach a new accommodation? Dunno. Keep reading.) If you begin this series at the beginning and follow it though the fifteen volumes to this point, you will have learned a great deal about Alan Banks and what makes him tick, and about his friends and lovers and colleagues, and about Yorkshire in the late 20th and early 21st century. Robinson does an excellent job with all of them, and he just keeps getting better and better."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Won't rehash the book so much as to simply say if you like \\"police procedurals\\" in the vein of say an Ed McBain and Michael Connelly, you should enjoy \\"A strange affair\\" by Mr. Robinson.This is the second book of his I've read(\\"Piece of my heart\\" being the other)and with Mr. McBain sadly passing and Mr. Connelly sometimes being a bit inconsistent with his Harry Bosch novels, all I can say this guy, so far at least, is a real find who has created not only some suspenseful storylines but some police people you get a bit more curious about each step along the way.If you like a good mystery where the \\"mundane\\" routine of a murder investigation is made all the more exciting by the wonderful characters, you should thoroughly enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"This was the first of Robinson's many books that I've read, I just finished it yesterday. I have to say he's a master at what he does, if his other books are on a par with this one.Without giving anything away, it's a murder mystery (of course) set in two different time periods. On of them is the late 1960's British rock scene. Those were the salad days of my adolescence, and Robinson took me on quite a stroll down memory lane.He draws that period with such a fine touch that I wondered if he hadn't played in a band himself then. And his plotting was tighter than the B-string on a cheap guitar.If you love the type of fiction just described, it doesn't get much better than this one. But save it until you can read it start to finish, as it's really quite hard to put down."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Canadian author Peter Robinson sets his noir-ish mysteries in the Yorkshire Dales, with a maverick, music- and whisky-loving, loner-type of a detective, Alan Banks. This mystery, however, primarily takes place in London. Alan is at home on leave when he receives a phone message from his brother Roy -- a man he isn't at all close to -- that leaves him worried -- his brother never calls, and this message mentions the phrase \\"life or death.\\" When Alan is unable to reach his brother, he leaves his Yorkshire village apartment for London. He finds his brother's front door unlocked and no sign of his brother. Since his wealthy financier brother is, he suspects, engaged in some iffy business most of the time, and because his brother is, after all, an adult, he refuses to make an official report but quietly goes about trying to find his brother. In the meantime, a woman is found shot and killed in her car, and there's a evidence of a link to Alan that has the police trying to contact him -- but he left his cell phone at home, so he is out of communication. Eventually, they track down Alan and the two investigations come together.I thought this was one of the better mysteries I've read this year. Robinson is simply a consistently good author, and anyone who hasn't discovered him yet is in for a treat.Yes, the hard-drinking music-loving British detective sounds like one or two fiction characters we've met before, but Alan Banks is his own distinctive character, and, in my opinion, a lot more likeable than Morse or Ian Rankin's harddrinking Scottish detective."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"This one is awesome. I followed the series of Inspector Banks books from In A Dry Season onward and this one is probably the best so far.Part of the reason is that the protagonist, Alan Banks got fixed pretty good in the previous book -Playing With Fire. This story starts with him still recovering from all the psychological and physical wounds that he had incurred previously. You follow along with his struggles through his attempt at coming back to a place where he can be normal again, as well as the rebuilding of his home as well as his relationships with his co-workers, especially with Annie Cabbot. The story then forces him to re-establish or re-evaluate his relationsip with his younger brother, the evidence of the their relationship had been hinted at throughout the previous books, but this book places the relationship front and center.Robinson once again uses his signature plot device: the dual story and the intertwining of the twin narratives. Whereas previously Robinson used this device to tell two stories which are related in a philosophical sense, this time the two murders are intimately related and inextricably become the same investigation. Robinson builds the plot line and the tempo of the narrative brilliantly. This time, he is a little more guarded with his storyline so that he doesn't telegraph the ending as much as he did with Playing With Fire, which makes for a much more satisfying ending.This particular will be my personal favorite out of the series so far just because it involves so many emotional changes with the characters and the story line is so personal for Banks. Robinson has also started to flesh out the other detectives at Eastvale, giving them points of views, foiles, strengths and weaknesses. It makes me care a lot more about the story and it also makes the story much more complicated and real."},{"Title":"Strange Affair: A Novel of Suspense (Inspector Banks Mysteries)","review":"Gets better and better; cannot recommend it too highly.

There appears to be much information about how the US government felt and acted in the relation to the Sioux but little on how those acts were precieved by the Sioux. According to this book every act by the US was done to help the Sioux. Stealing their land and stealing their food is glossed over. Depriving them of their culture is presented as a way to help them. I noted that only three of four paragraphs were devoted to Crazy Horse while pages and pages were devoted to the works of various white missionaries.

Many may not agree of the topic this book holds, but it is not if you believe or not, if it is non-fiction or fiction, the book keeps you wanting to read it from cover to cover. In fact when I got done, I longed for the story to continue. Understanding the author is not alone in dealing with spirits, ones most of us can't see, but maybe after reading it you may have more of a respect for the unknown - unseen parts of our world.

Annoying, tedious, repetitive... that's what parents say all down the ages and even Socrates told us so. They are supposed to be that, otherwise they would be just dumb meat and who wants his kids to be dumb? Right, none.So this book by Jane DeLynn's is about a teenager feeling different. It's not just family and upbringing, culture and religion, but... Jane unfolds the story, written as to be her own, and let us witness the inner workings of a 16 year old teenager coming to grips with what she really wants and needs. Discussions with parents, annoying family issues, troubles with friends frame the awakening of the supposed-to-be Jane. The book isn't printed yesterday or of this year, not even within this decade, but the topic is truly a classic. This book will not only fit lesbians.

The only certainity in Lynn's life is the fact she abhors her parents, who apparently have no thoughts or conversations about anything besides their only daughter, Lynn.Page after endless page we drift along with Lynn as she indulges herself in what passes for thoughts and conversations. Lynn wonders a lot, but learns nothing, and neither does the reader.

You have to use your imagination, use deduction, and often times be patient to really understand what's happening. If you want to be spoon-fed, this might not be for you.Overall, this was an excellent read. If you are tired of the same predictable stuff and would like to be suprised, this is a great story to get lost in."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"Do any of us really think that life with a Circus is glamorous? I never could think that and this book certainly puts that to rest, replete with in-fighting and back biting and jealousies and trauma. And since life in mainstream society is also fraught with bullying and all of the above, why would life for those considered \\"freaks of nature\\", be better or different. Well told I thought and it does depict human emotion well."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"I very seldom give up on a book as so many slow starters turn into real winners, and this was no exception. The first few chapters are confusing and a bit vague, with far too many characters, all of whom have foreign names which make them difficult to remember. There is no clear indication of who the main characters are going to be, nor of what their story is actually going to be about - besides being performers in the Circus. However, the book seamlessly evolves into an intriguing story with only a handful of exceptionally interesting lead characters. From roughly the 10% mark I was completely hooked and loved every minute of this wonderful story. It's one of those books that really stays with you long after you get to the end. Weeks later I find myself pondering the logistics of being one half of co-joined twins in the early 1900's, or living the lie which was the life of Shangai the dwarf. Imagine the outcry if modern-day circus was all about oggling human freaks, all with little or no regard for misery and suffering. This story is different yet deeply touching - well worth the read."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"What an incredible story! Pulled me in from the beginning.

Cirkus is one of my first books, and I wanted to add my comments. It is well written, and the author did an effective job in holding my interest, and keeping me 'off guard'. I enjoy a book that isn't so predictable that you are sure of the next chapter before you turn the page, and Cirkus certainly lives up to that! It is the kind of book I anxiously read to find out where the plot path will take me, but I know I will be reading it again, to more thoroughly enjoy the details and nuances Frazee incorporated into her work.Quirky and with unexpected plot twists, I found this book to be very entertaining. Both conventional and unconventional people and emotions are well handled, and the reader learns something about them all.

The story centers around Shanghai, the dwarf fire juggler and his attraction to one of a pair of siamese twins. It's a beautiful story in the vein of Geek Love.

Another reviewer pointed this out, that two of the characters had names that were a little too similar and made it difficult to keep them straight.OK, that wasn't so bad was it?I love that the characters were so well developed, and that no one is all good, or all bad, just very human. This is just the kind of book I like, it isn't a love story, but it has love, it isn't paranormal but has mystery.This writer has totally avoided formulaic writing and tells a great story with an ending that can't be predicted by the end of the first chapter.This is the type of writing I would like to see more of when I am reading books for review.The name of the book is Cirkus, but that is merely the setting for a collection of humans with their own hurts.

Prior to the last third I felt the book was disjointed and slow. At times I wanted to put the book down due to the harsh treatment given to the characters but I did finish it and can say, in retrospect, that the story is quite good. The protagonists and the minor characters are well drawn and have fullness of personality. The dialog reads true and the situations are unusual enough to garner interest.But it does have flow problems. The plot moves so slowly at times this reader was tempted to start skimming and I don't do that with books I am going to review. There are also more than a few spelling and grammar errors that would benefit with the services of a competent editor.However, if you get around the problems and stick with it you will get a different take on an early 20th century circus.Karen Bryant DoeringParents' Little Black BookMistBlueEeyore@gmail.com"},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"Yes, Cirkus was an \\"odd\\" story. Hard to digest at times, very dark except for glimpes of joyfulness due to the characters' love for each other or for a remembered person or place. Cirkus fully explored the humanity and emotional life of so-called \\"freaks\\" and let the reader live awhile inside them - this was valuable and unique in itself - but there was so much more. To me, Cirkus was about being trapped physically, finding a way to break free, and then discovering the \\"trap\\" was inside of you all along.Even Milada, who could fly through the air on her trapeze, accepted being trapped by her father and convention. Even Mariana, who could fly invisibly through any physical realm and see the hopes and dreams of anyone she chose, had no clue of her own future.What brought home to me the physical entrapment of the characters was Mariana's going into others' dreams - especially Bruno the Elephant. He was required to shove his feet together on a tiny podium and keep balanced, otherwise he was cruelly treated - and Bruno had nightmares about what might happen if he could not keep doing that.Which makes a reader have more of an emotional connection that maybe Shanghai got to go home and find Milada again?"},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"This book is set in 1899/1900 in the context of a circus troupe containing several Czech members. The focus is mainly on the emotional life of some of the members, including some of the sideshow \\"freaks.\\" Essentially, unusual people in an unusual setting are experiencing the usual problems of life. Disillusionment, a troubled marriage, business problems, first love, jealousy, loss...I found it absorbing and enjoyable. I did notice that the style seemed to smooth out a bit later in the book, but I was hooked almost from the very beginning. I read the book in one evening. The plot was not obvious to me as I read, so there were surprises and twists along the way.The perspectives do change frequently, but I didn't have a problem following along. In fact, I didn't really consciously note that \\"hey, the perspectives change a lot\\" because I was caught up in the story. I've read other books that do this, and it's not generally a style that hampers my reading. It's usually only a problem for me when the \\"voices\\" are so similar that I lose track of whose head I'm supposed to be in at any particular time.I was particularly impressed with how well the author dealt with the conjoined twins. These were such unusual characters that they could easily have become more of a focus for the reader than the story warranted. As it was, though, the handling of the emotional and physical issues involved was so well done and felt so \\"natural\\" that they took their proper place in the story.As many times as I've heard \\"show not tell,\\" I'll be darned if I can figure out what it really means or why telling is a bad thing. I've decided that either I like the story or I don't, and I'm not going to worry about whether they did the \\"right\\" thing. I don't honestly know whether this story had more \\"telling\\" or \\"showing,\\" but I liked the way the story was told and I liked the story.The writing was occasionally a little stilted, but there were also passages where the text flowed easily and was a pleasure to read. Shanghai's journal entries were the best example, for me. The physical settings of the story, both the circus itself and the areas it visited, were not neglected and the descriptions were evocative and fit well into the overall flow.Several Czech words are sprinkled throughout the book. In many cases, a translation follows: \\"Mluvite Cesky?\\" \\"Do you speak Czech?\\" This was mentioned in an Amazon discussion I read recently as something that sets some readers' teeth on edge, so I think that's why it caught my attention. Honestly, I'm not sure how one would work around it. Non-English phrases that aren't translated and can't be fully determined from context are a bigger irritation to me, so I don't consider it a negative or a flaw, and I rather liked the appearance and \\"flavor\\" that the Czech words added.I did look at the characterization a bit differently after finishing the book and having a more complete understanding. Had I been a beta reader, I would likely have made a couple of suggestions in terms of balance, but I wouldn't say that it would have made it a better book or that the book is flawed as it is.Technically speaking, the book appears to be largely free of spelling, grammar, or punctuation issues. Nothing jumped out at me, and such things do tend to catch my attention. The capitalization struck me as a little inconsistent at times, but nothing egregious and I can't even remember any examples off the top of my head the day after reading the book."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"This book was too strange for me.

This was one of the first books I downloaded on my Kindle Fire, and I'm really glad I didn't pay for it. The story was mostly interesting, but the spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors throughout were very distracting to this former English teacher, as well as the odd choices for hyphenating words at the end of lines. However, since I am new to reading on the Kindle, I'm not sure if that was due to the space requirements of the device or if it appeared the same in the hardcover book version. In close, the story was okay, not nearly on the par with the two previously mentioned circus books, but the errors throughout ruined it for me."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"FIVE STARS -- This novel is a don't miss for anyone, but especially those who like to read something a little different. It's one you can't put down because you don't want to wait to find out how the characters interact and react.

And I am looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"My gosh, this book was odd. I wanted to like it. I really did, ever since I first came across it in 2006. I was immediately intrigued by the cover and description, and I added it to my Amazon Wish List. I finally broke down and purchased it myself this year and was very excited to start reading. After about the first 100 pages, I wanted to put it down but I stayed with it till the end.The first 200 pages of the book read like disjointed short stories going back and forth between the characters featured on the book cover. There's Shanghai, a fire twirling dwarf; Atash and Anna the Siamese Twins; Mariana the gypsy fortune teller and Jakub, her husband who runs the circus. We are treated to choppy glimpses into these characters lives in the circus and the affairs that connect them. One connection in particular is with Milada the acrobat, who is no longer with the cirucs, and who was a past lover of Shanghai. It is not made clear what happened to them until later in the book. These 200 pages are very repetitive though and very slow. The author \\"tells\\" you more of the story, rather than \\"showing\\" you which makes it very hard to connect with any of the characters and makes the reading a bit dry overall.Another problem is the use of names. Mariana and Milada, both starting with the letter M, were easy to mix up in the beginning. Had the Siamese twins, Anna and Atasha, not physically been connnected, I probably would have confused them as well. An editor should have at least suggested a different name for one of the M characters. I found myself constantly consulting the book cover to look at the characters (there are 3 more pictured on the back) as I read, which eventually made me mad because I would have liked to conjure up their images on my own. Therefore, the book almost seems to turn into a picture book since the characters are right there and the story is being \\"told\\" moreso than shown. There are few other editorial/grammatical glitches, but what book doesn't have those?The author really begins to open up and breathe real life into the story in the last 100 pages as climaxes finally evolve and action really starts to take place, but by then it was too late for me. I skimmed through it just to find out what happened because I was tired of having already spent too much time reading this slow book. The characters are here, but like chess pieces never moving. The story is here, but comes too late and truly catches the reader off guard in the end. Not a bad try for a first book, but I won't be back to the Cirkus anytime soon."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"I love circus novels, and I'm Bohemian, so acquiring this was exciting! (VAGUE SPOILER AHEAD!!)But, after reading this I felt like I'd been put through the wringer of the author's issues played out by each character; and not a single one sympathetic. I felt manipulated by the author and as someone said....it just went on and on seeming like it would get better any chapter now.Every character is secretive, lying, despairing, desperate, betraying and betrayed. It's a dark read with no happy endings except in the character's imaginations. It reads as a fictionalized account of someone who sees the world as persecuting and descriminating anyone who is slightly \\"different,\\" or completely so and is subconciously projecting this into every character on the page.Yes these people would be \\"freaks,\\" however, I've always read the point of joining as a community in the \\"circus,\\" was that they could find some acceptance in the setting. Everyone in this circus is manipulating or being manipulated and, during the story as it's told, no one gets even a glimpse of hope.I cannot remember when I last read a novel in which there was not a single character I could like, or sympathize with. Nor in which there were so many characters playing out various shades of the worst of human nature, and none of the good. Very dissapointing considering the reviews!Plus it just totally ruins all my happy notions of circus life; which, though hard was fulfilled by the sense of community and the rush of performing, as described in some other circus novels I've reviewed. In contrast to the well researched and historically accurate novels that actually contains just as much violence and sexuality and desperation but also hope, human goodness, redeemable characters and a general sense that the characters are there because they find their joy in their drive to perform and their destinies fulfilled there - at the Circus!"},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"This is an amazing book!

I am kind of worn out from the effort and don't feel like giving constructive criticism or pointing out all the reasons why it was such torture for my poor noggin. The characters never felt right...I don't know how to say this - but their psychology was off. I kept thinking that wouldn't happen or that person wouldn't do that...what was the author thinking?

The story has so many layers, subtexts, and metaphors it is hard to define it and finally I concluded that, for me, 'Cirkus' is one of those very rare books that transcends genre. It's a great read, thought-provoking and hard to put down.At the most basic, it is a tale about a family-owned early 20th century traveling circus that makes the migration to America from Eastern Europe. The circus master and his wife have a very complicated and unsatisfactory relationship, she may have some interesting pyschic abilities, but she is stubborn, emotional and he is weak in character. On a different level, it is about the 'freaks' in the show- people of unusual physical appearance, a dwarf, a pair of conjoined twins, the fat lady, the thin man, and all the others who draw in the crowds. On a broader scale, the 'freakishness' of the rest of the circus performers slowly revealed through their interactions with each other and by contrast with the town folk who pay to see the exotics in the circus. It's a story about love and lovers, the attractions that all feel inside regardless of how they look to the rest of the world, and a story about how women are treated in the circus world, as possessions or possessed. And at bottom, it's about deceptive appearances and their undetected influence on others, who, all unknowing, are performing in the shadows."},{"Title":"Cirkus: A Novel","review":"I have always been interested in stories about traveling circuses or carnivals that traveled around America through the late 1800s through the early 1900s.

It presents a look into the lives of the disenfranchised and dispossessed of that era, and how they were so often exploited by sideshows and other venues.

While we are confronted nightly with images of violence from the Holy Land, the root causes and their effects are sometimes difficult to ascertain. In Jerusalem, one such manifestation is the international outcry over the administrative demolition of illegally built structures.Justus Reid Weiner, scholar-in-residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (www.jcpa.org), an independent think-tank, has undertaken the first comprehensive study of illegal construction in Jerusalem -a phenomenon that has reached epidemic proportions.A long-time Jerusalemite, Weiner brings first-person perspective to the damaging consequences that the politicization of Jerusalem's municipal affairs has wrought on the ancient city's residents of all backgrounds.If someone decided to build a three-story home in the middle of Central Park or the Champs Elysee without permission, would the tax-paying citizens of New York City or Paris not expect the municipality to swiftly and effectively remove this impediment to their city's standard of living? Why is Jerusalem any different?Despite having authorized the issuance of 36,000 permits for new housing units in the Arab sector - more than enough to meet the needs of Arab residents through legal construction until 2020 -6,000 homes without permits were built during the last 4 years, of which less than 200 were demolished by the city.Weiner insightfully illustrates how the Jerusalem Municipality has buckled under the international spotlight and politically-motivated NGO pressure, thereby doing a disservice to the quality of life in this very special city. Appeasement through the selective enforcement of planning policy has further left the Municipality open to criticism when it does, out of necessity, move against illegal structures.Interestingly, the frequency of administrative demolitions is equal amongst Arab and Jewish neighbourhoods. However, the majority of illegal construction is undertaken by Arab Jerusalemites, often built with the financial assistance of the Palestinian Authority on land that is not owned by the builder.More than any single factor, Weiner identifies the 35-year-long boycott of municipal politics by the Palestinian leadership as the cause of the continued imbalance in municipal services in Arab neighborhoods vis-a-vis Jewish neighborhoods.By taking the reader step-by-step through the building permit application process, Weiner illustrates the great lengths to which the Jerusalem Municipality has gone to make their services accessible to its Arab constituency, authoritatively discrediting NGO accusations that Arab Jerusalemites have no choice but to build their homes illegally since the municipality systematically rejects their applications for building permits.Containing a wealth of fascinating background materials, charts and photographs, meticulously researched and exhaustively footnoted, Weiner's surprisingly accessible work illustrates how the common legal mechanisms and urban planning solutions undertaken by Municipalities the world over - notably the demolition of unapproved structures - has taken on political significance as a result of the &quot;demographic war&quot; against Israel. This successful politicization has hindered the Jerusalem Municipality from effectively and inclusively administering, improving and caring for the quality of life of all its residents. At the end of the study we are left with one very difficult question: Who will ultimately bear the burden of chaotic development and an eroded quality of life in the Arab neighborhoods?Equally valuable to professional planners, Mid-East experts, and non- academics, Illegal Construction is an important contribution and insight in to one of the most important, but least understood facets of the Peace Process - the fate of Jerusalem."},{"Title":"Illegal Construction in Jerusalem: A Variation on an Alarming Global Phenomenon","review":"One of the strange paradoxes of the Israeli- Arab conflict is how frequently the Israelis are accused of actions which in fact it is the Arabs who primarily engage in. Here the item in question is illegal building in the city of Jerusalem.Justus Reid Weiner in this work makes a careful study of the whole building - situation in Jerusalem. He reveals that there is a massive illegal building going on in the Arab sector which the Municipality of Jerusalem , also for political reasons, dares not seriously impede. Over six- thousand illegal structures have been built by Palestinians in the past four years alone. Often this is on land which is formally owned by absentee landowers.This pattern of lawlessness in building has according to Weiner no justification in the Arab claim that they are deprived by the Israeli authorities of building permits. In fact thirty- six thousand such permits were issued in this time.The massive disordered sprawl which such illegal building creates is only one side of the problem. Weiner also shows how much of the building is politically motivated an effort of the Palestinian Authority to seize territory . Much of the building too Weiner shows is done by criminal elements within the Palestinian community.This illuminating work puts in true perspective a much misunderstood problem."},{"Title":"Reflections in a Pumpkin Field","review":"One-page essays on a wide variety of subjects, starting from the author's rabbinical perspective but showing clear, free and original thinking.

Actually, it isn't so much genuine world peace that the good doctor is interested in, but rather a state that is more conducive to the eventual takeover by his Si-Fan organization. While the book does seem to make the case that Nazi and Fascist dictators are preferable to the \\"yellow menace\\" as represented by the Manchu man, it still shows those men to be overbearing, arrogant and ripe for being brought down. The book is certainly racist (to a degree, all the other entries in the series are, too), as the reviewers below mention, but at the same time it does make a plea for peace and sanity in the year before WW2 broke out...and that's not too bad a message for any novel.In this book we have a new narrator, the journalist Bart Kerrigan, who joins Nayland Smith on his seemingly endless quest to foil the Doctor's plans. The action hops around quite a bit in this installment, from Essex and Suffolk to London, from Venice back to London, and finally off to (not so) gay Paree. The action is fairly relentless, the book's real saving grace. What with Green Deaths, a run-in with the Doctor on the Essex marshes, brainwashing via television, a new kind of superrifle, the Ericksen disintegration tube, torture chambers under creepy Venetian palazzos, a yacht trap on the Adriatic, killer pygmies and on and on, this book really keeps the reader glued to the page. One of our old friends from previous volumes makes a return in this book, and it's a real stunner when this character does reappear. So despite the racist elements, the book entertains.I did, however, have more serious problems with the book than just the racial comments. There are numerous inconsistencies with previous entries that just bug the bejeebers out of me. For example, in one scene of this volume, Fu Manchu refers to \\"the Seven Gates,\\" a grisly rat torture used on Nayland Smith in book 2, \\"The Return of Dr. Fu Manchu.\\" But in that earlier volume, it was called \\"the Six Gates.\\" Grrrrr. In the current book, Smith is referred to as a \\"deep, silent sleeper,\\" while in the previous book, #8 (\\"President Fu Manchu\\"), he is referred to as a light, \\"hair trigger\\" sleeper. Huh?!?!? Fey, Smith's manservant, in previous volumes, has had a rather normal pattern of speech. In this volume, his speech is telegraphic and robotlike all of a sudden. What!?!?!? These kinds of inconsistencies can and do drive alert readers bonkers. But the worst thing of all in this book is when Smith tells someone that a description of a Japanese suspect is not necessary, as all descriptions of his \\"countrymen sound identical.\\" Jeeeeezzzzz!!!!! Get past these groaners, though, and you'll have a fun time. I did."},{"Title":"The Drums of Fu Manchu","review":"Europe ~ 1939. As the fragrance of the deadly hawthorn wafts through the night air, sinister drums beat in the distance and herald the dreadful Green Death. The Si Fan and the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu murder military and political leaders who threaten world peace. Although it appears that Fu Manchu has switched to the side of the angels, Nayland Smith doesn't buy it. In his nervous and high strung way, Smith runs around trying to prevent the death of war mongers. In the process, he tries to determine what the heck Fu Manchu is up to now.This entry in the classic mystery-adventure series is good lightweight reading. We aren't speaking of great literature, but as a pulp novel, it serves the purpose for young adult readers (and those who remain young adult at heart). Typical of Sax Rohmer, there is a lot of running around and narrow escapes. Cryptic characters abound. The evil doctor stays one step ahead of his pursuers. Nayland Smith and Bart Kerrigan do what they can to frustrate Fu Manchu's fiendish purpose. Back and forth it goes. There are less of the typical \\"yellow peril\\" overtones of the earlier books in the series to trouble modern readers. To borrow a phrase from Sherlock Holmes, \\"The game's afoot!\\" Enjoy the fun. ;-)"},{"Title":"The Drums of Fu Manchu","review":"THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU sees Sax Rohmer bringing Fu Manchu into play in the months leading up to World War II. Originally published in 1939, the book returns to the classic FU MANCHU format with narrator/hero Bart Kerrigan (a worthy successor to Dr. Petrie, Shan Greville, and Alan Sterling) teaming with Nayland Smith to prevent Fu Manchu from assassinating fascist dictators from Germany and Italy (the names have been changed to protect the guilty). A marked change from the paranoiac American presidential campaign documented in PRESIDENT FU MANCHU (which inspired THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE). Long-time fans will thrill to Rohmer's patented breakneck pace, sharp characterizations, and brisk dialogue. Highly recommended to mystery fans and adventure-lovers alike. A word of warning--the book ends abruptly paving the way for 1941's THE ISLAND OF FU MANCHU."},{"Title":"The Drums of Fu Manchu","review":"A historical oddity as well as a very bad and very racist book. In this entry in the popular series, written in the late 1930's, Nayland Smith rescues thinly disguised versions of Hitler and Mussolini from the evil &quot;Yellow Peril&quot;, Fu Manchu. His only reason seems to be that, well, they may not be our sort of people, but they are white, dash it all.I wish I could have read Mr. Rohmer's mail over the next few years, after WWII started! Here it is fifty-plus years later and I still can't believe it."},{"Title":"The Drums of Fu Manchu","review":"One of the most boring and out and out racist books I have ever read. Other books in the series often contain material that is very racist and sexist, and may be excused in that they are products of their times. This one is a step beyond, in that it is poorly written and blatently racist. Reading it often made me cringe."},{"Title":"Galway Kinnell Reads Walt Whitman","review":"This reading brings out the strength and great love in W.W.'s work. This impressed me no end. Unforgettable!"},{"Title":"What Do We Know: Poems","review":"I was worried about what this book of poems would be like--like so many of us, I am madly in love with this poet, and want her to go on forever. The urgency in the love song to the world that The Leaf and the Cloud was has been replaced with a coolness and a lightness that is exquisitely beautiful once you get over the fact that so much of this is about death. The supernatural is the theme of this book, with god with a capital G and angels and ghosts. I have never read her more vulnerable or as far away from us. But this is a beautiful book, a fantastic transition from her last works, showing what a truly great American poet she is."},{"Title":"What Do We Know: Poems","review":"the poet has an insightful look into the minute details of the natural world.She puts a glow and a soothing touch and almost everything she narrates.Her poems are like a fresh breeze caressing one's very soul."},{"Title":"Dance on My Grave","review":"I first came across this novel in my eighth grade year at school. It had been the first homosexual novel that I'd ever read, and I found it both surprising and satisfying; it was a coming-of-age story about a pair of young men who happened to meet by chance of fate during the summer vacation and ended up spending several weeks together.Hal seems much more committed to the relationship than Barry, who acts as though his time with Hal is merely an exciting fling. And one morning, Barry, filled with exhilaration, makes Hal promise that if one of them dies, the other must dance on his grave. For Barry to ask such a daring thing of Hal only serves to further arouse Hal's interest and he becomes more obsessively committed than ever, for he had always hoped to find the ideal, \\"bosom\\" friend, and he feels that Barry must certainly be \\"the one\\".Dance on My Grave was like nothing I had ever read before, and admittedly, the novel seems targeted more towards a British audience and someone unfamiliar with British terms may have to reread certain parts several times to fully understand the book. But I have remained forever attatched to this book, for it evoked such emotions in me as I had never felt before. You can't help but feel sympathy for Hal, who, for his whole life, has been searching for the perfect friend and lover but could never find anyone that fit his ideals... until he met Barry.The lesson of the desperate, clinging obsession that comes with true and unconditional love in this story seems to be like the young adult equivallent to Joseph Olshan's Nightswimmer. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dance on My Grave","review":"Hal Robinson is sixteen, has just finished his school exams and has no idea what he wants to do with his life. Will he stay on at school? If so what will he study? Or will he get a job like his father wants? Hal lives at Southend, the part of London where the Thames River meets the sea. One day he 'borrows' a friend's sail-boat without asking permission. A storm blows up and soon Hal capsizes the boat. Then into his life sails Barry Gorman, eighteen year old, expert sailor, who rescues Hal and who it seems will soon sort Hal's life out. Soon Hal finds himself falling deeply in love with Barry, and it seems his every fantasy is about to be fulfilled. But, as Hal reveals at the very beginning of the book, Barry's life is destined to be cut short.This book is written in a quirky, interesting, experimental manner. The text consists of Hal's first person account, six \\"running reports\\" by Hal's social worker, two newspaper clippings, and a school essay. The personal account features \\"action replays\\" in which Hal goes over the scene he has just described filling in the psychological details that could not be included in the flow of action. One important theme to arise is the 'postmodern' question of how much a written account mirrors reality? Hal desperately wants to be honest, but no matter how much he tries his words fail to describe the true 'feeling' of events, or can be interpreted in a way that varies from the 'truth'.While being an account of a death the book is often surprisingly funny. I found myself laughing out loud in several parts. Grief, however, inevitably takes the main stage at the end of the story, and is represented in some considerable depth. This is not really a tear-jerker though, as throughout the book we have always known that Barry will die.Of course the book is also a description of first adult love, in all its depth and pain. As the story progresses Hal moves from confused teenager to wounded but wiser adult. While this could be described as a 'gay' story the book can be also enjoyed by 'straight' adolescent readers: love, death and truth are in fact universal themes no matter in what details we dress them. The story includes some sex but it is only very discretely referred to.This is an English novel and some colloquialisms and cultural references are included which US audiences may find difficult to understand. There is not enough of this though to make the book inaccessible: in fact most of the text should be crystal clear."},{"Title":"Dance on My Grave","review":"I originally ran across this book in the \\"young adult\\" section of the library, but I think it is just as rewarding for adults as it is for teens. The author has a wonderful flair for language, and the story is poignant and engaging. If you enjoy this, I'd recommend checking out the other books in this series... they don't share characters or story, but they do share certain thematic elements, as well as the author's unique style. My personal ranking for the series (from most favorite to least favorite): 1) Dance on My Grave, 2) Postcards from No Man's Land, 3) Now I Know, 4) The Toll Booth, 5) Breaktime... I have to admit that I haven't yet tackled This Is All."},{"Title":"Dance on My Grave","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago and I havent been able to forget about it. It was a great story of two young men who fall in love and find their lives turned around by their situation. I recommend it to anyone looking for something out side the norm!"},{"Title":"Second Trip","review":"In this very readable novel Silverberg addresses issues somewhat similar to those he wrote about in \\"To Live Again,\\" but whereas the plot of that novel was something of a soap opera, this one is more of a traditional adventure story.In the future, serious criminals like rapists and murderers are punished by having their identities erased. An artificial personality is created and implanted in the criminal's empty mind, thus creating a productive member of society. In this novel, however, the personality of the criminal, a famous artist, has somehow survived the process, and the body's new and original personalities battle for control. Silverberg describes this battle for dominance and portrays the character of the combatants in an arresting fashion, and the supporting characters and the world they all inhabit are also pretty interesting.\\"The Second Trip\\" merits a strong recommendation to Silverberg fans. Not as good or \\"literary\\" as the brilliant \\"Dying Inside,\\" but definitely in the same league as \\"To Live Again,\\" \\"The Glass Tower\\" or \\"Shadrach in the Furnace,\\" and more \\"adventure\\"-oriented than those, like, say, \\"Man in the Maze.\\""},{"Title":"Second Trip","review":"This is very much subpar Silverberg, with some of his favorite themes present but his usual literary grace absent. The hero, Paul Macy, is literally making a fresh start in life as the product of future justice: Having decided that capital punishment is unjust, society now erases the memories and personalities of violent criminals and replaces them with fictional identities. Unfortunately for Paul, the previous occupant of his head -- a sculptor and serial rapist named Nat Hamlin -- isn't ready to go away, and he begins making a comeback after Paul has a chance encounter with Lisa, Hamlin's former lover. The resurgent Hamlin carries on a guerrilla war within Paul's skull, disrupting his life while probing for ways to regain control of his old body. There are several graphic depictions of rape and near-rape, and an overall feeling of coarse nastiness -- early in his career, Silverberg made good money writing pseudonymous porn novels, and even the scenes of consensual sex have a clammy feel that makes them hard to distinguish from the rapes. Lisa is telepathic, and as is often the case in a Silverberg novel, psychic powers only make her more vulnerable to the random fantasies of would-be sexual predators. They also play a role in the novel's pat, too-abrupt ending, which leaves the reader with the feeling that Silverberg had tired of his idea and slammed it to a conclusion."},{"Title":"A Vast Army of Women : Maine's Uncounted Forces in the American Civil War.","review":"A Vast Army of Women not only relates the stories of Maine women and their important contributions to the war effort, but provides some very important contextual information about the formation of the Sanitary Commission. Furthermore, the book discusses the relationship between the Sanitary Commission and the army. Sudlow's history reveals that although unprepared for the casualties of war, the U.S. Army strongly resisted the help of the Sanitary Commission that saved many lives merely because it was from a source outside the military.Sudlow's research uncovers the tales of women, although having Maine connections, that could have been from anywhere in the northern United States. In fact, one woman lived in Tennessee. These stories, collected from manuscripts and lesser known documents in many cases, highlight the important roles that women filled during the Civil War and in fact may have influenced the outcome of the war. Also, the stories illustrate that although disharmony existed between some of the nurses, many long-lived friendships were formed. Within the biographies included here, a reader can also discern the changing role of women as they took on burdens far greater than the traditional domestic role.Do not be fooled into thinking that this book is about local history. It reflects northern history during the civil war with its indepth look at Maine women.This is a very valuable addition to women's history."},{"Title":"A Vast Army of Women : Maine's Uncounted Forces in the American Civil War.","review":"What a wonderful job Lyn Sudlow did! This is such an important book, which highlights not only the unsung Civil War heroines of Maine, but represents the &quot;vast&quot; contributions of all of those women who will never be identified, from every State. The book clearly folows their struggle to rise to the unimaginable duty required of them during the War, and how the strengths they exhibited (rewarded, but often not), set the stage for the Suffrage Movement which was to follow. They proved themselves on many levels, and there would be no turning back! I cherished reading about each one of these women, most biographies being accompanied by a photo. The book was thoroughly researched, intelligently written, and well-edited. You don't need to be a historian to love this book! I enjoyed learning about everything from the shapes of the donuts sent to the troops, to the strength, courage and fortitude it took to manage a major medical operation on no budget and scarse supplies. (And, of course, an occasional &quot;cat fight.&quot; I wonder how well I would have interacted with Dorothea Dix, whose responsibilities were unfathomable.) Again, this is a great historical contribution. I'm so grateful to Ms. Sudlow for publishing her extensive research, and look forward to her next work!"},{"Title":"A Vast Army of Women : Maine's Uncounted Forces in the American Civil War.","review":"Book was exactly what I was looking for. Seller was very prompt in shipping it to me."},{"Title":"The Blade's Edge: Forever After: Volume One","review":"To be quite honest, I'd never read a book like this before... Yet this is a book for exactly that kind of person. It was easy enough to approach, and even easier to pull you in completely. History and myth are mixed with little regard for modern preconceived notions on long standing legends, but that (combined with a roaring good story) is what makes it so fresh. And the worst part is that the further back you trace his myths, the more accurate they are. Zealous Camelot purists beware, deceptively this book accomplished the impossible task of not only getting me to forgive his disregard for how I thought these myths should be, but to forget he'd ever bent them in the first place.That being said, this is not a story of Camelot. It begins there, but the story soon plunges deep into uncharted territory, eventually ending up somewhere in Eastern Europe on a manhunt for Mordred more nefarious than you've ever imagined him to be. It is unique, and yet has roots in stories older than the written word. The main mythologies mentioned are Irish, Welsh, and Arthurian, but has ties that bind it to the Norse and as far back as the Egyptians.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Blade's Edge: Forever After: Volume One","review":"The strange, macabre world of The Blade's Edge is one of myth enticed by history. This isn't true alternate history in that it's not about how the world would've worked out differently by changing bits here and there. The only &quot;what if&quot; is &quot;what if Arthur was not the one meant for Excalibur?&quot; and this really only effects the story told, not the history revised.That being said, this book is equal parts horror, fantasy, tragic love story, and epic saga. Heroes fall from grace and villains attempt redemption, in fact the whole story seems to turn around from where you expect it to go. He treats his work like Poe, striving to preserve a sense of beauty throughout the story, even when the reader is forced to stare deep into the darkness. At times disturbing but never blunt, this book could vilify the sunrise or make a train wreck beautiful.The mythology referenced can be a bit obscure to the average reader, but there's an entertaining glossary in the back. Tongue often in cheek and very witty, it gives the reader enough background that I actually recommend reading it first.Quin Xavier, our flawed and tragic hero, must face life after Arthur with the weight of Excalibur in his hands. His love, his life, all are gone. This is primarily the story of his fall from grace, and the attempt of Bowen to redeem him. Bowen mac Nessa, his friend and former mentor, is the last true knight of Camelot and eventual hero of Ulster. Bowen and Morrigan (of Irish legend) are searching for Quin who is on a desperate hunt across Europe for the one responsible for all this bloodshed, the monster known as Mordred. Add to this intriguing subplots involving an undead castle guard and the roman witch who loves him, the machinations of enigmatic eldritch beings from the dawn of Egypt, the sword of kings, and the fate of the world in one man's soul.The Blade's Edge is never what you expect. Just when you think you have a good lead on where the story is going, it plunges head-long in another direction. Heroes become villains and vice versa, and the writer has the opposite problem of most in that at times it seems as though he delights in torturing the characters we come to care about. But as angering as they are at times, the plot twists make sense. He is completely faithful to the story, taking it where it needs to go, whether it hurts the reader's feelings or not. You may end up hating the author but you will love the story.I'm definitely eager for more.Edgar BlackadderDark Fiction/Fantasy Rampant Review"},{"Title":"The Blade's Edge: Forever After: Volume One","review":"This book really grabs you, it's one of those that you just can't sit down until you flip the last page and realize there isn't anymore.

From San Francisco, to New York, to New England, to Germany, they never fail to give me accurate and useful information. I bought the Green Guide to Italy and it is as chock full of goodies as any of the other half dozen guides I own and love. It is not laid out by region (which is the only reason why I gave just 4 stars), but, instead, by city. Since I know the alphabet pretty well by now, I got over my initial disappointment! The guide does a very good job describing the best things to see at all of the major tourist cities - Venice, Rome Florence and Milan. It even gives useful information on smaller, but interesting, cities like Gubbio (a GREAT town to visit). The size and shape encourages you to carry it along with you and the high quality of the paper and binding means that it will last through several trips. If I could only own one book on Italy, this would probably be it - it was the first I bought. It doesn't give insights into places to eat or hotels, but there are the red guides..."},{"Title":"Michelin the Green Guide Italy (Michelin Green Guides)","review":"Michelin may be too superficial on mainstream places like Rome and Florence, but if you need a guide to cover destinations that are less obvious, this is definitely your choice.Maps are very good.

And thank God they are not too shy to use plenty of pictures - apart from Eyewitness Guides, few publishers do this.Language is not brilliant - it often has the &quot;translated&quot; feel.Michelin is not very strong on practicalities - you will probably need something in addition to this for covering day-to-day questions.

I like the stories in this book different than others because the situations are vivid, believable, things that could and do happen every day at school, like... I WORE MY WWJD BRACELET TO SCHOOL AND THE CLASS BULLY ASKED ME WHAT IT STOOD FOR, DO I TELL HIM? Other stories include kids playing video games and resulting conflicts, comic books, tithe, neighbor friends, Sunday School...so many more. After each devotional story, there are multiple choice questions for you to read with your kids or them alone. Sometimes, more than one answer is possible, one is better than the other. The answers really get kids talking about the right path that should be taken, and also an opportunity for kids to share similar things/stuggles they've encountered and how better they can choose to react next time.

Making breakfast/brunch is a joy for me and I have not been disappointed by anything I have made!"},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"This book is not only beautiful - it is FULL of recipes, useful information, 4 pages of brunch menu suggestions, and a lot of suggestions for varieties of the same recipe using different ingredients, i.e. pancakes 8 different ways using the same basic recipe.If you are ever in a food rut, tired of eatting eggs and bacon, looking for healthier alternatives to start your families day - this is the book for you.How about cobbler for breakfast, pg 39? So easy - I LOVE it made entirely with fresh organic strawberries! I mix all the dry ingredients and cut the strawberries without washing the night before. In the morning - I wash the berries, mix wet and dry ingredients pour over berries - (generously butter the casserole dish - yum) - 5 minutes total and pop into my preheated oven! My family wakes up to a delicious warm, gooie, healthy fruit breakfast....This is one cookbook in my collection that is covered with my notes and food splatterings - well worth the space it takes in my house - it's a keeper!"},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"Mollie Katzen's new Sunlight Cafe is delightful to read and the illustrations are great. Some of her recipes are truly innovative and may yet convert non-breakfast eaters. Mollie Katzen confirms that any food can be good for breakfast. But the recipes are not all easy to prepare in advance or don't seem to store well (like her crunchy millet muffins, frozen and reheated), and some may be daunting to anyone but the most experienced cook. You have to be brave to make babka for breakfast! The real breakfast foods can be found mostly in the \\"How To\\" sections and in the amusing little stories interwoven in the text. Egg and tomato tartines - delicious! But it also shows that the best treats are not necessarily those planned for and meticulously made in advance. There are easier and similarly delicious and nutritious ones in the Moosewood Classic cookbook."},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"Seems like it's probably a decent cookbook for what it is. I was disappointed to realize that it is very nearly completely vegetarian (Canadian bacon in the eggs Benedict was the only meat component I could find with a cursory perusal). Nothing wrong with that, I suppose, if that's what you're into. I just would've liked some indication of that in the item description and/or reviews as veggie bacon, smoked tofu and wheat-free pancakes are not my idea of a good time."},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"If only Mollie Katzen's food was as feather weight as her gee whiz, Ma, tone. But is there anyone nowadays (short of people running a marathon) who can eat like this? Obviously, Katzen hasn't gotten the message that America's gone low carb. However what she lacks in recipes, she more than makes up for in enthusiasm. Back when she was leading the vegetarian vanguard, (look behind you, there's no one on that parade anymore), her hype convinced because all the world needed encouragement to eat veggies. But now we've heard that a million times. So she's turned her attention to breakfast (whoopee! it's breakfast) but this presents a major challenge, because eating French toast, porridge and the other foods she recommends more often than once a season will fatten you up real fast. I realize that recipe books like this one are mostly just fantasy reading as most people try to stick to the latest diet-- and usually people who write them don't pretend to be health conscious. But Ms. Katzen does. What happens when your healthy shtick is no longer healthy?"},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Caf&eacute;, is a beautifully produced book with original art by the author, and interesting mini-articles at the beginning of each section. (Katzen also has nice introductions and incidental notes within the articles that make them fun to read.) Many recipes include variations that make the book full of possible recipes and combinations. I especially liked the two introductory chapters about breakfast: \\"Make Room in your Life for Breakfast,\\" which includes a short look at breakfast around the world, and \\"Breakfast for Metabolic Health,\\" which discusses how breakfast contributes to our overall diet. The book contains over 300 recipes with sections on breakfast beverages, \\"Vegetables for Breakfast\\" and a delicious-looking chapter on \\"Potatoes, Beans, Tempeh & Hashes.\\" Katzen states that most of the recipes take less than 30 minutes to prepare, and many take less than fifteen.Unfortunately, there is no nutritional information with the recipes, and only 3 1/2 pages on menu planning at the back of the book. Sunlight Caf&eacute; is also obviously designed for lacto-ovo vegetarians as it relies heavily on dairy and eggs, and many recipes are not suitable for vegan substitutions, although Katzen says you can always substitute soy milk for cow's milk. While there are vegan recipes in the book, they're not labeled, so vegans get the not unpleasant chore of wandering through the chapters soaking in all the interesting tidbits while picking out what recipes to prepare.--Reviewed by Amy O'Neill Houck"},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"Mollie Katzen's self-named book \`Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Caf&eacute;' is a very welcome addition to the very small number of books available on breakfast. As I have just reviewed a classic, \`The Breakfast Book' from the widely recognized author, Marion Cunningham, it seemed only appropriate that I tackle this new breakfast book by an equally honored writer who is best known for her books on vegetarian cooking co-authored with the Moosewood Collective.Before I loose you in my usually long discourse, let me say that this book can do more good for your eating and health than just about any three other books put together. This opinion is based both on the quality of the book and the special position of it's subject.Most people give less attention to breakfast than to either lunch or dinner. This means that breakfast is the one meal where the room for improvement is the greatest. It certainly has a higher potential for improvement than lunch, as most people eat lunch outside of the home. Even if they carry lunch from home, the range of foods, which can be made portable without special equipment, is smaller than what can be prepared and eaten in ones own kitchen.This book is directed not only at a very wide range of good breakfast food, it is also directed at giving you the information you need to eat a nutritious breakfast with few or no \`empty calories.The book starts with a brief essay on how the body deals with carbohydrates, especially upon eating the first meal of the day, or, \`breaking fast'. The long and the short of this story is that you are much better eating whole grains with protein and good fats rather than sugars and quickly digested starches. The remainder of the book is dedicated to making this option appealing.The recipe chapters are:Beverages: The straight skinny on coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and smoothies.Fruit, including fruit salads, dried and roasted fruits, and crisp or cobbler.Grains, Cereals, and Porridges, including an excellent tabular presentation of grain cooking characteristics.Muffins, Biscuits, Breads, and Buns, including all the classics plus great stuff with bran and whole grains.Eggs, Tofu, Scrambles, Quiches &amp; Souffles, or Protein Central. Lots of basic methods.Potatoes, Beans, Tempeh &amp; Hashes. Lots of Potato recipes and unusual hashes.(Other) Vegetables for Breakfast, especially tomatoes, mushrooms, and spinachGriddle Foods: Pancakes, Waffles, Blintzes, Crepes &amp; French ToastYogurt and Cheese: Lactose central with (mostly) ricotta and other soft cheeses.Puddings and Custards: Sweeten up your egg protein and vegetable goodness.Condiments, Sauces, Toppings &amp; Spreads with syrups, sauces, salsas Jams, Aioli, Ketchup, etcBreakfast Bars, Coffee Cakes &amp; Sweet Somethings: Home for lots of nuts, berries, and seedsMenus, or how to really do a healthy pig out on Sunday morningThe book is laid out with lots of sidebars on tips and techniques which make it very easy to read and to find what you are looking for. Each chapter title page gives a complete table of recipes in the chapter. Almost (but not quite) as good as a complete list of recipes in the front of the book. Be sure to check the index when you are looking for a specific recipe. French toast, for example, appears in Griddle Foods and not Eggs or Breads and Potato Pancakes appears in griddle foods and not under potatoes.The author wins me over completely when she quotes the line on omelets by Elizabeth David that says that the perfect omelet recipe is the way you make it. Another good quote describes an omelet as nothing more than eggs, butter, and body English. Of course, she goes on to give detailed instructions on how to make a good omelet and says it is not easy. Moral of the story, read and emulate her directions, but don't get too hung up on the result not looking like something done on the Food Network. Just keep practicing until you are happy with the result.Not nearly enough has been written about the economics of home cooking versus prepared foods. Ms. Katzen's recipe for granola is probably an excellent place to start. A quick look at the health food aisles of my local megamart shows designer brand containers with less than a pound of food for prices that would make a beef fillet blush. Granola is a product that is almost completely foolproof to make from ingredients that individually are very, very cheap. And, I checked out those same health food aisles in the megamart and I found every single ingredient in bulk.To repeat, Ms. Katzen's book is probably one of the very best places to start in improving what you eat. It is a very nice bonus that the list price of the book is significantly lower than the average cookbook and the artwork done by the author is truly delightful.Very highly recommended. Easy for people with little cooking knowledge."},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"I never gave much thought to breakfast, but Mollie Katzen sure has! And she is her usual contagious self in this unusual new volume, as she shares hundreds of ideas and many, many simple recipes with healthy undertones and delicious overtones. And speaking of tone, hers is never dogmatic or preachy, just very informative (with interesting asides and anecdotes) and personal encouragement, helping us realize just how important it is to have something decent to eat as early in the day as possible, and sympathizing with how difficult that is for many of us. It would have been easy to write a breakfast/brunch book oriented specifically to leisurely weekend entertaining, and although this book covers that (a nice list of user-friendly menus appears in the back) it mostly focuses on the challenge of a good breakfast on busy weekdays. I've tried about 6 of the recipes, and they have all been delicious. Try the Chai Oatmeal and the Wild Rice &amp; Quinoa Muffins with Dried Cranberries. I also loved the Breakfast Gingerbread and the Homemade Chocolate Chip Protein Bars. A winner all around, complete with lovely full-color art by the talented Ms. Katzen! A bargain at the price offered here (and even a bargain at full price)!"},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"I bought this book, read it cover to cover--which is not something I typically do with cookbooks--and within the first three days of owning it had tried four of the recipes.My breakfasts have been more varied and I've made a number of the dishes for use at other times of the day. I've also made items over the weekend for consumption during the weekday mornings. I think I've made more dishes based on this book in the short period I've owned it, than I have from most of my other cookbooks.I've changed my techniques for making eggs and some other basics based on her recommendations too.I was very inspired by this book and I think all of my recent cooking reflects it. I already had two other books by this author. I've been showing it to all of my friends and encouraging them to buy it too."},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"Mollie Katzen's books are in their own category, and they just seem to get better and better. Her latest, &quot;Sunlight Caf&eacute;,&quot; in the opinion of this reviewer, is her best! She writes in a personal voice and her recipes are very much geared to the ordianry &quot;non-foodie&quot; peron, while inspiring to experienced cooks as well. In this latest work, she has shed new light (play on words intended) on the subject of breakfast, addressing not just more complex recipes for weekend brunches, but also (and mainly) nutirious and reasonably (and often very) convenient ideas for busy people running out the door on weekdays. Throughout, there is a spirit of optimism (which she talks about as symbolic of the morning meal) and encouragement. Some of the ideas are really quite surprising, like Gaxpacho as a morning drink, or delicious little nuggets made out of dates, peanut butter and flax seeds as a nutritionally dense, easy, freezable breakfast-snack. As someone who always liked the idea of breakfast without figuring out a good way to include it in my daily life, I feel that I am now equipped with inspiration and information to make a change. I am especially impressed by the large number of healthy muffin recipes, which I will now bake and keep in my freezer. Also, it bears mentioning that Mollie Katzen is an accomplished artist, and the gorgeous full-color illustrations in the book are all her handiwork."},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"I already love Mollie Katzen--her lovely artwork and ideas about eating, however unorthodox--always inspire me to try new things. Sometimes these experiments are a crashing failure--but the winners make it all worthwhile! This book in particular has piqued my interest. I have not used the recipes, but I am reading and rereading it. I picked it up partly based on my interest in all of Mollie Katzen's books and partly because I had initially opened it to the page with the recipe for Vanilla Ricotta Muffins. &quot;Just like Italian Cream Cake&quot;...I can't wait to try it. Her breakfast menu suggestions are also giving me new ideas for making my breakfasts, especially on weekdays, more interesting, healthy, and imbued with &quot;soulful intention.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe (Mollie Katzen's Classic Cooking)","review":"This is my favorite book EVER!

I can work with that."},{"Title":"CCSP: Securing Cisco IOS Networks Study Guide (642-501)","review":"This book has a lot going for it. Lammle and Timm are obviously knowledgeable and generally present information in an easy to understand, well organized fashion. I particularly enjoyed the last chapter on Easy VPNs. Short sweet, easy to understand with lots of good info. I also thought chapter 5 was well written - lots of useful tips on how to use CBAC, which seems like it can be especially helpful in securing a network. I like that the book has practical information as well as what you need to pass the exam. The CD is also worthwhile, providing 2 bonus exams (though the answer to question 19 in the first exam has a glaring error that reflects a disturbing lack of understanding of the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption that is fortunately not duplicated in the book), an electronic version of the book and flashcards.One annoying thing about this book is that each chapter warms up with a page or two of useless fluff. The book is also riddled with easily correctable though sometimes amusing errors. A few errors are listed on Sybex's web site (which is worth checking out before you read the book) but not nearly all of them. The first chapter is the worst and should probably be skipped altogether. In it the book makes some interesting claims - for example, on pg 4 that TCP/IP has operating system weaknesses (a bizarre claim to make about a protocol suite) and that because of NAT, there is absolutely no reason to use real IP addresses (surely debatable). On page 12 the book claims that \\"ICMP attacks are known as 'The Ping of Death'\\". Hm, I always thought that was the name of one specific ICMP attack. Silly me. On page 15 the book claims, in rather amusing fashion, that \\"the latest trend in the attacker game is the smurf attack\\" (certainly not true even in 2002 when the book was written) and that \\"Smurf attacks send a Layer 2 (Data Link layer) broadcast\\" (I'm sure Lammle and Timm are aware that ICMP is a layer 3 protocol). There are simply too many to list. Errors are sadly not confined to the first chapter. On page 310 the book claims that the Easy VPN Client does not support DH1 (I believe they meant the VPN server). This contradicts page 308 and the answers to the review questions. The explanation of IPSEC theory (ch 7) and configuration (ch 8) is convoluted, incomplete and should definitely be covered in at least 3 chapters.Perhaps there was a last minute rush to get the book published or maybe quality control is slipping a bit at Sybex. In any case, this book is pretty good but it could have been great with a bit more work.Additional note: I just took the test and passed it using this book and a Boson practice exam. There were at least 5 questions on SDM on the test (if the test focused on anything I would say it was SDM). Router MC was also covered. Neither topic was covered in this book - though the Boson exam had more than enough info on each. Concentrate on simple topics for the test - it doesn't delve into anything in great detail (I imagine that's saved for later in the CCSP process)."},{"Title":"CCSP: Securing Cisco IOS Networks Study Guide (642-501)","review":"This book will help you pass the exam but you will have to use the Cisco web site to get up to date info on SDM and Management Center if you want to score above 900. You can get upwards of 6 questions on SDM on the exam and every point counts towards the 860 pass mark.

The book is only good in conjunction with the latest Cisco Press books.The main problem is that this entire Sybex CCSP series is outdated. Cisco added to their tests and updated their books after these were written. (i am giving them the benefit of the doubt there). These book leave a ton of stuff out. There are also some errors in the questions.Bottom line is that these books do not stand up by themselves."},{"Title":"CCSP: Securing Cisco IOS Networks Study Guide (642-501)","review":"Another great Todd Lammle book. I just passed the exam today with 922 points, 860 points being the minimum passing score.I love the encouraging words after a tough chapter for example, telling you what a good job you have done. I generally love the humane writing, that really helps you understand the technical terms. The book misses the &quot;Managing Enterprise VPN Routers&quot; subject comletely so it would be a good idea to find some information about this subject elewhere before taking the exam, just to improve your chances. However if you study the book hard enough you will still pass. There are a few errors here and there, but you should be able to spot them, reading through the material.

If you are a beginner, this is not a quick read. Altough this is not what I consider &quot;leisure reading&quot;, I'm very thankful that Mr. Lammle added a little humor to his writing.

There is a big chance that the exam will hold quite a few questions on these topics as happened with me. With a passing rate of 860 you just can't afford loosing valuable points just because it wasn't in the book. I am now reading the cisco press self study book (Published: Apr 21, 2004), and indeed like one of the other reviewers says, they might sometimes be crammed with in depth information (perhaps even too much for the exam).

High fashion details, starting with the truly bizarre jacket on the cover, are probably not for the majority of us. The photos are an interesting history of fashion but I don't know how much of the interesting touches and admittedly time-consuming processes would find their way into anything I sew. I don't necessarily want my clothes to last forever and end up in the Smithsonian, so I would not recommend this unless you are really, really into detailed, multi-process construction work."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I bought this book many years ago and have used it for so many specific questions. Please note, this is not a basic sewing instruction book, but if you know the basics and are somewhat bored by the industry standard instructions (as I was, even for the vogue advanced) this book will open your eyes!! Please realize that many (most) of the things explained in this book involve hand sewing - that is just the way it is done!! Personally, it is my favorite way to sew and it showed me so many instances of how things get that gorgeous look - all the inner goings on, so to speak!!! I love to just read it for everything from proper pressing, finishing of seams, handling of seams that cross other seams, etc - things that are not taught these days - but they make such a difference in the look of garments. Also, there is an entire chapter devoted to evening wear - my own daughter's petticoat under her silk duchess satin wedding gown is straight from in-depth detail given of a Dior petticoat from the early 50's. You need a working knowledge of sewing to really understand this book. But, that said, you would not believe how many many many things that standard instructions tell you to do will interfer with the gorgeous couture look - it takes time, and LOTS of it!!! You have to love to sew to do this type of work, and realize that the garment is done when it is done, you can't rush this stuff!!! But, if you have the time and the desire, this book will tell you how to get that gorgeous couture mark to your clothing. Although the photos are not current, this is not a drawback in my opinion - this is couture - the golden age of couture, at that!!! This author also designs patterns for Vogue Pattern Company, and they are very good! But the book is in a realm of its own - so much information, you just can't imagine!! Good luck on your sewing..... this book will make your efforts better!!"},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This book was out of print for a while.

It is a \\"must have\\" for every serious sewer.Even if you aren't going to go through all the hand work required for couture sewing, you can always improve the fit with application of the construction details found in this volume. The fashion fabric is only the beginning, and most patterns provide minimal instructions that are only suited to the fabric the pattern envelope features in the photo on the front. And, even then, those instructions are woefully lacking if you want to make a perfect fit from what you are sewing. The pattern companies are catering to the average sewer, when so many of us want to make something that is absolutely a WOW when wornI've found that applying some of the construction hints, especially for interfacings and reinforcements on those summer frocks that are sleeveless or that have thin shoulder straps holding the dress up, can make all the difference. If you interface, apply backing and other construction \\"helpers\\", a $5 remnant can become a dress you'd have to pay hundreds for in any decent store or boutique. The book also shows how to embellish construction details so as to eliminate ridges, bumps and other irritations when putting something together.Best advice is to make sure your dress form is properly fitted to you, and then use the dress form to fit, fit and more fit for a perfect fit in the end. Ms. Shaeffer has encouraged me to go ahead and make a suit or dress out of expensive material without fear of wasting my money.She also provides several approaches to every construction detail. Making garments is construction, and very much application of engineering to achieve perfect drape, flow and fit. Couture is in the details, and the details make all the difference. The book doesn't intimidate either, nor does it make you think beautiful garments are out of reach for average sewers. You can still do shortcuts, but when you understand the reasons behind a pattern's construction helps to clarify even the worst drafted instruction sheet.Many of the tips and tricks of the atelier are geared to sewing and tailoring tools such as interfacings that aren't the press-in variety. But, if you know how a press on interfacing works with a given fabric, you can still achieve many of the great results without investment of huge amounts of time for hand sewing. Finishing techniques also recognize that shortcuts are inevitable for tailors and home sewers alike. Details for seam finishing cover all the best techniques, and give the results each will achieve. They are also well described with excellent illustrations and easy to follow instructions. I keep this book near the machine for constant reference.When you are debating whether or not you should pay some of today's prices for fabric and patterns, this book will help you look like you are wearing a $50,000 dress, put together using $50 in fabric. Or even a tenth of that. I sew to make things that fit better than anything off the rack could ever fit, and I am very pleased with this reference book. If you want your sewing to fit perfectly, get this book, a good iron, and a dress form. The rest will be a piece of cake.Or French pastry, so long as it doesn't make those hips enlarge. yt"},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"The introduction is interesting and basically explains why Shaffer is qualified to give you this information. The rest reads like a text book, which, for me, is much easier. When I reach a road block with sewing, I simply refer to the applicable section and determine what stitch, seam, technique would best solve the issue. There are decent diagrams/pictures to walk you through each step. It discusses each type of seam, tools and their purpose, threads, needles, etc. It's a sewing dictionary.Chapters include:PART I1. Inside the world of haute couture2. The art of hand sewing3. Shaping the garment: seams, darts, and pressing techniques4. Edge finishes: hems, facings, and bindings5. ClosuresPART II6.

It offers valuable fashion history and methods used in couture sewing. It catalogs important dates that changed fashion and it offers random pictures of various sewing styles. My only disappointment was that the pictures are limited in number. I would like to have seen more visuals of the methods described and up close details of the ballgowns, in particular. This book makes you realize what an art form sewing can be.It gave me a sense of aesthetic beauty and appreciation for the talent that brings the fabric to life."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I am in the process of starting a couture label, and this book has taught me amazing things.

However, the instructions when provided are better explained and diagrammed in the Vogue Sewing book - 1982 edition complete with color pics. The new edition of Couture Sewing does have lovely photos of some older couture clothes that illustrate a point of design or sewing but the instructions are not extensive enough for a novice, and too basic for someone with experience - I would look for a different how-to book if that's what you need."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"this is an excellent book for the person who wants to learn about couture sewing. instead of taking that expensive university class, one can read this book and practically get the same experience."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"Thoroughly researched, insightful and well written, this thoughtful and informative book presents the topic of fashion creation for women as a serious subject. It provides a history of the couture industry as it developed beginning in 1850 through today, an overview of the significant changes in fashion during that period and the relationship to historical events.This book also provides and well illustrates the fitting and sewing techniques which created this fashion. Both common and obscure techniques inspire the reader to try this at home. Anyone who sews or appreciates fashion will enjoy and learn from this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I have enjoyed sewing for years, but when I committed to making my daughters wedding dress, I knew that I had to step up my skills. This book has been a wonderful reference to get those special details into the design. It is easy to read with lots of examples of sewing techniques and construction information. I have also enjoyed learning about the process involved with couture construction. The book has helped to boost my confidence.When I first looked at the book I was struck by how outdated the reference fashion photos were, but realized it was not a problem because the techniques were still current, so I quickly got past that. I love this book."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I got this book as an inspiration, along with another, more basic book to teach me how to sew (that's right, I am a total beginner). Now, even I made fun of me a little for buying this-- if I can't even use my sewing machine yet, isn't trying to learn Couture Sewing Techniques putting the cart rather before the horse?No. Here's why:This book explains something I hadn't realized. Most couture clothes are hand-sewn, and many of the techniques described are for hand sewing. But not just that- things like customizing or matching fabric patterns, attention to certain details, or even the proper way to press a garment during the making of it are all good things to know as any point in the learning process.So, now that I have read this, when I tackled my first machine-sewing project (a sewing machine cover in a pretty victorian-wallpaper patterened fabric), I didn't just cut out the pieces and go; I matched the motifs on the fabric so that it flowed nicely all the way around, and added contrasting piping and a pretty hem detail. When I needed to fix a seam that had opened at the side of a delicate top of mine, rather than just plowing through clumsily, I used a hand-sewn overlock stitch to keep the seam invisible and secure. I wouldn't have thought to do these things if I hadn't read this book. I expect that as my sewing progresses, I will discover even more wonderful tricks that I hadn't absorbed through my first read-through.Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This is a very wonderful book! I have sewn from childhood and come from a family who worked at all levels of the garment trade from factory worker to sample maker. I never sewed professionally but aspired in my personal sewing to be the best. This book not only showed the inner workings of a world of sewing even higher than what I am familiar with but also gave explicit technical information on creating details that I had never done. One of these was how to make a corselette to go inside the bodice of a dress to preserve its line and free the wearer from wearing foundation garment that may spoil the effect of the dress. Also her list of sources is very helpful especially with so many local fabric stores closing. I was able to find a source for the spiral steel boning and cotton tulle needed to make the corselette. My factory sewing relatives could never understand the fine hand sewing techniques that make the difference in creating couture garments. This book justifies those of us in my family who have done this for years to produce magnificent results and also shows there is a level even above this."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"The first moment I got it in my hands, I nearly fainted in excitement. Never did I thought that I could ever get to see inside couture garments--at least long enough to study the details. Ms. Shaeffer had collected a majority of garments, from Yves Saint Laurent, Dior, and Schiaparelli and photographs from Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. It's rather amazing to see the inside of these garments and study their complexity.First Ms. Shaeffer reviews the basics from what thread they use to permanent stitches to sew the garments. She even reviews the steps you would take if you wanted to purchase a couture garment...if you had 50,000 - 100,000 to spend...on one garment. Then each chapter is dedicated to a different part of the garment, such as the seams, one chapter completely devoted to the sleeve, another for the lining, blouses, dresses, tailored jackets, evening wear, etc. My absolute favorite is that she goes over designer details, such as the Dior pocket, and the goodie of them all, the Chanel Jacket. Chanel is creative in ever sense of their couture garments, such as their quilted lining and gold chains basted for weight, and Miss. Shaeffer goes over it all. I'm even impressed that she goes over the embellishments as well. She guides you on how to create beaded garments with the Tambour hook, which is the fastest way to bead a garment.I haven't been able to put this book down. It is filled with pictures, actually couture garments--vintage and new (new at publishing date in 1980/1990s). I've learned so much and I hope to put these techniques to use."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"Having tried to find books for advanced home and hobby sewers in German (almost impossible), I came across this book, and have never regretted buying it a single second. And having aimed at perfecting my skills with regard to creating wardrobe, I was amazed about how little I have known so far. Why could I not find such book a lot earlier!!Even while browsing through it, a lot of questions that I had always had were simply solved by reading instructions, and by the conciseness of the illustrations. My only - personal - problem is that the language is quite technical, and at worst, I have to read with a dictionary by my side, as my English is not so advanced on technical discussion level, but all of Ms Shaeffers instructions are self-explanatory and very precise.I strongly recommend this book to anyone ready for a new challenge in spicing up their wardrobes. And yes, even if you 'only' use the odd trick here and there, your clothes will start looking different - much more professional - as you start paying more and more attention to little details, and learn to avoid mistakes by focusing on how something should really look like - not that I wasn't focused on what I was doing before, but this is like the difference between your first watercolours and your first picture in an exhibition.Thank you, Ms Shaeffer, for taking the time to write this absolutely, truly, wonderful book, and keeping good traditions alive."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I'm sure you are not surprised that I gave this book 5 stars; but you are probably surprised that I read reviews. I even read the \\"bad\\" ones so that I can eliminate these issues next time. I'm particularly pleased when someone new to sewing writes that it was helpful or when someone who has been sewing \\"forever\\" writes. My workshop students include both.For the newcomer, the book includes a variety of techniques which you will find helpful to improve your skills and understand why you do some things in a particular way. If you are an expert or simply more advanced,you'll find applications for techniques which you already know. I cease to be amazed at the many things I've seen on couture garments; they weren't difficult to sew I just had not thought of doing them.One of the most overlooked elements in this book is several sections on fitting. This book is about the craft of sewing, not fitting, so these sections or short, but they will help you understand how to correct fitting problems.Like most of you, I have limited time to sew; but I rarely sew anything that doesn't have a few couture techniques. I might add that I much prefer basting to ripping.Best wishes to all for many happy hours of fine sewing.Claire"},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This book is full to the brim with all those details that make the highest end clothing so desirable, with clear instructions, detailed diagrams, and photos of couture garments with the techniques discussed (and cross-referenced on other pages where additional techniques appear). My only complaint is that I didn't even find out about this book until very recently, and it wasn't for lack of research. I highly recommend this book not only for constructing a personal wardrobe, but also for hand-stitching instructions and construction on authentic historical replica costuming, as the details are more than clear enough to transfer to disparate applications."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"If you buy only one book about sewing...well, it probably shouldn't be this one. But if you buy more than one, this would be an excellent choice.This book was something of a godsend for me. I draft many of my patterns from scratch, and heavily alter any store-bought patterns I use. Some of the standard sewing how-to books (like Vogue's) are hard to beat for easy reference and the sheer breadth of topics they cover, but because they are written for the widest possible audience, they can be frustratingly over-simplified on certain topics.Example: I had spent hours scanning through books and the web trying to demystify set-in sleeves. I kept turning up the same information over and over again: how to ease the sleeve cap, how to join the sleeve to the garment, how to perform very basic alterations. None of this was very helpful when it came to drafting a sleeve. How wide should the sleeve cap be? How tall? How steeply should it taper? How much extra, exactly, should be added for ease? Here, at last, are the answers to those questions.I found the writing to be exceptionally clear and accessible, in fact more so than most \\"beginner\\" books. Even if you have no intention of copying the painstaking construction techniques detailed here, there are lots of little tricks and techniques to help you fit garments more precisely, construct them more easily, and achieve a finer end result.If you like making clothes but hate for things to scream \\"home-sewn!\\" then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"Fantastic book, hand sewing techniques being the art in itself. Written in a friendly way, making it possible to achieve a really finished fit and look for the clothes.

Beautiful to look at, and wonderful for all seamstresses.This book is good in particular for costume/ historical sewers.

I thought I was going to enter the world of couture and not have to go to France. I like how the author talks about the couture world, it gave me a lot of inspirationg. When it got down to technique, I thought some of the descriptions were a bit confusing and I wish the author would have said more on pressing. She showed the pressing tools, but did not explain the techniques in using them.

Well worth the money."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This was one of the first \\"moving beyond beginner\\" books that I bought -- on the recommendation of my sewing instructor. I find Ms. Schaeffer's writing technique to be clear and concise. One of my biggest complaints about other books is that they may or may not show how the techniques that they are discussing are incorporated into true couture work. In this book, Ms. Schaeffer illustrates the technique, describes how you would make the technique work, and then has lovely pictures of garments by Valentino, Givenchy, Schiaparelli and other houses where they utilize the technique.The other thing that I particularly like about this book is that -- while it assumes that the reader knows how to use a sewing machine -- it also emphasizes hand work techniques. So much of what distinguishes couture technique is exceptional, perfect hand sewing. So, that was much appreciated.I would recommend this book for intermediate sewists -- i.e., those who have moved beyond the simple pillow case, have made a few garments, and are interested in kicking their sewing up a notch. As the title implies, it is garment-focused and the illustrations are primarily (if not exclusively) women's garments.

Couture sewing is not for the faint-hearted or impatient so, if you're drawn to this kind of book, you must already have some stick-to-it-iveness.

This is not average everyday sewing but meant for your best flight of imagination."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"Not only does this fine book describe haute couture, but it explains why \\"high fashion\\" is classified for clothing that made specifically for individuals and runways.

Because I've been sewing on and off for a long time, I was interested in perfecting my skills on sewing. This book is excellent! She talks about the history of the industry which I thoroughly enjoyed, and talks about how hand sewing is the basis of couture sewing (haute couture) which I did not know. Another book I found interesting was [[ASIN:0935278281 Couture: The Art of Fine Sewing by Roberta Carr. This touched on machine sewing more so than hand sewing.

In addition, most advanced sewers would probably still do best by using this book as part of a couture class.I agree that more step-by-step instructions would be helpful, as well as a spiral binding. It also should be supplemented with more interesting clothing illustrations, although the current ones are very impressive from the point of view of technique."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"The book is a must for any dressmaker to give you insight to the couture finishes.

I was a bit leery of the word \\"couture\\" being in the title but I was hoping for some timeless finishing techniques that would look really great.

Drawings illustrate techniques and sewing of some elements, photos give overview of construction of the item.However, such outline makes it a mix of sewing and construction which is hard to read and understand.

I cannot stress that enough. I purchased it with the hopes of taking my home sewing to the next level by designing looks and incorporating couture techniques into their construction. The book arrived yesterday and I have yet to put it down!As other reviews state, there is a strong emphasis on what haute couture is and what it means. Nearly all of the techniques are for hand sewing (which is how almost all haute couture stitching is done), but there are techniques that can be adapted for machine sewing (although this may seem to some as taking away from the integrity of haute couture sewing, some of us don't have infinite time and patience for hand basting and sewing every seam, and as I stated, my personal intention for this book was to integrate couture techniques, not use them exclusively). However, there are many cases in which hand sewing is the only way to achieve certain looks and the book goes into deep detail with very clear illustrations of how this is done.For me, this book contains everything I was looking for! It not only goes into detail about how to complete each technique, in most cases it tells the fabric type it works best with and how to apply it to different parts of garments.

She details how great fit and fine details are achieved in the couture houses and shows a home sewer how to do those techniques and details when to use them. Claire Shaeffer really knows her subject, and of the stack of sewing books I've purchased this is my absolute favorite. A truly great book!

Interestingly both have some basic hand sewing techniques but this couture book covers more than a few not found in the guide.I recommend this book for anyone interested in constructing well fitted, well made garments. You may not produce couture but with the techniques here you can do some amazing things. As an inexpensive aide to these endevors I would suggest making a duct tape dress form (lots of tutorials online)."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This book is not a beginner book, unless you are a VERY adventurous and determined beginner. This book details the steps involved in couture (very high end hand made) sewing. If you want a garment that is every bit as well made as a ten thousand dollar dress by a Paris couture house, this is your book. If you want to make something fast using a serger, this isn't your book at all.As usual, many of the examples show the author's or creator's style, which may not be yours. Often instructional examples are chosen for their clear demonstration of a specific technique, not for their overall beauty. so don't be fooled by the fact that you don't like the style or design of the examples! this is a technique book. i suggest strongly simply getting some scraps of fabric and practicing the technique on those \\"waste fabrics\\" rather than assuming you need to make THAT dress, or that you need to try it first on a real garment.(also, many techniques will make more sense to you when you have fabric \\"in hand\\" ..a chronic issue with book explanations of any art or craft)This book will not explain how to make an outfit fit you, or how to do basic sewing, or how to select a pattern. Ms. Shaeffer has other books for these topics, and i heartily recommend them. This book details how to do couture level bindings, pockets, buttonholes, facings, and some fitting tricks, as well as details on enhancing your darts.After 26 years of crafting and sewing, i am finally pursuing a degree in fashion Design, and am dealing with people at all levels of expertise and skill. This book is going to sit and gather dust on your shelf if you want fast and easy machine sewing, but if you want to take that dress or jacket up from \\"i made it myself\\" to \\"WOW! YOU made THAT???!!!\\" this book will be dog eared and worn out in no time.Ps. i suggest photocopying (for your own use only) and laminating the techniques on buttonholes and other techniques you use frequently to keep in your sewing bag, otherwise you will end up (as i did) destroying the book by frequent use.PPS. those are not cockroaches or random bugs on the cover; the author chose to use cicada shaped buttons. an example of \\"your style may vary\\" in action.

I've been sewing for 40 years and never knew how different couture sewing techniques are from those the rest of us commonly use. As precisely used in this text the word &quot;haute couture&quot; only applies to those 20 or so designer houses in France who meet certain strict standards regulated by the government. Fascinating!This is a book to read and study, lots of carefully detailed text and good photographs of haute couture designs and finishing techniques. Did you know there are at least five different hand basting stitches and even more permanent hand sewing stitches for garment construction? Did you know couture houses don't use paper patterns? That their seam allowances are usually at least one inch wide? That most of their basting is done from the RIGHT side of the garment? That most seam edges are finished by hand -- even into the curve clips? That most garments are constructed entirely by hand? That steaming, shrinking and molding garment sections by pressing are as important to the shaping process as the sewing? And I'm not just talking about pressing seams open here. Wow! And I thought I knew how to sew.While other books may use &quot;couture&quot; in their titles this book means it. While I've said this isn't for the fainthearted anyone who sews clothing will find some new and accessible technique here. Grab it, keep it near your sewing machine and if you only add one new technique with each project your skill, pride and satisfaction in your work will grow immensely."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"Though there are wonderful pictures of couture garments, this is a how-to book. It is filled with detailed instruction and many easy to follow diagrams. &quot;Haute Couture&quot; is defined, and the chapter &quot;Inside the World of Haute Couture&quot; will be of interest to anyone who loves sewing or clothing. Then she goes on to discuss many couture techniques and applies them to a number of garments that any intermediate sewer could duplicate. This is how you get from intermediate to advanced! The best book I've found for information on women's tailoring, and it includes my favorite reference when someone asks me how to make bound buttonholes. If you want to take your sewing to the next level, get this book in your library."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"Firstly I'd like rebut the comment given by the person who said that the techniques were unnecessary, outdated and could easily be found in the internet. I purchased this book because I couldn't find any website that spoke to the techniques found in this book in any straight-forward detail (The pictures are invaluable). Do a search for \\"couture sewing\\" and you'll find sites by ready-to-wear vendors incorrectly labeling their garments 'couture' or fashion schools offering classes.As to the \\"outdated\\" comment, a lot of the garments shown are by the designers when they were alive. So you'll see a Dior or Chanel garment designed by THE Dior and Chanel, not the later designers working for their respective houses. Granted the designs might be considered 'dated' to some, but art doesn't go out of style; and the techniques used in the garment assembly can easily be applied to the latest runway fashions seen today. All you need is a little imagination.Most people don't have the time to sew every stitch on the garment by hand. Note, though, that this is a book on haute couture technique where handsewing comprises 95% of the work done in couture houses. There IS something to be said for the control provided by handsewing. Most of the mistakes I've done on garments may not have taken place had I sewn by hand because of fabric unintentionally caught up in seams, etc. Also some fabrics are very unforgiving, and cannot withstand repeated machine-sewing/ seam ripping. A little time spent on planning from muslin to garment goes a long way. I find this book user- friendly; easy to read and refer to while working (though it would have been nice if it were spiral-bound). There is an adequate index/glossary in the back and the few unknown terms can be Googled for clarity.Lastly, I feel that this book is for people who feel that if they're spending time on stitching a classy garment (i.e. wool/linen suit, wedding gown, vintage restoration, historical re-enactment) they might as well spend time on the detail."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This is an indispensable guide for anyone who wants to take the next step toward creating exquisite, professional garments. It will transform your sewing from finished to &quot;professionally finished&quot;. It is accessible even to beginners who have reached the level of creating a basic garment.The book is clearly written and walks you step-by-step through the most simple hem to complicated padding techniques, frequently using drawings to help visualize the instructions.Shaeffer includes background information and uses for each technique, as well as beautiful color photos of dresses and suits from Schiaparelli, Givenchy, Dior and others as examples. The book is a beautiful piece of publishing on its own, using fine paper, endpapers and backing, making owning the book as pleasureable as working with it.As a student in fashion design at Parsons School of Design in New York City, I have found Couture Sewing Techniques to be the book I turn to most often as a resource for sewing my designs. I couldn't recommend it more highly"},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I wanted to learn what differentiates a haute couture garment from a ready-to-wear garment or a garment custom-made by a seamstress or tailor. Then, I wanted to know HOW to incorporate couture quality into a custom garment. This book gives just enough history of the haute couture industry and a very detailed description of haute couture processes. The numerous hand stiches are explained in detail, along with where to use each stitch and which threads are appropriate. The first section of the book explains the couture process and techniques in detail. In addition to the above, it includes garment shaping, edge finishes and closures. The author also references techniques common to home sewing, but does not waste time describing them since they are readily available in other sewing books. The remainder of the book describes examples of different garment types and gives construction and fitting techniques unique to each type of garment. Each page is an education and the illustrations (photographs and artwork) are well selected to illustrate the techniques and results. With the anecdotal information the author provides, it's like a virtual field trip. This book is a pleasure to read and a gold mine of information."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I have encountered a good deal of frustration in learning to sew because it seems that most of the books available focus on sewing things fast and taking shortcuts. Given that one can buy inexpensive, fashionable clothes at Target or Ross Dress for Less, my focus in sewing is to make clothes that are better than what I can afford to buy. If you want to take the time to give your clothes the best possible finish inside and out, this is the book. The instructions are clearly written. The only draw-back to some readers might be that the book is written in narrative form. Use a hilighter while you read so you can easily find the techniques you want to use. Also, the techniques are sometimes not illustrated."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"My background is basic alterations and sewing from commercial patterns since I am hard-to-fit, but this book explains what goes into the $10,000 dresses that is missing from the $100 dresses. It also goes into the history behind 'couture', which is very fascinating for the layperson.It covers basic clothes selection for your body type, since what looks good on full-figured but beautiful Queen Latifah would look odd on thin Paris Hilton, even in a size 2. It also describes how most fashions need to be adjusted for variations in the more average figures in order to hang right, but if done right, can hide your figure flaws and make a person look as glamourous as the Movie Stars on Awards night.With all the specialized fitting and sewing techiniques it descibes, the book will at least sure help my $40 clothes items I make look more like professionally sewn $400+ items instead of something made in High School Home-Ec class."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I based my purchase of this book upon the recommendations of the comprehensive ratings of the obvious experts. There is little I can add to what they've already said except that I concur wholehartedly that this is THE book to own if you are ready to construct pieces of art. Even if I had 100K or so to spend on a garment I doubt that it would prevent me from wanting to experiment and attempt to master the techniques of these couture geniuses. I haven't been able to put this book down long enough to start sewing anything. I have been sewing and knitting since I was five years old and I considered myself to be advanced in both arts. However, I fear that I'm but a novice compared to what I've learned from this one book. I've always considered that the inside of each garment should be as complete and as presentable as the outside so this book is right up my alley. Those who complained that the styles are outdated clearly have no idea of how classic and timeless pieces like the Chanel jacket are and how the techniques can be used for ANY fashion forward pieces. The possibilities are endless for the seamstress looking to advance and at least touch the hemlines of couture sewing. Whether your creative enough to design your own patterns or just follow the trends of pre-printed patterns, this book will be a resource for everything you make. I can honestly say that I didn't study for my MBA with this much enthusiasm. My only wish is that it were spiral bound with heavy-duty plastic-coated pages because I will use it forever."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I've sewn a lot starting with all my many cocktail and formal dresses as a teen, whole wardrobes, kid's clothes and I rate this book a deep bargain and one the home sewer who aspires to fine clothes ought to buy. Now.Who should not buy it? If you are in love with your serger and have perfected 92 ways to avoid basting or marking fabric, forget it. If a wardrobe in a weekend is what you want, this would definitely set you on a different track that's not going that way. If you can't see the difference between a $30 skirt and a $300 skirt, let alone a $3,000 one, you probably won't care for half the stuff in this book. But if the idea of making your own couture quality clothes excites you, this is your book.This is not for the uncertain beginner who wants to know everything, but a brave beginner could use it and learn a lot about finishing and fitting alongside standard pattern instructions. The intermediate and experienced sewer will get the most from it fastest. The basic theme is how couture differs from everything else. For instance--far fewer darts. For instance a lot more hand sewing, even of major seams. It is explicit in the areas it covers, exactly how to mount a collar, or exactly how long a basting stitch should be and when you should use a running stitch or backstitch. Which end of the thread from the spool goes in your hand-sewing needle. Now there's something most of us never even thought about,and it is a tiny thing, yet knowing the right way helps. There are a number of techiques that make usually difficult areas a lot easier.The beauty of this book is a subtle one. Claire Shaeffer can write lucid instructions. It is not an easy thing to explain sewing steps that don't sound like jabberwocky, and she can.Some will hate the old pictures, but those with designer instincts or artistic types will understand them as inspiration and examples to prime the creative spirits.I've already improved my finish product with a couple of techniques. Wish I had this book 30 years ago."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This book expanded my design vision and awareness of the techniques and structure underlying many haute couture creations.Claire gained access to many famous designers and offers us detailed descriptions of how some of their creations were made. Her sections on hand sewing establish the foundation in Part 1 of the book. There are several photographs of the inside construction of featured outfits to illustrate the finishings and techniques used.The diagrams although detailed are rather confusing. There are too many arrows and descriptions to assimilate at one time. However, a breakdown of step-by-step procedures would've expanded the book too much so I understand why the diagrams are this way.What this book will teach the reader is how to think and visualize like a worker or designer in the haute couture. There is no formula that will be applied across the board. Each couture creation requires different consideration for choice of fabrics, underlinings, linings, notions and threads. This book will give you a good launchpad."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This book is not a beginner's text; if you are still struggling with basic techniques, then this is not a suitable text; there are a couple of complaints which essentially amount to, \\"This is too hard for me to understand,\\" but in actuality the book is extremely easy to follow, precise, and descriptive -- for readers with sufficient knowledge to understand what is being discussed."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"Claire Schaeffer takes us through a survey of the couture sewing industry, but in such a way that we can benefit. As a home sewer, I was able to use many of the techniques I learned right away in projects ranging from making new garments to completing my mending pile. The photos in the book are beautiful, and there are illustrations to help you understand the concepts explained.What surprised me was learning that while couture sewing techniques tend to take longer, they make sewing much less frustrating. In North America, we are often not familiar with the many hand stitches that were once common knowledge, nor where the best place to use them is. Claire's book shows how and when to use the many stitches utilized in couture houses, and also what makes something \\"couture\\" in the first place.I highly recommend this book for any sewer interested in improving their skills."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I recently purchased \\"Couture Sewing Techniques\\" to expand my knowledge about sewing.

I am hard-pressed to find anything in this volume that I could not have learned in other, more well-rounded guides, and to top it off, several of the techniques and ALL of the stylings in this book are out dated.As other reviewers have mentioned, several of the techniques are not accompanied with pictures, and the instructions for some techniques are difficult to understand even with illustration (unless you already understand the techniques -- then why purchase this book?)I'd purchased this in hopes to add some new techniques to my repertoire, and being that I've already studied seamstressing for many years, I thought this was the ideal place to begin. I was wrong, and regret spending my money on a small volume containing no information I couldn't have found in greater detail on the internet for free."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"I just LOVE THIS BOOK !But, i must say, i think it's for advanced users only.When is Claire Schaeffer coming out with a new book that takes it even further.I work in the couture industry and this is really a good work."},{"Title":"Couture Sewing Techniques","review":"This is a marvelous book; as I read it, I was continually inspired to try to make the best clothes possible.

However, the book is essentially useless for potty trainers. The entire book is just Elmo telling people he has to go, he has to go. He doesn't explain that he has to go potty.

Finally he gets home and tells his mother he has to go and she helps him off with his suspenders so he can go to the potty. The main complaint seems to be that Grover never says he is going to the potty until right at the very end. I don't see a major problem with that.

And I heartily enjoyed Travels With My Aunt. Apparently, Graham Greene described it as \\"the only book I have written for the fun of it\\" (which doesn't speak so well for his other novels), and it was quite amusing, but also somehow serious at the same time (in a way.) The narrator of the book is Henry Pulling, a retired bank manager with nothing much to do. He meets his Aunt Augusta at what he believes to be his mother's funeral. She may be seventy-five, but she still travels and convinces Henry to come with her to travel the globe. Their first trip? Istanbul, via the Orient Express. Aunt Agatha also has many tales of her various adventures in various places, with various men. She was quite comic, especially the way that she talked about things. And Henry, who has never done anything dangerous in his life, finds himself mixing with all sorts of not-so-respectable company.I was pleasantly surprised by this one, though I have a feeling that not all of Graham Greene's works are so humorous and light. But it was a good place to start, and perhaps will help me enjoy other novels of his. Also, I got the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, which was quite beautiful designed, with a nice cover image (a dahlia, I believe.) I would definitely recommend that edition (I'm not sure if there are many others available anyway.)All of my reviews can be read at my blog novareviews.blogspot.com."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"It's a late and a bit 'slow' but lovely novel from the English master Graham Greene who has always been interested in religious matters.

All the same, it's a light-hearted novel and not at all suffocating or depressing in the way it teaches the \\"lesson.\\" I checked it out of the library for the first read, but plan to purchase a copy for my next long bus/train/car ride!"},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"This is a wonderful book, and its depth -- which is not apparent at first glance -- comes out when you examine the contrast in personalities between Harry and his aunt."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"I was in Vietnam about 20 years ago. Our tour group included a delightful Spanish couple and German teacher couple--and an Italian Communist who developed a special liking for me, saying I reminded him of The Quiet American. When we returned to Bangkok, he presented me with a copy of Graham Greene's book. I filed this away on a book shelf and forgot about it. Perhaps five years ago, I became interested in Greene's works, and I now have a nice collection of novels, autobiographies, and travel books. Some of the great author's writings are more interesting to me, but I don't rank his works. For example, I should not place \\"Travels with My Aunt\\" below, say, \\"The Comedians.\\" The main theme of \\"Travels\\" is the corruption (or should I say education?) of a retired, fiftyish bank manager, Henry Pulling by his septuagenarian Aunt Augusta. Henry and his Aunt meet at the funeral of Henry's mother, who Augusta informs Henry is really his stepmother. But who is Henry's mother? Could it be his Aunt or perhaps the little old woman who visits Henry's father's grave at Boulogne? We never learn. We soon meet Wordsworth, a sturdy native of Freetown, Sierra Leone (where Greene did secret work during WWII). Wordsworth is a reliable source of pot and apparently one of Aunt Augusta's many lovers. Henry's travels with his aunt get under way on the Orient Express, where Henry meets a young girl, Tooley, whose father was apparently high up in the CIA. Tooley had missed her period and feared her boyfriend had knocked her up. But her period arrives, and Tooley and her boyfriend and some other young people head for Katmandu, Vientiane, and Goa. (Katmandu and Goa were Hippie Havens at that time). I kind of hoped that Henry and Tooley would get together some time, but this didn't happen although Henry did end up with a close approximation. Henry and Aunt Augusta met some adventure in Istanbul, including transporting a very heavy candle, heavy because a gold brick was encased in its base. (Smuggling is an important business throughout the book.) Aunt Augusta liked to talk about her various lovers, especially Monsieur Dambreuse and Mister Visconti. The most important part of Henry's travels with his aunt began with a flight to Buenos Aires and from there a river boat to Asuncion, Paraguay. On board was Tooley's father, Mr. O'Toole. Shortly after Henry arrived, Colorado Day was being celebrated, and everybody was supposed to wear red. Henry had nothing red, so he borrows a red scarf from his aunt and sticks into his breast pocket. Suddenly Henry has a fit of sneezing and blows his nose on the red scarf, a crime that immediately leads to his arrest and incarceration and a bit of being slapped around by the authorities. O'Toole shows up and rescues Henry. Aunt Augusta has acquired a large but derelict house. Henry becomes aware that the main business is smuggling. Planes fly from Panama, and Dakota A/C carry the goods to appropriate estancias. Wordsworth had been on the boat, but is dumped by Aunt Augusta because Mr. Visconti has shown up. Of course Visconti is tall, tan, slender but muscular, and handsome. Except that he is rather the opposite--short, fat, and bald, with a gap in his front teeth. The novel ends with Aunt Augusta and Henry comfortably settled in the smuggling business with their own Dakota A/C, extensive renovation and furnishing of the mansion, and holding of a celebratory party for everybody who is anybody. Unfortunately, Wordsworth was killed as a tresspasser. Henry feels remarkably alive, knowing that his past (including his beloved dahlias and contact with old friends) has gone forever. Henry is slated to marry next year, when she is 16, the daughter of the Chief of Customs."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene is probably my favorite author. True to form, Travels with My Aunt is rich with dry, intelligent humor (sometimes not so dry), and subtle sharp wit.It's an unusual piece compared to prior Greene that I've read - even a bit of a farce. A retired English banker becomes entwined in the world of his very worldly aunt (or is she actually his aunt?). As implied, there is travel . . . from the Orient Express to the jungles of Paraguay. Lot's of characters, maybe too many for my tastes. I was lost occasionally.Unfortunately, for me it was NOT one fo those can't-put-it-down, can't-wait-to-get-back-to-it novels. Extremely well written, but not really a great story. Perhaps there was no clear \\"antagonist\\".A decent piece, but not representative of what made Graham Greene one of the great 20th century novelists."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"I found this to be an enjoyable, easily-read novel with great characters. Aunt Augusta is a marvellous character and it's fun to follow the changes her nephew Henry undergoes as he learns to loosen up from her example. Though it's more a book to read for fun than one that will &quot;change your life&quot;, it gives pause for thought about living life to its fullest."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Henry Pulling has settled deep in a comfortable, middle-aged rut when he discovers the secret to staying young involves a life of no small danger - thanks to an even-older aunt more or less on the lam. \\"Harold & Maude\\" meets \\"The Third Man\\" in this sometimes engaging if coldly relativist and cheerless Graham Greene comedy.Once upon a time, Graham Greene was a voice of moral certainty in a world of cultural upheaval. But by the time \\"Travels With My Aunt\\" was published in 1969, he had become rather French in his outlook on life. Free love and drugs were in while standards and mores appeared on the way out, a condition Greene seemed at pains to celebrate here through the characters we meet, particularly the woman who pulls Henry out of his rut.\\"I have never planned anything illegal in my life,\\" Aunt Augusta explains to him as she enlists on one of her many capers. \\"How could I plan anything of the kind when I have never read any of the laws and have no idea what they are?\\"As Henry gets to know his aunt, he discovers the world she inhabits includes smuggling, adultery, and maybe even murder. Sure, people get hurt, but as he gets swept into its undertow, he finds it beats tending dahlias.I wish I liked \\"Travels With My Aunt\\" more. Alas, both Henry and the author were far more enamored with the aunt than I was. She's given to making snippy observations about Henry's failure at making himself interesting, while pontificating on getting all one can from life. The relativist theme of the book is pounded shrilly throughout. \\"Regret your own actions, if you like that kind of wallowing in self-pity, but never, never despise,\\" she warns him. \\"Never presume yours is the better morality.\\"The novel does move easily enough. Greene's mastery of travel writing comes to the fore with scenic depictions of Paris, Istanbul, and Asunci&oacute;n. His ability to develop piquant secondary characters with a few stray phrases is on fine display, including an American who measures his own urine output for science and a next-door neighbor who lives for his goldfish and the old British empire. A sad woman with a love for tatting suggests a life Henry has left behind and the rough justice of choosing your own happiness over someone else's.But the novel never really gels. The aunt does one wild and/or dangerous thing after another, either in the narrative itself or in an amusing flashback she relates to Henry, with Greene holding up her unscrupulousness as a kind of honor. Much time is taken with Aunt Augusta's odd African boyfriend Wordsworth, who begs for money and talks in a rough pidgin dialect. His moment of highest comedy involves storing his stash of pot in an urn with the ashes of Henry's mother. Here and elsewhere, an ever-shifting plot comes across as strained and contrived.If you enjoy Greene's other novels, you will probably find \\"Travels With My Aunt\\" entertaining, if not quite as much so as other light novels of his like \\"The Third Man\\" or \\"Our Man In Havana.\\" Its cheerful cynicism is engaging for pages at a time. But I found myself missing another Graham Greene, one less enamored with just getting by who actually believed in something."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Another well-written novel by Graham Greene, \\"Travels With My Aunt\\" is a complete entertainment. \\"Travels\\" is one of Greene's less known novels. When discussing Graham Greene one thinks of novels like \\"The Power and the Glory\\", \\"The End of the Affair\\", \\"The Heart of the Matter\\" and the unforgettable \\"The Quiet American.\\" But if one's seeking absolute entertainment this one is it. If you liked \\"Monsignor Quixote\\" you would love this book. Henry Pulling, a bachelor in his mid-50s and a former bank manager, is enjoying his quiet retirement when he unexpectedly meets his aunt at his mother's funeral. He's vaguely familiar with her, but her entrance causes a tumult in his quiet life. Henry's a reserved, saintly man who always thinks of others first. He even remembers his parents with affection whose was a loveless marriage. In his spare time he tends to dahlias in his garden and corresponds with the daughter of a former bank client to whom, owing to his timidity, he failed to express his love. When his aunt suggests they take a trip to get to know each other, he doesn't foresee what it would entail. As he travels with her to different parts of Europe, along with meeting pot smokers, shady businessmen and a CIA spy, he gets to have some fun as well."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"\\"Travels with My Aunt\\" was penned by its greatly praised British author Graham Greene rather late in his long life, and his long, prolific, greatly-honored literary career. In fact, Greene wrote it past the point at which he divided his work into 'novels--' serious, like \\"The Power and the Glory,\\" and 'entertainments,' lighter, like \\"Our Man in Havana.\\" He probably would, however, have called it an 'entertainment.' Mind you, this novel never has been a critical favorite; nor has the movie, starring Maggie Smith, who was Oscar-nominated for the role of Aunt Augusta, made from it. (Most of his books were filmed).The novel is told in first person by its narrator Henry Pulling, a never-married, presumably virgin, stuffy, retired bank manager, looking forward to a lifetime of cultivating his suburban dahlias. At his mother's funeral, he meets his Aunt Augusta, absent from his life since his christening. She shakes him up, drags him on exotic travels, and gives him some better reasons to live. (It's noticeable that there's a certain family resemblance to Patrick Dennis's \\"Auntie Mame,\\" penned roughly a decade earlier. But these two books involve protaganists at different ends of life: a boy, and a retiree, and, let's face it, anything written by Graham Greene, no matter how late in his career, has his touch, and his thoughts.)The plot's episodic, and not as tight as some of the writer's great spy stories. But the book's well written. Furthermore, you can see the Greene touch in some of the book's flavorful characters. In addition to Aunt Augusta, there's the Turkish cop, Colonel Hakim, one of several powerful third world law 'enforcers' created by Greene. There's 'Tooley,' the airhead hippie girl met on the Orient Express (played by Cindy Williams, of \\"Laverne and Shirley,\\" in the movie.) And 'Wordsworth,' as Augusta calls him, an emigrant from Sierra Leone, a part of the world with which Greene was very familiar, as he'd spent World War II there as a spy. Wordsworth (played by Lou Gossett in the film) is fiercely in love with Augusta, a woman at least twice his age, and devotes his life to her.One of the more challenging results of the first-person narration is that the reader, like Henry, doesn't know what Aunt Augusta is up to, until we're told. There's a longish period, in terms of this short book, when Augusta is out of touch, and Henry thinks of really solidifying his suburban retirement -- as if it could be much more solid, he's already pretty well set in concrete -- by marrying a sad local spinster. In another interesting use of the first person, Greene does not always tell us what Henry's thinking: when the narrator at last realizes some of the central facts of his Aunt's life -- some of us might ask what took him so long -- he doesn't share his thought processes with us.\\"Travels\\" is short, and funny. And the subject matter is touching: a man no longer young, discovering family he didn't know he had, rescued from a dread life cultivating his dahlias by that family. What could be bad?"},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"This intelligent and entertaining masterwork remains with me for all of my days. I often reflect on this, or that passage from the book, it happens unexpectedly, without warning, or even motivation, yet there it will be, all encomposing and lurid. This writing becomes a part of you, ingested , it is there for all time; it will suddenly emerge filling the senses, a type of remembrence that you relate to past events experienced on a personal level. I often realize with dispare that the experience I'm remembering was related to me through a great work of literature, and then I smile fondly realizing that few works of writing have been affected in such a pleasurable manner. I only dispare for the poor souls that have never experienced this mesmerizing sequence of adventures, yet for the fortunate few who take this journey for the first time in all it's splendor and amazement, I only wish it were myself again releshing with abandon and joy this fantastic voyage for the first time!"},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Great premise: at his mother's funeral, Henry's long-estranged aunt, Augusta, tells Henry that his lifelong beliefs about his parentage are mistaken. This leads to the development of a relationship between early-retired banker Henry with his septuagenarian aunt, who has a most decidedly colorful background that is in fullest contrast to Henry's staid bachelorhood and isolated life. Lighthearted moments often develop from the contrast of Henry's straight-laced views and Aunt Augusta's rather unconventional perspectives about the importance of the means vs. the ends, laws, and romantic relationships. (Not to mention her thoughts on truth, which lead Henry to understandably doubt her revelation.) Augusta is a character, in both senses of the word, to be absorbed and enjoyed. Henry is the well-suited foil or backdrop for her. The British-ness of the writing, the product names, sometimes the pacing and phrasing were not sufficient to diminish the story, but led to some feelings of awkwardness. Some of the goings-on reflect well on the time the book was written, the late 60s, both its influence and international repercussions of World War II some 25 years after its conclusion. It was a pleasant read and I will both recommend it and look to more Greene, most likely his two most highly praised works: The Power and the Glory and The Heart of the Matter."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Travels With My Aunt is a fairly short amusing farce, that chronicles the impact of long lost Aunt Augusta coming back into the Henry's life.Aunt Augusta is very old (we never learn quite how old)but vital and lively dragging our initially reluctant hero half way around the world into a dark world of smuggling, South American Dictatorships and the CIA. Middle Aged Henry in contrast in cautious, timid, bored and dull in the extreme. A Bank Manager forced to retire early after a merger, Henry has thrown himself into a life of Daliah growing and visiting rather than worshiping at the local church, as his entertainment. Initially shocked by his wild octaganerian Auntie, he develops a taste for new adventure and living life on the edge.Travels With My Aunt is clearly not what you would call typical Greene, however it works because of the stark contrast between the characters. Aunt Augusta is a wanton disgraceful character that captures your affection immediately, while Henry is a good but boring man that fails to penetrate the emotions beyond a kind of grudging pity.Beyond the humor of his farce Greene challenges us to live, not merely exist and in doing so enjoy what little time we have. He illustrates that if we achieve the goal of removing all risk in our lives to guarantee longevity, we have destroyed the essence of life and longevity is therefore undesirable.In addition to the novel I have seen Travels With My Aunt as a very clever and entertaining stage play, which I would also recommend.This is not the authors greatest work by any means, however it is hugely enjoyable, very funny and has a message that we all would do well to heed. All in all a great little package that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Part 1 of the book is fun. Fun characters, fun plot, fun (and funny!) writing. For a while I did find it disturbing that the aunt's immoral actions were treated as free-spirited sources of humor, but I finally took my wife's advice and read the book for the fun work of fiction that it was intended to be. The first sentence of the book is one of my favorite first sentences of any novel I have read.Unfortunately, the fun stops in Part 2. I have three theories about Part 2. Either the author decided that the book he was writing in Part 1 was not the book that he wanted to continue writing; or the author wanted to play a prank on the reader; or the author's brain was taken over by space aliens. The aunt no longer wants to travel? She suddenly wants to stay in one place for the rest of her life? And in a crime-infested, corruption-ridden South American backwater? And her nephew joins her? And while we are at it, how about if we also kill off one of the readers' favorite characters for no good reason? None of it make any sense; none of it is fun. The author's editor should have handed back Part 2 and told him to try again."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene created an unforgettable female rogue character in the person of Aunt Augusta. Henry Pulling , a recently retired mid-50s banker , has lived a very conservative life. He is a model of consistency and fidelity. At his mother's funeral he meets his Aunt for the very first time and is drawn into a world of intrigue, smuggling, pot smoking and exotic travel that is in every way the polar opposite of his former existence. His shocked reactions and his slow realization of just what he's gotten himself into provides the perfect foil for the real star of this story which is indeed his aging yet restlessly exuberant Aunt.As Henry is drawn into her world and becomes acquainted with the characters she is comfortable with he begins to question his own past which seems all the more run of he mill as their adventures progress.This is a tremendously funny novel by a master of 20th century fiction and along the way as always with Graham Greene there is a bit of reflective wisdom thrown in. I am a huge fan of his work and this did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"This is a gorgeous edition of a wonderful book -- the cover art by Brian Cronin for these deluxe editions is absolutely gorgeous -- and other reviewers have thoroughly explained how it is one of Greene's later, more unusual successes. All that remains to be said is BEWARE ITS HORRIBLY SPOILER-FILLED INTRODUCTION.It'd be clear how much Gloria Emerson, its author, loved Graham Greene even if her only novel wasn't called 'Loving Graham Greene.' She relates some very sweet memories of meeting him in Antibes, 1972, for Rolling Stone. Then she lovingly reveals the endings of 4 or 5 of his best novels in as many pages. Why anyone, any publisher would print such disastrous introductory material, the world may never know.As with the other Penguin Classics Deluxe Editions of Graham Greene ('The Heart of the Matter' is another big offender), any page numbered with Roman numerals mysteriously insists on murdering your enjoyment of the timeless classic you hold in your hands. They'd do just as good to print the last chapter first. Skip the intro, enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Public fame and several commentaries about this book made me expect an \\"entertainment\\", as Greene himself called his more generic or relaxed books. I expected a purely comical book, full of British wit and crazy adventures. It is all that but, in the end, it is also a Greene novel, and his themes, or better, obsessions, pop up everywhere: the consequences, often irremediable, of what was not, or of what was and shouldn't have been; the intrinsic loneliness of each person; lost time; indifference before death; the original savagery. Of course, in this novel these subjects are treated in the key of farce. Somewhat like in \\"Our Man in Havana\\", but unlike in his most somber works like \\"A Brunt-out Case\\".At his mother's funeral, Henry Pulling meets his Aunt Augusta, a younger sister of the deceased's, for the first time in fifty years. After picking up the ashes, he goes to Aunt Augusta's apartment to have a drink. There they are joined by \\"Wordsworth\\", the Aunt's African valet-lover. After some drinks, Henry leaves, but suddenly remembers he has forgotten the urn and returns to get it. A little later, the police ring up in his house and ask for the urn, as they have suspicions that the ashes have been replaced by marijuana.This incident detonates the plot in which Henry will be involved. He is a solitary fiftysomething, a never-married virgin, recently retired as a bank manager. His only distractions are his dahlias and the Walter Scott novels he inherited from his father. His parents' story is strange and disturbing, and in fact his mother was not the biological one. Henry follows his aunt in a discontinuous series of trips with both sordid and comic adventures, first to Istanbul and the to Paraguay. Obviously, Henry starts discovering a totally different life experience compared to his own. Aunt Augusta has been and continues to be a dissolute, opportunistic, enchanting, cynical, and basically delinquent woman, which drags his innocent nephew into the lower strata of society, in adventures which show him the face of crime and corruption.Certainly not one of Greene's top novels, nevertheless he shows in good, even if relaxed, form. It also shows that, up until his old age, he never ceased to ponder on the mysterious workings of the human soul."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"I grew up in Paraguay, where the protagonist of this novel winds up, and Greene does an amusing job of portraying some of the subtleties of living in a dictatorship (like the danger of blowing your nose on the wrong colored handkerchief).

I liked it a lot, but sometimes I had no idea what was going on - much like the main character.Henry Pulling has spent his whole life trying to be a respectable English gentleman. He's about 50, retired from the bank, never married. At his mother's funeral he meets his Aunt Augusta. She is eccentric and doesn't care one bit about being respectable. She tells him some things about his father and mother, and Henry, intrigued, wants to further their acquaintance.Next thing he knows, his aunt Augusta is booking him as her companion on travels to other countries. He wants to say no so he can stay home and take care of his flowers, but he doesn't know how to get out of it. So he goes along.They have adventures together, and stiff Mr. Pulling begins to know his aunt, and himself, a little better.Aunt Augusta tells long rambling stories and never fully explains anything...which often leaves Henry (and the reader) a little confused. But I think this is exactly what the author wanted to do.This book is not going to be for everyone...but I'm pretty sure that if you like books such as Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson (books where a 'respectable' person learns to loosen up a little), you are going to like this book as well."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"This is a terribly mundane book. By using a boring middle-aged bank manager as the first person Graham greene successfully reduces travels across two continents to mere tedium. The obvious objective is to present extravagant and improbable adventures through the eyes of an innocent surburbanite and thus make them funny. It doesn't work - the bank manager is immediately accepting of his aunt's eccentricities, the humour is obvious and prohibitively antiquated (I admit it was written some time ago) and the description of the wonderful places they visit terribly superficial.

The British Empire-type characters might have been fashioned by Agatha Christie in the 20's and 30's. The only hint that the book was written in the '60's is the young American hippie girl the banker meets on the Orient Express to Istanbul.

It is flawed, mannered, contrived, old-fashioned, complacent; the work of a writer who has earned his laurels and is content to lounge on them. The frequent allusions to then-modish Latin American fiction (the novel ends up in Paraguay) only exposes its lack of adventurousness. Sometimes you wonder whether the maddening primness is the narrator's or the author's. Too often, Greene resorts to caricature rather than character, and even the splendid figure of Aunt Augusta feels like a writerly short-cut.But.'Travels' is one of the most purely pleasurable books I have ever read, largely due to the perfectly captured narrative voice, a middle-aged virgin, retired bank manager and dahlia expert unwittingly thrown into a world of smuggling, soft drugs, hippies, war criminals, CIA operatives, military dictatorships, and whose decent, limited tolerance keeps the fantastic narrative believable, but also blinds him to genuine horrors.The book contains some of Greene's funniest writing; if he'd written it 30 years earlier he's have called it an 'entertainment', those more generic or populist works that weren't overtly concerned with great moral themes. Today, these entertainments seem to have dated better than the 'serious' books.Of course, 30 years on and Greene can relax his style - the plot is less vice-like, the words don't imprison - rather, they eloquently express a developing consciousness and sensibility. This is a story that proliferates with stories, some comic, some tragic, some parable-lie, all leading inexorably towards one untold story. Like all Greene's novels, 'Travels' concerns modern man's search for home, and the ending is devastating, mixing imagistic beauty with characteristically flat cynicism."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Mr Greene's novel is the story of Henry Pulling, a 50 year old retired bank manager who lives a quiet life in Southwood, passionately looking after his dahlias. Henry meets his septuagenarian Aunt Augusta for the first time at what he supposes to be his mother's funeral. She quickly persuades him to abandon his monotonous suburban life to join her and travel her way. And so they make their way first to Brighton and later to Paris, Istanbul and Paraguay. Through her aunt Henry gets acquainted with a twilight society, hippies, war criminals and CIA agents. He learns to smoke pot and to smuggle large amounts of money from one country to the next.The character of Aunt Augusta is very witty indeed: she is wicked, selfish, wildly engaging, an old \\"belle de nuit\\" who likes men \\"who have a bit of the hound in them\\", a quality her nephew obviously lacks, which adds to her bewilderment. It is a feminine character, Aunt Augusta, who takes charge of the story, a rare fact for Mr Greene. She becomes a fierce, bossy and intrusive mother figure for Henry. Indeed he ends up by understanding and calling her \\"mother\\" a few lines before the end of the novel as he lays his head on his aunt's breast, feeling like a boy again who has run away from school and will never have to return. Finally Henry is completely transformed by his aunt and, at 50, begins to blossom. He sees her differently and acknowledges that she is not as wicked as he first considered her. In a prison cell in Paraguay, Henry notes: \\"I would certainly have called her career shady myself nine months ago and yet now there seemed nothing so very wrong in her curriculum vitae, nothing as wrong as 30 years in a bank.\\""},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"Finally, a Graham Greene book I sort of liked (following disappointing experiences with Stamboul Train and This Gun For Hire)! That said, it's not great stuff, but it's at least fairly entertaining, diverting, and sad. The tale is of Henry, a middle-aged bachelor (and presumably virgin) who has been forced to retire from his bank job after 30 years. He's a total zero, dull and timid, with nothing to look forward to but 30 years of watering his dahlias. At his mother's funeral he meets his Aunt Augusta for the first time since his baptism, and she immediately rocks his world by announcing that his mother was in fact not this biological mother. She then proceeds to disrupt his empty life by insisting on his accompaniment for a various trips, notably a ride on the Orient Express to Istanbul, and a furtive trip to Paraguay. She's old, but with way more zest than her nephew, and their interplay is a clear call for everyone to live life and not let it drift by (carpe diem and all that). Of course, her interpretation of this involves smuggling a gold ingot, running around with a young Sierra Leonian pot merchant, and tracking down her Italian war criminal lover-all while spinning tales of her life and loves. Of course, it's obvious to everyone except Henry that his &quot;aunt&quot; is his real mother, but that the one story which goes untold. In the end, it's hard not to feel sad for the pitiful Henry, whose passive approach to life is characterized as being a product of his upbringing."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"If you want to re-experience the joy of reading that you had as a child--when you couldn't put a book down, when you carried characters with you from day to day--this is one to read. It is about life and second chances and is an antidote to the rather 1984-ish world we are living in today: you experience that boundless life can never really be contained, nor a human life ever really circumscribed. I don't agree that it has \\"no plot,\\" it moves right along from experience to experience, event to event. It far surpasses most contemporary novels because Greene is a master of voice, tone, pacing and he knows a thing or two about the human character as well. It is at once laugh out loud funny, poignant, and extremely wise. I think it summarizes Greene's worldview quite nicely."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"I enjoyed this book but I found it disturbing in the same way that I find Nabokov's &quot;Lolita&quot; disturbing. Greene divided the chapters into two parts and they are very different in tone. The first is a light narrative of Henry's travels with his picaresque Aunt Augusta, who has many associations with people outside of the law. The second part of the book starts with an encounter by Henry and Augusta with a woman who has shown a long-time devotion to the memory of Henry's dead father.Augusta's antipathy to this woman sets the dark mood that underlies the remainder of the book. Augusta's unsentimental amoralism is no longer so amusing. Henry's involvement in this world is like Alice trying to establish residency in Wonderland. Henry remarks about how much he has changed and yet in some ways he has not changed at all. He moves from passively drifting in one world to doing the same in another. He is incapable of love or attachment and our sympathy toward him makes us question our own values."},{"Title":"Travels with my aunt (Heron books)","review":"If your idea of a good novel is something that takes you where you've never been before and leaves you wanting more, consider this one.

She proceeds to shake up his staid existence, and to make it abundantly clear that he ought either to join her in her reckless and dangerous travels or continue to roll downhill to a certain, but dull end. Lucky for us readers he chooses the former, though not without grave misgivings. The message here is to all of us middle-agers: Do you really want to stop living?

He was offered an arrangement after many years of devoted service when his bank was taken over by another. He is looking forward to spending more time with the dahlias that are his pride and joy, and also rubbing shoulders with his former customers in Southwood, an unremarkable London suburb that seems to be populated entirely by retired officers from the armed forces. He mentions Omo quite a lot and is vaguely embarrassed by the fact that he shares initials with a well known brand of sauce. And then he meets his long lost aunt, Augusta Bertram.Henry's mother has just died. His father died forty years before. He never really knew the father and his relationship with his mother was perennially tense. After the funeral, Agatha takes him on one side and calmly informs him that his father was something of a rogue and that his \\"mother\\" was really his step-mother, his true biological mother being one of his father's bits on the side. Henry Pulling finds himself attracted to his aunt, not because she is something of an eccentric, unpredictable old bird, but also because she retains, somewhere, the secret of his own origins. When she suggests they travel together, he eagerly accompanies, despite the fact that he has never been one for straying far from the nest.Graham Greene has Henry and Aunt Agatha travel as far afield as Brighton, Istanbul and South America. Together, via stories from Aunt Augusta's past, they relive the first half of the twentieth century, from late Victorian roots to 1960s drug culture, from fascism to dictators, from war to peace. Throughout, Henry Pulling comes across as a genial, predictable gent in his late fifties, whilst Aunt Augusta seems to be a confirmed member of Hell's Grannies. Europe - the world even - seems to be littered with her conquests, with hardly a country passing by without some faded memory of hers coming back to life.As it unfolds, Travels With My Aunt reveals itself as a true masterpiece of twentieth century fiction. The characters really do live through the century's history, but the events are never pressed onto the surface of their lives. On the contrary, they are entwined within the fabric of Aunt Agatha's being, a character whose complexity unfolds as the story progresses.Throughout Henry Pulling is a truly comic character. He seems out of his depth, nave, a product of an over-protected suburban existence, over-burdened with the assumptions of his upbringing. But he comes into his own and eventually it is no surprise when he describes his new life, which is almost as far removed from a suburban bank manager's office as it is possible to get. And, of course, the story's denouement, when it arrives, is also no surprise. And is not less because of that.There are many laughs along the way, not least as a result of Henry's being constantly taken aback by his aunt's bluntness and lust for life. Particularly memorable, however, were scenes where Henry put his personal foot in it. On Paraguay's national day, he carries a red scarf on his aunt's advice so he can show allegiance to the ruling party and the dictator. He just happens to be outside the military and political headquarters when he sneezes and uses the scarf as a hankie. A nearby soldier records the snotting into the national emblem as deeply insulting and irreverent, duly beats him up and slaps him in jail. Situation comedy at its best.Travels With My Aunt is quite simply a must read and must re-read book. Graham Greene's immense skill provides a simplicity of style and construction to communicate a complex plot alongside powerful characterisation, and all this accomplished with true but elegant economy. It is a beautifully crafted book, expertly written, full of surprises and humour, all set against a deadly serious plot: surely a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The philosophy of fire,","review":"This book really has a lot of insight if your looking to expand your views or how your perceive a lot of things I've read this book twice and still am learning something new every time."},{"Title":"Escape to Mexico: An Anthology of Great Writers","review":"Unlike the other reviewer, I had no problem with most if not all of the selections in this anthology being excerpts from longer works.

Well worth while!"},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"She not only writes well, but has the ability to desribe her restaurants in a manner which will match what you find when you enter through their doors. A characteristic which isn't always that common among restaurant reviewers. And if you take her advise, when you visit Paris, you should find the quality, atmosphere, and price range you are on the lookout for. She is a truly excellent restaurant reviewer, who has never disappointed me. Whether the restaurant is expensive or inexpensive, if Patricia Wells tells you the quality is high that's what you should find. And I've discovered some extraordinary restaurants through her guides."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"\\"The Food Lover's Guide to Paris\\" has been a terrific resource for a lot of years for anything to do with food, Paris and France. It includes recommended restaurants, food stores, kitchen boutiques, classic recipes, a guide to daily food markets and a food glossary, among other things. Patricia Wells' knowing and insightful writing is clear and ego-free throughout. I've been using the book for nearly 15 years of travel to Paris and rate it better than anything else of its kind.So why write a review 10 years after its last publishing date? Primarily to make a plea to the author and her publisher to update this bible some. There are more than a few restaurants and stores that have gone out of business or simply gone down hill. There are plenty of recipes from Well's other books that could supplant what's in the 1999 edition. And, I'm certain that Wells has learned more about this grand city in the past 10 years that could usefully be passed along to those of us who are only occasional visitors. So how about it, Patricia? Thanks in advance."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"This is a wonderful book but out of date so unless you are very familiar with Paris, or check other sources, it is not clear what places are still in business. The meal prices are all in francs but they do tell the relative costs. The book contains many recipes."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I was expecting a conprehensive guide to the best resturantes, something along the line of a better Zagot.. this is not what this book is... there are a dozen or so reviews of different restruants.. so i was disapointed in that aspect.. but the recommendations on the outdoor markets, the food shops, the linen shops, the Kitchen shops, the bread, mustard and on and on,,, was great... worth three times the price.... but not the best if your only looking for places to eat... but I recommend you purchase"},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"Ms Wells allows you to prepare for a gastronomic trip to Paris.Her essential information regarding types of eateries, locations, speciality foods, terminolgy and ofcourse understanding tipping is highly descriptive and beneficial.Choosing restaurants and food styles are of personal taste and may not reflect that of Ms Wells', but the guidelines established in this book provide many options. One can dine at a numerous amount of bistros listed in this guide and understand their specialities and price ranges effectively.As a person who has travelled to Paris, many restaurant guides are available and recommendations are abundant. I regret not having this book on my last two trips but will definitely visit some of the eateries listed in this book on my next trip."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I agree with the reviewer who describes Ms. Wells as overly generous to certain bistrots, brasseries and cafes, and I would strongly suggest getting a second opinion before choosing one based on her recommendation alone.

It didn't provide enough choice within a geographic area, and with respect to our one &quot;big night&quot; out, led us to a disastrous, expensive disappointment. Alcazar(p. 51) had miserable service (she had billed it &quot;exquisite&quot;) and a meal that had to go back. We did much better following Rick Steves' recommendations, and our own noses. If it's the third or fourth book on your list for Paris, as it was for us, save your money and the aggravation of carting the hefty thing around. It's not worth it."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"3/3/03 I Purchased \\"The Second Edition\\" of The Food Lover's Guide to Paris in May,1990 from a [local] Book store.....It not only gives insight into Paris(customs and costs) ,by Paris's equivalent to our USA zip codes locations(e.g 8th and 9th Arrondissements:location of Arc de Triomphe),but also by food specialty shops with a French/English Food Glossary; and two index alphabetical and food recipe).Patricia Welles's 4th Edition can only enhance a 'true masterpiece\\",which I found her 2nd Edition to be.

Was a Xmas present for father in law. And didn't like it.O k"},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I brought this book to Paris on a recent week-long trip, and had very mixed feelings about the reviews. About half of the recommended establishments were closed, moved, or under new names/management. If you use this book, calling ahead to verify that the restaurant exists is a must! The copyright date on this book is 1999, and many of the reviews must have been written or checked earlier than that. The reviews quote all prices in francs, which constantly reminds you of the age of the reviews, and the age of the quoted prices.Still, every one of the restaurants, bistros and cafes which Wells recommended, and still exist, were winners. Often times, the reviews suggest perhaps a too cozy relationship between reviewer and owner/chef, but I'm willing to overlook that somewhat, as that doesn't seem to spoil the quality of the recommendations. Despite what people may think, there are bad (well, not-so-good) restaurants in Paris, and price is not always proportional to quality. Having a guide like this one is key to painful trial-and-error experiences. I just long for an up-to-date edition!"},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I, too, spent only a few days in Paris and used the first edition of this book with wonderful results. I found the absolutely best croissant and cafe au lait spot for breakfast (Laduree) and a wonderful alternate for hot chocolate and croissants (Angelina). I picknicked at Flo Prestige, had a wonderful foie gras and sauterne feast in my hotel room, found the best bread, etc. etc. I also tried two wonderful restaurants (some of these on my second Paris trip). I only wish Ms. Wells would go on to a 4th edition. I have always recommended this book and plan to take it with me for my trip this month. I was looking here at Amazon to buy the next edition. This book made my Paris trips. I only give it 4 stars, since I want a new edition!"},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I thought that this book was a good 'coffee-table' book overview of the restaurant scene in paris that would also be useful as a cookbook. Unfortunately I really didn't find it useful as guide because it was too lengthy and wasn't organized in way that made it easy to scan through and find a recommended restaurant in the style you are looking for.I think this book is best suited for someone who is living in Paris or moving there and wants to be able to savor many restaurants over a long period of time."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I was frustrated with this book's organization. I wanted to know things like which restaurant had the best chocolate mousse in Paris, which were the best values for the money, etc. With only one weekend in Paris, this book was too detailed for me and too difficult to quickly navigate."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"As I consider &quot;Food Lovers Guide to Paris&quot; an old friend, I was really pleased to see a timely update to one of the most useful travel books I know. I highly recommend it to anyone with a good appetite who is contemplating a visit to the City of Light.In this fourth version of her classic, Ms Wells again does a superb job of ferreting out and reviewing top notch restaurants, cafes, bakeries, pastry shops, wine bars, candy makers, markets, and a myriad of specialty shops - anything and everything that has to do with food in the food capital of the world. Some notable names from the third edition have been dropped and some exciting new ones added.Some restaurants have been in all four guides, but an update was certainly necessary for those who enjoy the finest of fine cuisine: three years ago, the celebrated superstar chef Joel Robuchon retired. Today, several of his talented former assistants are now running their own kitchens in Paris, and their food can be absolutely stunning. My girlfriend and I visited two of these restaurants last autumn, (during the wild mushroom season, of course!), and were blown away by the exquisite food at both establishments.Those looking for dining bargains will not be disappointed, as a good many of the recommended restaurants are not only quite affordable, but also offer wonderful value for your money. Good food, simply but imaginatively prepared. Included amongst the latter are several wonderful regional restaurants, if, for instance, you would like to try some of the specialties of the Southwest or Provence.As there are other serious restaurant guides available, perhaps the most uniquely useful chapters in the book are those devoted to specialty shops. Whether you are looking for fresh truffles, old cookbooks, designer china, or the most specialized and esoteric of cookware, using this book you will be able to find it.As another reviewer pointed out that the book features a number of recipes (I think the reviewer was peeved by this), I thought I would add my two cents: every recipe I have tried from other editions of this book has been at least very good; some have been superb.Finally, as usual, there there are many, many explanatory notes and a very good glossary that covers a large amount of French food terminology. First time visitors to Paris will find both the notes and the glossary VERY useful."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"This is the only guide that I brought with me to Paris for my 2 months stay there. Here's what I like about this book:1. The food dictionary on the back! Eventhough I can speak/write/read some French that I don't need to carry regular dictionary around, the food terms sometimes confusing and this book has an excellent section on it.2. The recipes are worth trying. I tried her recipes for madeleine and financiers, both turned out excellent.3. Ms. Wells not only give restaurant guides but also specialty shops, bakery, etc. Some of the recommendations are well secluded from mainstream tourists. A trully excellent find.Here's what I don't like about this book:1. Many of the restaurants featured are expensive, especially for 2 months stay in Paris. I think there's plenty of cheap and reasonably good food that I could find. I used Ms. Well's recommendation for weekends/special occasions.2. I think this book is a bit too heavy/thick to carry around."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I bought this book (from Amazon of course) about 2 months ago. I read it cover to cover before our Paris trip. We ate in about half a dozen of the resaurants. She was completely accurate. . . the prices, the suggestions on what to order, the hours, everything. In case you're going, L'Astier was our overwhelming favorite. We also used the info on kitchen shops, patisseries, boulangeries and specialty shops.Her title is accurate. If you're not a &quot;food lover,&quot; don't bother. If you're obsessed like my family, don't go without it."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"This guide covers all the bases - restaurants, markets, shops (both food and housewares), and food as culture. The book is not organized in a &quot;list of the best&quot; fashion. It is organized by subject matter - cafe, bakery, marche', etc. - and then by arrondissement within each category. If you are looking for short and quick rundowns, this book requires more commitment on your part. But for an overall secure sense of food in Paris, this book is correct, insightful, and educational. We are &quot;food people&quot;, and this book really made our trip enjoyable."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"Although I find her engaging, I have to admit my experience with Patricia Wells' guide books and recipes has been less than foolproof. Although this book contains a wealth of useful details, in my experience she is far too generous with many mediocre restaurants and I have had several meals I considered downright bad based on this book. Perhaps a part of the problem is that, unlike most restaurant reviewers, Ms. Wells is well-known and well-recognized among Parisian proprietors. She loves them, they love her. As a result, I suspect the service - and in some cases the food - are often a notch or so better for her than for the average patron."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"We recently returned from Paris and this book was of great value to us in finding wonderful food. One day we walked all over Paris stopping in first at a cheese shop recommended in the book, then a chocolate shop then a bakery finally taking all the food back to our hotel for a wonderful meal. The extensive French/English glossery in the back was also great but we wish there was an English/French one as well. We have tried one of the recipes at home and it was great. Only one place in the book did we find no longer in business at the listed location but that is to be expected since things change."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"Just came back from 8 days in Paris and I had studied and marked on a map Wells' recommended cafes, boulangeries, patisseries, fromageries and specialty food stores. Note that I wasn't so much interested in restaurants but I've NEVER known Patricia Wells to be wrong so I can't imagine her recomendations wouldn't be excellent. Although it would be great if her book were updated again since it hasn't been in 5 years I found most of the places still there and loaded with thoroughly delicious treats. Her website patriciawells.com has updates for restaurants for those interested. The French really do food right and the baguettes, cheese, wine and pastries were exquisite. Each place has certain items that are especially delightful. Gosselin really does have a superb baguette, Calixte has croissants and pain au chocolat that are really magnificent, Malineau has fruit tarts which are exquiisite, Martin has wonderful baguette sandwiches to take with you and munch on and Kayser has many wonderful delights. Go to Paris and you will come to know what Bon Appetit can really mean."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"My husband and I left for Paris with the usual Zagat's and Michelin's . . . a friend had given us Ms. Well's _Food Lover's Guide_ . . . I argued for taking it; my husband thought it too big and heavy. Since I was the person who had read it cover to cover twice, I won. After three days, we left Zags and Michs on the shelf in the closet, and consulted Ms. Wells constantly. It helped at every moment, from the first baguette in the morning, til the last cafe at night--and certianly in between, distinguishing between all of the wonderful food, kitchen, and food/gift shops. We will not go back to Paris without it.In fact, we will likely read it all year, savoring our memories, and getting ready for next years' trip!"},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"Yes, some of the restaurant reviews are out of date, but this is so much more than just a restaurant guide. It also gives details about markets, boulangeries, pattiseries and other treats and traiteurs. Gold dust.One of the best ways to eat in Paris is to buy a baguette de tradition and a fresh piece of really STINKY and TOTALLY unpasteurised fromage and eat it in a jardin or parc. (I reccomend the rue Cler for this you can get your fromage from Christine and your pain from Poujairan and your patisserie from Lenotre - all spellings approximate!- and eat them around the Invalides).This book tells you how to do all that, and how to find precious treats like Berthillon ice cream and Christian Constant chocolates and Le Stubli's cakes.... I could go on but it's making me too hungry.But a new edition is certainly sorely needed. For example, Andre Lerch is retired, and has been replaced in rue Cardinal Lemoine by a store selling Tour D'Argent memorabilia. Conversely, the book omits the magnificent Pierre Herme (probably the best and most astonishingly innovative patissier in Paris, and it's in rue Bonaparte - just spot the queue). In the meantime, boulangerie fans could acquire the Guide des Boulangeres (which is regularly updated with a pamphlet supplement) or the Michelin single-city food guides; both can be got from the fabulous cookbook store in the Rue Dante, which has very helpful English-speaking staff. And for restaurants nothing beats Gault-Millau (provided your French is good - it's idiomatic).But Wells is still worth having, especially for non-French speakers. She points in most of the right directions. You CAN update her book a bit by visiting her website.And her devotion to Paris and Parisian food makes you want to sing aloud. It was this book that helped me become a raving Paris foodie, and I'm still very grateful."},{"Title":"Food Lover's Guide to Paris, 4th edition","review":"I just returned from Paris and found this book to be very helpful but a bit heavy to tote around. Perhaps the future edition could be divided into 2 volumes - one for the right bank and one for the left. I was extremely pleased with a restaurant called Maceo on rue des Petits-Champs - wonderful food but disappointed with Le Grizzli- horrible service."},{"Title":"Reflections on Gender and Science: Tenth Anniversary Paperback Edition","review":"This is a fine work that ought to be better known. I read it some years ago when I was a graduate student in Philosophy. It is not technical, but neither is it lacking in depth. Keller reviews the history of science from the Enlightenment onward, showing how it followed an agenda based on the model of human control over nature. She suggests other approaches to research that have proved fruitful. Importantly, she avoids polemics--this is not a book that displays any political bias towards men. Keller's background is in hard science (mathematical biophysics), which lends her a credibility other \\"feminist\\" philosophers of science may lack."},{"Title":"The psychoanalysis of war","review":"Fornari emphasizes that war and violence develop out of a &quot;love need:&quot; our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached. &quot;Nations,&quot; of course, are the sacred objects that most often generate warfare. Fornari focuses upon SACRIFICE as the essence of war: this astonishing willingness of human beings to give over their bodies to the nation-state.

Gresham Machen. Even after the better part of a century after these lectures were given, the book represents a monumental feat and is still one of the best studies of Paul in print.Machen's lectures that are presented in this book were given at a time when Biblical criticism that rejected supernaturalism, Bible inspiration, and Biblical historicity was in full blossom. Many competing schemes had been developed to naturalize the musings of the Apostle Paul and to separate the Pauline epistles in every possible way from the alleged 'historical Jesus' of the naturalistic scholarship fad that prevailed in Biblical criticism at that time. This book represents a comprehensive rebuttal to many of these theories. Machen's critiques are complete; and they are devastating. By so thoroughly destroying the naturalistic theories that were forced onto Christianity in an effort to discredit it, Machen not only discredits these theories, he strongly affirms the orthodox tenets of the historic Christian faith in a very scholarly manner.Machen, with relentless logic, systematically tackles several main thrusts of criticism and finds each of them wanting to the extreme. In the process, Machen discredits efforts to separate the religion of Paul from the religion of Peter, and thereby discrediting the view that the Christianity of Jerusalem and the Christianity of the dispersion were somehow different. This section was simply masterful, in my opinion. Machen then discredits theories that tried to contrast Paul and Jesus. These theories suggested that the Jesus of Paulinism was different than the real Jesus of Palestine. Again, Machen is relentless in discrediting this argument. Machen moves on to perhaps his best section, which is discussing the alleged pagan influences and/or origins of Paul's thought. Two complete chapters, and a portion of a third, are devoted to tackling this subject. In the process, the theories of Bousset, Bruckner, Reitzenstein and others are demonstrated to be an embarassment. Machen's treatment of the pagan influence issue here was probably the most resounding rebuke written until Nash's 'Gospel and the Greeks' was written in the late '80s. At a number of points, Nash draws significantly from Machen here, and put together, the two works represent a devastating case against pagan influences upon early Christianity.Throughout this book, I was simply amazed at how thorough Machen was in considering so many objections and nuances that impact on the central question of the origin of Paulinism. I was also amazed that even though these lectures were given so long ago, they are extraordinarily relevant today. Yesterday's Boussets, Bruckners, and Reitzensteins are today's Crossans, Funks, and Borgs. The arguments are strikingly similar, and fueled by similar motivations - ie: to find a way to desupernaturalize Jesus Christ, the words of the Bible, and the Christian experience. This book by Machen, therefore, is truly timeless because it thoroughly discredited such arguments when they were in fashion 100 years ago, and can likewise be used by believers today to discredit the Jesus Seminar and other like minded contemporary 'scholars'.This is not a book that the reader will be able to rush through. I found each chapter so engaging and so deep in its analysis that I needed to stop after each chapter because Machen had given my brain a serious workout. This is Reformed scholarship at its finest. Machen brilliantly shows that in an effort to 'demythologize' the Bible, naturalistic scholars are engaging in a great deal of myth-building themselves. The orthodox Christianity of the Apostle Paul is demonstrated to be in comprehensive harmony with the other apostles, the Old Testament writings, and the sayings of Christ Himself. An outstanding example of solid scholarship!"},{"Title":"The origin of Paul's religion, (The James Sprunt lectures delivered at Union theological seminary in Virginia)","review":"I have never seen a secondary source reference to this, but years ago I read an English translation of Bultmann's German review of this Machen book. Bultmann generally ignored works written in English, especially by Americans, and he despised the theology that people like Machen stood for. And yet he gave a long review where he acknowledged this to be the best book of its kind to appear thus far.Extremely insightful and thorough. And the balanced and fair tone will surprise those unfamiliar with Machen's more scholarly writings.A real classi c still well worth reading."},{"Title":"The origin of Paul's religion, (The James Sprunt lectures delivered at Union theological seminary in Virginia)","review":"I used it in my Pauline letter class in seminary.

Machen also has a manner of speech that is often difficult to follow, including long, wordy sentences. I think the meat of the book could have been reduced to a single chapter. I may have more gray hairs on my head after reading this one.

When Hart began college the Disney World theme park was being constructed across from her parents' home. The change from rural Florida to a theme park capital was Hart's inspiration to write Waterwoman, so that she was able to capture and preserve an ageless quality of a place that changes little over time.Waterwoman is the story of two sisters, growing up on an island off the coast of Virginia. Annie Revels, a tall, insecure woman and her sister, Rebecca, who is beautiful and desired. Initially these women live in a simple country style house and carry out their duties at home such as collecting vegetables for dinner and washing clothes, but terrible mistakes lead to jealousy and antagonism, which tears the girls' friendship and almost strips them of all that they have together.This story is about change and he sacrifices made for family. Despite her wishes, Annie, takes over the challenge of household chores when her grandmother passes away due to a chain of severe heart attacks. Annie has always dreamed of being a waterwoman and working on the sea. As her father is a waterman, she is privileged on occasions to accompany her father at sea and learn the basics of the profession. Annie then thinks when her father dies as a result of an unfortunate fishing tragedy, that she must provide the money for the family. While her sister remains at home caring for their mother and doing the household chores, Annie, takes over her father's profession and becomes a waterwoman.Waterwoman is written in a manner that only provides the audience a view of what Annie is experiencing, the use of first person narrative enables the audience to have contact with Annie's emotions and also provides an insight to what she is experiencing. Other characters, such as Rebecca and Mrs Revels, are not expressed in the same manner; they are portrayed through what Annie's experiences and through her thoughts. As a consequence of this, the novel becomes biased, as the audience becomes manipulated and unable to understand the emotions of the other characters.Waterwoman is unrealistic; in the way that one misfortune is followed by another, like a chain of unlikely events, hitting Annie in every direction she faces. This novel is almost like a fairytale, as Annie falls for men too quickly, but they all end up breaking her heart. The issues in Waterwoman follow a pattern like a roller coaster ride; times of contentment are followed by times of grief and after a while the novel becomes a bit predictable. As the audience continues the novel, they begin to ride this roller coaster along with Annie, in order to see what rough moments will hit her next.Hart has targeted a mature female audience, from the age of 16 to 25. Waterwoman is targeted towards a female audience as the main characters in this novel are female and this novel covers issues that are very common for a female audience of this age, therefore because of this, the audience is able to relate well to the characters and become entangled in the novel until reading is complete.Despite flashbacks that alter the linear narrative and the fact that this novel is described as belonging to a poetic genre, Hart's style is very basic, as it uses simple, accessible language. Hart works on developing Annie's character throughout the novel, each personal obstacle that Annie experiences and overcomes, makes her more internally stronger and determined to make everything work out in the end."},{"Title":"Waterwoman","review":"Lenore Hart lived as a child in &quot;old&quot; Florida, when she began college the Disney World theme park was being constructed across from her parents' home.

Annie Revels's father is a waterman pronging for oysters and putting out pots for crabs making a living for his family. Annie being older than her sister Rebecca loves going out on the boat with her father and sometimes wishes she could be working with him everyday. Her mother was ill and had to be looked after, and of course, she has to look after little Rebecca too. I loved the way Ms. Hart presents the different viewpoints of the family members, sometimes revealing the private and shocking thoughts that they have about one another.When Annie's father suddenly dies she takes over going out on the water and providing for the family as her father did. Wearing his old clothes, working in the broiling sun doing backbreaking work day after day she realizes what her father had to do to keep them all alive. Annie has always felt Rebecca was the beautiful one, while she can only aspire to the life of a waterwoman. All changes in her life the day she meets Nathan Combs, a handsome guide working for the Cobb's brothers who takes out rich folks for fishing and hunting. Nathan is a veteran of the First World War and had a lot of ghosts of his own to bury. Annie and Nathan become friends and something more, but the lack of committing how they feel about one another brings about its own chaos.Ms. Hart weaves a tale of love and relationships that is powerful, compelling and a must read. This is a rare gem of a book that you will be thinking about long after you read the last page. I could be wrong, but I have a feeling it isn't over yet! I can't wait to read the next book from this talented author.Suzanne Coleburn, Reader To Reader Reviews"},{"Title":"Waterwoman","review":"I read Lenore Hart's &quot;Waterwoman&quot; with great interest, as she set her story in a region of the country that my ancestors have lived and worked - as watermen - for 300 years. She beautifully depicted the life of the people of the barrier islands off of the coast of Virginia - it could have been my grandmother's story! Hart's characters's dialog, motivations, and actions were dead-on, and yes, you weep for Annie's losses in the end. But! Hart knows what she is doing - she writes what she knows to be true to the characters she has created so close to &quot;the real thing.&quot;"},{"Title":"Waterwoman","review":"Despite others raving about this book, I wasn't really crazy about it. The premise - a young woman struggling to find her place in a world with a beautiful younger sister and a father who won't let her pursue her true longing - is interesting, but somehow, I just couldn't become emotionally invested in the characters. At the end, I felt like my time would have been better spent reading something else."},{"Title":"Waterwoman","review":"This is one of the most intriguing book I had read. I tend to lean more toward mystery (Janet Evanovich) and fantasy (Tamora Pierce). This story talks about Anne, a woman with very normal feelings, who is percieved by many people as a selfish woman. Hart tells Anne's story and the events that she goes through. She writes about the selfish acts that Anne believe she goes through, yet in reality, most of her acts are unselfish.

John Kennedy is President; Martin Luther King is leading the civil rights movement; the sexual revolution has hit the affluent suburbs (with varying degrees of success from one couple to another); and life among upper middle class professionals is about as empty as it can get.The main character, Piet Hanema, builds and remodels houses for a living. In his mid-'30's, attractive but not handsome, according to his near-frigid wife, Piet is as promiscuous as 24/7 will allow. So sexually effective with so many other men's spouses, his wife's lack of responsiveness seems not to be of great concern. He's flattered when other women tell him he's so big it makes them ache. He seems indifferent to the meaning of an erection prompted by giving a comforting embrace to his grade school-aged daughter.Piet is gross. He comes into the bathroom while his wife is bathing, sits on the toilet and emits gas that smells like rotten cinnamon (even he is a bit embarrassed), while his wife covers her face with a wet washcloth. It does not occur to him that this level of viscerally physical intimacy might contribute to explaining why she is unresponsive to his sexual ministrations. The guy is a pig.His neighbors include a prominent nuclear physicist who escaped from North Korea, has learned very little English, married a woman whose native language is Portuguese, and even after an unspecified number of years of marriage, she speaks only a few words of Korean. A smoker who plays tennis with breathless relish, when the physicist dies of lung cancer Dean Rusk, Kennedy's Secretary of State, sends flowers.Much less successful, but sufficiently affluent to afford the neighborhood, is a biochemist who teaches at Harvard or MIT (unless the reader is familiar with the geography of Cambridge, it's not possible to tell which). His wife confides to Piet that her husband's research is not going well. He's being bested first by the Japanese and then the Jews ... or was it the other way around? The one instance in which the biochemist manque' experiences a sense of control and even exhiliration at his skill is on the drive home. Speeding a bit, in and out of traffic, handling his sporty two-seater masterfully.Yet another neighbor's wife, the one whose husband is a dentist with gangrenous-looking toenails, confides to Piet that while her husband talks incessantly about sex, that's pretty much it. Unless he's been drinking he's impotent. This information is shared, of course, after she and Piet have screwed. (She's not the one who wraps her legs around him as if he were a tree limb and she were hanging upside down. That's someone else's wife.)The couples are not oblivious to consideration of status group and class. They are dismissive of the older, less affluent, beer-drinking colony of public school teachers who live nearby in less affluent circumstances.Anyone who wonders why the social unrest of the '60's was not limited to civil rights and the war in Viet Nam should read Updike's Couples. The drab and empty prosperity of the characters who people this novel speaks volumes about the dispirited existence that passed for the good life among well-educated upper middle class professionals, the stratum to which all but the rich were expected to aspire. What a miserable way to live. If it was Updike's aim to show us this, he succeeded. Still, not a fun read.[This review gets little attention, but almost all hits are unfavorable. No big deal,but it does pique my curiosity. Would some reviewer suggest what may be missing, misinterpreted, misunderstood ... I wrote the review from a distant memory, but I thought I had pretty much hit it. I'd appreciate any comments.]"},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I think this book has benn reviewed enough and there is nothing that I can say that has not already been said.An wonderfully romantic book that explores our right to not be fully discovered until someone else discoveres you.

Looking back, the sexual content is actually rather mild, but, more importantly, it seems that the type of communities and lifestyles that Updike describe have been swallowed up by vast, numbing suburbs, where traffic is terrible, wives work, and neighbors are strangers.Yet, the book is a keen look at the dissatisfactions of marriage. Most of the couples knew or suspected that unfaithfulness was occurring among themselves, but they seemed to understand, if only subconsciously, that infidelity was or could be an outlet for the limitations of a spouse. The central character is home remodeler Piet Hanema, married to the sublime, but unapproachable, Angela, who seems to be happiest when in the arms of his latest lover. Updike's entry into this world is at the point when the Whitman's move in: he a professor and Elizabeth, or Foxy, a tall, winsome beauty who is also pregnant. Their old home on the coast requires extensive renovation providing the opportunity for Piet and Foxy to start a complicated relationship that that has community-wide consequences.The book is a challenging read containing Updike's typical complex descriptions of various scenes, etc. And the interactions of the various couples, usually at some sort of party, while revealing and sometimes insightful, do get tedious. The author hardly advocates this sort of group infidelity. In fact, there is a pervading sense of sadness about the book as many of the couples go their own way, their problems resolved or not. It is a simplification to label this book as one primarily about \\"wife swapping.\\" For one, that is wrong, and secondly it is about people trying to find some happiness or connectedness in their lives."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Updike's portrait of the upper middle class in a sleepy Boston suburb in 1963 when people actually had more time than they knew what to do with seems almost as distant and foreign to our overworked present as Fitzgerald's Jazz Age. Set on the eve of the sexual revolution, the novel explores a circle of couples who nearly devour each other out of jealousy, lust and boredom. Yet, the book is not without its tender sides, as Updike manages some hard-won sympathy for his protagonist Piet Hanema, the philandering grown boy of a man who does very bad things for very sad reasons. Richly-detailed with references of the time, COUPLES is a vivid snapshot of America, or at least one slice of it, in 1963."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Having read many of Updike's books (he's my fav. author), I rate Couples in the middle. The book is full of subtle symbolism and not-so-subtle symbolism, and has the Updike trademark of colorful imagery. It is a fair treatment of the complexities of infidelity.However, I found reading it a bit of a chore. If you want to read Updike, this one should not be your first. I'd recommend the second Rabbit book, Rabbit Redux."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I don't think anyone reads John Updike books to feel good about themselves, unless they want to feel glad that they are not the people in his novels. His characters are constantly flawed, strewn with cracks, by turns petty or manipulative or simply ignorant, doing things out of self-interest or boredom and seeming to not understand the consequences of their actions, or knowing them full well and doing it anyway because they just don't care. Which, in all honesty, is what makes his books worth reading. Couples is the story of a small town and the yes, couples that live in bored upper class leisure in the town and how they interact. That's pretty much it and yet it remains strangely fascinating, even though all Updike really does is play them off each other in as many permutations as he can manage until he runs out of pages. At the time I think the book was considered shocking for its frank depiction of infidelity and at times it does seem like all anyone in the town is interested in is sleeping with as many other people as possible. Yet it's not the act itself that matters, but the reasons why they do it. Beceause they're bored or they're not in love anymore or they feel constricted, because they want to get a reaction, or maybe convince themselves that they can still react. The action, as it is, tends to center around Piet, who is married to Angela but seems to still enjoy playing the field and it's what he does that drives what there is of the plot. Much like Updike's Rabbit, he's not a role model but an extremely flawed human being who does callous things and convinces himself that he's doing them out of kindness. But he just fits in with the rest of the town's couples, who drift through their days trying to find some sort of excitement amidst all the sameness, dinner parties, basketball games, vacations, lounging around to avoid the notion that they're just killing time. Not every character is as well drawn, and telling some of the minor characters apart can be difficult at times. But the main ones linger and resonate, in all their loves and foibles, their jealousies and their loyalties. Updike's prose remains as sharp as ever, he rarely builds to explosions of excitement but instead moves it along in tiny charges, creating little waves that over time become devastating. Sometimes he gets a bit carried away with the descriptive metaphors but that's par for the course for him, it's his style. His dialogue is especially good, even when it's being elusive, it can suddenly shift to cutting and raw and the best scenes are the ones with all the couples together as they dance and dart around each other, revealing by not revealing. The bits between the stronger characters, like Piet and Freddy Thorne, go to another level entirely. It's not a happy book, more about people existing and making the wrong choices, and how those poor choices can come back to haunt them. These days the idea of the suburban life only hiding a miserable bored existence fraught with infidelities is nearly a cliche but Updike's prose and viewpoint still elevate it. You may not like his character but you'll feel like you know them, for better or for ill."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Updike makes the reader feel like a voyeur privy to the most intimate acts and discussions in the characters' lives. We are transported to the fictional New England town of Tarbox in the 60's and introduced to its suburban inhabitants. They have cocktail parties and play tennis and basketball and raise children and discuss politics, consumerism, gossip, and sex. Yet beyond its Peyton Place scenario, the characters are truly complex, searching for answers, happiness, joy, excitement, anything!Updike brilliantly blends literary prose and imagery with frank situations and absorbing dialogue to create a beautiful American portrait that is extraordinarily accurate. It satisifes the reader's quest for truth, drama, and philisophical stimulation.I have read this novel 3 times and become completely imersed and enthralled each time."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"When I recently saw the author on a talk show on C-SPAN, he seemed to keep reminiscing about how this 1968 book in particular marked a turning point in his notoriety. Naturally, as one who had already read a ton of Updike (but not this volume), I was intrigued. And I was glad when I finally did read it, for it turns out to be a deliciously lyrical description of how a small group of married people in a coastal town engage in extramarital sex and other forms of innocent seeming behavior and how it all blows up in their faces &#8211; quietly, oh so quietly. Updike is testing the ice for us (indeed, one section is named &#8220;Thin Ice&#8221;). He is helping us judge the New Morality. Will it work, or does it simply displace a more established code of sexual ethics for a while, then vanish? Thirty-five odd years later, the Pill and other forms of birth control have still failed to make marriage obsolete; &#8220;wife-swapping&#8221; is still not widely practiced. So perhaps Updike was on to something here (namely, that marital fidelity has its place in our scheme of things). The famous graphic sex this novel is supposed to contain? Well, it&#8217;s pretty tame stuff these days, but the directness of the sexual descriptions is still delightfully scintillating and refreshing. The best thing about the book though is its characters&#8217; dialog. Updike wouldn&#8217;t know how to fill a page with bland verbiage if he tried, and this book is no exception. But unlike the &#8220;Rabbit&#8221; novels, these characters are always making exotic observations, expressing themselves in a surprising, distinctive, and endlessly entertaining manner. ... Still a terrific read, however (and you may always disagree with me about the ending!)."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I have to admit, much like porn, I bought the book based on its cover. &quot;Seductive&quot; Savagely graphic&quot; etc. These are the things that make me spend 13 bucks. However, what was considered lewd and graphic back in the '60's is downright quaint today. What we're left with, however, is another Updike masterpiece. No one knows the suburbs like Updike and he once again demonstrates his mastery over this terrain here. Despite the Biblical overtones of the ending (which seemed forced and completely out of the flow of this otherwise seemless novel) this is a book that you fall into like a comfy couch. It takes a while to keep the characters straight and the fact that each of them takes up with another's spouse only complicates matters further but once you become familiar with everyone the sparks almost crackle off the page. There's a reason this guy's so famous."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"John Updike put a damper on my reading and writing. Smug, drawn-out and decadent, \\"Couples\\" prevented me from going about my usual business because I kept hoping that \\"it\\", whatever it was, would finally start and do Updike's name and his biggest commercial success justice. With a lot of goodwill I might say that something with a remote ring of truth began to emerge in the last 100 or so pages, but applying an 80/20 ratio to a novel of this size and reputation is to expect a lot. Updike's trademark imagery, more prominent in later works, appears in bud stages throughout the book and, admittedly, gives the content some much-needed embellishment (for instance, \\"an orange in the net\\" is the sun setting through bare tree branches.)I am not quite sure what Updike was up to with this. Assuming he had calculated the mild scandal the book would cause, then the story about swinger club in a small, but apparently vastly overpopulated Boston suburb came out darn humorless. If it was a morality tale, it left me stone cold. Published 40 years ago, it doesn't even hold up as a snapshot of its time, despite some news clips dusted here and there. Swinging Sixties, The Pill and middle-class indolence notwithstanding, I simply don't see people acting like that--and I am NOT talking about the so-called sexual candor. The only ones whose behavior resembled anything candid were the whiny children, certainly not the sorry excuses for characters of the rest of the bloated cast, until nearly the end. I was disturbed, however, by how insincerely the word \\"love\\" was thrown around and what hypocrisy was supposed to pass for emotion. Let's take a closer look at the crowd: There's Piet Hanema, the protagonist, who is a churchgoer while promiscuous--this one is a giveaway and I won't be hung up on it; the church tower, the landmark of the town, carries a rotating rooster--get it? Cock-a-doodle-do? More witticisms: Piet's, um, head mistress, among several, is Foxy Whitman (she had ivory looks but is, well, foxy). There are the Thornes (they sting), the Applebys (they are red-cheeked and chubby), the Smiths (they try to counteract their ordinariness by showing off their school French) and many more, everyone sleeps with everyone at some point (or so it seems), except Piet's wife, a cornerstone of class and principle in a morass of sin. In the middle of this, the periodically surfacing concerns about discovery or worries about offending partners seems conceitedly out of place. Should one believe that Mr. Hanema is sucking breast milk from Mrs. Whitman in their friends' bathroom but is nervous about parking his truck in front of her house? And that his wife, or anyone, for that matter, can be shocked by anything? I don't think so. Devoting an entire, long chapter to the wife-swappings of the \\"Applesmiths\\", two minor pathetic couples (out of ten pathetic couples, a daring premise in itself) and expecting the reader to care, or burdening her with their family history is what is audacious, not their fumbling and groping.At long last, however, the party's over, and the hangover kicks in. That is when Updike's imitation of conflict begins to grasp and acuminates into the reasonably interesting conclusion that the oh-so liberal, open-minded, immoral ones are usually just as square and subject to hurt as the next ones. But, for a reading experience about the same subject--moral decline in suburbia--I hotly recommend \\"Revolutionary Road\\" by Richard Yates instead. He did it earlier, better and much funnier. If it's a motion picture you'd rather get done with, the movie is being released at the end of the year. Until then, rent \\"The Decline of the American Empire\\" by Denys Arcand."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"This is a prototypical Updike novel, in my opinion. Here he tackles the convoluted longings and messy interpersonal relationships between Foxy and her contractor Piet. Foxy is married, of course, but that doesn't stop our randy boy Piet from trying to bed her. Set in a tense New England town, the dour weather and the hard-edge environment may have something to do with Foxy's dissatisfaction, with her husband and with life in general. The much-about-town Piet just views Foxy as another conquest, but serious complications occur when something happens to Foxy, and Piet's own life starts to unravel.Other reviewers have panned this book or damned it with faint praise, but I enjoyed it a lot. It is a faster read than the Rabbit novels, less serious in tone, perhaps lighter in writing, but with serious, dark issues the characters must face.Updike seems to be saying, 'every action has a consequence'. Highly recommended. Perhaps one has to be familiar with the period to give it five stars. I could place much of the angst of the period, though I was too young to have lived it like Piet and Foxy."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"John Updike is one of our great novelists. This certainly explains why I have read and enjoyed SEEK MY FACE, GERTRUDE AND CLAUDIUS, and MEMORIES OF THE FORD ADMINISTRATION, as well as the lesser VILLAGES, in recent years. Further, my shelves carry ten additional Updike novels in hardcover. All of them, even the sly BECH books, were terrific reads. So why did this Updike novel take me nearly two months to finish?I suppose the ambitiousness of COUPLES is the cause. In contrast to, say, GERTRUDE AND CLAUDIUS, which tells of the story of a certain prominent couple, COUPLES tells the story of a not-small group (18 characters) of upper middle class New England suburbanites and their sexual shenanigans.In this very close-knit group, there are two-sets of two married couples (eight people altogether) who swap mates. Further, there is a character who has a quickie with a swapper, as well as three lovers among the wives, whose husbands don't play. Here, two of the husbands may be gay while another is a stiff and unlikable associate professor who is conveniently away during the day.In COUPLES, Updike tells us everything there is to know about this intense and incestuous group, whose members, but for their sexual adventurism, are very average and even annoying. (One interacts pretentiously using French phrases. Another is sour and a high-ball nihilist.)Maybe in these jaded times, roughly 40 years after the events in COUPLES, the sexual revolution that these characters embody is simply not very involving. Indeed, my reaction to these couples after our two-month journey together is not amazed interest but the impression that their lives are sad, unrewarding, and claustrophobic.Even so, COUPLES, is like other Updike's novels in the astonishing lyricism of his prose."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"An reviewer on Amazon's British site said that he found it difficult to imagine a less appealing subject than adultery, but in fact there have been a good many authors who have found it a highly appealing subject to write about. Given that some of their works now enjoy the status of established literary classics, I imagine that there must also be a good many people who find it an appealing subject to read about. The classic \\"novel of adultery\\" (\\"Madame Bovary\\", \\"Anna Karenina\\", \\"La Regenta\\", \\"Effi Briest\\", \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\", etc.) typically has at its centre an upper-class or middle-class woman who finds her (often older) husband dull, cold, unloving or otherwise unsatisfactory, and therefore takes a lover in the hope of finding more satisfaction with him. In most cases this hope is to be sadly disappointed.\\"Couples\\", however, chronicles a far more complex set of erotic permutations than such classic novels, featuring no fewer than ten couples, all of whom are, to some extent, involved in adultery or wife-swapping. It is set in the small New England town of Tarbox, on the Massachusetts coast between Boston and Plymouth, during 1963 and 1964. (The fictitious events of the novel can often be dated by reference to real-life events, such as the death of Pope John XXIII or the Kennedy assassination).The couples involved are all relatively young, in their late twenties, thirties or early forties, mostly from the professional middle classes. The nearest thing to one single central character is Piet Hanema, a builder of Dutch extraction, who cheats on his wife Angela with the wives of several of his friends and acquaintances. These affairs are carried out either with or without the knowledge or tacit consent (although not normally with the explicit consent) of the women's husbands. Piet's most important affair is the one that he conducts with Elizabeth \\"Foxy\\" Whitman, the attractive young wife of an academic scientist.The book has a couple of faults. Firstly, twenty main characters is really too many; the publishers ought to consider issuing an edition incorporating family trees to enable the reader to keep track of who is married to whom and who their children are. Secondly, much of the first half is taken up with a lengthy and unnecessary section about the wife-swapping exploits of Harold and Marcia Smith (generally known as the Little-Smiths to differentiate them from another couple named Smith) and Frank and Janet Appleby, two couples who play only minor roles in the rest of the novel.Nevertheless, the book's weaknesses are outweighed by its strengths. As always, Updike is a very fluent prose stylist. As in some of his other books such as \\"The Witches of Eastwick\\", I was struck by his ability to conjure up a sense of place. He is not normally thought of as a \\"nature writer\\", but some of his descriptions of the countryside around Tarbox, especially the dunes and the saltmarshes, were most striking.Above all, there is his ability to analyse the psychology of his main characters, particularly in the second half of the novel which is more focused and more serious in tone than the first. When Foxy becomes pregnant with Piet's child, they realise that there is a price to be paid for adultery and that they need the help of Freddy Thorne, the husband of one of Piet's previous mistresses. The price Piet has to pay for obtaining Freddy's help leads to the breakdown of his marriage to the long-suffering Angela. As is often the case in Updike's novels (the author was a practising Christian), religion plays an important part, as Piet tries to reconcile his permissive lifestyle with his religious beliefs.When the book first came out in 1968 it was attacked by some readers and critics as \\"pornographic\\", but in fact it is the precise opposite of a work of pornography. Pornography is an amoral celebration of the supposed joys of promiscuous sex, whereas Updike's novel is concerned with the moral consequences of promiscuity. Although there are some sexually graphic passages, his aim was not to titillate his readers but to explore the way in which traditional ideas about sexual morality were, in the 1960s, giving way to a more permissive lifestyle among the post-Pill generation (or, as they appear to us today, the post-Pill, pre-AIDS generation). There were many writers in this period who saw themselves as reporters from the front line of the sexual revolution, but few who sent back dispatches as clear and stylish as Updike's."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"The early nineteen sixties beckoned on a decade of change. Not only did the world shake off most of the remnants of its most recent global war, not only did Europe's defeated former colonial powers almost complete their American-dictated divestment of their assets, not only did capitalism institutionalise the shape of globalised future, but also, apparently, married people discovered sex. But not, for the purposes of Couples by John Updike, with their legal partners...John Updike published Couples in 1968, so as the decade went, the novel was already something of a retrospective, a conscious revisiting of years of change. John F Kennedy was shot. Cuban missiles suffered their crises. There was probably the occasional sporting event. Wars turned cold. Vietnam was still just a country. Much of contemporary life, however, seemed to by-pass Tarbox, a New England residential area in the academic commuter belt. Methods of contraception in many ways dominated life in the chessboard of this community, where moves made in private produced their perhaps inevitable physical responses alongside personal and social consequences, both intended and not.Couples looks at the lives of several Tarbox types. Each relationship has its own foibles. Each one has its man who is doing his best to be a man, and each has its woman who aspires to her own brand of perfection. Eventually the story focuses on one particular relationship, that of Piet and Foxy, pursued despite their mutual marital partners.As ever with John Updike, the sex is both voluminous and throbbing. Each encounter seems to rediscover that thrill of first touch, the transport of discovery. But also guilt begins to build its walls of deception as the habit sets. There are consequences, not only for partners, but also for children and even community. And, in an age when conception can be avoided, both bio-chemically and mechanically, there can still be other consequences that can prove to be even more far-reaching, and provoke visits to the dentist.The couples in Couples begin their communal voyage of discovery believing, perhaps like Columbus at the behest of Spanish monarchs, themselves a couple, that the world was about to begin anew, especially and just fort them. Also for them, as for Columbus, the journey was to prove a long one despite the fact that, certainly in twenty-first century terms, it does not go very far. For men and women conjoined, however, it's about as far as it ever gets, and further than many might venture. When a long way from the comforts of home, many of us might feel the touch of insecurity. And so it is for Tarbox people for whom, embarking upon their voyages of self-discovery outside their homely security, initial wonder at novelty soon engenders new doubt. Late on, John Updike notes that \\"We are all exiles who need to bathe in the irrational\\". We know it's not going to do us any good, but still we indulge. The compulsion is complete, perhaps inevitable, and thus the reminder that once through life is all we have is duly delivered, but much later, of course, that we really need to hear it. It has passed by before we have noticed.Like all voyages of discovery, John Updike's Couples is a dated experience and a long one at that. But like all dated material, if it faithfully reflects and truly inhabits its own time, its journey is still worth the effort, its results permanently revelatory. The respectable normality that John Updike eventually imposes on his straying sheep reminds us that though new knowledge changes assumptions and new gadgets might render a different sheen onto the surface of life, we are still very much on the same voyage, whatever the age."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Perhaps I am just too old to read a book of this type. This is one of those books I missed many years ago. It came out in 1968 was a best- seller and supposedly told us the truth about marriage, couples, human relationships in the suburban America of the time. The truth was that Fidelity was dead, and the age of sexual revolution was the age of adultery. And this book does explore multiple adultery as the inhabitants of Tarbox, Updike's fictional New England town engage in a whole set of explorations and betrayals. The major figure here is Piet Hanema, the contractor whose more refined wife , Angela has frozen him out of intimacy. The tale of his multiple misadventures most notably with Foxy Whitman lead somehow to moral complications and a reckoning at the end of the book. My problem was that I did not have the patience and time for the characters none of which I could have any real identification with or sympathy for. Perhaps had I been more patient in my reading I would have find more to enjoy here. But Updike's verbal acrobatics however brilliant seemed to me more trivial and boring than anything else. And so I could not get through a book of a writer who I so greatly admire."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"The outer veneer of the \\"perfect suburbia\\" is stripped off and the realities of life are laid open. This is fiction, but not so fictional at the last."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I don't know if this story is a commentary on the commencement of the sexual revolution ushered in during the 1960s, but today that's not particularly relevant. This is certainly a fantastical story of a not so small group of couples in fictional Tarbox, Massachussets who all have one thing in common: adultery. Speaking of the not-so-small group of couples, the reader is well served to pay close attention at the beginning of the book as the couples are introduced. You have to know who is married to whom so you can later understand who is cheating on whom. It gets a little convoluted because there are quite a few characters to remember.Updike takes the reader on this adulterous adventure for 458 pages. He could have done so in about 300 pages or less. But I truly have mixed emotions about this story. The literary arts side of me agrees that Updike is a master of his art. To say his writing is skillful is a simplistic understatement. He sets the scene well and his character development goes beyond meticulous. The voyeuristic side of me remained interested to see just what sexual adventure might come next for this group of swinging Tarboxians; which spouse would bed which spouse and who would be the cuckold on the next page. But the pragmatic side of me says this book was just too long and portions of the writing were too laborious (must we have pages of detail about the littlest things that are generally irrelevant to the storyline?). I realize the story was about more than just adultery, but at the basic level adultery and marital dissatisfaction were the main ingredients of the plot. Can any author write about those things for nearly 500 pages and succeed? Maybe or maybe not; Updike made a valiant effort without quite succeeding.Having said all that, Updike is an author I would certainly read again because he is so obviously a master at his craft.P.S. - Have a dictionary nearby."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"This novel explores a time and place close in history and yet so very far away in terms of lives lived then and as they are today. Perhaps this 1968 observational work set amongst the middle classes went some way to reweave some moral fibre into society. The characters are intelligent and witty and yet somehow feckless and tawdry. Sex is the common currency and boredom their disease, someone ultimately has to get sick enough as to jolt a sense of awareness and re-evaluation into this disaffected group of people.This is only time I have read a historic work of a well educated cast and somehow managed to feel both morally and intellectually superior.An Updike classic and well worth a look, recently serialised as a two part play by the BBC so watch out for upcoming sales of that recording, stars Amanda Donohue as Foxy."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"This book is great! 1 Long and difficult, but Updikes writing style is amazing and potrays lots of detailed sex between the protagonist Piet and all of his love affairs... many of the characters are relatable, andif you have ever lived in suburbia, you will relate with the fakeness that surrounds everyone. Also, even though I had to read this book for a class, I did thouiroughly enjoy it."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"One of my good colleagues was telling me that back in his student days it was considered fashionable to parade round the uni with a copy of Couples tucked under your arm. People read it publicly-to be seen to be reading it-and you had to have read it to be considered in the know. That, of course, was before my time...This book proved a somewhat mixed bag for me. I decided to read it following an obituary programme, after Updike's fairly recent demise, in which Couples was discussed.As someone who loves cyclical structures and themes in writing, that aspect of the book worked to some extent. Upon completing a book I will nearly invariable revisit the first pages and make links between beginning and end. Although the cycle was evident, sadly, there had been no change or progress, the protagonist didn't seem to have learnt, progressed, discovered or developed in any way apart from being slightly more bumbly and avaricious. Cyclical structures are there to emphasise change and development, but in this case only emphasised the lack of it. Now, evidently Updike will have deployed this method for a specific purpose, reflecting '60s society, exploring the concept of the american suburban dream, consumerism, decay, pointlessness of life etc, but it did not work for me.In fact, Piet was just such an utter lettuce, he really and truly irritated me. His whole existence seemed pointless and directionless, bumbling from one farcical bed into another and not really achieving anything worthwhile in the process. I couldn't extract myself from the same feeling I had when reading Mme Bovary years ago. She was equally unfocused and ungrateful, not valuing what she had and making faux-pas after faux-pas. At risk of becoming repetitive, but I guess I simply have an issue with spineless characters.And it wasn't just Piet. Truly, I tried, but did not find a single character in the entire novel I liked or particularly connected with. I don't think I have nearly given up on a book so often as this before.Another irritating feature was the way symbolism was used, which was just too contrived, especially symbolism associated with death. Hamsters, teeth, religious imagery. It all somehow did not seem to fit together snugly at all.Talking about hamsters, do I really need to know the dimensions of the wood Piet buys when wanting to build a hamster cage? Or the exact dimensions of someone's living room, the pattern on their wallpaper? No. No!The sex didn't satisfy either, all the characters seem to be left with delusions and never quite arrive at a point of complete satisfatcion.I am not a child of Updike's era. Maybe I was born too late to fully appreciate.So why 3 stars? In spite of it all, Updike writes in such lovely language, has such pretty diction and phrases things so nicely. Clever."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Updike has examined several couples and their relationships with each other, lots of sex and quite risque for being written in the late 1960s! I read a 1968 older copy. Fits in today's world, too! I have to admit that I HATE Piet, although he seems to be the &quot;main&quot; character. I hate how he just jumps from bed to bed to bed, although he finally makes the right decision. The book makes marriage seem like a dead end, although there are so many marriages that ARE like that! Maybe it's a chance to show us how we behave as humans, and maybe we can work on our relationships to keep the fire going and not turn out like his characters!Something else that made me uncomfortable about Piet is his comparing one woman's body parts to another. Makes ya wonder if guys really do that -- of course it would have to be really promiscuous men! But I'm sure men DO compare ex-girlfriends' bodies to new girlfriends. It makes me feel self-conscious.Updike does a good job in the book of pointing out our flaws and greatest fears in relationships, and showing beginnings and endings of relationships. It's a very intellectual study. Great book!"},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Based upon seeing John Updike in a Charlie Rose interview and never had read his books, I was impressed with his likable personality and wit. So I decided to read some of his much acclaimed novels. I started with The Witches of Eastwick and its sequel. I was not impressed. I was surprised however of how good a job Hollywood did with the movie based on this novel. It was funny and fast moving, unlike the novel.I then started thinking, maybe I misjudged this author, so I read Couples. Nope, it was the same slow moving story line the Witches twosome suffered from. Why pages and pages of narrative are required to describe each characters thoughts and personality is beyond my humble thinking.Oh well...I guess millions can't be wrong. You'll just have to read his novels and make a judgment for yourself.Just not for me....Virg in Austin, Tx."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"With the recent passing of this literary giant, there is much attention focused on perhaps the greatest American writer of the 20th century (allowing the first decade to be owned by Mr. Twain).It would be best for a beginner to read the \\"Rabbit...\\" series, but \\"Couples\\" will introduce you to the seething, angst-ridden world of 1960's-era suburbia, populated by couples with nothing to do but have affairs with each other. It seems dated now (it takes place from 1962 to early 1964), but the writing is timeless."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"This book, \\"Couples\\", is by far, John Updike's best--it's a masterpiece, and, one of the most controversial books I've read in my life. From the beginning, when the Hanema's first arrive to the community, everything starts to unravel. Even though this book's lengthy at 458 pages, you have to read every last page in order for you to understand it, I absolutely love Updike's \\"go-there\\" style of writing. It deals with controversial issues, such as abortion (illegal back in 1968 when this book was written), and, using freedom and sex in the same sentence, and the church, as well as other mind-bending things. The ending is shocking and sad, and, it will anger you. This book will definitely make you want to check out where you move before you move there..this novel beats all the soap operas, have to read it!"},{"Title":"Couples","review":"Reviled in its time as a great author's descent into tabloid, Peyton Place populism, Couples has proven itself to be one of Updike's most memorable.

It still is. I wanted to read this on my Kindle, but I gave the item 4 stars because the digital reproduction is poor. Sentences are often repeated, and sometimes left out. The book is so good, I suffered through it anyway. Hope Amazon corrects this, because this book shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"John Updike's \\"Couples\\" is not his best novel, but it's not his worst, either. This is, in fact, a very good book about marriage and infidelity, set in the 1960s as the sexual revolution swept over America.Updike published the book in 1968, as that revolution was still building; one coult argue that the sexual revolution did not reach its peak until sometime in the early 1970s. The novel focuses on several fictional New England couples, and Updike is at his best in this book not in the more explicit sexual scenes, but rather in the passages that chronicle the various characters' faint but very real dissatisfactions with their lives.Unfortunately, there is no character in these pages nearly as compelling as Harry Angstrom, (anti-)hero of Updike's tetralogy of \\"Rabbit\\" novels. Piet Hanema, the main character here, is vivid enough, but one senses he was more elusive for Updike -- there's something ghostly about the man, something not quite real or as fully created.It is, however, somewhat unrealistic of me to demand such a character from \\"Couples.\\" I don't think Updike intended it as a deep map of one man's mind, body and soul, as the \\"Rabbit\\" novels offer. Instead, this is more of an ensemble cast, and an exploration of several lives -- including musings on how a single individual's actions can have devastating effects on others.\\"Couples\\" is a worthy novel, though modern readers might actually find it somewhat quaint now. The sexual revolution ended not in a radiant burst of everlasting free love but with the specter of AIDS, and the realization that with freedom comes responsibility. This novel, though it may be fiction, reads as a sort of soap-operatic (I mean that in a good way) documentary of the moral choices Americans were grappling with in the face of great social change."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I've read this novel maybe half a dozen times over the years. the story follows the marriages and affairs of several couples through a few turbulent years of the 1960's. The story draws you into the characters whose lies and deceipts make most of them eminently unlikeable. All of them live in a state of pradoxical moral ambiguity. but still their stories are gripping and tragic. updike breathes life and humanity into the characters while showing us how ugly they van be. as in life in love you must be careful wht you wish for and scheme for. its classic updike and should not be missed."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"I also felt sad for the people when I finished the book. Is there any character to look up to? No. Did any of the characters grow to become better people? No. Is this a typical community of families in the 60's? I don't know. Can you take much from this book and reflect on your own life? Absolutely. The book held my rapt interest throughout. Not your typical fiction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"\\"Couples\\" is an erudite -- if not, at times, overly rigorous -- analysis of marriage; and an attempt to explain how and why our commitments, which here also includes professional life, fail to provide the satisfaction we hoped to find within their strictures.Updike's protagonist -- Piet Hanema -- is a character too ordinary in his fears and impulses to be called a hero and too privileged and single-minded to label an Everyman. He is an architect and the son of Dutch immigrants by way of Grand Rapids, Michigan. A tragic car crash leaves him a middle-aged orphan, a fact that evokes a kind of sarcastic pity from his neighbors and, really, offers feeble excuse for his mischievous streak.With his business partner, the unerringly devout Matt Gallagher, Piet builds and restores houses in the fictional village of Tarbox, applying the attention to his work that he finds difficult to maintain in his marriage. His training in carpentry teaches him that wood will yield, and that he may treat it according to his vision -- and does so -- resulting in clean and stable-looking homes described by one character as \\"a row of teeth.\\"The Hanemas, along with other couples in Tarbox, are carnally comfortable with each other -- sharing intimate sexual details and spouses. Parties are a common motif in the novel and we are, in fact, welcomed to the Hanemas' world after yet another has ended: \\"What do you think of the new couple?\\" Angela Hanema asks, while undressing in their meticulously described bedroom. We learn all about the Guerins, the Constantines, the Saltzes, the Thornes, the Ongs, the Whitmans, the little-Smiths (as well as the curious origin of their surname), and the latter's closest counterparts, the Applebys. The last two are referred to with the adorable portmanteau \\"the AppleSmiths\\" for intriguing reasons elucidated in their own detailed chapter.The couples are introduced rather quickly; we learn their thoughts, pretensions, and insecurities immediately. Updike does not interrupt the narrative with the often tedious business of providing back story -- that point in which the author stops all action to remind us of who these people are and why we ought to care about them. Many of the characters, it seems, are held together by no more than their pretensions, insecurities, and quirks. At one point, Hanema sleeps with the wife of one neighbor who admits to an interest in sadomasochistic sex play -- a rather bold detail for 1966. There are, however, some couples who abstain from Tarbox's unchecked hedonism, such as the Gallaghers. However, Piet's business partner and his wife, Terry, are rather garishly presented as a prudish and insufferably well-behaved couple; though they do provide Piet with the parental guidance he lacks.Piet is the only character who is well-understood outside of his coupling. We don't learn much about the others as individuals until they begin to stray from their marriages. In other cases, it is a major professional failure or a terminal illness that makes one singular. Identity is restored only by tragedy, it seems; we are alone with our failures.As for the setting, Tarbox seems less like a quiet New England village than an island. We receive sporadic updates on the major news of the time, especially pertaining to the Kennedys, perhaps to provide a larger context for the very insular lives these people lead.There are other authors who explore themes of suburban angst and disappointment, most notably John Cheever and Richard Yates. One could argue that their work, or perhaps even another piece by Updike (he did return to this subject, nearly forty years later, with \\"Villages\\"), is more deft and enjoyable. However, \\"Couples\\" provides an interesting and comprehensive exploration of why people work so hard to build comfortable lives only to tear them apart or to watch passively as they decay beyond recognition. It is useful as a timepiece, with references to the freedoms provided by birth control and the constant upheavals that helped define the 1960s. Admittedly, the notion of \\"suburban angst\\" will seem like an anachronism to many readers, as we live in a time when people struggle or yearn to afford homes in quiet suburbs. Yet the novel remains relevant as an exploration of what the words \\"failure,\\" \\"success,\\" and \\"happiness\\" truly mean and the sometimes unfortunate ways in which we choose to define them."},{"Title":"Couples","review":"While this is the first Updike book I have read, I found it to be an interesting read. I think that some of the other reviews over analyze his characters. And since when do all people act in such a rational, predictable manner? I mean think about it... people constantly do either silly or things that are inconsistent at the least...Is he difficult to read? Not to me personally, but then again I spend most of my time reading classical literature. I have read writers who kill you to death with superfluous and tedious details, but I don't think that he is one of them. I also think that he pokes fun at a lot of the society of his time, but I guess some people just look at this book and see sex, sex,sex... I mean there is sex here, but there is other stuff too!

This is the fruition of a quite collosal intellect at work with Updikes passages of lyrical grandour and beautifly shaded expressions of barely recordable emotions bambarding the reader in squadrons. The alarming promiscuity of Piet Hanama and his assoiciates in a New England small town no longer shocks in terms of sexual explicitness but rather the depiction of the ghastly sythentic 'social' occasions and the transparancy of the ostensible friendships displayed should send shivers through anyone themselves caught up in the 'badminton and bridge' set. The accuracy of the personalitys Updike creates is proven through the absolute lack of sympathy or affection that any of them provoke in the reader. The endless self anaylsis and loqaucious navel gazing of the males and females in the novel can be hard to stomach at times and this could have been diluted perhaps if Updike had reduced his cast slightly. There are too many bit-part narcissits languidly sniffing around the perhipery of the plot and not enough emphsis on the pantomime-esque rogue Freddie Thorne who, whilst the most fascinating character is by far the most one-dimensional.The sheer length and convaluted nature of the narrative will limit the appeal of this book to the educated dinner party set it so desparingly describes but this book deserves kudos for it's attempt to capture the selfishness, ennui and cloying dissatifaction at the crux of the American Dream."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"In the early sixties, three young girls make a decision that will affect the rest of their lives. For one girl, it would divide her family; for another, it would devastate her father; for the other, it would be the family's shining moment. Each girl has her own reasons for making the life-changing decision. One seeks to heal a broken heart, one feels a calling from God, and one just did what she knows her family wants her to do. The girls leave behind their families and all their worldly possession, and join into a new family and a new way of life when they enter a convent to become nuns.In her new book, \\"Changing Habits,\\" best-selling author Debbie Macomber explores a world that fascinates many but has remained a mystery for ages; the world of the sisterhood of nuns.Three young women join the sisterhood of St. Bridget's Sisters of the Assumption. Angelina had gone to Catholic schools all her life and had a special affinity for the nuns who taught her. She felt she had a calling from God, and despite her father's objections, entered the convent determined to return the gift of learning by becoming a parochial teacher. Kathleen had known she would become a nun since she was six years old because it was what her family expected of her. Joanne entered the convent broken-hearted and searching for peace after her fianc&eacute; returned from Vietnam married to another woman.Each woman goes through the process from postulate to novice to sister, and each finds her vocation within the sisterhood. Angelina and Kathleen become teachers, and Joanne becomes a nurse. Although secluded from most of the \\"real\\" world in their early years, as they mature and become more involved in their community each sister finds that events of the world soon affect their own lives, and eventually causes each to reconsider their place among the religious order.Angelina loves her position as a teacher, but when she feels that she has failed a young pregnant teenager she finds herself longing to return home to help her father in the family restaurant. Kathleen helps out the young and handsome parish priest with problems with an older priest, but when evidence turns up that she helped the priest cover up money problems she is forced to leave the sisterhood amidst betrayal and shame. Joanne finds that she is drawn to the Vietnam Veteran doctor she assists at the hospital, and leaves to become a devoted wife and helpmate to the man she loves.The stories of their individual journeys back to the world are complex and enriching. Although they are no longer called \\"Sister,\\" Angelina, Joanne, and Kathleen find that they are influenced throughout their lives by their time spent as nuns.Normally considered a romance writer, author Debbie Macomber has entered the world of mainstream women's fiction with great success. In this novel, Macomber was inspired to write this intriguing story by a cousin who had been a nun, and had also left her order to pursue life in the \\"real\\" world. Her depictions of women who lived the cloistered life and who returned to live full and satisfying lives as wives, mothers, and successful business women is realistic, warm and enlightening."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"After working in a bookstore for a few years, I am ashamed to admit that I sometimes still judge a book by its cover and, more often, by where it is shelved.Changing habits is written by Debbie Macomber, who is shelved in romance. Yet, somehow, she just doesn't fit there. This book more than any of her others shows that.Changing habits is a group of very well told tales that are also very well blended - a challenge for any author. The stories span time and yet somehow are all contemporary. There is romance, but not in the bodice-ripping or even sassy-female kind of way one comes to expect these days.The stories are about faith and the loss of it, religion and the turning from it, the struggles within the Catholic church, and, at its best, life, and how some very different women live it.I enjoyed this book.

But three young women decide to use their lives to serve God and become nuns.Kathleen O'Shaughnessy, from a large Boston Irish family, has always known she'd become a nun. There was never any question from the time of her first communion on. And a more wonderful and devout nun you'd be hard pressed to find. But when Kathleen's naivet&eacute; allows her to get into a very sticky situation, her fellow nuns have no problem sending her away... .Joanna and Greg became engaged before he left for Vietnam. They had become intimate before - conflicting with Joanna's morals. But she knows they are meant for each other and while he is gone she spends time planning the wedding. But Joanna is in for a shock when he returns, giving her all the impetus she needs to enter the convent. She becomes a caring nurse and in her caring ends up devoting herself to more than just her patients when a troubled young physician forces her to take stock of her life.Angelina joined the convent despite her father's vehement protest. The young Italian girl has been primed to take over her father's restaurant business from an early age. Sister Angelina becomes a schoolteacher, caring deeply for her students. But when she is unable to help one of her favorites, leading to tragedy, Angelina is unable to forgive herself.Debbie Macomber has given readers a glimpse into a world that has many a mystery to many. As a non-Catholic the depth of the isolation forced on the novices, especially in the late sixties, surprised me. But Macomber has chosen to set the bulk of CHANGING HABITS in a time that saw many changes in the Catholic Church and for the nuns in particular.The poignant stories and choices made by these three women make for one of the most compelling books I've read in a very long time. In spite of the subject matter, there is romance as well, but the story really belongs to Kathleen, Joanna, and Angie.This book is very highly recommended not only for its interesting subject matter but also for the compassion with which Macomber tackles controversial issues, as well as her trademark poignancy. It certainly proves why she is one of the most beloved authors writing today."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"In the 1960s, three young women from diverse lifestyles enter St. Peter's Parrish in Minneapolis with the belief they are destined to become nuns. Angelina Marcello, Kathleen O'Shaunessy, and Joanna Baird had different reasons for becoming \\"Brides of Christ\\", but shared an idealism to serve God and help the community.In 1972 the three nuns struggle with crisis of faith. For Sister Angelina, it was the simple failure of the Church to deal with the problems of a pregnant teen Corrine that sent her back to her father's restaurant. Temporarily taking over the accounting journal led Sister Kathleen to Father Brian Doyle with both wrestling between their vows and a very human love for one another. For Sister Joanna, the return of Viet Nam vet Dr. Tim Murray reminds her that she joined for the wrong reasons as she begins to fall in love with the still recovering medical practitioner. Will the church lose three more dedicated people or will the vows prove strong enough to keep these Sisters within the fold?CHANGING HABITS is not the typical fare from Debbie Macomber, but is an insightful look at some of the problems the modern day Catholic Church is confronting in America. The story line is well written as the trio of nuns seems so genuine and human. The support cast enables the audience to understand their motives from entry into the Church until the individual crisis of faith occurs. Readers will feel strongly what each one of the Sisters contends with as Ms. Macomber powerfully focuses on the critical loss of nuns facing the Church today.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I just finished reading \\"Changing Habits,\\" by Debbie Macomber, who is, to me, a new author. I'd never read her books until recently, when I read two of the books in her Blossom Street series, which, while they aren't deep writing, are feel-good and satisfying. It seemed she gives some of her characters more depth than others. In both of the books I read, there were 2 or 3 characters that I felt I 'knew' and could see in my mind but others that just weren't developed beyond the basics.So I wasn't expecting that \\"Changing Habits\\" would be deep and extremely detailed in the way of character development. It wasn't. BUT, the author does have a gift for developing a good storyline and hooking the reader. This book follows three women in three different states and in different situations, as they each decide they are called to be nuns. I learned so much about nuns that I never knew, and I was raised Catholic during the time in which this book is set.I enjoyed reading this; it was light reading, great stories for each character. I thought the ending was kind of untidy. Some of the dialogue was stilted (particularly between one of the characters, Joanna, and her husband, who have been married 30 years. The conversations between them sound like talk between a couple that's just met! I just didn't find it believable.) and I was left wondering about parts of the story lines.Anyway, if you want a quick, interesting read, give it a try. I loved the author's Blossom Street series and will continue reading Debbie Macomber's books."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I absolutely loved this book and the author's style of writing. It was the first book I read by her but it won't be the last. In my opinion, this author works very hard to make her characters believable and interesting. Great book."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"In the late 1950s and early 1960s, three young women decide to become nuns. Angelina has a sudden calling while on a school retreat. Kathleen had always planned on being a nun. And Joanna had planned to marry but felt her calling when her fiance came home from Viet Nam with an Asian bride. As noviates and as nuns, the three learn a great deal about themselves and their faith. Yet, even behind their cloister walls, the events of the 1960s and 1970s cannot leave them unaltered. Each suffers a crisis in their faith--for one, the realization that the Church's views on birth control can be destructive; for another, desire for a man; for a third, the sisterhood's unwillingness to stand up and defend her when she needs it most. Somehow, the three women must learn to reenter the common world and make their place in a nation that has been transformed while they had turned inward.Author Debbie Macomber has a knack for developing fascinating characters and seeing them through traumatic life changes. CHANGING HABITS, with its emphasis on the three women and their shared journey to faith and beyond, lets Macomber run with this strength. Each of the three women is interesting and becomes more interesting as they leave their youth behind them and struggles to find their place in faith and back in the profane world. Macomber's deft touch lets her bring in the events of the 1960s and 1970s (the assassinations of Kennedy, King, and Kennedy, Watergate, and especially Viet Nam) and the transformations of the Catholic Church (Vatican II, the debate over birth control, and the Church's self-inflicted wounds as it tried to hide renegade Priests from their punishments) in a way that will resonate with those who remember them, yet without detracting from the fundamental issues of the novel itself (this is alway a challenge in dealing with issues that remain controversial today).CHANGING HABITS is sometimes episodic. Rather than a continuous story line, Macomber gives highlights of the lives these women experience, focussing on the key transitions and decisions that each must make. The language is occasionally simplistic and CHANGING HABITS sometimes reads like it was intended for young adults. The interesting characters and the decisions they face, though, will appeal to all ages. Macomber delivers an enjoyable Woman's Fiction story."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"It is one of the best books I have read of Debbie Macomber's. The three girls and their stories kept me up all night reading."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Debbie Macomber presents an honest look at the lives of three young women who discover that there are many ways to &quot;serve God&quot;. Without resorting to the all too common Church bashing attitude, &quot;Changing Habits&quot; shows the complex interaction of individuals, family and the world in shaping institutions and the people working within them. Although a bit predictable, this book does an excellent job of portraying the evolution of the Catholic Church and the efforts of people to remain faithful to themselves and to the truth in an ever changing world."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I received my book in good condition and extremely promptly. I would order from this seller again."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Had there been an in-depth treatment of the motives, situations, and dispositions of the four characters, the premise of this novel could have been intriguing. Unfortunately, the characters are quite one-dimensional, and the situations not treated with any depth. The general effect is of a poor play.The attraction to convent life is peripheral in all of the subjects, and they do not ultimately confront true convictions or their own motives. The odd effect is of women in young adulthood (all leave the convent while still in their twenties) who are shaken by confronting troubling situations, common in some form to any adult life, and who find some vague solution merely by departing from convent life. The two who marry seem childish and impulsive in the choice (one drawn by a handsome face and the idea that she's got the man to return to church, the other suddenly contemplating marriage to her spiritual advisor, who cannot deal with having a homosexual priest in his parish) - though, at the end, there is a sense of 'happily ever after, one as Catholic, the other renegade.'Though Macomber writes of an era when convent life was in tumult, neither the overall situation nor a directly related conflict in the lives of the Sisters is treated. The Sister who is unjustly accused of 'doctoring the books' for her own advantage, and the other who blames herself for a student's having a back alley abortion, seem to be running from their first look at tragic but common parts of life. The reader seems to be told that the Sisters are departing from an unfair Church, yet incidents such as these are never developed as quite common paths to mature knowledge of oneself.The 'fudged' ending has no resolution or purpose. We learn that they have no regret for having been nuns, yet still cannot see what drew them to the life or how leaving was the answer to their problems.The deficiencies in plot, theme (if indeed there is one), and characterisation are all the more unfortunate because a premise such as this could have been fascinating. The potential for reflecting history, exploring spiritual and psychological aspects, and treating of the complexity of human nature was ignored. We are left with one-dimensional characters who cannot even consider the larger picture of their own community."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"LIKED THIS BOOK I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT READ FOR ME,BUT REALLY ENJOYED IT DEBBIE MACOMBER DOSE IT AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GREAT READ"},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I'm not a Macomber fan. I've never liked her shmaltzy style or poorly researched story backgrounds.I want to give credit where it is due when I find the opportunity.Ms. Macomber did a very fine job of exploring the issues which Nuns can confront and which can force them to reevaluate the decision to continue with that life. I felt that she was able to present an unbiased view of the three women in this story revealing the way that each resolved those issues.Good job."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"What a change from the regular stories she writes. This was a great book and I loved it. Wow she is always giving us new themes to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Changing Habits is an extraordinary book. It introduces us to three young women from different backgrounds, Kathleen, Angelina, and Joanna, and their journey through the convent and later life outside the convent. Told through their eyes, each chapter features one of the girls experiences and how it affects their life in the convent and eventually the women they become.When I picked up the book, I didn't know how wrapped up in the story I would get. Each girl had their own story to tell and how their personal struggles affected themselves and their faith. I didn't know much about the Catholic Order, but with reading this book, I got information that was both interesting and not overwhelming. This book touched me in ways that most books can't even begin to match. It's a wonderful book that will make you think differently and look at your life in a whole new light.A must read for anyone looking for a heartwarming and touching book!"},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Heard the taped version of CHANGING HABITS by Debbie Macomber . . . it is the story of two women who enter the convent, then both leave it for various reasons . . . their respectivetales were interesting, and I enjoyed reading about both of them--until the ending . . . Macomber seems to have gotten tired of writing at that point in time and fast forwards thingsto a reunion of all the sisterhood members . . . I wanted to know more about what happened to the two women; instead, the last 30 years of their lives were condensed into a few minutes (pages, I imagine, if you're reading) at the end . . . Trini Alvarado--an actress I've admired but who just hasn't been in that many films to suit my taste--did an excellent job of narration."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"What a great beach book! I loved the way the author took 3 young ladies from different areas and time periods and weaved their stories together into a perfect tapestry. What a step back to the 1960s; it evoked many memories. It was fascinating to see how the church changed over the years and the impact it had on the women. From the first page to the last Ms. Macomber has written a compelling novel with no loose ends. Sometimes it seems like authors rush to finish a book, resulting in a weak ending. That is not the case with this one--it's quality through the last tissue in the box! It was my first Macomber book, and it won't be the last."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I just finished reading this book and it was very interesting and held my attention to the end. All of Debbie Macomber's books are well written. I like her style of writing."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I agree with the positive things that the other reviewers said about this book. However, this book left me feeling the same way as I did at the end of Cast Away. There just wasn't enough time spent describing how the sisters assimulated into secular life. 30 years were wrapped up in a chapter or two.I gave this book 3 stars because while it was good while it lasted at the end I felt down. I won't keep this one in my library to read over again."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Did I read the same book? I wish I could have those hours back. Perhaps this is not my genre - I read it because it was the choice of my book group. I'm sure I'll never read another book by this author.Why didn't I like this book? It was sooooooo predictable after about 50 pages. And the writing was very bland and uninteresting."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I was under the impression that this was a christian novel... not... way to sensual for good teens to read. Very disapointed in this author."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I am a big fan of Debbie Macomber, but I didn't think I was going to like this book because i'm not Catholic. But it was a very good book. And I would recomend it to any of my friends to read."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and KritiquesTwo young women enter the convent in the 1960s for very different reasons and both later leave the convent as well, around the same time, also for different reasons.Angelina Marcello goes on a school field trip and suddenly gets the very strong feeling that God is calling her to become a bride of Christ and become a nun. Her father is furious and does not want her to go, preferring she stay with him and help run the family restaurant that she'll own some day.Joanna Baird is supposed to get married when her fianc&eacute; has to go to Nam. She continues to plan the wedding, and they expect to be married when her returns from the war. When he comes home with a pregnant Vietnamese bride, Joanna is heartbroken and six months later joins the convent, believing she has a calling to the vocation.Both girls find contentment and even happiness behind the walls of the convent. Angelina is a high school teacher and Joanna a nurse at the local hospital. Then Joanna falls in love with a doctor at the hospital, a Vietnam vet. Angelina grows very attached to a young girl she teaches, but then that girl dies from complications due to an illegal back alley abortion. Now both women are Changing Habits and must resolve their respective crises of faith outside of the religious order.Wow, even in abridged format that completely erases the story of a third young woman at the convent, Changing Habits is a very powerful story. These young women join the church at a very tumultuous time for the Catholic Church and for the country. While the focus is on the girls' lives as nuns, we get quite a glimpse at current events happening all around them, from the scandals of the Nixon presidency to church politics.I was pulled right into the story, engrossed in the lives of these young women. Macomber is brilliant when it comes to portraying the hearts of her characters, which in turn makes the readers emotionally invested in the story. I cried with Angelina as she lost a student so very dear to her and I felt empathy for Joanna as she struggles to resist passions denied to nuns.I'm very disappointed Kathleen's story was completely eliminated in the abridged book though. From the book descriptions I found, hers sounds like it was quite a story. But due to the nature of her story, I wonder if it was eliminated due to this book being published right around the time so much scandal in the Catholic Church was being uncovered.I also was thrown a little at the end of the story when the women reunite after many years apart and they suddenly appear to be best friends. Since the bulk of the story was divided out as each nun's story was told, we never saw the development of the bond these women appear to share at the conclusion of the novel. Whether this was because the book was abridged for audio or because it was never really portrayed in the novel I am unable to save.What I do know however is I am so very glad I recently \\"discovered\\" Debbie Macomber. With the sheer numbers of books she has written over the years, I'm amazed I never tried anything by her until recently. She has fast become a beloved author of mine however and Changing Habits is a perfect example of why I love her writing.Kelley A. Hartsell, April 2008. All rights reserved."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"I loved this book, read it in one sitting. This book is honest and digs deep into some uncomfortable places without sacrificing heart or grace. This will go on my keeper shelf!"},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Nearly forty years ago, three young women feel that they are called to serve God, and their chosen way is to become nuns. Though they enter the same order, each is a very different person.Kathleen has always felt called to the convent, Angie enters despite her father's opposition, and Joanna goes in to help heal a heart broken by betrayal. As the years pass, each one is called upon to make sacrifices, to face humility, and to use her gifts to the maximum. Through the changes wrought by Vatican II, Vietnam, and life's own quirks, the girls are brought to the point where they must choose whether or not to remain as they are or to rejoin the world outside the convent doors...This timely, serious novel will face critsism as anti-religious by some, yet the opposite is true. It shows how you can serve God, even if it's not always the way you think you are meant to at first. Love and duty can sometimes be at war. Like Father Greeley, Ms. Macomber sheds new light on the lives of the secluded and tells a fine story in the process."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"A very predictable story.

Love the way Macomber portrays her characters. Very interesting concepts revealed in this book. A lot of insight into the workings of a convent and its effect on the women choosing this way of life."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Angelina, Kathleen and Joanna each had very different reasons for joining St. Bridget's Sisters of the Assumption in the early 1960s. But each was devoted to her faith, and despite the strict, complex rules of the convent and the swirling controversies of the outside world, each stayed true to her call.But one by one, each woman suffers an unexpected crisis of faith. And ultimately, all three leave the sisterhood for the exciting, confusing world outside the convent walls. It's not an easy choice, and it's not an easy change.I found this book fascinating - I had no idea what a nun's life was like, and I felt that Macomber did a good job of exploring and explaining the maze of regulations that rule a so-called simple life. She touches on controversies within the church in dramatic, poignant ways, weaving storytelling in with historical facts.I do wish the women's lives had been more entwined - while they're all nuns and they all know each other, they don't interact that much, and I found myself wishing for that deeper friendship that's often woven through Macomber's novels. Also, since the book covers such a large span of time - starting in the late 50s and ending in the new millennium - there are large chunks of time that are glossed over. I wanted more details.Still, small complaints in an overall compelling story."},{"Title":"Changing Habits","review":"Couldn't put this down.

And yes, I sometimes get snobby too about \\"romance\\" novels, but this is neither a romance nor a \\"throwaway\\" book. Debbie Macomber is always a good storyteller, but this novel, about three women who choose to be nuns before Vatican II and what happens in their lives is moving, spiritual and has a truth that resonates.I'm not going to do spoilers and retell the plot, but I will say that I was deeply drawn to each young woman who took the step in becoming a Sister. None of the three was fey or silly about her decision; each prayed long and hard and believed she was making the right choice. The very real struggles, heartaches and triumps of these women, and their heartfelt wish to be good members of their convent, moved me deeply.This is a beautiful, beautiful book, well worth the read.

The Remedy -- describes it beautifully: why we have the ups and downs of our economy, which cause incredible human misery, and why we have increasing poverty at the same time that there is hugely increasing wealth.And Henry George provides a logical and workable -- even elegant -- remedy, one which will untangle many of the perverse incentives we cope with today: we say we value work, but we tax it. We say we want to promote sales, but we tax them. We say we want to encourage entrepreneurial effort, but we allow huge barriers designed to discourage the person with an idea from being able to execute it. We say we want a society that naturally creates more jobs, but we allow a relative few of us to pocket the funds which would create those jobs. We say we value initiative, but we reward the \\"dog in the manger\\" far more than we reward the laborer. We say that urban blight is a bad thing, but our tax code encourages it. We say we dislike urban sprawl, and long commutes, and low wages -- but we've failed to implement the simple tax reform that will correct these ills. We work longer hours than our counterparts in other countries, and have less to show for it. We allow a relative few to own our airwaves, and resell them at higher and higher prices, collecting advertising revenues from all who would run for public office or advertise their products.If we truly mean to end poverty, to reward initiative, to ensure that the next child born in America is truly the equal of all who are here today, to ensure that our environment is protected for the common good, George's framework for understanding provides the missing puzzle piece.And as we consider what sort of country we'd like Iraq to be, it is worth considering that if we only give them a constitution without giving them an economic system that considers all people equal, truly equal, we've not accomplished much with the American lives we've lost there.If we can figure it out for Iraq, with all its oil wealth, maybe we can figure out how to share America justly among Americans, too.George lays out simply and elegantly what the underlying problem is and how to solve it.He dedicates the book \\"To those who, seeing the vice and misery that spring from the unequal distribution of wealth and privilege, feel the possibility of a higher social state and would strive for its attainment.\\" Might you be among those who see and feel, and would strive, if only you could see the source of the problem?Churchill, Twain, Huxley, Shaw and many others came to see what George was pointing out. Will you?This one is worth your time!Get a copy for yourself, and send one to your favorite legislator, be he/she local, state or federal. Then start looking for other Georgists, also known as Geoists. You'll find them a lively group with a vision that might inspire you, too. And it is refreshing to be with people who seek a finer society, not more advantage or privilege -- \\"private law\\" -- for their own benefit! --"},{"Title":"Essentials of Real Estate Investment","review":"Excellent reference book for beginning and moderately experienced investors.

Every singlestory was predictable. I found none of them to be original or special.Mr. Block, along the line of Elmore Leonard, has a gift for dialoge but his stories are dull and repetitious.And the book itself was so bloody heavy it was a pain to comfortably read."},{"Title":"Enough Rope","review":"Fans of Block's series characters will find plenty to enjoy here, including nine Matt Scudder stories, three featuring burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr, and five with hit man Keller. They have all appeared elsewhere at one time or another, but unless you're a Block completist, you're unlikely to have seen several of them before. Even if you have read some of them, this book is still an invaluable addition to your collection, as it includes all of the stories and presents them in chronological order, something impossible to find prior to this.Perhaps the best thing about &quot;Enough Rope,&quot; though, is the inclusion of a dozen new works, most of them fairly lengthy for short stories, all of them superbly crafted and delightful little reads. A few in particular, like &quot;Almost Perfect&quot; (about a murderous baseball game) and &quot;Points&quot; (about a father and son) stand out for their quality and inventiveness. Even after half a decade of writing short fiction, Block is still trying, and succeeding at, new things. (For historical value, if nothing else, the author's first published story is included as well.)&quot;Enough Rope&quot; is a hefty book, containing eighty-three stories that run almost 900 pages. That represents virtually every published story by this prolific writer. It is a testimony to the popularity of Block and the quality of his writing that his publisher would take such a gamble and produce such a large, handsome volume. &quot;Enough Rope&quot; is a real treat.Reviewed by David Montgomery, MysteryInkOnline.com"},{"Title":"Enough Rope","review":"I discovered Lawrence Block when he was writing a monthly column for \\"Writer's Digest\\" magazine back in the late 70's. His contribution was always the highlight of each issue, so I began reading his novels and short stories. Now almost all of his shorter pieces, over a 40-year career, are in this volume...885 pages worth. For the price, you can't get another book that will give you as much enjoyment as this one, and teach you about well-crafted writing to boot. All his tales have a twist, and he wastes no words. Block is as good in his own way as Dick Francis and Robert B. Parker are in theirs. I had read many of these older stories in the 80's, but forgot the details until encountering them again in this volume. He'll occasionally make you laugh, more often give you a shiver, but always, his people resonate, even the darkest characters.

Just the right length for a quick fix of Block irony, and arranged by character, this is a great beach book or airport companion.

That said, this huge book exceeded expectations. Short stories of many of his featured characters and other unknown tales (to me at least). Whimsical at times, fanciful and delightful. I read 12 stories while flying to Vegas last week. Would read one or two, take a break, come back and read some more.I had read a couple of these previously, but having them all together was nice.

For the novice,this collection is a good primer of many of Block's characters. For the more seasoned Block fan,it is yet another unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"Enough Rope","review":"The first four stories of Enough Rope were bad enough for me never to buy a book written by Mr. Block again. His writing is pedestrian and he clumsily tries to spice it up by throwing in polysyllabic words. Finally, I began picking stories at random to see whether there would be any improvement. It was an utter waste of time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was a amusing book, but Harry is a bad character. He is kinda dorky, and so are his friends.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book for children and adults!!! Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is very well written and a real page turner.

This book has however, proved me wrong. (Which I'm getting use to!) When I read the first book I felt like I was there in with Harry going on adventures with him and Ron and Hermione. I loved it and especially loved Hagrid, Hermione, and Ron's personalities. One of the things different about this book than the first book of the series is that there's this really snotty wizard who....I won't tell you...you'll have to read the book! Also I love it how J.K. Rowling plans the whole story out, then at the very end, all the pieces of the puzzle come together making the story sooooooooooo spectacular. (And I'm not counting just the story itself) If your reading this right now....BUY THIS BOOK! I promise you that you'll be more than satisfied with it. I only hope that the next book of the series gets out soon!!!!! I know that I'll be on the waiting list praying that It'll come in the mail soon.

Very Mystical , well written makes a great story.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry and his high jinks, this is getting too old for me..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This Harry Potter book was great. My brother and sister had been reading these books as well as many of my friends but I wasn't into them. After a few years I decided to pick up the first book and read it. After that I knew I was going to read the rest of the series. This book fit perfectly into the series and was an exciting read. I recommend it to anyone who likes to read books for pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The only real problem was that the book was described as \\"like new\\" and we got it with bent, worn corners. Could have been due to the way it was packed. None the less, it was a little disappointing. Probably not a big deal in the long run but it would have been nice to get exactly what we thought we were getting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My item came in own time adequately wrapped. Also, the item was as advertised, except the book I purchased didn't have a dust jacket. Overall, I was glad that I purchased from this seller."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Yes its better than the movie. Much more details than the movie. Even an adult will enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I originally read the first Harry Potter book when my kids were young. I thought it was yet another cookie-cutter fantasy rip-off. But it has become hard to find good fantasy these days, so I thought I'd give the series another try (now that all the books are available!)Well of course it cast its spell on me and I am hooked! I am starting book 6 now. Why am I reviewing this book? Because I have been reading other people's reviews of it, and the reviews are about as entertaining as the book itself! It is hilarious to read that people don't like Harry Potter because \\"it doesn't teach any Moral Values\\". I imagine that these people don't like to eat a muffin in the morning or watch a ball game because these things don't have a moral value, they are just \\"enjoyable\\".I did have mixed feelings about this book. Like the first book, parts of it are kind of silly...like the flying car and the \\"whomping willow\\", not to mention \\"haunted plumbing\\" (well, when we live in old houses, maybe that's not so unbelievable). I could really do with fewer descriptions of spells involving exotic animal parts (the animal rights people would have an issue about this). Ridiculous goings-on, an outrageous castle where poltergeists float around and staircases appear and disappear (I wonder if the author was visualizing the movie when she wrote). This book kind of reminded me of Nancy Drew detective stories. There is a contrived mystery with set-up clues which the genius sidekick (Hermione) just happens to find in an old book. Oh, did I mention one-dimensional characters? Malfoy is \\"bad\\", his sidekicks are \\"thuggish\\", and the Weasleys are extremely annoying. Any scene involving the Weasley family can be skimmed over because it will be pages and pages of exploding firecrackers, magical household disasters and other pointless foolery. I'm sure they will be even worse in the movies.So basically, I enjoyed this book, but it was light bedtime reading. I think that if Rowling had stopped after this one, it would have gone down to oblivion. I believe the chief value of the first few Potter books is that they are a set-up to the later books. It is not till about book 4 (Goblet of Fire) that I began to see what was behind the silliness... the tragic backstory of Harry's parents, an epic struggle, and a fascinating alternate world of wizards that exists right next to our own.Now that I am starting Book 6, I actually went back and skimmed over the first few books again to pick up some of the details. It is kind of like the first part of Lord of the Rings: Tolkien started off with cutesie-pie Hobbits and their fairy-story world, and you get the feeling the author was writing for children. But somewhere in the middle the author and the readers grew up. The cutesie pie became grim, and you couldn't read the books at night anymore."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"What is in the chamber of secrets? Harry wants to find out who is the heir of Slytheryn. However, everyone thinks he is the heir and the teachers won't allow anyone out by themselves at night. So Harry uses the invisibility cloak to sneak out to see Hagrid to follow the spiders. Do you think Harry will find out who is the heir of Slytheryn to clear his name?I think this is a good book because it has twist and turns. It is surprising and full of action. There is also a lot of extra stuff that will make it an adventure to remember. I think you should read the whole series (1-7)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love, love the later Harry Potter books. The first was okay, but this one just didn't click with me. It's my least favorite and I stopped reading it a few times. I'm glad I powered through the blek blek blek to get to the better later books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"..2 points short of being memorable...The return to the magical world of Harry Potter starts with Harry meeting a rather unusual creature from the magic world--in Harry's Muggle world! This leads to Harry being spirited away by the Weasley twins and Ron...in a flying car. Harry stays with the Weasleys until the second year at Hogwarts begins--giving Harry his first experience of a real family. The classes, Quidditch matches, and fun escapades continue at Hogwarts, written so warmly and enticingly that it seems sloop real. All the favorite characters are back, of course, be they human or owl or Hagrid :) There's also a new teacher, one so pompous and annoying that you'll want to punch him! But the main plot is oh so predictable and only gets exciting at the end. However...for getting more of the magical world you love, \\"hanging with\\" the characters who are friends (and enemies) read this."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was very good it had a lot of mysteries to be solved and a few twists and turns here and there anyways it was a very good book I just love a;ll the Harry Potter movies and books of course.I just don't know how these books make you keep reading it, it has this force of dragging you back to reading it it's just WOW."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book was in better condition than I expected.

It starts out another normal birthday for Harry until a house elf named Dobby pays a visit. Dobby warns Harry not to go to Hogwarts this yearfor disaster will strike. But Harry doesn't pay any attention to the warning and goes to school anyway. At first it is just a normalconfusing year. The school has a new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher ,Gilderoy Lockhart, a concieded warlock who says he's good and has the books to proof it, but refuses to do deminstrations. Harry also has the attentions of two first years Ginny Weasley (Ron's younger sister) and Colin Creevey a boy who loves to take pictures of Harry any chance he gets. But then the attacks start and people think Harry is the culprit. Who is really behind these horrible attacks? Can Harry find out and proof his innocence?

Rowling will keep you spellbound with &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;. It has all the aspects of the first book: action, adventure, and suspense. I love how J. K. Rowling makes her memorable characters come alive by making you love them or hate them. After I finished with &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; I couldn't wait to get the sequel. Words cannot tell how much I love these books, I mean even my mom loves them. J. K. Rowling has gotta be one of the world's greatest author's and I hope she'll keep the books coming!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the second book in the Harry Potter series. It is a really good book. It is about a mysterious monster who tries to kill all of the pupils at Hogwarts. A great buy for anyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just finished &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;, only a day and a half after starting it. In five days, I've read the first two books, and in my opinion, this is by far better than the first.Starting with the good: The plot is darker, much more of a horror than an adventure, and a lot like something Stephen King might write--my favorite author. Second, the characters are now more interesting due to their increasing knowledge of magic, which makes the plot and the story a little more action-packed. Also, I liked the surprise ending--just like the first--and just as I did in the first book, I didn't figure it out until it actually happened.The Bad: There aren't too many things wrong with this book. It's about thirty pages longer than the first, which isn't bad, and is actually better for the story. However, the ending is dragged out, and it could've come to a close a little sooner. Another thing would be the beginning, where a lot is reviewed from the first book. You could actually pick this one up and understand it having no prior knowledge as to what happened in Book 1 (although I do recommend it.) If the author would've just started where she left off, assuming that they were to be read in order without a review, I--and probably many others--would've appreciated it.Other than that, I have no other complaints. This is, in fact, the better of the first two. I just started reading the third, and I hear it's the best of the first four, but I'm not jumping to any conclusions considering I heard the second was boring and dull."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter books have to be the best books I have ever read. They are captivating and leave me counting down the months until the next book is released. You definitly won't be disapointed!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this, the second book in J.K. Rowling's highly acclaimed series, Harry and his friends return to Hogwarts Academy for more education and adventure. Along with their studies, Harry, Ron and Hermione have to deal with a poltergeist in the ladies' room ... and many other interesting secrets that reveal themselves over the course of the tale. I find this series of novels highly entertaining, for adults and young folks alike. This is a book that lends itself well to being read aloud, so that the entire family might enjoy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it was really interesting and it made you want to countinue reading the book. Well I think that it was good but some parts were boring like when they kept on saying that Heermione whent to the libary. So what I am tring to so that I like this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is about a boy named Harry Potter. It's his second year at Hogwarts but his mean Aunt and Uncle wont let him go to his magic school. So his best friend Ron Weasley comes and pretty much kidnaps him. Harry is very happy with Ron's family because they care about him.Once Ron and Harry get to Hogwarts they have a mystery on their hands because there is a monster on the loose. When they here about the monster they want to go see the action up close so they go looking for the Chamber of Secrets were the monster lives. To see if they find the monster and how the chamber was opened you will have to read the book.My OpinionI think Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good book. I think that because the plot of the story is amazing. I also think J.K Rowling did an excellent job on righting the book because she didn't leave any details out. The book is better than alot of other books because you are able to picture the scene in your mind. Harry Potter is a good book for kids around eight or older because in some parts it could be pretty scary. Even though most of my friends read this book, I would defiantly recommend this book to any one else. The Harry Potter book series probably did such a good job selling the books because there are not many good books with suspense and magic. That's why I would recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book. J.K. Rowling has not only created a very magical world but, it crosses over into the real world enough to make the fantasy seem more plausible. I remember reading the Wizard of Oz books as a child and and being able to vividly see Frank L. Baum's creations in my mind's eye. J. K. Rowling has done the same for me with the Harry Potter series and I found myself reading voraciously. I kept returning to this book all day until I had completed it. To parents: fear not, the book is no threat to your children's religious beliefs. Those of us who delighted at Peter Pan or the Wizard of Oz or Star Wars as children remember what it was like to fantasize about things magical and wondrous. This book is not more of a threat than these stories were to us."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hey everyone- anyone who has not read the harry potter series is crazy- these are the best books ever!! the second one isnt the best of all of them, my fav is the fourth, but it is awesome too-u really feel like ur in the magical world. anyone who has only seen the movie- if u liked it, then u should know tht the books are fifty million times better, and if u didnt like it, u should know tht the books are nothing like the movie and are soooo much cooler!!! (the only good part in the movie was quidditch but anyway) so about the second book- this is really good- harry has a really cool adventure and his life in hogwarts continued to unfold! (but dont read this if u havent read the first book- make sure u read the first one first) anyway enjoy!! stop reading this review and buy the book and start reading- youll love it!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought this book was the best.

And those who consider it &quot;not for children&quot; are wrong, this book has nothing that coud offend a young reader.

This year strange things are happening at Hogwarts,students attacked,a crazy elf named Dobby, and Harry hearing voices in the halls. Who or what is making them? I would recommend this book to anyone who likes mystery and adventure.I believe that almost everyone who has read this book would say that they loved it. I enjoy reading books by J.K. Rowling, because she gives the story a life. She makes you feel like your in the book,like your right around the corner listening and watching the characters."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book of the Harry Potter series, &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,&quot; has more twists and turns, is more exciting, and provides more scary imagery than the first book. There are more dangers awaiting Harry than ever before, and it provides for a reading experience that exceeds the promise of the first book exponentially.In this tale, it is Year Two for Harry, and everyone who was nasty to Harry in the first book is even nastier here. The Dursleys are meaner than ever, Professor Snape oozes contempt for Harry more than last time, and Draco Malfoy, Harry's main rival at Hogwarts, is even more delightfully slimy and slippery.J.K. Rowling's writing is as straight-forward and uncomplicated as the first book, and it is a wonderfully fast read. The events unfold before you at such a rapid rate that I never wanted to put the book down.If you have read the first book, or seen the first movie, this book is a MUST-HAVE. How can you resist the further adventures of Harry Potter? (If you can, you are a stronger person than myself.) I prefer to be sucked into Harry's world, and I think you'd enjoy the second trip yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the second in the hugely successful series about the boy wizard. In this book, Harry Potter has just finished his terrible summer vacation with the Dursleys and goes back to Hogwarts for his second year of wizard training. He is visited by a strange goblin Dobby, who warns him not to go back to Hogwarts. Despite this unpleasing warning, Harry Potter is ready to start his new school year and Quidditch practice. However horrible things soon start to happen. The annoying cat of Filtch is attacked and petrified. Then a boy is attacked in the same way. Soon the whole school is in big fear. However some Hogwarts students are attacked and petrified- even one of Harry&iexcl;s best friends, Hermione, becomes a victim. The only thing that the victims have in common is that they are all Muggle-born. Can Harry solve the mystery and rescue his friends and Hogwarts? The reader follows Harry through his exciting adventures in which Voldermort must be outwitted again.The plot is definitely full of interesting twists that pull the reader right into the story. Everything Harry Potter does is so heroic that makes the reader love him. However there is one part I am not much satisfied. When Hogwarts people find out that Hermione is attacked and petrified. Harry thinks of Hogwarts will be closed and he needs to go back and live with the Dursleys again, which his unfortunate future days can be imagined. That is why, as the book says, the reason why Harry needs to find out who is the headmaster of these terrible events, stop him and rescue the victims. But in my opinion, it is better for him to consider of his best friend rather than his own life. He should be more miserable and grieve when he sees the cold and stiff body of Hermione.The first one of Harry Potter ends in a pretty unexpected way. The mastermind appears to be a man who is not suspected in the first place at all. So while reading the second one, I was thinking of somebody else to be the bad guy, not Molfoy. However I was wrong this time. The Molfoys is still the bad guys, just the big bad one shows up in a very surprising way. Dobby's ending is fun and brilliant too. I just cannot stop praising Harry, our young hero.This book is certainly interesting. I could not stop reading it till midnight, though the finals were coming. It just stuck on my hand."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second one gets better than the first! My favourite among the lot of four! This one has more adventures but a great logical ending too! Loved it!! New characters are introduced in this one and believe me nothing like this book!

How can people even think of banning this series?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I rate this book 5 stars.J.K Rowling has inspired me by this magical fantasy novel of a young wizard going through his second year of Hogwarts.

I like how Rowling makes it so you don't have to read the books in order to keep up with the series (although I don't know why you wouldn't read them in order). I am glad I stopped watching the movies until I have read the books. A must read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a fun continuation of the Harry Potter Series. The book closely mirrors the familiar formula of the first novel--it opens with Harry spending the summer with his horrible family, the Dursleys, when he is visited by Dobby, a house elf who has come to warn him about danger at Hogwarts. Harry returns to Hogwarts despite the warning, and soon people start being attacked around the castle. Harry, Ron and Hermoine must work to unravel the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets before the school is shut down.All of the successful elements of The Sorcerer's Stone are back in this second installement of the Harry Potter series. From quidditch to the opulence and magic of Hogwarts, Rowlings imagination once again takes the reader to the magical world of Harry Potter. I did think this novel was a bit darker than the first one, with students being attacked at random and some violence. But this is an enjoyable read for fans of fantasy and the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"These books are so addicting! I think I like this one better than the first one! I don't know, I'm sure I'll change my opinions throughout the series.There isn't anything I can say that will sway/change someone from their already formed opinion about the Harry Potter series. You either love it or you don't. I enjoy the child-like feel of the book, the humor, and the writing style. It's mature, but quickly and easily read. Also, while the book covers basically the course of a school year, you'll notice that when the characters are halfway through their year (Christmas break) the reader is halfway through the book. So it moves along quite quickly and doesn't dwell on one time period for long. The chapters are just the right length to read in 15-20 minutes. Also, I enjoy the names of the chapters and the small artwork that is at the beginning of each chapter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I've only been introduced to Harry Potter through the movies. Finally decided to break down and read the book. Even though, I'm well above the age group, the book was fantastic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book in the series continues in the same vein as the first, full of infinite invention of characters, creatures and magical circumstances. The stakes are still not as high as they are to become within the next two books. Voldemort's power is still limited and diluted through the memory of his former identity as prodigious wizard Tom Riddle. My patience wore thin a little with the invention of the character of Gilderoy Lockhart, a bumbling wannabe wizard. His hubris paired with incompetence became tiresome after the second scene and the fact that none of these brilliant wizards, even the genius Dumbledore, could see him for the fool that he was undercut their credibility. Even in a magical wizarding world there should be an internal logic and the continued presence of Lockhart was evidence to me that it was lacking. I saw no reason why, if Dumbledore had seen through him, he would continue to keep him employed at Hogwarts. That is not a major weakness and the book is still quite enjoyable. As I recall from my first reading several years ago, the plot thickens, the doom grows more ominous and the saga grows more interesting with the next volume."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved reading the entire Harry Potter series, my husband is a truck driver & doesn't have time to read. I bought this so he could listen to the book. It is well read & very enjoyable!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The thing is that the worst Potter is better than anything else anybody else is writing. I think what hurts this one is the dark story of the chamber of secrets clashes with her need to keep this one kiddy. Still characters and setting are so good it overcomes any shortcomings."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I greatly enjoyed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. This book wasn't incredible, but no one should have ever expected it to be. The story of Harry Potter builds as he grows more mature, therefore allowing greater depth in late books. The character development is what is exciting about the Harry Potter series, each character grows and changes from book to book. If you are not anti-mainstream and have not yet read a Harry Potter book, I strongly suggest you try reading the first two."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As you can read in my review of the first book I have read and re-read this series multiple times. To me, and several other family members, this was the most scariest book of the series. Why? Well read below.In this book Harry returns to Hogwarts for his second year, but like all the others it starts out at the Dursleys. Harry is being taunted by Dudley as being a loser with no friends, not true we find out later. We meet the incredible Dobby, the house elf and later free elf, who we are not sure if he is helping Harry or not until the very end. We learn more about Harry, and not all of it is good. And we learn more about Voldemort before he rose to power. Like the others in the end Harry, Ron and Hermione rise to the task and save the day.Now I know if you've made it this far you are asking yourself, so why did you think this is the scariest book of the series. Well here's why:1) The tone of the book is dark. I felt as I read it as if I was trapped in a big dark hole with the rain pouring down on me and nobody around to help me out. Now to me that's really dark and depressing.2) Harry speaks Parseltongue, which is the sign of an evil wizard, so it makes you wonder if he is a dark evil person. Or is he dark and evil because Voldemort laid an evil curse on him, or possesses him or... Well you get the idea. At this point in the series I just wasn't sure what kind of person Harry was and so it was easy to think the worst about him.3) The Chamber of Secrets...a dark evil place that was built by Slytherin,now doesn't that make you think a big old fat snake, which of course what the monster of Slytherin was.4) And this is the book we learn about the pure-bloods and their thoughts of racial purity (Shades of Hitler).5) And of course Draco and his love of all things evil.So all this left you wondering who was the heir of Slytherin who was trying to kill people.Again a magical addition to this series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"from Murphy's Library -- [....]When I think about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, I can't help but feel like this is the \\"slowest\\" book of all the seven. There's mystery, there's action in the end, but Potter and his friends weren't really aware of everything yet. After that, we see all characters growing up, and I think it happened because of the tension Chambers of Secrets has.Harry lives with his Uncle and Aunt one more summer, and things are obviously not looking good. They can't accept him--never will--and Harry misses his friends, as his owl is behind the bars and he can't send her to them. In this book he meets one of the most irritating characters of all the time: the domestic elf Dobby! The little creature is annoying as hell and can't shut his whining voice for nothing! Damn!So, after just two chapter of annoying characters, we get to fly to The Borrow--the Weasley's house--in a Ford Anglia magically modified! All seems to be going better, Harry meets his dream family, the little Ginny Weasley will start Hogwarts too... All is perfect, right?But Harry, being the truly Gryffindor he always is, starts his year in trouble. He and Ron lose the Hogwarts Express and have the brilliant idea of flying there. Oh, well, you can just imagine how good it ended.We get yet to meet another infuriating character, a professor called Gilderoy Lockhart that thinks a little too much of himself. But this is the least of Harry's problems. Something--or someone--is starting to make people be petrified (literally) and there's a rumor going on that it's him. I mean, really? Just because he can talk with snakes? It should be a little suspicious, but Harry could never pull a evil plan, just saying. The book goes from some chapters in this same pace, explaining a lot about Hagrid's past, that is curiously related to all this petrifying thing that is going on.I liked Chambers of Secrets, but I must admit it isn't my favorite book of the series. Still, just because it showed me the lovely little boy Tom Riddle--I'm kidding--, this book is five books rated. I can't give any other rating to Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book but I remember liking it pretty well. Lots of very interesting detail but be warned, there are some sections that might be very scary for the younger readers, especially the Chamber of Secrets section. I don't have any children but I think I'd be careful about letting the more nervous types of kids read this book by themselves. I didn't have problems with any of it and maybe most kids these days wouldn't but still, use caution."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a great book for children between 10 and 15. It is full of adventure and comedy. It was awesome when they drank the poly juice potion and turned into other people. It was cool when Harry saved Dobby from the Malfoys. Harry even saved his school from the Dark Lord Voldemort! It is just one adventure after another. I would highly recommend this book to any middle school readers and any Harry Potter fans!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought the mania surrounding the Harry Potter series was due to hype. After about 20 of my friends told me how great it was I decided to read the series. Now I love it! I finished the first three books in one week. I stayed up 'til all hours to finish it. I sound like an infomercial because now I'm convincing everyone I know to read it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I just finished reading the great book Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets.I would reccomend this book to many different ages of children. In the book, I liked how it had a cliffhanging effect. It was also very suprising and I almost died when I found out who opened the Chamber of Secrets. If you see this book lying around on one of the shelves at your local store, you should buy it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I started the second book, I was wondering wether or not J.K. Rowling was a one trick pony. Could she duplicate the same kind of magic that inticed me to the first Harry Pooter book? The answer, is yes.Not only does the book get more intelligent, but the situations thrown at the characters are even more intense. And the whole story has a very dark tone to it that made it a very creepy but fun read. The introduction of Dobby the house-elf is wonderful, and the reader ends up wanting to care about him, even though he may not seem on the up-and-up. The new teacher at the school is also fun to read. His &quot;Focus on me attitude&quot; makes it seem like I'm reading some sort of auto-biography of a Hollywood actor turned drama teacher.The darker theme of the book is a pleasant surprise, and further supports what I've been saying about how kids today can handle more dramatic pieces of work, while still wanting to support the heros of the story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I didn't think it was possible, but the second installment of Harry Potter's adventures is even better than the Philosopher's Stone (which is the real title). I have read all four books and I cannot wait for the fifth book to be released. Even though these books are geared towards little kids, adults alike will enjoy the tales of Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was somewhat better than the previous one even if the beginning, yet again, was not promissing. Harry's relatives are so abusive that I wonder if they will ever start beating the poor thing. You would expect such a behaviour from his horrible, snobish uncle. And while he never really gets seriously punnished by the people you would expect to do so, he always gets punnished in the school for things he didn't do - by those who are educated and renowned. It rings a bit unrealistic that the school would not research any of the occurances that he was blamed for. Honestly, Harry is not my favorite character. Not even close. I liked shy little Ginny, sad ghost Moaning Myrtle (one question though: how come that no teachers remembered or recognised her even if they went to school with her?) even that irritable, selfobsessed emptyhead Lockhart... My definite favorite is Ron (witty , humorous, cinical...).An interesting read for all who want to, at least briefly, run away from everyday problems and go back to their childhood. Nevertheless, don't read these books one after another. You might get overwhelmed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was a very interesting book.This book is great for kids of all ages.Harry Potter is an amazing wizard who had a very mysterious past.Harry is very famous for his scar on his forehead.Harry didn't know he was a wizard until he recieved a letter from &quot;Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardy&quot; inviting him to attend that school.His first year was last year on his 11th birthday.He found out little bits of his past and is still learning some.This year is his second year of &quot;Hogwarts&quot; and he is having a hard time because there are people and ghosts turning into stone.Everyone thinks its Harry because Harry is always there when they find a person that has turned to stone.After everybody stops thinking its Harry because one of his friends get turned to stone.Then his friends sister gets kid napped and he figures a way to defeat the monster who has kidnapped her.This book is exciting and very imaginatable.I really think everybody(even grown-ups)should read this magnificent book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is to start his new year at Hogwarts. After escaping from the Dursley's home (his Muggle relatives who treat him as though he is nothing at all and despise even the word magic), he stays with Ron Weasly, his best friend from Hogwarts, the remainder of the summer. He is then visited by a strange house-elf, Dobby, who warns Harry to not go back to Hogwarts and that many bad things were to happen, but he could not tell Harry what they were. Harry ignored his warnings and went to the train station to catch the Hogwarts Express. As he and Ron try to go through gate 3 and a quarter (a gate inbetween 3 and 4 that Muggles cannot see; one must lean on it to go through) it mysteriously seals. The Hogwart's Express pulls away and Ron and Harry have missed their chance to get to Hogwarts. Ron tells Harry to get into the car because his father has bewitched the car so that it is able to fly and stay invisible. They fly the car smoothly until the invisibility shield is broken and the car starts to die. They land straight into the Whomping Willow, a tree on campus that hits anything that comes near it. They are nearly smashed and Ron's wand breaks, and his family hardly has enough money to supply his sister with the things she needs for school. This is when strange things start to happen. Overall, this book was very good, very suspenseful, and just like the book before it: excellent. I definitely recommend this book to other's."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This, to my opinion is the best book of the Harry Potter series so far. All of Harry's problems get worse and worse. But the best part is the end, where everything I expected changed. In other words, the end of the book was really suprizing. To tell the truth, i'm now addicted to Harry Potter, as it was some kind of drugs. I can't stop reading the books! I think that it's a worthy experience, because(as I was one that hated to read and rather play on my computer) it makes people see that reading really isn't that bad. Of course, required reading for school isn't exactly what I would call fun, but Harry Potter changed the way I looked at thick books.Whatever your age is, I definitly suggest you to read the Harry Potter series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Altho I received two books in two different shipments, they both arrived promptly &amp; in very good shape."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second Harry Potter books is just as good as the first.

It may say that the Reading Level is ages 9-12, but I know for sure that many kids my age (14), and adults read these fabulous stories. You never quite know what is going to happen next in these series, and all the new magical things make it even more interesting! By far the best in the series so far is #3, Harry Potter &amp; The Prisoner of Azkaban, I just thought it had a really great plot, but #2 is my second favorite, I guess they just keep getting better and better as they go along! :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is just as good as the first in the series.

Many people are worried that it incourages witchcraft as a religion. It doesn't, why if they used the word magical person, would you be offended.

Certainly not."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is an excellent read for children of all ages. It is as good, if not better than the first.

I haven't read a lot of fantasy books in my time, but when I first picked up Harry Potter it reminded me a lot of THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ--the book, not the movie. L. Frank Baum was told NO, NO, NO while trying to get OZ published; thank goodness he persevered. J.K. was told she wouldn't make any money selling &quot;kids books.&quot; HA!

It is not half as good as the Deryni Chronicles by Katherine Kurtz! Is this just because it is new or something?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is everywhere lately, featured on the cover of Time (but not as man of the year yet), making the rounds of the TV talk shows (in the guise of the author J.K. Rowling), and holding the top three slots on the NY Times Bestseller List. He's making headlines as both the savior of literacy and the spawn of Satan. But what's lost in this all this noise is the fact that, when all is said and done, Harry Potter is boring. He's popular the way Big Macs are popular; it's easy to sell something bland and formulaic.The first clue to Harry Potter's franchise status is in the interesting title switch. Harry became all the rage in Britain under the title Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. Since no red-blooded American would be caught dead with a book about philosophy, the title had to change. So as Harry crossed the Atlantic, he dropped the Philosopher's Stone and picked up the Sorcerer's Stone; the occult sells better than contemplation.The second problem is the gross simplicity of the plot and characters. Magic works in these novels the same way Waylon Jennings' singing worked in the TV show The Dukes of Hazard. Whenever Bo, Luke and Daisy got into a pickle they couldn't get out of, the show would cut to Waylon Jennings singing yet another variation of &quot;Good Ol' Boys&quot; and the problem would be miraculously solved. Logic, character development, consistency even within the parameters of the story, were always ignored. Harry has the same luck. Whenever he's in a jam or things aren't going well, he manages to find some long lost spell or some arcane rule of quidditch to make everything all right.Character development is, of course, out of the question. Just like the rule requiring every Big Mac around the world to taste equally bland, every character in the Potter books is either good or bad from start to finish. Harry runs the emotional gamut from A to A and back again. The villains twirl their mustaches and cackle like an army of Snidely Whiplashes. The characters in the Potter books are all gross cartoon exaggerations; but as Homer Simpson has proven, even cartoon characters can have hearts. Too bad Harry hasn't learned that.The real trouble with Harry is that his oversized ego and the hype all around him is crowding everybody else out of the field of new children's books. He's like the George W. Bush of children's literature. If you want to read books that don't insult the intelligence of your inner child try Holes by Louis Sachar, or The View from Saturday by E. L. Konigsburg. Jules Feiffer has two amazing novels: A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears and The Man in the Ceiling. Or if you need something British try The Daydreamer by Ian McEwan. Like Harry, these books were all written in the last five or six years; and like Harry, they all have magic of one kind or another. But unlike Harry, these books are also fresh and intelligent. These books aren't products to be mass-produced for maximum sales; these books have hearts."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book.

So I had to finish the book to find out everything. And I liked it so much that I read it again. And again. And again. Then I made my mum read it, but she was too slow, so I had too keep taking it off her to read it. I never put it on my bookshelf for the first few weeks that I got it, because someone was always reading it. Then I thought I had better read something else.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the book you have been looking for. J.K.

Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I wasn't even going to read these books- I laughed at my friend when she told me she stayed up until 5 in the morning reading them.

While reading this book, I felt like I was experiencingadventures right along with Harry and his friends, Hermione and Ron. If you read the book about Harry's first year, &quot;The Sorceror's Stone&quot;, you know that Hogwarts is a school for wizards and worlocks. And you also know about Harry's famous background. In this book Harry meets the sorceror who killed his parents. If you want to know who it is and how he does it, you'll have to read the book for yourself. Along the way you'll meet lots of new characters like Moaning Myrtle, Dobby the house elf and Aragog the spider.

J.K. Rolling put out the second book in a seriesthat will reach seven... Harry Potter was never a normal boy.

Then Voldomoart (the dark wizard) came for Harry and he mistirically lost all of his powers. Harry his famous in the magical community.

J.K. Rowling uses great word choose. You should difinitly own this great book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The 2nd book is much better than the first. It has a betterstory, better characters, plot, and overal understanding. J.K. Rowlingadded so much detail that you could remember it forever. Ok, so maybe Harry is freaky looking, and Ron is also, and Hermoine is annoying, but that is the origanal part of the characters. Thay also have funny names (like Minerva ^_^). J.K. Rowling should have books when Harry Potter is in school his 7 years than when he is out. I am glad the book is printed in more than 1 language, so everyone can enjoy it. I may only be 9 years, but I still think Harry Potter books are Cool!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter series is the best series of books I have ever read.

I really like these books."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling's books are great fun and I would heartily recommend them to anyone. However, there is one grating flaw in the first two books I've read that troubles me and disrupts the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief.&quot; This is the author's sad lack of knowledge about snake anatomy. It wouldn't be that important, except that snakes play such an important part in the second book. First of all, snakes DO NOT have eyelids; secondly, they DO NOT have ears, and therefore can't hear. The former fact makes it impossible for the Brazilian snake to wink at Harry in Sorcerer's Stone; the second fact makes the entire notion of Harry's &quot;Parsletongue&quot; abilities completely ridiculous. Now, I realize that this is a fantasy book, and I'm all for believing in witches, werewolves, and the like, but when you take a real-life animal such as a snake and, without explanation, make terrible anatomical mistakes, then there's a problem. The author should be more careful with such matters in the future. However, let me say again that these books are a joy to read, and the characters are all great fun! Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"THIS BOOK WAS WONDERFUL! I loved this book because I love fantasy and J.K.

Not only has he greatly angeredthe Dursleys and annoyed the Ministry of Magic, now he's managed toget himself dragged up before Dumbledore on the first day of school! What's a poor wizard-in-training to do? As Harry works on this puzzler, things at Hogwarts take a turn for the bizarre. Harry hears strange voices coming from the walls when no one else does. Then, a sinister message from the heir of Slytherin appears and students start turning to stone. And everyone suspects Harry is somehow behind it all. Add to this Quidditch, a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, a &quot;Harry Potter Fan Club&quot; among the new first years, and the continuation of the Harry-Malfoy fued, and the second Harry Potter book is a wonderful story full of alll the hooks that will keep you reading, no matter how late it is or how early you need to get up the next morning!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This one is scarier than the first, but still, just as good and funny!

The first book was great, that now I have all the series at home. The Chamber of Secrets, has been so different from the first book, it builds more the excitment of the magical life over there...and it lets your immagination fly all over the place...Harry and Ron find themselves again in the most peculiar situations. Harry discovers new capabilities in him, that makes him way different than the others, and others get worried of what he could be,and what harm he may cause...Harry's curiosity can't leave him alone, he goes for everything he feels he should do, even if that would expel him from school...Malfoy tries more and more to put Harry in his place, but with no luck, and he starts seeing the superiority that Harry carries, if he does not not confess it until now...The Chamber of secrets and the encounter that finally happens in it, solves another mystery that the school was waiting for, for more than 50 years...Read the book, but make sure you read no.1 first...ENJOY"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"With the rising fanaticism of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series comes many complaints, even bashings of these lovable books. Some believe the books to be sacrilegious because they possess subjects of wizardry and Dark Magic. Others knock the series because they feel the books hold excessive grotesqueness and violence. Since these fears lead to the implication that the series will corrupt children, people begin to advocate the banishing of the books. Firstly, people need to realize these books are fiction and do not prove any damage to children. Secondly, people fail to see the valuable lessons the series can instill in children. In the second book of the series Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is faced with a dilemma that is apparent in many adolescent lives-how does he deal when his peers turn against him? Throughout the book, people constantly point to Harry for the attacks at Hogwarts; they persecute him, condemning his popularity and his talents, both of which are factors that define his character. Harry learns not to depend on others' thoughts and glorifies his traits so that he will subsist through accusations, in the end finding triumph from the vices of Lord Voldemort. Harry holds unique qualities and traits that differentiate him from his peers. Physically, he is like any other child; the only exception is the lightening-shaped scar on his forehead that stands as the emblem of his self-&quot;the boy who lived&quot; (Rowling The Sorcerer's Stone 17). This scar maintains Harry's reputation and symbolizes his distinctive traits. The scar popularizes Harry in the wizard world, denoting him as the hero who defeated Voldemort. Unfortunately, when the attacks begin Harry coincidently finds himself at every crime scene. This along with the discovery of a certain peculiarity causes Harry's fame to backfire; his peers begin to doubt him and distort his attributes to be destructive rather than stout. In The Chamber of Secrets Harry and the rest of Hogwarts learn that he is a Parselmouth, one who can communicate with snakes, a trait inhabited by two other people--Salazar Slytherin and his heir, the only one who can open the Chamber of Secrets. Both are infamous for their engagements in the Dark Arts. Harry's ability to speak Parseltongue links him to these terrible beings, thus opening the gateway for accusations and assumptions of who Harry Potter really is. &quot;No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who...Only a really powerful Dark wizard could have survived a curse like that...I wonder what other powers Potter's been hiding?&quot; (Rowling The Chamber of Secrets 199). Many of Harry's peers blame him for the attacks, assuming he is Salazar Slytherin's heir; as the accusations increase, Harry begins to doubt himself and his self-worth. &quot;Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin?...But I'm in Gryffindor...The Sorting Hat wouldn't have put me here if I had Slytherin blood...Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat wanted to put you in Slytherin, don't you remember?&quot; (Rowling The Chamber of Secrets 197). These hasty allegations place unhealthy thoughts in Harry's mind; he questions his choices, talents, and history, allowing himself to believe these rash rumors. Harry's choices, talents, and history make him who he is; for him to doubt himself deters him from achieving his individuality. After the foe attacks his best friend Hermione, Harry shuts away other's opinions, and concentrates on his own talents, ultimately discovering the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets and, for a third time, escaping the evils of Voldemort. Harry is triumphant in the end because he refuses to engage himself in other's thoughts. To be happy, Harry must be content with the factors that make him who he is-his qualities, his talents, and his choices. This is one of the priceless lessons that is embedded in the Harry Potter series. In his article, &quot;Long Live Harry Potter,&quot; Christopher Barili defends the Harry Potter books, stating, &quot;...Rowling has created a literary character, a person who, for millions of kids around the world, lives and breathes. They identify with him and with his problems...&quot; (2). The Harry Potter series should not even be considered for banishment; there is no evidence that they corrupt children. The series holds true to the fact that children do identify with Harry, perceiving him as if he were real. Harry learns many valuable lessons as he completes his years at Hogwarts. He grows to become his own person, gaining the confidence to pride himself. As he grows, the children stay with him through every adventure.Sources:Barili, Christopher. &quot;Long Live Harry Potter.&quot; Themestream. 8 August 2000.Rowling, J.K.

Rowling! =8)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love the humor, imagination, hope and spirit in all of Harry's adventures! I found myself totally immersed with each turn of the page-Rowling is a very creative and talented writer. This book is alittle more intense than the first but I enjoyed the twisting plot up to the ending. One of the aspects I like most about the Potter books is how refreshening it is to read about Harry's genuine good spirit towards others he comes into contact with.I am reminded of another book when reading the Potter books called &quot;Working On Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. To me the Kanes' book is a magical guide in discovering myself and has enabled me to create a lasting wonderful and fun adventure called &quot;my life.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling does it again. A children's book for all ages. Harry once again is faced with his nemince Voldermort, and must save himself and his friends from his evil. All the great characters from the first novel are back.What I noticed most with this book is how clever Rowling is. The story is filled with word puns, and the names are interesting linguisticaly.On the whole this is another winner for Rowling, I think the first novel is better. The first seemed more exciting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling had an awesome way of putting together an extremely strong plot to her books. I've read the first three and am anxiously awaiting the 4th one. If you loved stories like the Chronicles of narnia you'll be facinated with Harry Potter. No matter how old you are these books will be entertaining and you will not regret reading them."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It was one of the best books in the series. I am sure other people will agree with me. I am still awating book 4. All of the books are GREAT!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"That is what the author said after finishing the first Harry Potter book. I must agree with one of the reviewers who was a little ticked about the many similarities between the first book and The Chamber of Secrets. And yes, there are some nagging sterotypes (the one that bothers me the most is the constant comparision of Dudley to a pig)that I could do without. Although, this all was a little annoying, there were some differences that kept the book interesting. I really enjoy the Harry Potter series so far, and fully intend to continue on to the third book. Let's face it, this is a children's novel! It's allowed to have a simplistic cast of characters that develope slowly as the author writes more books. Look at all of the other series of children's novels out there. They all pretty much have a formula, just like sitcoms tend to have. Examples: The Babysitter's Club(one I read as a pre-teen), The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew...the list goes on. But, honestly, I find that Harry Potter is a cut above the others in many respects. So why are people so shocked at the similarities in Harry Potter plots? Easy, because not everyone is 8 to 12. And I'm sorry to say, if you're not 8 to 12, sometimes there are things you just don't understand anymore. Like getting into a series of books that doesn't necessarily scream Pulitzer Prize. I'm 19, and am thrilled that a new series of children's books has landed in the bookstores. It's been too long since a decent and original idea hit this area of literature. What kid doesn't imagine, late at night in their bed, that they could be part of a magical and mystical world, where they would be the most talked about and gifted person in that radically different place? I'm sorry to say I can't give Chamber of Secrets 5 stars, but I definately feel that it is still a good children's book, and worth the majority of its praise."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of thebest books I've ever read. I gave the book five stars because it wasreally exciting and it kept me interested through the whole story. I think J.K. Rowling is a terrific author. Harry Potter is a young wizard who goes to a school named Hogwarts. He'd been home on summer vacation with his Muggle (non-magic) relatives the Dursley's and they had mistreated him so much he couldn't wait for school to start. While he was there, Harry got a warning from a strange elf who told him that he shouldn't go back to Hogwart's because disaster would strike, but Harry was determined to return to school. The Dursleys had locked Harry in his room so his best wizard friend Ron, helped him escape in a flying car! They even ended up flying the car back to school. At Hogwart's they met up with their other best friend, Hermoine Granger. Soon though, weird things started happening, students start getting turned to stone, strange messages appear on the walls and mysterious rumors about a Chamber of Secrets start flying all around school. What's behind all this? You'll have to read this book to find out and you won't be sorry that you did.!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book tells the story of the one and only,lightning skard Harry Potter.This magical story tells of a chamber of secrets being opened.But by who? The answer may come as a shock! Especially if you read the first book.I would give it 9,0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 if I could.

I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was totally blown away by this addition of the Harry Potter novels. I still hope there are going to be 70, not seven! The plot was thrilling, and the characters all well devloped. I fell in love with little Ginny Weasley at first glance. I know every one of any age will love these books. A definate must read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Great book-but it gave me nightmares for 3 days, now I can't get the third book...From HANNAHne.E A 100 ON A SCALE OF ONE TO ONE-HUNDRED AND I WOULD RATE HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS A 99!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As if it were possible, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series has gotten better. I was lucky enough to be on vacation in Stratford this week and I found the third one, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in a small bookstore. I may be only in high school, but I can tell great literature when I see it. My father heard about the books and persuaded me to read Sorcerer's Stone. I couldn't believe how fast I read it. I couldn't put it down! I would recommend this book even to older adults. Anyone who has a sense of adventure could find themselves begging for more of the stories of Harry Potter."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is sinsational!!! He is an average kid, a good friend, and an average student. There is just one difference between him and you and me. He is a wizard. He can fly on a bloomstick and do spells! While going to school at Hogwarts he discovers a hidden chamber. Will he be able to save the day? Read and find out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think this book is one of the best children's book I've ever read. The imagination and creativity behind the story is remarkable! I'm thirty-six, and I know this is the best book I've ever read!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; in quick succession, after receiving the first one as a gift. They are so well written, both in word and story. And the recent article in Newsweek is right -- Rowling doesn't condescend to her audience (regardless of age) for a second. These books are simply, deliciously fun. You know, the self-indulgent kind of fun that makes you want to stay up late and read under the covers with a flashlight. What a delightful departure from the usual pain-and-complain fare of contemporary literature!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It was brilliant! I couldn't put it down. I've read it many times and I think it's the best! The complex plot has the same beauty as its predescessor, the twists and turns that all fall into place at the end. The Dursleys are as obnoxious as ever, this time including their latest clients, the Masons. Dobby is the pessimist of the story, while Harry, the hero, solves the mystery, in spite of boastful teachers and supercilious classmates. Neurotic Ron and &quot;teacher's pet&quot; Hermione stand by Harry all the way until they eventually find discover the deadly truth. That perfect balance between horror and humour, emotions and action is true Rowling magic."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"THIS IS A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE ON SCHOOL REQUIRED READING LISTS. IT MAKES YOU USE YOUR IMAGINATION AND TAKES YOU TO A WONDERFUL, MYSTERIOUS WORLD. IT IS A GREAT B00K ESPECIALLY FOR BOYS."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"JK has really outdone herself this time. It has tons of plot twists and jokes just like the first one. I love the great surprise at the end. This is a great book!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book and the first Harry Potter book were the best books I've ever read. They were very well written with the best story ever!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Yet another fantastic new book by J.K Rowling. Twists and turns galore catapult this book to the same heights as C.S.Lewis and Roald Dahl. I only have one thing to say and that is...Watch your back Mrs Norris...S.E.Lewis-Newton"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book one of the best books I've ever read. At first J.K. Rowling brings you on a slow but informitable ride trough Harry Potter's life but later on pulls you trough a spine tingeling roller coaster with Harry and his Pals' close calls, mysterys and,near death experinces. And somehow there is humor brought into this magnificent book. I personally recomed this masterpiece to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was the bested book i have ever read in my entire life and i have read alot of books in my 7 years of life on this earth.

I'm 13, and loved the first book, so I absolutely HAD to read the next. It is so good I finished it in a day. I wish I could have savored it a little longer. I just ordered the third book from London."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a 11 year-old that has been enthralled with the Harry Potter books ever since i recived the first one in Christmas of 98. I got the next two from my grandmother, who lives in the same city as the author. These books have the biggest twists and turns of any titles I have ever read. There is a little bit of magic for everyone in Harry's adventures, something that few authors have ever acomplished in they're whole careers, much less they're first three tries!! All I can say is that Mrs. Rowling very much deserves to be Hogwarts's Headmaster after Dumbledore retires, cause THESE BOOKS ROCK!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The cover of the book was what caught my attention first. As you open the book and start to read you become addicted to it. Harry is a wonderful character and his adventures are awesome. This is a book I will want my children to read (which should be in about ten years). I have already preordered the new one and am counting the days until it gets here. I hope the author has many more books in her imagination and hurries to give us readers what we want. MORE HARRY BOOKS."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I find Rowling's writing style fun and entertaining.

It's Harry Potter back again and this time in an adventure where he comes face to face with none other than the young Voldemort.

This book is a great addition to Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone, and you will dive into the book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I love all of the Harry Potter books - have read my son's a couple of times and thought it would be good to have my own...The Chamber of Secrects brings new challenges for Harry...in the first book he relied a lot on the help of Hermoine and Ron - in this one..he has to rely on himself. The bond between Harry and Dumbledore is established in this book. It's a great book and a great series - it gets my 10 year old reading books with hundreds of pages!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved the first and the sixth audiobooks in the Harry Potter series so much that I ended up buying them all within about a month's time. Why? Jim Dale continues to deliver in these wonderful, witty and well-narrated one mans show with a great grasp of the characters, giving each one a voice all his or her own. He obviously has spent his time getting inside the characters' minds, expressing voices that are believable and enjoyable. Mr. Dale does a great job of bringing this popular series to life. You might find yourself saying that you will only listen to one or two chapters at a time and the next thing you know, you're through four CDS! That's how I ended up with all six audiobooks in less than a month!It is a genuine pleasure to listen to him do what is a one man show. I feel his best character voices include Hagrid, Professor McGonagall, Ron Weasley and his mother, as well as the Dursleys. His take on Gilderoy Lockhart was awesome and hilarious! In many ways, he sounded like Kenneth Branaugh in the movie role. I feel he is still developing Harry's voice and it differed a little in this installment, showing us a Harry growing up and maturing. He again pronounces Voldemort's name \\"Voldemore\\"; I think this must be the way the British might pronounce the dark lord's name but he adds the \\"T\\" sound, beginning in either the fifth or sixth books, perhaps to appease American readers?Audiobooks are great because you can take them anywhere or do things you couldn't do with a regular book such as chores, go to the gym or for a walk or run, driving for fun or to and from work, going for a walk, spending time with the family listening together and so on. Highly recommended with Awesome packaging and great artwork from the series! I know once I finish all six of these, I'll want to listen to them again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Satisfying, I must say. Indeed, I liked it better than the first, and I liked the first a lot. Spellbinding, witty, and occasionally realistic.What the problem was with this book was the stereotypical \\"hero might actually be bad\\" thing. And then the \\"oh, I'm sorry I accused you\\" thing. However, this shows some foreshadowing for the next few books. That was the flip-side of the stereotype. Well done.All in all, worth the time. Want that next book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Everyone that I have spoken to has said that HP and the CoS was their least favorite book in the Harry Potter series. This is for a variety of reasons. However it all boils down to the fact that the readers HATED the snakes, didn't like how poorly the Chamber was described, found Lockhart annoying, and the giant spiders were just to creepy.The story, like all of the HP stories, involves Harry going to Hogwarts, casting spells, flying his broom, and fighting Voldemort. In this book Harry learns he can speak snake and how to duel.This is a must read for a Harry Potter fan, but I find it the hardest to read of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This one is better than the first. This is where it starts to get more intense and darker, but still has a kiddie feel. Remember this, IT IS NOT A KID'S BOOK, especially book 3 forward. HP books are great because of the character development and the progressive storyline and progressive ominous tone."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Another year at Hogwwars for Harry Potter.The author J.K. Rowling kept letting the secrets keep unravelling this year.As Harry Potter finally discovers the Chamber of Secrets,he learns that he is a true Gryffinder.This is a book your whole family will love!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My only beef with this product is that they haven't made all of them in the gold edition. Other than that the book is of good quality and everyone knows the content is as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I already have the paper bag book and loved it. I just needed to purchase the hard cover book, to add to my collection."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter has captured the imagination of children and adult alike using fresh ideas when stories were running dry. She injected the kind of originality missing for so long in children's fantasy novels. She created a whole new world so complete and detailed that you suspend you disbelief and get immersed immediately."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't know about other people who've read all seven books but the series is awesome and has alot of adventures between Harry Potter, Ron Weasly, and Hermione Granger. they been through alot in the series and that's what makes them a daring team. JK Rowling is a genius with her writing style and imagenation. In the seventh book she killed alot of important people off which i'm not going to name just incase no one read it yet. these books will capture the fun while your reading it. In the first book Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone JK Rowling introduced Harry in a deep way that nobody could ever imagined. Then she went on with her fantasy stories about the flying car, the flying broom sticks, and exspecially the Hogwarts train which Hermione first met Harry Potter and Ron Weasly. which most of you agree I hope. I also like how JK Rowling described the main characters like Hagrid, the rest of the Professors, exspecially Voldermont who really had a dark side to him that no one imagined he had until the seventh book. so if you haven't read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Great book, but did anyone notice that they left there trunks in the trunk of the car yet had them when they got to school...?"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There is no sophomore slump in the J.K. Rowling household or in Harry Potter's universe, as Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets somehow takes the magic and excitement of the first book to even higher levels of enjoyment. The characterization of the main characters is greatly enriched, while new, important characters come on the scene in grand style. After getting another bitter taste of Harry's life with the Dursleys, watching him become a prisoner in every sense of the word in the aftermath of the strange half-elf Dobby's noble yet highly frustrating attempts to protect him, we get a high treat indeed in being allowed a few days' stay in the home of the Weasleys. I must admit that I rather dote on young Ginny Weasley, whose obvious crush on Harry Potter works a magic (one which even we Muggles know and understand) all its own upon her. I can appreciate Gilderoy Lockhart's place in this novel, but the humor he sometimes provides with his egomaniacal self-love is as pathetic and frustrating to me as it is to Ron and Harry; I can't for the life of me see what Hermione's fascination with the man is, particularly after sitting through a few of his Defenses Against the Dark Arts classes. Then there is Lucius Malfoy, another sinister character for us to love to hate; compared to his father, young Draco Malfoy is a choir boy.Some of the early action, particularly the whole flying car business, probably appeals to young readers more than it does to me, but things get very interesting very quickly as soon as the boys arrive at Hogwarts. There is sinister business at the school during Harry's second year, a crisis that leaves several students literally petrified, threatens the positions of even Hagrid and Dumbledore, and puts the very future of Hogwarts in great jeopardy. It all leads up to an ending that seems to stretch the limits of credulity in a couple of places yet succeeds much more impressively than the denouement of the first novel. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets takes everything I loved about the first book, multiplies it several times, expands the entire world in which Harry lives, throws in several juicy new sub-plots and immensely interesting new characters, and establishes Harry Potter as a bona fide phenomenon with the unlimited potential to thrill young and old readers alike for years and years to come."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This story seems to be largely a repeat of the first book. Not enough new information is revealed about the world of HP (although the flying car is just cool). Also, things seems to happen a little too conveniently (like how NO ONE is killed by the Basilisk, all being next to light refracting/reflecting devices of some sort) If you like HP, read it; but don't expect the freshness of the first book. I'm personally more interested in the later books, as they were much more engaging to the reader."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"My wife and I have enjoyed listening to the whole Potter series on CD. While the first one worked well, in book two, the narator Jim Dale really comes into his own. With his destinctive voices, dramatic florish and excellent sense of comic timing he brings the book to life for the listener. Though I found the books a little dry as a read, they make a wonderful performance and I would urge anyone who enjoys books on CD to add this and the rest of the series to their collections."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The transition from one book to the other is a smooth one. Its like reading one continuous adventure. It is so exciting to watch Harry, Ron and Hermione grow up at Hogwarts!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second, and in my opinion best, novel in the fantasy/fiction series of Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. As you all probably know Harry Potter is a young boy with an extraordinary life, in the muggle world at least. Harry is a wizard, unlike his aunt and uncle with whom he lives. Harry has inherited his wizarding skills from his late parents who died at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. Harry grew up knowing very little about his parents or his magical past and how he had been named, \\"the downfall of Lord Voldemort.\\" During the first book Harry finds out he is a wizard, and is faced with battling the remains of Lord Voldemort.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets starts with Harry receiving a visit from a house elf warning him against going back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry ignores the warnings and after a few minor obstacles, he finds himself back at Hogwarts for yet another year.The school year seems to be going great, with the addition of a new defense against the dark arts teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. However, messages have started to appear written on the walls, walls in which Harry is hearing voices from. It seems that yet again the chamber of secrets has been opened, and by the heir of Slytherin. Even though Harry is a Gryffindor, students, and some teachers, suspect he is the culprit. If the messages on the walls aren't threatening enough the fact that students are being petrified surely is.Throughout all of the Harry Potter Books J.K. Rowling has created this wonderful fantasy world of wizardry, with the readers being able to really relate to the characters, and possibly learn from their struggles and triumphs. Not only does Rowling create such a positive and inspiring group of characters, but she does so in a way unlike many authors, that I can not even try to explain.So it seems Rowling has made Harry's second year at Hogwarts yet again difficult for him. From a deathday party, to a living diary, and a giant talking spider, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good read. Whether Harry is the true heir to Slytherin or not, I'm not going to say, so I recommend you go out and read it this book to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't suggest this book to extremly young readers(4-6) because even though only 1 person dies, there is alot of people who get petrified and that means it might effect dreams.this book keeps you reading and trying to piece together the puzzle until the very end. this book has alot of suspense and action unlike the first book having the same amount of action but less suspence"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this great young adult book, Harry Potter is whisked away from his evil muggle relatives and is flown back to Rons by his dad's flying car. The ideal audience for the book is all ages. Children will love the magical spells, the flying cars, and of course the flying cars. The characterization in the book is excellent. Harry is just a small boy who is feared by his muggle relatives and wants to leave the bedroom where he is locked in. Draco Malfoy is represented well as the ideal bully in any story and is hated by most readers for putting Harry in danger. The plot is well written because everyone wants to keep on reading to see why only Harry happens to hear the strange voice. They also want to know who is actually turning people into stone since everyone is a suspect. Emotions were stirred when Professor Snide first tried to get Harry expelled on the first day of school for flying a car to school. Snide is out to get Harry whenever there is trouble and the finger is usually pointed at Harry when there is trouble. It's hard to watch Harry get abused verbally like he did when he was living with his muggle relatives. It was also really humorous to see his cousin so intimidated by his magic ways even though he couldn't use any of his powers. My overall impression of the book was that it was very intriguing and very well written. It was hard for me to put the book down whenever I got to the end of the chapter. It was easy reading and I think all ages could read any of these books. I'm excited to see the movie that just came out to see how closely it relates to the first book. I recommend this book to any of those who are remotely interested."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book (&amp; its series) is clearly written primarily for young minds to enthrall &amp; entertain, combined with the positive influence of getting them into the habit of reading (instead of zombie-watching).This book is written closely similar to its predecessor with the same dreadful/pitiful openning &amp; ending (back to the Dudleys we will go). Dumbledore is always away when the &quot;big&quot; thing happens leaving Harry to deal with it by himself. Of course, we know he comes back in time to rescue Harry. There is also always a suspicious character who may not necessarily be the antagonist. &amp; most importantly, the lesson we all love ... good triumphs over evil.I agree though that it is highly entertaining. It has a touch of suspense (Oh, what's going to Harry next?), mystery (Who is doing all those nasty things?) &amp; humor (like what happened to Hermoine in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom). It is also filled with good stuff for the young (&amp; old) minds about loyalty, bravery, friendship, pure-heartedness &amp; yes, the importance of CHOICE! For it is this very &quot;choice&quot; that defines the core of a person --whether he be a muggle or a wizard."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"HI I PURCHASED THIS PARTICULAR BOOK FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD NEPHEW , BEFORE GIVING THE BOOK TO HIM I READ A FEW CHAPTERS AND FOUND MY SELF ENGROUSSED IN THIS YOUNGMANS ADVENTURES , THERE WAS NOTHING DIABOLICAL ABOUT HARRY OR HIS FRIENDS , I ATTEND TO PURCHASE THE OTHER BOOKS IN THE SERIES AND GIVE THEM TO HIM AS WELL."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"To an adult, J.K ROWLING's book represents cloying nostalgia for the days of childhood when I was hooked on Enchanted Forest by Enid Blyton. But what sets Harry Potter apart from many children's books is the sprawling imagination and the tight pacing which left me impressed.In the CHAMBER OF SECRETS, Harry Potter returns to the Hogswart School of Wizardry after a gruelling stay with the Dudley and what a hoot - Ron's wand broken repaired with Spellotape, the duelling club started by the unabashed Professor Lockhart, polyjuice potion and Parseltongue. The imagery created by ROWLING is powerful and enchants with a magical realm - like that of lofty clouds and vertiginous cliffs. The plot is buoyant and full of unexpected twists and turns - when many in the domitory are attacked surreptitiously by an unknown enemy, Harry Potter sets out to unravel the secret behind the Chamber of secrets. His nemesis, Lord Valdemort is threatening to explode in his life again....Even the side characters are side-splitting and memorable. Dobby the neurotic elf, Draco Malfroy the spoilt brat and most of all who could ever forget the Headmaster Dumbledore? JK Rowling tells a moral tale with a polished touch without preaching simple universal truth. &quot;It is the choices which make up what you are, not your abilities.&quot; The book defies categorization - it is immediately one bound of adventures, who-dun-it mystery and certainly one out of fantasy.Throw away all your logic with this one, because THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS is irresistibly original, bewitching and spellbinding. The disarming charm made me stayed up reading all night.It makes you see things .... in the eyes of a child again."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a very good Harry Potter book. I think the last chapters are the best parts of the story. I like when they drink the bottles of stuff. That's cool. I think they should at least make about six books, or make even more because this is a great series so far, especially Book #2 and Book #3. Book #1 is good, but personally I like the other ones better, including the one that I am reviewing. I especially like the 2nd to last chapter. When they try and get the boy, (who is Harry). Someone tells the bird to get Harry, but that idea doesn't work. Dobby's Reward is the last chapter. I would like to give part of the story, but I don't want to give the parts away. I would like to get the 4th book when it comes out on July 8. It is supposed to have a very lot of pages. I am looking forward to reading it.

END"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I thought that this book was very intresting because there were many exciting points and there was lots of action.This book is really good and if you like Harry Potter books i would recommend this book to you!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is wonderful when the second book in a series is even better than the first. Such is the case with \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\" Rowling's skill as an author is improved over the first book, and her story is much more consistent and generally easier to follow. Rowling also manages to keep track of the various elements left in suspense as the novel progresses to be sure she ties all the loose ends up before the story ends.The story begins at the Dursley's Privet Drive house, where Harry's muggle guardians live. The story is hardly begun when we meet Dobby, a house elf. Dobby tries hard to convince Harry to stay away from Hogwart's. Dobby tells Harry that he will die if he returns to Hogwart's. Harry's only enjoyment in life was his first year at Hogwart's and there is little doubt he will return for his second year. Soon Harry's best friend Ron Weasley shows up to rescue Harry, and it seems Harry is close to returning to school. Prior to returning to school, Harry sees strange things in Knock-Turn Alley, a black magic area associated with Diagon Alley, and he and Ron miss the Hogwart's Express. Naturally missing the train is something that will not stop Harry and Ron from returning to school, which is a story in itself.Once back in school it seems it takes only a little while for strange things to begin to happen. Students turn up frozen. Even Mrs. Norris, Filch's cat, has turned up frozen. Further, Harry keeps hearing voices in the walls speaking of killing and death. Harry's proximity to many of these incidents soon leads many of the students to believe that Harry is responsible.Introduced in this story is a new character, Gilderoy Lockhart, who must be the essence of every obnoxious, stuck-up, self-centered person that Rowling has ever met. While he talks a big story, he is all talk and less than zero action, as he makes nearly every situation worse. Lockhart is so over-the-top that he was barely tolerable. However, he does play an interesting role at the end of the story, and I somewhat enjoyed what happened to him.We also learn something of Voldemort and Hagrid's history, which is as interesting as you would think. We also meet Aragog, a somewhat unique creature in the pantheon of creatures Hagrid has befriended. There is still the creature that we have yet to see.This story is much easier to read compared to the first Harry Potter, as readers are now familiar with Rowling's built-from-scratch fantasy. Further, while she has made the story significantly more complex than the first novel by introducing the Chamber of Secrets and the histories of various characters, the clarity of her writing keep the reader on track throughout the story. Rowling even manages to include a number of bizarre incidents, assuming that anything more than witches and wizards would be bizarre. Imagine, for example, asking a ghost how they died.Rowling keeps her fantasy fresh in this second story with much promise for the following novels. For those who can read this story as a fantasy, they will find the story creative and interesting. I recommend this book for everyone from age 8 to adult, and even some younger children may be able to handle the story."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am really impressed with this series. Usually i read \\"Grown up\\" fantasy books like Jordan, goodkind and GRR Martin - but Harry Potter has certainly been an appriciated diversion. Its been so long sine i was a child and believed in magic but J.K. Rowlings brings me back to that more innocent time. I am not going to review the plot - there are over 3000 reviews for that - I just wanted to Thank Mrs. Rowlings for doing something that should have been done a long time ago. It may sound kind of strange - but i almost feel like i have attended hogwarts. As i read these books i was in a new city away from my friends and going to law school. I know its not quite the same... but anyone who has ever studued law knows that there is a lot of strange words [usually latin]and scary proffesors galore. I swear my administrative law professor is the spitting image of professor umbridge, and my contracts prof is Snape re-incarnated... Maybe its just hopw great of storytelelr Rowlings is that makes me believe...Thankfully, soon i will be done law school, but sadly, someday, this series will come to an end.I highly suggest reading it - the first book is almost a chilrens book, but they grow darker as time goes on. [not unlike real life]Anyone who reads fantasy and does not read these books is a disgrace to the genre. I place this series with Tolkien, Dragonlance, and the Song of Ice and Fire.Thanks Mrs. Rowlings! And Thanks Harry!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Nothing was wrong with this book in particular. It just was my least favorite. The whole story with Ginny was great but I just found myself being frustrated with Harry the whole book for not tellin gpeople what was going on. I know that that is the point and that there were reasons, but I was frustrated none the less. However I still think this book is worthy of 5 stars. I loved getting to know Colin and Ginny. And Rowlings kept you guessing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm reading a cool book named Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets by J.K Rowling. The main character is Harry Potter. Harry doesn't know he is a wizard because an evil wizard named Voldemort killed Harry's wizard parents. They left Harry with his bad aunt, uncle, and cousin. Harry finds out he is a wizard when a big guy named Hagrid comes to a light house where Harry his uncle, aunt and cousin are living. Harry escapes by getting help from his friend Ron Weasly and his flying car. He escapes to Hogwarts. Harry gets in trouble because the kids in Hogwarts think he is the real heir of Slytherin.They think Harry is going to kill all muggle-born people. I think this book is interesting because it includes different stuff than in the movie .So if you like wizard books - here are the best ones you can find: Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azcaban, and many more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Following the enormous success of the book \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" (also known as \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\") in 1997, author J. K. Rowling set about writing its sequel. Published in 1999, \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" was even more successful than the first. It focuses on Harry Potter returning for his second year at the famous Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but the story is much darker than the first book. Like the first book, the story begins with Harry living with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia and cousin Dudley (the Dursleys). Harry is distressed because he hasn't heard from his dear friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during the summer break. One night, when the Dursleys are preparing to entertain for Uncle Vernon's boss, Harry is instructed to remain in his room and be completely quiet. However, an annoying elf by the name of Dobby magically appears in Harry's room to warn him not to go to Hogwarts this year. Harry refuses to heed to the warning, so Dobby proceeds to make trouble for Harry and the Dursleys who (of course) blame Harry and refuse to let him return to Hogwarts. Late one night as Harry gazes out of the bars that his Uncle Vernon has installed on his bedroom window, he sees car lights approaching in the sky. A flying car pulls up along side the window and Harry hears the all-too-familiar voice of Ron Weasley. Ron and his twin brothers Fred & George have borrowed their father's flying car to rescue Harry. Hurriedly, Harry escapes with them so that he can get away from the Dursleys. However, Dobby causes more trouble for Harry both in getting to Hogwarts and at Hogwarts itself. Then, people begin to become petrified at Hogwarts with eerie warnings written on the walls in blood saying that the heir of Slytherin has returned to open the chamber of secrets. Can Harry find out who is behind the petrifactions? What is the meaning of the spiders? Is Hagrid involved? Can Harry tolerate the vain babblings of the narcisstic Gilderoy Lockhart? Does Harry really belong in Gryffindore? Will Hogwarts have to be closed? You'll have to read this fantastic book to find out!In comparing the book with the film version of \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\", the book contains a lot more details than is possible to contain within a 2-hour film, and the film also changes some of the details. Several examples include the following:1. Professor McGonagall (played by Maggie Smith in the film) gives some details about the chamber of secrets instead of the History of Magic teacher, the ghostly Professor Binns.2. Hermione (played by Emma Watson in the film) gets some dialog in the film that was said originally by Ron Weasley in the book.3. Details of Gilderoy Lockhart's behavior is only partially displayed in the film as compared to the book.4. The party given by Nearly Headless Nick is not included in the film at all.Overall, I rate J. K. Rowling's 341-page book \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars. It's a wonderful read for both children and adults alike and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hello my name is Matt and I think this book was awesome. Harry potter was one of the best books I have ever read. Harry potter is a type of book that can be enjoyed and loved by all ages. The best part of the book is when the turn themselves into those two fat kids and seek around. Harry potter is the type of book that takes even the most serious adult into a wonder world and sends you imagination screaming for joy.I gave this book 5 stars because as I read this book it was so well written that I would get angry when harry did or I would get happy or scared when harry did. This book was an emotional roller coaster and that's the type of book I like. If I could be Harry potter for one day, I would want to be Harry during this book. This book was so much more exciting then the others.This book was by far the best book I have ever read. As I said I give this book 5 starts because it is so good and just the fact that it is harry potter earned it three stars without me reading it. This book is perfect for every age, I am 18 and it certainly is my favorite."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It begins with a house elf, Doby, coming to Harry's relatives house, warning him that there are many dangers at Hogwarts this year.

Treated shamefully by them, he had known nothing about his true abilities, or about how his parents really died, until visited by a giant of a man called Hagrid. Harry, the son of a Wizard and a Witch, was a hugely talented, very famous wizard himself - and Hagrid was to take him to Hogwarts. Hogwarts is a prestigious school for training young witches and wizards, and Harry's first year there was covered in \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\". This book, \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\", covers Harry's second year there.The book features most of the characters who turned up in the previous book - Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger also return to Hogwarts and remain Harry's best friends. Draco Malfoy, Harry's arch-nemesis, also returns. Malfoy's distaste for Wizards and Witches with muggle parents seems to have increased over the holidays, and he is even less likeable in this book than in the last. His father Lucius, who sits on the school's Board of Governors, also makes his first appearance. It's easy to see where Draco picked up all his less than endearing qualities, and that Lucius has some rather 'dark' secrets of his own.Naturally, there are some new characters. The new first years at the school include Ron's younger sister, Ginny - who appears to have something of a crush on Harry. While a number of ghosts appeared in \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", Moaning Myrtle, who haunts one of the school's toilets, makes her debut in this book. There's also been one change to the teaching staff over the holidays - Professor Gilderoy Lockhart has been appointed the new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher. Harry meets him for the first time in Diagon Alley, and takes an instant dislike to him. Although very famous and popular with witches everywhere, he has a huge ego, plainly loves being famous and is constantly bragging.As the book starts, the end of the holidays is approaching and Harry can't wait for the beginning of term. However he receives a visit from a mysterious house elf called Dobby, who warns Harry he'll be in grave danger if he returns to school. Things take an even more worrying turn when he arrives at Kings Cross - neither himself or Ron can enter Platform Nine and Three Quarters. They do make their own way to Hogwarts - but their mode of transport only gets them in even more trouble. Things go from bad to worse and, before long, Harry starts hearing strange voices around the school that no-one else can hear. Sooner than you can say \\"Expelliarmus\\", the legend of the Chamber of Secrets comes back to life raising disturbing suspicions about our hero.Rowling has produced another excellent story. The fact that much of the wizarding world has already been introduced in \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" helps this book out greatly. (As a result, it's probably best to read them in order). With this book, she can concentrate a little more on the story - which has quite a strong sense of mystery element about it. As with \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", it will be enjoyed by children and by adults willing to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"How would you like it if you could use magic? Well in this book, Harry Potter and the Chamber Of Secrets, by J.K Rowling, a boy named Harry Potter goes to Witchcraft and Wizardry School, which is called Hogwarts. Harry enjoys his school a lot because he thinks it's his home. He flies on a broomstick and does magic. Every year something happens. His friends Ron and Herminie always help him out.Half way through the school year Harry and his friends start to get suspicious about the chamber and what's down there. Herminie figured out what was down there, it's the chamber of a basilic. A basilic is a snake and Harry can talk to snakes. The snake starts to petrify people. It even took Ron's little sister Ginny down in the chamber.I really liked this book more than the others, not because it's shorter, but it's more interesting. If you haven't read any of them, at least read this one.

J Rowling has created memorable characters and a stalwart hero in Harry, and more power to her pen, I say.I hope that when they do (inevitably) get round to making a film of the first book, that they do not oversweeten either the flavour of the book, or the characters themselves.

I'm a commuter in DC so the audio version is perfect for me but parents may want to look at audio as the ideal version for their children too. Dale's voice communicates all the wonder and wit of the text, with faultless characterizations of Harry, Ron, Hermione and the whole crew. His British public school accent is so well suited to the subject that it actually enhances Rowling's wonderful work. His voice for Gilderoy Lockhart, that grating fraud, is so perfect he should get an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

For example Moaning Myrtle, the ghost, who always cries because she was always made fun of when she was alive. Another is Ginny who could never get Harry's attention. In the first and second book the story went almost the same, Harry goes to Hogwarts and faces Voldemort and prevents him to come back to power. The book had some cool stuff but if all the books are going to be the same flow then Rowling books wont be that entertaining. That's all for now."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"As a die-hard fantasy fan who has long outgrown his childhood, I first eyed the Harry Potter books with askance. They seemed to me to be more suitable for little kids and hardly the material that an adult would read, especially one who has long since been jaded by the typical fare produced by Tolkien-esque authors drawing upon Celtic-Nordic traditions.However, I was soon persuaded by the many positive reviews of this series, both by my friends and by book critics everywhere. The first book I could not put down until I finished it; the sequel ensnared me just the same.While the fantasy genre is composed of hackneyed plots and themes, regurgitated by the many different authors out there, each cranking out thousand page novels, Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone proved that succinctness is indeed a virtue. All of the stereotypes are here, but instead of just rehashing the same old fare that Tolkien dished out, Rowling re-defines it. And while many readers, especially those, like me, who are well-read in this genre, will recognize in Rowling's novels elements that have appeared in countless other stories and myths, Rowling does not use these as crutches to drive her story where none existed; rather, these are bridges she uses to communicate to her readers, common archetypes that exist in the minds of all. Hers is far more than one author's interpretation; it is a book that has captured the imagination and echoes the awe of the fantastic that resides within all of usSeldom has an author written with such clarity that her words flow so smoothly from the page into our thoughts. The fantasy genre owes its revival in large part to Rowling's gift of gab. Instead of alienating most readers as many other authors do, Rowling appeals to the mundane, beckoning them, in their own language, to visit the world of the incredible, the fantastic, the impossible that nevertheless seems so real.Harry Potter is a character of the new millennium, and his exploits usher in a new philosophy of fantasy. An orphaned child living in adverse conditions, Harry discovers that he is truly extraordinary; he is a wizard. Thus begin his adventures and his escape from his cruel life. He makes us all seek within ourselves that spark of magic that will allow each of us to transcend the mundanity and normalizing pressure of society, to become true individuals, unique to one another, and special, each in our own way.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets continues the tradition--yes, tradition, even after a single book!--of Rowling's novels. Engaging and funny, clever and entertaining, the sequel further develops the world in which Rowling has set for her Harry Potter novels, one much like ours but influenced by wizards who move behind the scenes, unsuspecting to the common person. Harry displays the unflagging spirit of determination in the face of adversity, as even his friends slowly turn against him. Rowling's novel teaches children the value of courage, intelligence, and morality while reminding adult readers of the same. Continuing her excellence, Rowling crafts a fantasy series perhaps one day as defining as Tolkien's contribution to fantasy literature. Certainly, it is a worthy addition to everyone's bookshelves, young and old alike."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K Rowling has written a series of books reminiscent of works by J.R.R. Tolkien, Madeleine L'Engle, and R.A. Salvatore. I am 25 years old and I was surprised to find Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets such an enjoyable read! Rowling's use of words conjures up a highly enjoyable world, where you become quickly attached to the heroes therein. The story is masterfully woven and leaves even the most astute reader looking back several pages to find the clues that they initially paid no attention to. One of the best books I have read in many a year!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you like the Harry Potter books, then definitely take a look at any books by John Bellairs! He's no longer with us, but his tales were well written tales of fantasy, magic and adventure. They fed my imagination when I was younger, and now that I have nieces and nephews that love Harry Potter, I have passed along the Bellairs books to them. They love them just as much as the Potter books, and while they're waiting for the next Harry adventure, they pass the time reading the extremely fascinating Bellairs stories. And they're books the parents will love too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After introducing us to Harry Potter and his new life at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry author J.K. Rowling is able to expand on her idea. In &quot;Sorcerer's Stone&quot; she had to spend a lot of time getting us accustomed to Harry's world, but now we can enjoy it along with a richer plot and more developed narrative and characters. And what a plot! I was under the impression that these were completely dumbed down, G-rated kid-friendly books but there is a definite dark side to them. It's nothing that will give kids nightmares or anything, but it is a little creepy. I couldn't put it down I was so drawn in, and finished it easily the first day I got it. It's very hard to pull yourself away from. I think that if you are a parent you should read these books aloud to your children. Some of my most cherished childhood memories are my father reading to us, and this is the sort of book that we would have loved. You will enjoy it on your own, but I imagine that it would be a more fulfilling experience shared with the whole family."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Hello. My name is Katie Potter. &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; was about the best book I have ever read. With full detail and great, capturing words I felt like I was in Harry's little group, or it painted a picture in my head, more like a movie. As I said again, I love this books and all of the other, tremendously written Harry Potter books by J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book should be from ages 9 to adult. It is excellent! There are so many positive life lessons in these books I can only believe that those that challenge its subject matter didn't read them or take life way to seriously. I would like to see some middle school english classes study these books and realize it is ok to be different."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Everyone in our family loves Harry Potter, from eight-year-old Eve to fifteen-year-old Sarah to thirty-eight-year-old Mom!We have just finished Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and have started on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

I liked how the book was action-packed. The author gave good descriptions of the characters. Also if you like mysteries, this would be a good book for you!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is visually very appealing. Fast paced and witty, kids just won't put it down. The character of Harry is a little flat, however he still engages the reader's sympathy. Highly recommend, particularly the UK or Canadian versions which reflect the author's original intent."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"OK, even though I am a little old for Harry Potter books, I can't help it. I was babysitting and I picked it up, and I just couldn't put it down, so of course, I had to run out and buy all 3 so that i could get the whole story, and read them all in about 2 days, and I am now eagerly awaiting the next one. &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; was good, but I don't think it had quite the flair of the first one. By no means is this book tough going, it's quite easy to read, and it is quite entertaining. I enjoy reading something light, and Harry's adventures in Hogworts, playing Quidditch, and dealing with muggles make for fun reading. I now have a book I can read for myself, i can read it to my neice, I can pull it out when I babysit, even my Mom likes them. Harry Potter has all around apeal, and almost anyone can enjoy this book immensly."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Delivery of product was very fast. Product arrived in fabulous condition, as stated in ad."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It is summer vacation and Harry Potter is back at the Dursleys. They have locked all of Harry's magical things in the closet underneath the stairs. One day someone tells him not to go back to Hogwarts, but Harry eventually does go back. At Hogwarts somebody is attacking and petrifying students! People start to suspect that Harry Potter is the culprit!I think J.K. Rowling is a very good writer. I enjoy her sense of exciting drama, and how she writes side plots to help the story. At first the side plots seem to just thicken the story, but sometimes the story could not go on without them. Some of Harry, Ron, and Hermione's adventures get kind of scary, but overall you'll have a good laugh."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The first two books in the Harry Potter series really function as an introduction to the final five novels in the series. They are also the least sophisticated. THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN introduces a depth and sophistication almost completely lacking in the first two books, which while fun are really more books for kids than books for kids and adults.THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS essentially repeated the first novel. At the end of the novel one would safely have assumed that a formula had been established. Virtually every segment of the first novel had an analog in the second. But to her great credit, in the third novel she broke the apparent formula at several crucial points, with delightful results. From the third novel on, nothing about Harry Potter was predictable.There isn't really anything wrong with the second novel; it simply doesn't add a great deal to the mix. Of the seven novels, it is the least innovative, the least adventurous. It is the least exceptional and least exciting. The fact that it breaks no new ground -- apart from the introduction of some new characters and some nice details -- is what causes me to call it part of the introduction to the series, along with the previous book. Within those limitations, the book is a delight. There are numerous truly funny moments and a host of delightful details.When the series of books was coming out, many critics complained at this point that the series was somewhat superficial, that the books lacked any real sense of evil, of danger. I think there was a certain validity to that. Voldemort was more of a cardboard villain, twirling his mustache. All of this changed in the third novel. It added a level of depth and seriousness previously lacking, and there were so many surprises that one could no longer take the story for granted. Bad things could and did happen. As in the best long narratives, a body count built up. Had the series ended with this novel we probably wouldn't have continued to be fascinated with Harry Potter, Hogwarts, and Dumbledore. Luckily, the series got much, much better, and sooner than we could have hoped."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a Magical, charming, entertaining and wonderful book!The lessons in this book are constant.

The magic in the story is like the icing on the cake!I am a HUGE fan of these books,and I recommend them highly to people of all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't think age has anything to do with enjoying a book. I loved this whole series"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Great book for the money. Very good condition. Arrived earlier than stated. Thank you"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm just eating up these books! A brief background: I was disappointed in the Half-Blood Prince movie so I turned to the book to make up for it. I loved the book and then went to the Deathly Hallows. I loved it too. So now I've decided to start from the beginning reading each book to get the best of both worlds. So, here is my take on the book.The story is just as wonderful as the other ones I have read so far. I don't know what else to say to help convince anyone else the book is worth reading other than I personally loved it.However, even though I loved the book I did notice three things I liked better in the movie than the book (can't believe I'd ever feel that a movie was better than a book in any way).1. First, I think the movie did a better job with Tom Riddle's past (Hagrid's involvement, the dead girl, and I think Dumbledore was the Headmaster back then as well but I need to double-check that).2. Second, I thought the conversation between Harry and Tom in the Chamber of Secrets was better in the book but I think the battle with the basilisk was better portrayed in the movie.3. And thirdly, I think the movie portrayed Dobby's freedom better. In the book, the diary is placed in a sock and handed to Malfoy who then pulls the diary out and tosses the sock aside. Had Dobby not happened to be on that one side of him and happened to have caught the sock he wouldn't have been freed. This doesn't seem to be a well thought out plan when you picture it. Not to mention Lucius Malfoy is not the kind of person to reach out to grab a dirty SOCK even if something was obviously in it? So, hiding the sock in the diary and Malfoy handing the diary to Dobby (because he is too good to carry things and has a house-elf slave to do it for him) made more sense in the movie. Plus, it makes better sense because later the diary is in Dumbledore's posession, not Malfoy's possession as I was led to believe in the book.So, there's my opinion of the little things I liked better in the movie than the book but it still doesn't take away from the fact the book is just great and a lot of fun to read. I would 100% recommend this book (and the movie)."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Evil is something tht can control anybody. I have dealt with evil before. It is terrible sometimes. This is why I chose \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.\\" Harry is having a hard time at home and Hogwarts.

Flying,Ha!,you would have your attention on it the whole time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second book in the Harry Potter series follows the same story/formula that worked so well for the first - and does it better. As with the first book, veteran readers of fantasy aren't going to find anything really novel here, but that isn't the point. Its a fun, familar story, and it is told well.I rarely give out 5 star ratings (to me 5 really means outstanding and few really are) but this book earns its stars because of the wonderful balance to its elements - the sense of wonder, the wit and humor, the wisdom, and the dark undercurrent. The book combines and shifts between these elements effortlessly to make what is otherwise a fairly straightforward story really come alive. And hand in hand with that balance is the excellent pacing. It speeds up and slows down - as it should - but I never felt too hurried or bored. In short, the book delivered me to the end in just the right number of pages.Rowling certainly deserves credit for bringing the world to life, but I suspect there is also some top-rate editing at work here that really helped tighten things up. In any case, kudos to the writing and editing team that produced such a well-balanced and enjoyable work."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book in the greatest fantasy series of all time is just the way all sequels should be: darker and deeper. Harry's magical world begins to show its cracks: slavery, racism, elitism, classism, hate crimes and slurs against \\"inferior blood\\". Harry himself is darkened by the threat of his own destiny (hero or villain?), as he must unravel the mystery of the monster hidden in the Chamber of Secrets that threatens his school. Themes and events of this book send shockwaves through the rest of the series (particularly Half-Blood Prince, which is essentially its sequel). What is amazing isn't that Rowling is able to maintain her Dickensian cast of brilliant characters, her Agatha Christieish complex, enigmatic psychological plots, her sly Austenian wit, her Tolkien imagination, and her Shakespearean themes of destiny and heroism, but that--with each book--she improves to create a thoroughly original, satisfying, intoxicating read. Yes, this is my eighth time reading it. Each read reveals more and more of Rowling's brilliance (\\"maybe he killed Moaning Myrtle...\\")....and, you know, the best part of COS is finishing it, because you know which one is up next.... Grade: A"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you like the Harry Potter series you must get this book.

Now it completes my books.It is a good book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets, the second book in the Harry Potter series, is just as- if not more- great as the first, The Philosopher's Stone (aka) The Sorcerer's Stone. After fighting Professor Quirrell and thus ensuring Lord Voldemort did not return, Harry enters his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and finds that, yet again, there is another evil challenge he must face: The Chamber of Secrets.Harry is mysteriously able to hear voices no one else seems to hear, this often gets him into trouble because the voice always leads him to a petrified victim. It therefore isn't hard to blame the other Hogwarts students for believing Harry is the culprit who opened the Chamber of Secrets.While in the Girls' Lavatory, Harry finds a diary left behind in one of the stalls. When he returns to the Gryffindor Common Room, he begins to unwrap the mystery of this empty diary, making him doubt even his closest friend. From then on, the story takes wonderfully fantastic twists and turns that lead up to Harry facing a most terrifying enemy with nothing but \\"a songbird and an old hat.\\"Can Harry battle evil and prevail once again? The Chamber of Secret is a book you can't possibly miss out of (mostly because that means you aren't planning to read the 3rd-7th book...and I find that horrible decision!)

It's good that they filmed the movies in quick succession, so that you can grow up with the kids. And the story line was very well done, loved it too!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Though my favorite volumes in the Harry Potter series are the first, the fourth, the fifth and the seventh, I have to say that this one is very special to me. For the simple reason that this second year of Harry's studies at Hogwarts presents events from the past, events that reveal secrets about characters we know like Hagrid the gamekeeper, others like the amazing Dobby, and an incident that was the start of several incidents around the wizard world. Not only that, we find in this book events and characters, along with small incidents that take place around the school, that will definitely take an influence in the upcoming books.For when Harry Potter is warned that he must not return to Hogwarts and then becomes accused of several incidents around Hogwarts, and a certain Chamber of Secrets, he has to find, with Ron and Hermione, the culprit before it is too late.As a final note, those that are very careful can find out in a single chapter the year that the story is taking place and set that series around the 1990s and not the 21st century, like I heard some people say when discussing the series with other readers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Going back through and reading the series with my son is one of the most special parts of my day.

He overhears some teachers saying \\"The Chamber is open\\", but that can't be true...the Chamber of Secrets can only be opened by the true heir of Slytherin, the evil house of Hogwarts. Can it be true? As more and more students turn to stone, Harry Potter knows he had to do something. He teams up with Ron Weasley, his best friend, and they figure out that the Chamber is open, and they know who is opening it. Can they stop them before it's too late?A great book for kids of all ages! Adventure, comedy, romance, and action are just the beginning of how much is in this book. Harry, Ron and Hermione, Harry's other friend, are captivating characters, and you can't wait to see what they do next!! Of course, it helps to read the first book beforehand, but they're separate stories, so don't worry if you never read the first one. The book covers a whole year at Hogwarts, from beginning to end. Once you start, you can't put the book down until the very last page. No matter what your age, you will enjoy J.K Rowling's second masterpiece.From kids to adults, everyone loves Harry Potter! The Harry Potter books grab the reader's attention and doesn't let it go until the last page. The books are amazing grabbers and everyone will love them. I recommend them to everyone.

Many who share my other beliefs have attacked this book without having read it. So, this review is directed to those types and anyone who wishes to discuss the issue intelligently with someone who claims religious objections to this book and the rest of the series.The primary objection that is raised is the use of magic in the book. Afterall, the book is about a school of wizardry and witchcraft. Well, hold the phone! If the use of magic as a plot device makes a book inherently unsuitable for Christians, then let us gather at the river and throw away our beloved Chronicles of Narnia and Ring Triology. To be fair, some of Potter's critics do object to Lewis's and Tolkien's works as well, but the vast majority of the Conservative Christian world embraces those authors with no reservations.So, this leads to another possible basis for objection to the Harry Potter series: the books don't promote an explicitly Christian worldview. Well, back the bus up!! If that's our standard, then to be consistent, we would have to object to John Steinbeck, Herman Melville, Ernest Hemingway, John Grisham, Tom Clancy, Pat Conroy, . . . well, you get my point.Okay, so maybe the Potter books really do teach bad lessons. Ummmm . . . NOPE! The books are classic Good vs. Evil stories. Yes, Potter, Ron, & Hermione don't always show proper respect for their elders, but in this book they are only 12 years old, so for the most part, that's realistic. Plus, in the books, there is usually some negative consequence to the characters' \\"bad\\" actions.Now, onto this book. Unlike Sorcerer's Stone, this book kept me guessing until the final revelations toward the end. Rowling seems to have gotten a bit better at writing in a subtle manner to cause the reader to second-guess throughout the reading.Plus, I really liked Dobby. :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A great deal of angst has been expressed in the Christian press and amongst conservatives over the notion that the Harry Potter bookssanction magic and are, by the very nature of the story, irreligious. Though many commentators have had great fun with this worry, feelingthat it somehow shows how fundamentally silly Christians are, I'm not inclined to dismiss it so quickly. In a society in which Wicca hasbegun to be taken seriously as a belief system, even receiving IRS tax-exempt status, a parent has to be concerned about the possible effectson their child of such a phenomena as Harry Potter. But a responsible parent who reads with their child and discusses the books and theirthemes presumably has no more need to worry about the witchcraft within them than have preceding generations of parents needed to losesleep over the sorcery in The Lord of the Rings. In fact, it's hard to escape the nagging feeling that most of us simply accept that Tolkienwon't warp our kids because we know him to have been a devout Christian himself, and influential in converting C. S. Lewis, whose Narniabooks are too explicitly Christian-themed to worry anyone. Presumably, if J. K. Rowling were known to be religious (I've no idea whethershe is or not), and outspoken about her beliefs, many of these concerns about her writings would likewise disappear. But this is neither arealistic nor a productive standard to hold authors to; instead we should judge them by the moral message of their works. By this standard,the Harry Potter books should give Christians, and religious parents of all stripes, reason to be grateful, not worried.This is the case because Harry is a quintessential example of Man's struggle to choose between good and evil. In fact, we've reached a pointin our culture where the simple acknowledgments that Evil exists, that the propensity to behave in an evil manner is an essential aspect ofMan's character, that Evil is seductive, and that we are susceptible too it--the bifurcated nature of Man which is the very basis ofJudeo-Christianity and, thus, of our civilization--are in themselves conservative notions. The political and spiritual philosophies of the Leftare premised on a very different conception of Man, that he is fundamentally Good and that selfish, antisocial, and antihuman behaviors areproducts of external factors : of faulty social institutions; political oppression; or errant belief systems. The Left believes that if all of theseartificial accretions could be stripped away Man would return to his natural state of goodness. J. K. Rowling obviously disagrees.Famously, or at least it will be famous to anyone who's read the books, when Harry arrived at Hogwarts the Sorting Hat hesitated over whatdorm to place him in. Eventually he was assigned to Gryffindor, but the Hat also noted that he would fit in Slytherin, the dorm associatedwith Salazar Slytherin and the study of the Dark Arts. Merely noting that the capacity for evil, as well as good, resides in Harry is unusualenough, but Rowling also makes it clear that Harry will be defined by the choices he makes between the two. At the end of Chamber ofSecrets, worried about his ability to tap into skills that are usually associated with Slytherin (like communicating with snakes [note theBiblical echo]), Harry confesses his self-doubt to Albus Dumbledore, headmaster of Hogwarts. Harry wonders if he really should be inSlytherin :'[The Sorting Hat] only put me in Gryffindor,' said Harry in a defeated voice, 'Because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .''Exactly,' said Dumbledore, beaming once more. 'Which makes you very different from [Voldemort]. It is our choices, Harry, that showwhat we truly are, far more than our abilities.' Harry sat motionless in his chair, stunned.Well might Harry, or any other modern child, be stunned by this revelation, that it is our moral choices in life that define who we are, thatwe bear the responsibility for who we become in life. Adults hear this seldom enough, children almost never. It is this message that makesthe Harry Potter books so valuable to parents and makes their appeal to children such a welcome development. Concerned parents--thoughthey may obviously prefer that kids not be exposed to such themes in public schools, which antireligion activists have rendered so morallyneutral and hostile to Christianity that they are incompetent to address them--should embrace the books, should read them with their kids,and, without sucking the fun out of them, should take advantage of the lessons that they teach.Meanwhile, the popularity of the books suggests a genuine thirst among kids for the kind of moral clarity that they provide. The Educationestablishment, the Left, and parents who leave such matters to the public schools to fulfill would do well to engage in some soul searchingabout the inadequacy of the moral education that the schools are apparently providing. One approach that conservatives and Christiansmight take is to, quite disingenuously, suggest that just as these Wiccan novels have valuable non-religious lessons to teach, so might someof the great children's novels of the Christian tradition, like Swiss Family Robinson, which is usually horribly bowdlerized to strip it ofreligious themes. Rather than trying to ban a worthwhile series of books, one which has kids reading enthusiastically, they should be used asa lever to get more good books into the curricula, to at least make sure that the same schools are reading Tolkien and Lewis and MadeleineL'Engle. After all, what's good for the Wiccan goose is good for the Christian gander, right?GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"K, basically, out of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Harry Potter Books,this was definatly the best.

Ms. Rowling has created delightful characters, enough plot for the audience the book was intended for (young readers) and great lessons on how to remain calm, use good judgement and to believe in one's self. Parents should not worry that their child is going to jump out of a window on a broomstick (unless you yourself was the child that played Superman from the roof as a kid) Parents read the book with your child and live the adventure with them.

I have never felt this way about a book, I usually don't like books. (I'm a TV guy) But this book was so realistic and detailed I felt I was in the book myself. Also, the story wasso fun, I couldn't stop reading. Once when my mom told me to go to sleep, I stayed up reading Harry Potter. I can't wait to read the second one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Potter, Ron, and Hermione unravel the mysteries of the Chamber of Secrets in this second book of the series and in doing so confront the subtle system of classism in England. The school's purebloods (i.e. royals?) have no Muggle blood in them and claim superiority over the mudbloods (commoners?), who fall victim to mysterious attacks. In the end, the hard-working and most talented wizard wins, despite a mix of Muggle blood. So there's a message of acceptance and equality which is long overdue in children's literature."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Chamber of Secrets is a great read for kids of all ages.My husband and I bought the books to read to our children, and have fallen so in love with the series, that we ourselves are addicted!In the Chamber of Secrets there are so many twists and turns that you feel like you are on an emotional roller coaster. From the start you wish that you could be there to parent Harry yourself. Once he goes to Hogwarts it doesn't get much better for Him either, but once again good triumphs over evil, or does it?I sicerely hope that you enjoy this book as much as I did !"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Some creature is petrifying certain Hogwarts students as well as a certain unpopular animal. People who've seen the movie probably already know. Underlying that is a threat that the heir of Slytherin will strike at all the Muggle-borns, or to use the derogatory term Draco calls Hermione, a mudblood. In two of the attacks, Harry walks in on the scene and is suspected. Fortunately, the Weasleys and Hermione back him up, as do Hagrid, McGonagall, and Dumbledore. Could this be the danger that Dobby the house-elf warned him about early in the book?Author J. K. Rowling ratchets up certain conflicts. The Dursleys cruelty goes up when they bar Harry up in his room. Draco Malfoy, the rich kid bully, is more verbally vicious to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The Quidditch match and the duelling scene underscore Harry vs. Draco. The same goes for Professor Snape, who becomes more hateful of Harry than in the first book. But nicer characters continue to be a relief, such as Dumbledore and Hagrid. As this is a more serious crisis, their roles as kindly guardians become more pronounced than ever, especially for Harry. And the Weasley twins, Fred and George, are more mischievous than ever. Whoever invites them to a party had better have a good sense of humour. And Hermione is still the know-it-all and her expertise comes in handy for her two friends, but she's still a girl, as evidenced by her crush on the handsome Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher.Another key to a successful book series is expanding on concepts or people from a previous story. For example, in Book One, Hagrid tells Harry that he got into trouble at Hogwarts and got expelled. Here, we found out why he got expelled. The three-cornered friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione is also cemented here, as is Harry's affinity to the Weasley brothers. Face it, the Weasley family might as well be Harry's true adopted family compared to the Dursleys.Of the new characters, Lucius Malfoy stands out as a menacing character to be reckoned with, and we see where Draco got his nastiness from. Gilderoy Lockhart is a narcissistic, self-promoting, shallow, incompetent charmer. In fact the required texts for his class are all based on his exploits.The concept of pure-bloods and Mudbloods (wizards with Muggle parents) has definite overtones of the Nazis determination of race and their effort to keep the Germanic race pure. But, as Hagrid points out, \\"...they haven't invented a spell our Hermione can' do.\\"Oh, Mary GrandPre\\u001b$B!G\\u001b(Bs chapter heading illustrations are still vivid. Check out the picture of the Mandrake!The second book tops the first in terms of excitement level, richer writing style, expanding the Hogwarts universe, and the desire to read it all the way through. Despite its being a fantasy, it is for all intents and purposes, a mystery, and a wonderful one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After reading the first Harry Potter, I was anxious to begin reading Harry Potter and the Chamber of Sercrets.I was surprised because I thought it would not be as good as the first book.

Please be aware that the beginning of the the story may be a bit upsetting to a young reader/listener due to Harry's living conditions and mistreatment. Yes, it all works out wonderfully in the end, but a young child will need some explaination about Harry's various situations, and even that this is a fictional story. Both of my children loved this book, and begged to have part of a chapter read to them every night. We had wonderful discussions about Harry, the Dursleys, Hogwarts, the death of Harry's parents, love, teasing, meanness, friendship, and magic. We are excited about starting book two, and hope that there will be more, if the quality continues and it does not become disneyfied. We hope it does not become a movie, because it could never live up to the magic of one's imagination!! ps...I am a mental health therapist who works with children.....do not overlook your child's thoughts and questions that may come from reading this book!

Probubly the Best I've Read!!!! Go Harry Potter! Also, read Ella Enchanted, It's good too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was written by J. K. Rowling. This is a book about a fictional place called Hogwarts which is a school of witchcraft and wizardry. The book also tells about the troubles and adventures that Harry Potter and all of his friends get into.The end of the summer was drawing near as Harry Potter got ready for another fun filled year at Hogwarts school of magic. Harry was having a miserable time at home with the Dursley's who treated him extremely poorly since he was a wizard and they were not. Everything seemed to be going fine until Harry was visited a house elf by the name of Dobby. After ruining half of the Dursley's house, Dobby told Harry that he was not to go back to Hogwarts because something bad was going to happen but he didn't tell him what. Because of Dobby's unexpected visit, the Dursley's told Harry that he was not going to his school. Harry wasn't going to listen to either one of them and decided to get his friend Ron and his brothers to help him get to the school. After they got him out, Harry and Ron missed the train and stole Ron's parents flying car and followed the train all the way there. When they got there, they got into a great deal of trouble.After the two got there, they met up with there friend Hermione how tells them about one of the new teachers, Gildereoy Lockhart. Also at the school is the evil Malfoy and for her first year, Ron's sister Ginny. Also along the way Harry runs into a ghost by the name of Moaning Myrtle and a giant snake, but u have to read the book to find out more about that.Overall I thought that this was a great book and picked up right were the first one left off. Some sequels that I have read did not hold up th the high standards that the first book did, but this book was far different, it kept me interested the whole time and I can't wait to read the third book in this amazing series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am well into finishing HP4 and I must say that this series has excited my own imagination. This book was the first HP I read (and yes I backtracked to HP1). The mystery JKR plots out for Harry portrays him in this edition and those to follow as a young sleuth and less of a wizard (like a youthful Sherlock Holmes). A villianous culprit is about at Hogwarts and Harry along with the help of his two best friends must solve who is behind these attacks on the student body. Harry is more anxious to find this fiend to not only stop them, but also to help clear his name as a suspect. JKR paints a literary picture of intigrue and suspicion in this installment. I however gave it four stars only because of one chapter in the book I just had to muttle through so I could get back into the real plot (hint: DDP). The chapter was not portrayed in the movie, but it does fill in details about certain characters shown and not shown in the film version. I hope you enjoy it and please do read them all in order."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an altogether great book. From the begining, you cannot put it down. I like how much the characters have matured from the first one. This book is already a classic, and I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it. The book can be thoroughly enjoyed from anyone ages 8 to 80. If you like fantasy books, you'll love this book. Just as good as the first, the magic is altogther facinating."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Do you like mystery, adventure, and action? Then feast your eyes on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J. K. Rowling .The protagonist is a boy named Harry Potter who lives with his foster parents, the Dursley&#65533;s. They are very mean to him and don&#65533;t care much about him. This book is packed with chills and thrills. This is Harry&#65533;s second year in Hogwarts. But he is admonished not to go because something terrible is going to happen. But like always, Harry is so undaunted he goes.When Harry and his friend Ron got to the train station an invisible wall blocked the entrance. Each time they tried to get through they were knocked down.So Harry and Ron stole their parent&#65533;s car and flew to Hogwarts. When they arrived, their potions teacher, Snape, punished them. Harry and Ron were almost expelled because some people or &#65533;muggles&#65533; saw the flying car. Later in the book Harry and his friends walking down the hallway and they saw a dead cat on the wall. On the wall it said the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Children were then found frozen solid in the hallways or petrified.What could be doing this and why? Is the Chamber of Secrets really open? If you want to find out anymore the go read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling's second book in the Harry Potter series steps it up a notch. The writing is more engaging for mixed age audiences, meaning it's the perfect book to read aloud together as a family. In addition, the plot has a gripping effect that mere magic alone can't account for. Yes, it's the creative muse that drives this one along, and Rowling has done a smashing job this time.In \\"Chamber of Secrets,\\" we are introduced to new and engaging characters. There's Gilderoy Lockhart, the guest wizard of the dark arts that is neither to dark or too wizardly, but boy does this guy love himself. There's Dobby the house elf that despite the comic relief reminds this reader too much of the annoying character in the Star War prequels...you know that tall goofy guy with floppy ears and a Jamaican accent. Well, the colloquial house elf dialouge is only a minor misstep but I'm sure to be riotous fun for the young and younger at heart. There's Moaning Myrtle who inhabits and haunts a defunct toilet. And best of all there's a new villain lurking about whispering dark dark things through the walls of Hogwarts.Harry Potter is more nuanced between a battle of good and evil. And like all good battles between the polarized moral compass, we see shades of black and white, and marker lines that find you pitched on one side or the other. Harry Potter captures all that is magical, quirky, and wondrous in childhood and Rowling's writing reaches out to all ages to remind them of that time. She does so, in such a way, that the pages keep turning effortlessly and before you know it, you've reached a temporary end; satisfied and entertainingly chilled."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was really great.

You can tell that JK Rowling struggled with this book, since she seemed determined to put a lot of plot elements into one excellent story. She was very tedious with laying her clues, and hinting about certain things, but there was always irony around every corner. The words used can build a child's vocabulary well, but isn't too hard to understand. The book has a dark and creepy feel to it, while also making you think, and piece the puzzle together.

The plot, setting, and characters bring your imagination to new levels where it can run rampant in a sea of wonder.The depiction of Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are so detailed tha you feel as if you have had a personal relationship with these characters for years. The setting is described in such a magical way that if you close your eyes you can see, hear, smell, and touch everything that the characters do. It is one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had while reading a book, to feel such a part of it. The plot is also something that will keep you on the edge of your seat every moment, weather it be flying cars, or man eating spiders.

Rowling does an excelent job describing the scenes so you can picture it in your head. there is also never a dull moment. I would recomend this book to anyone, even if you don't like to read. It is an all aroundgreat book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I had been assigned to read the first HP book for an English class. I read it and enjoyed. When, I saw the second one I decide to give it a try. So, I bought it. I didn't think it was going to be good. Generally, most squels, are worse than the first ones and in my opinion the first was ok. Nothing great but not horrible. Just an ok read. This book shocked me.This book is good for many reasons. One, the characters grow. They don't change drasticly, they just grow up a bit as we all do every year. It's cute how Hermione has a crush. The new professor is a real trip. I also like how we get to meet the Weasely family. They're a cute little family. I love all of the members. Another character that comes is Dobby. He's funny. Dobby causes a lot of trouble for Harry, but tries to help. House elves seem annoying. The only problem with Dobby is when you find out who sent him, you're not shocked. It's a let down because he was sent to Harry by the person who I thought sent him. Which if you don't mind a *spoiler* is Malfoy.Another thing I enjoyed about this book is the adventure is more detailed and exciting. You get caught up in it, even if you're not a little kid. Teens like myself enjoy it, too. All throughtout the story, you wonder what's in the chamber of secrets, who opened it, and who is the heir of Slytherin. Unlike, Dobby, you'll be surprised when you do find out the answers to those questions.The last thing I like about this book is all through out the story, Harry is questioning himself. Harry feels like he may have been sorted into the wrong house, because he thinks he may be the heir of Slytherin. He also wonders what it's like to be evil and can he be evil. Everyone thinks about that at one time or another.I really enjoyed this book. Much more than the the first one. I only gave it four stars, though. It wasn't perfect. I rarely feel any book is perfect."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of SSecrets is the sequel to the original book, Harry Potter and the Sorcorer's Stone.

If you're not familiar with the Harry Potter books, then not only does this spell mean nothing to you, but you are also missing out on suspense, adventure, mind-boggling spells, hidden secrets, laughs, and most of all, the famous mystery - who opened the Chamber of Secrets? Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets not only keeps your interest, but it's very well written and descriptive. I cannot begin to convey how phenomenally J.K Rowling creates such intricate characters that you can so easily relate to.Starting off his boring and dreadful school year, Harry is bossed around and locked up when a hideous house-elf \\"Dobby\\" shows up in his not-so-spacious room. His best friend Ron soon rescues him; which starts his remarkable adventure at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. \\"You don't have to be a wizard or a kid to appreciate the spell cast by Harry Potter.\\"-USA Today. This book isn't recommended for any age, but all ages. No matter how old, or how young, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets will expand your imagination to so many new horizons and keep you flipping pages until you're done.This book was so incredibly popular that it sold millions of copies and was made into a million dollar movie that was just as impressive. Although some parts were dull, the other stimulating parts definitely made up for it. This novel is a wonderful must-read!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"While skimming through the pages, you try to imagine how could any person come up with such remarkable ideas. A massive serpent, a diary that writes back to you, and a secret chamber that opens from the girls lavatory. The majestic scenery and the wondrous incidents make the Chamber of Secrets an outstanding novel.There is so much wonder and history behind this magical universe, and J.K Rowling sucks you right into it. Witchcraft and wizardry is such an interesting topic to write about, and Rowling approaches it in such an unusual way. She lets you learn and grow with the characters so by the end of the first book, you have to read on. Harry, Ron and Hermione are regular kids, but withhold a little secret. All born witches and wizards, they await their year spent at Hogwarts, the school that they attend. But every year strange, mysterious things happen to the trio, which cause the to take matters into their own hands. And this year it's the Chamber of Secrets, a very sensitive subject, no one is willing to talk about. Rowling's description and detail bring you right into Hogwarts, as if you are student enrolled there.The Harry Potter books are definitely a read that you don't want to miss out on. Once you finish The Chamber of Secrets you will be anxious to start the next book. If you're feeling dull and want to jump into a new novel, I would strongly recommend Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. But be careful, you don't want to get too obsessed."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I liked Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets because it is a fantasy and fantasies are my favarit books.

The author is J.K. Rowling. The genre is fantasy, and mystery. The main characters are Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermonie Granger, Dumbledore, Malfoy, Hagrid, and Dobby. It takes place in England, and it's about modern time. The problem is that a monster is coming from a hidden chamber and is trying to kill young wizards that are learning magic. The rising action is when the monster takes a girl down to the chamber, and the school has to be closed. Harry Potter thinks he can save the girl. Harry Potter is the main character, and his role is to try and save the girl. Ron Weasley is Harry's best friend and he goes with Harry to save the girl. Hermonie is Harrys other friend and she is attacked by the beast. Dumbledore is the Headmaster. Malfoy is Harrys enemy and Harry thinks that Malfoy is ordering the beast to attack students. Hagrid is the grounds keeper and is like a father to Harry. He is suspected of being behind the attacks. Dobby is a elf, and he warns Harry not to go to school. After Heromine is attacked Harry and Ron are motivated to stop the attacker. There are many strong points in the book. The author is good at describing what is happening, especially at the end."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Just because I rate this book 4 stars doesn't mean it's not an example of a great story. It's just that there isn't enough good in it. Also, the movie is just plain scary. But with the rest, it's a wonderful book.My favorite part of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is when Gilderoy Lockhart Memory charmed himself which was really funny. The Dobby parts were also funny. It was kind of cool how Ron and Harry got away from Malfoy when they were changing back to themselves. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a great book to read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It seems that if Harry Potter returns to the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizards that bad things will happen. And it does. Somebody is turning students (and others) into stone. And it has to do with something that happened 50 YEARS AGO.I enjoyed this book. Same style as the first, with a mystery, and some information about the school and history of some of the characters, like Hagrid and Tim Riddle. Secret Chambers, snakes and spiders do make this slightly more darker than the first book, so be warned!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is not your ordinary boy. He doesn't go to your ordinary school or hang out with your average friends. Instead he goes to Hogwarts, a school of witchcraft and wizardry, and hangs out with other wizards and witches at school. He is at his second year of Hogwarts when strange things start to happen including messages warning the heir that the Chamber of Secrets have been opened. He even stumbles over the diary of Tom Riddle that writes back to him and takes him back to the past. Will Harry be safe at Hogwarts? Later on Harry goes into the Chamber of Secrets and saves Ron's little sister, Ginny, after fighting a enormous basilisk summoned by Tom Riddle who lured Ginny into coming. I would recommend this book to anybody, old or young, because this book and series is very interesting and makes the reader never want to put the book down.I like the main characters in this book because they are very intelligent and logical. Harry, Ron, and Hermione all are very smart and good at solving puzzles. In the first book they all went through the puzzles and test to get to the Sorcerer's Stone. In this book they all put in to solving this mystery. They are very sneaky because numerous times they snuck out of Hogwarts and got Hagrid to give them some information that he shouldn't have.I also like the setting in this book. This book takes place at a school for witches and wizards. They have many classes like potion classes and defense against the dark arts classes. Although it may be dangerous at times it is a perfectly fine institution. The people and things at Howgwarts made it possible for Harry to rescue Ron's sister and fight the basilisk.Finally I like the problem and the way it was introduced. The way the plot was introduced was almost like a mystery by itself because the clues led to the problem. First Dobby came to Harry's house to keep him from coming to school. Second, Harry gets hurt badly. Then bodies start to be found in Hogwarts petrified. Harry also finds the diary and then finds out that Ginny has gone into the Chamber of Secrets. The problem is to find out who has opened the Chamber of Secrets and how all these people are getting petrified. It is resolved by Harry going into the Chamber of Secrets to meet Tom Riddle and Dumbledore's Phoenix kills the basilisk.Harry Potter and the Chamber os Secrets is a very interesting book that keeps readers of all levels interested. It has mystery and adventure which makes this book a great read for anybody.-B. Nicholas"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book that I read was Harry Potter : Chamber of Secrets.It is a new adventure that involves Harry Potter, and witchcraft and important stuff to solve the book .It's challenging for some elementary school kids. It's pretty frightening to some children. It 's perfect to read during a school year because it's exciting and it's a type of book that you might want more, also that the book will keep you going when don't have nothing to do.It's just like an inside book and has parts of the story that leave you to investigate.This book of series was sold a bunch of copies and made a lot of history. Iwould recommend it a 3 out of 4 stars. It's a interesting book and it's fun to read when your bored.Even though it's good it my not be suitable for kids under 13 years of age. It has some violence in it . For some kids might be just right. The Harry Potter books are close to be alike with A ''SERIES of UNFORTUNATE EVENTS''.Next time if your looking for abook check out Harry Potter:Chamber of Secrets, Go for an exciting adventure with Harry and his friends to discover what's happening in the school."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second book, HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS immediately turns the Hogwarts World on its ear. Harry and you the reader are to re-learn strange world of wizardry together. With each revelation, the stakes increase until Harry's story is a much more frightening adventure, peril at every step. But even a world where house elves, fights with snakes, chasing spiders and flying cars are not out of the ordinary has it all over living with obnoxious relatives living in the real world, or for some of you readers the Muggle world.Either way, Rowling's storytelling remains quaint and steady but the book has blossomed by 43 pages over the previous episode, a trend that will explode in book four. The heart that is somewhat lacking in the screen adaptation is here in spades.The story follows Harry's second year at Hogwarts, a school for magicians. Already the story has more meat to it as the amount of introduction required is limited. Instead, we are immediately thrust into danger as Harry receives death threats and executes an escape from his Muggle prison. We are also introduced to the new Defense Against the dark Arts instructor, a position that seems to always be in flux. This time is Gilderoy Lockhart, a boorish celebrity who is five time winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award. This has been my favorite instructor in the job.With the help of his insecure friend Ron Weasley and know-it-all Hermione Granger, Harry begins to delve deeper into the dangerous world of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, already fighting battles with Voldemort's supporters. Through it all, Hogwarts remains a world of magic, fun and entertaining to discover.If you happen to be short on time, all the books have been \`performed' on Audio CD by Jim Dale (Pete's Dragon). He does a wonderful job of reading the novel, word for word, using voice characterizations to help your enjoyment.The book was adapted to film pretty faithfully, but more has been cut out than in the previous book. That is understandable, considering the blossoming page count of the book. After all, an accurate, 19 hour version will only please purists. Even with many cuts and abridgements, the film clocks in at a family unfriendly 2 and a half hours.While the films leave me as somewhat of a Muggle, I have enjoyed all of the Harry Potter books (six at this writing). Author J.K. Rowling is a great storyteller, providing readers with a hero we enjoy watching grow up in a world of magic and creativity. And as Harry matures, so does her storytelling technique.Harry Potter's greatest magic trick was making millions of children pick up and read a book! And they're still reading!Next stop for me, Azkaban Prison!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Setting is at Hogwarts mainly.Plot The first event that happened is Harry left Privet Drive. 2nd He got his school supplies. 3rd He went to Hogwarts. 4th He found a diary in the girls bathroom.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets continues Harry Potter's life in the wizarding world! This book is an amazingly written book, including shocks, surprises, and loads of humor! This eye-grabbing and mind-boggling book is one of the best books I have ever read! Harry returns to Hogwarts for his second term, but what awaits him there is defienetly not what he had expected. Gossips about a chamber within Hogwarts spread, but is it just a joke passed around students, or is it a real chamber with horrors within it?I really enjoyed this book a lot, for it is well written just like it's preuqel. When you read a few sentences, the book hooks you to it, and you can be reading for like, two hours and not notice that you have read for that much! This book was not was good as the first, but it is still an amazing book, with it's humor, mysteries, and magic!This book is the kind of book you can read a countless number of times without getting bored! I have read this book at least ten times, and when I come read it again, I am still interested and enthusiastic about reading it!Well recommended!Rating: 9/10"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter was a very good book because it had suspence and a very well thought out mystery.In the book Harry has to find out whats been petrifying everyone. An example of a suspenceful part was when Harry was fighting the baslisc,a giant snake. It was one second year wizard against a baslisc and one of the most powerful dark wizards in the wizarding world. The odds are against Harry but with a little help from Fox,Dumbledor's pet pheonix,Harry beats both of them and saved a little girl. One example of a mysterious part is when Harry heres a voice saying \\"Kill,kill,kill.\\" Then he asked if anyone else heard it and they said they didn't.I would recomend this book to someone who likes mystery and suspence.D.Fleming"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling writes a magnificent 2nd sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This book is called Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. This book caught my attention the moment I laid eyes on it.This is an excellent book that everybody should read. It keeps you on your feet and you never want to put it down. J.K. Rowling has great flashbacks, word choice, and description. It's a very unique book because of all the witch/wizard spells, and the supernatural things that happen in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.The only part I don't care for is the way the author doesn't explain what the title of the chapter means until the chaper is almost done. Other than that, this is a must read book for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I would recomend this book to evrryone.It's called Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

But this year Voldemart, an evil wizard who seeks revenge on Harry, is back mysterious diary of Tom Riddle and has opened the Chamber of Secrets. Together Harry and his trusted friends, Ron and Hermioni, will solve the mystery of the Chamber of secrets and who opened it once before.What I like most about this book: I like most about this book was the action and suspense it brung, for example when Harry faced off against the mighty sepant, The Basilisk.What I didnt like and Why: One thing I didnt like about it is I thought it was just a little too long to read.My favorite character and Why: My favorite character in this book is Harry Potter because he is Resourceful when fighting Voldemart and the Basilisk.The scene, line, or passage that meant something to me and why: (Pg.333)The line that meant something to me in this story as\\" It is our choices, that show what we truly are,\\" because I also bilieve that the choices a person makes show who they really are.What I would say about this book to someone else: I would say htis was a great book and it was really fun to read. It was also written very detailed so you could see the image in your mind.One Question I have about htis book: One question I have about this book is the relationship between Tom Riddle & Lord Voldemart in the book. The author could have been a little more detailed about that.My strongest reason for recommending this book: My strongest reason for recomending this book is it is written so detailed that it really captures your imagination as you read more and more."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"For all it's worth, Harry Potter is definately a phenomenon among young readers. This surprising novel had me worried at first. Post my reluctance to read the first book, I found that &quot;The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; is more than I ever could have imagined it to be. However, sequals can either be better, or devestatingly awful. This is the prior.This book carries itself as my favorite in the series due to its adaptation of the Harry Potter formula to create a captivating mystery. The clencher is the end, which is far from a let down. The references to a diary which carries one's very being is the perfect personification of a writer's feelings about his or her own work.This book is well worth the money, but only if you've read the predecessor and are prepared to get deeper stuck into the Harry Potter phenomenon."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is as adventure packed and mysterious as the 1st, 3rd, and 4th book. In this book once again there's a new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher that is sooooo full of him/herself it's funny. Once this book starts rolling you don't want to stop reading it until you are done! Happy reading! :)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am surprised at some of the low ratings this book recieved. I have read all the Harry Potter books multiple times, and I have to say this is one of my favorites. I have heard some other readers say that this was less magical and interesting than the others and that it was predictable and a little too noticably modeled after the first book. While I admit there was some similarity in the endings of the first two books (Harry faces You-Know-Who and barely escapes... saves the day... wins the house cup... loses out with the Quidditch cup...) in no way were they identical. Harry's final battle in the Chamber of Secrets is more desperate, more fantastic, faster-paced, and more isolated. Harry doesn't have the glimmering hope that his friends might get help in time. And more than just the return of Voldemort is at stake. A girl lies at the brink of death and the Monster poses another threat to Harry and, if it survives, to Hogwarts school itself. Harry's adversary in this one is more formidable as well. He doesn't just face an evil man with a wand and Voldemort's shadow. He faces Voldemort himself, but a glowing Voldemort, with his life in a book, and a giant, deadly beast, whose very glance can kill... And how about the rest of the book? So much is revealed... Hagrid's story, Voldemort's past... and more of the mysteries of Harry Potter. Many people like the third book better. Yes, perhaps it is more thrilling, more... angry. But I personally felt that the Chamber of Secrets revealed a more subtle secret, carried a more delicate story. It WAS full of secrets... and the potential terror in its pages reminds me deliciously of the fourth book, which happens to be my other favorite. So... if you're looking for an excellent story, with magical secrets, and terrifying truths... I suggest you try this one..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I don't know why, this book is the best that I loved, maybe because of the beautiful concept of an image living in a diary, mesmerising the reader, just as the book had mesmerised me. Or maybe because the author was brilliant in depiciting the maturity of the protagonists, who are one year older now after their first year in the wizard school (and this perfect imaging of gradual maturity with age becomes the norm of the series, one of the most difficult accomplishment of the author). A wonderful book that not only lives upto its expectations, it oulives it. Very rarely a sequel comes out so good, if not better."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Installment #2 of the Harry Potter series is a very good book. Again, Harry still has to live at home with the &quot;muggles&quot; during the summer. But, in the fall, he returns to the magical world where he is learning to become a wizard. I have thoroughly enjoyed this book; it continues where Book #1 left off. If you liked Book #1, you will like this book! I encourage and recommend this book"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry and all the gang from Hogwarts are back and in full force in this exciting sequel to the original. This book is just as well written and, like the first, I would become so immersed in the story that I would get quite a shock when I would finally lift my head from the pages and realise that I was actually back in this world sitting in my living room! Perhaps this story is just a tad darker than the first but certainly no darker than more traditional fairy tales such as those of the Brothers Grimm. I'll be moving onto the third book just as soon as I can."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the 2nd book in the 'ever-so-cool' Harry Potter series. I think I enjoyed this book most of all. It's sort of got some 'horror' story attributes and is one of those read-it-through books 'cuz the story never slows down. It has some things in it that if you'd stop and analyze them you'd start having nightmares. I really enjoyed this book and I think it might be my favorite Harry Potter book of the first 3. J.K.

I recommend this to everyone!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry's story goes on with another year at Hogwart's, and the magic too continues in this fantastic sequel.You don't need to be under the age of 13 to appreciate these books. They are incredibly fun to read. If you've been tempted but passed over these &quot;children's books,&quot; I urge you to be brave and pick up a copy. Read it in secret if you have to. You won't regret it. There's a good reason this series is so popular!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter picks up steam with the second volume in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. The number of characters increase with the delightful addition of Ginny Weasly, Dobby, and Gildefroy Lockhart (not always a successful creation) and the elements of mystery have also increased noticeably over the first Harry Potter adventure. The volume becomes more of an actual series with this story as all the elements build to a climax that leaves much to be explored in the future volumes. The excitement and inventiveness of the series deserve their praise and popularity and this is the volume that kicks the experience into high gear."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There are few books in this world which can really grab you and make it so you don't want to stop reading. While there is a lot of value in slower study, it is necessary for an avid reader to take these pleasure trips. Rowling is very talented in keeping one intrigued and pleased by the story.Of course this book takes us through Harry's second year at Hogwarts which begins with a crash landing in a charmed Muggle car with his buddy Ron, which interestingly saves their lives later on. The Slytherin Quidditch team has got newer and faster brooms and are a real threat this year, but Harry's skill proves to be too much. However Slytherin is in full power in other ways. Muggle Born wizards and witches being petrified all over the place. This leads Harry and his friends through a mass of riddles to find the truth, eventually finding some interesting new information about Lord Voldemort.My greatest impression with this book is similar to the first. I couldn't figure it out. The villain was almost undetectable and I was persuaded several times to change my mind about who the real pureblood heir to Slytherin (the one who was responsible for releasing the beast who was doing the petrifying) was. The ending was unique and though I preferred the ending to the first book this was fascinating as well."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The 2nd year of Harry Potter at Hogwarts sees more adventures. The second of the Harry Potter scintillates readers with musch twist-and-turns and surprises. It is more or less a detective plot in the wizardry world. Piece by piece, Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger probed identity of the Heir of Slytherin through traces of evidence. Who launched the spree of Muggle-born attacks? Who turned the Hogwarts students into stone? What kind of monster stands behind the Chambers of Secrets? Who kept the Very Secret Diary and how did it end up in Hogwarts? The three friends unveiled, little bit little, the mystery of the Chamber and trapped into unprecedent danger. The element of suspense makes story interesting to follow. Dobby, the impish Malfoy family house-elf, warned Harry not to go back to Hogwarts at the beginning makes it very difficult for me to put the book down! I rate this second of the series 4.5 stars. Another good read."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. Rowling's has done it again with her second book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets has Harry going back to Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry for his second year, and there is no telling what will happen. With strange phenomena happening all around the school and people turning into statues, Harry, along with his friends, Ron and Hermione, are caught in the middle trying to find out who is causing the madness. When Harry is caught snooping around, he is immediately one of the suspects in the bizarre happenings at Hogwarts. All the students at Hogwarts are having a hard time believing Harry is innocent, including his friends. Even his rival, Draco Malfoy, is there to taunt and criticize Harry at every turn. When Harry finds a strange opening leading to a dark tunnel, he has to make a tough decision on what to do, go in, or run away. Does this dark tunnel hold the answers to the mystery, or is it just a dead end? Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is filled with danger, action, and of course the humor that only Ron, Hermione, and Harry can create. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a terrific book for all ages, and it is a must read if you have read the first Harry Potter book. FIVE STARS"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read enough books in my life. But I can honestly say that I've never skipped any sleep for any other book before I started reading these books. I could not put them down, not just a first one - all four of them. I finished reading them (all four) in less then a week. Each one seems to be better then the one before.For anyone with a slight imagination these books are the most enjoyable reading. They have everything the reader can look for in a story. And most importantly, pages are not felled with unnecessary details like most adult books I've read. Non-stop adventure.Only disappointment I felt was when I finished the fourth book and realized that next one was not published yet.Two very enthusiastic thumbs up to Mrs. Rowling for writing the most creative book I've ever read in my life.And as for those criticizing these books: ...

The book also does a fine job of continuing our own wizard education, expanding on subjects we already know about, such as the game of quiddich, as well as introducing us to new terms, such as herbology, the study of magical herbs and roots. The book also introduces us to many new characters, such as the pompus new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Gilderoy Lockart. Best of all, as \\"The Socerer's Stone\\" did so well, \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" keeps us guessing until the end, trying to put the clues together to unveil the new villian.

K. Rowling still exhibits a lack of literary style. Her story is engrossing. It draws you in and wraps around your mind as easily as her latest creature wraps snugly 'round the Slytherin Heir. Fortunately, her style will obviously become more developed with the next few installments, as it has improved a bit with this one.The addition of some supporting characters was lovely. I particularly loved poor, sweet, tragic Dobby. He was an unintentionally treacherous delight.I was delighted with the subtle clues laid throughout this work, the overall dark feeling of danger invoked by the power of her words, the red herrings, and the implications of things to come.

Out of nowhere, a very worried, interfering house elf named Dobby appears in Harry's room to warn him against returning to Hogwarts. Dobby is desperate to convince Harry that his life will be in danger if he should return to school -so desperate that he gets Harry in a whole lot of trouble with his aunt and uncle, making life at the Dursleys' truly unbearable. But some evil is indeed lurking at the school. Students are being petrified -frozen stiff like statues. And a warning that \\"The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir Beware.\\" is found scrawled on a wall. But what can it mean? The Chamber of Secrets is an old legend. And who is the Heir? Harry, Ron, and Hermione set out to solve the mystery amid increasing paranoia and suspicion in their classmates.\\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\" is the best of the 5 books thus far in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. They're all page-turners, but \\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\" is particularly well-constructed and perfectly paced. It builds steadily to a climax that 's a little more interesting than the other books. As always, Harry discovers a few more pieces to the puzzle of his past. At this point, the reader is as anxious to understand his family and their nemesis, the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, as Harry is. J.K. Rowling understands the appeal of ongoing mystery and the expectation of payoff. So she gives her readers both in each book. \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" is particularly satisfying.The Leather Collector's Edition (ISBN 0439203538): The \\"Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets\\" Collector's Edition is bound in red textured leather with gold lettering and design embossed on the cover and spine, and matching gold design on the back. A 3 3/4\\" x 2 3/4\\" print of artist Mary GrandPr&eacute;'s color artwork of Harry being lifted by Fawkes that illustrates the cover of the American hardback and paperback editions is mounted in the center of the book's front cover. The pages are off-white 70 pound acid-free paper with gilt edges. A plastic book jacket that identifies the book as a Collector's Edition is provided for protection. It's more flexible but not as crystal clear as the one for \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\". Also included is an 8 3/4\\" x 5 3/4\\" print of the cover artwork by Mary GrandPr&eacute; that is suitable for framing. The print is loosely adhered inside the back cover so it won't fall out."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This was probably my favorite of the Harry Potter books so far. The Plot was very creative and it was fun to see how it all turned out. Every time I thought I knew what was going on, I was supprised to find out that I was competely wrong. I definitely enjoyed seing Ron and Harry turn into our infasmous sub-rivals, Crabbe and Goyle. I definitely didn't expect to find Jenny behind all the writings on the wall and to find out that Tom Riddle turns out to be Voldermort. I mean, come on like anyone saw that coming.

It is fun to read about the day to day magic that happens in a wizard family's life. Getting a glimpse into the Weasley's home is great fun. I enjoyed Mr. Weasley's fastination with everything Muggle.We also learn a little more about 'He Who Must Not Be Named' and his quest to get back into power.

We have read all of Dahl's books at least twice and are delighted to find another author whose child characters are the heroes. We read The Sorcerer's Stone within a few days after Christmas, and have read Chamber of Secrets quicker. Couldn't put either one of them down!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Having read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I dove into Book 2, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, anxious to see where J. K. Rowling was going to take the story. I also wanted to see if my criticisms of the first book would stand up or get flattened as the story progressed.Well, as for the story line, it really wasn't a whole lot different from the first book. First, a mystery is introduced: the Chamber of Secrets has been opened by the mysterious Heir of Slytherin and whatever was locked in the Chamber has been attacking, but not killing, certain students who are not of pure magical blood. Harry and his friends sleuth around to figure out the mystery, breaking a myriad of school rules in the process and nearly (of course) getting expelled. When Hermione is attacked, Hogwarts is on the point of shutting down for good. It's up to Harry, Ron, and the famous but useless Professor Gilderoy Lockhart to discover where the Chamber of Secrets is located and defeat the evil that lurks within.I have to say I enjoyed reading this installment in the series quite a bit less than the previous book. The character of the self-promoting Gilderoy Lockhart was too overdone to be funny--like a Monty Python skit that is shown over and over again until all the humor is thoroughly beaten out of it. Also in this category was the scene with Ron vomiting up slugs. Several pages of such imagery is more than enough for even the most scatologically-inclined juvenile reader.On the other hand, I did like the character of Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister. In fact, I think that a lot of homeschool families would find the Weasleys very sympathetic. They've got seven kids--six boys and a girl. They're poor, so they're forced to make due with hand-me-down robes and second-hand wands. And they're ridiculed by their social \\"betters\\" for their financial straits. The fact that Ron and his brothers are quick to resort to fisticuffs rather than hear their family demeaned may also resonate with some.One thing that particularly irritated me about The Chamber of Secrets was the surreptitious planting of some alternate history. \\"Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the time,\\" the ghost of Professor Binns lectures. \\"They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and wizards suffered much persecution\\" (pg. 150). I realize that this is a fictional book, but I've heard similar claims of the supposed persecution of magic in the Middle Ages bandied about seriously by certain historically-challenged individuals. For the record, magic/sorcery has been a abhorred and its practitioners liable to capital punishment since ancient times. The Egyptians, Babylonians, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, and others condemned it in their laws in no uncertain terms. Even among the Eastern Woodland Native American tribes, sorcerers were liable to be killed for any reason and no reason, with the killer suffering no punishment. To pretend that this attitude arose only during the Middle Ages (cue scary organ music) is complete poppycock.The Chamber of Secrets also elaborates upon the differences between the magically inclined and those poor benighted creatures known as Muggles--that is, anyone who is \\"normal\\" and non-magical. In Rowling's world, there are those among the magical who despise the \\"Mudbloods\\"--anyone who is magical but from a Muggle family--and those good magic-users who are tolerant of Muggles, no matter how awful and nasty they may be. There seems to be an obvious intent on Rowling's part to make this a lesson in tolerance somehow, but it seems peculiarly elitist to me. Even the magical beings who tolerate the Muggles still, for them most part, look down on them as curious and generally pathetic creatures in need of study. One could easily imagine a book of poetry in the Hogwart's library containing \\"The Magical Man's Burden.\\" I'm curious to see where this tangent ends up in the future books.The climax of the book was also subpar. The horrible creature in the Chamber of Secrets is fairly inept. It kills no one (and the reasons given for this are ludicrous) and is eventually destroyed almost by accident. Though Harry is the hero, he seems to survive his deadly encounters almost completely by luck and the intervention of an \\"eye-in-the-sky\\"--all of which makes you wonder why the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" didn't just deal with the problem in the first place.I've heard it said that Chamber of Secrets is the weakest of the Potter books. Having read only the previous one, I can't comment on that, yet. However, it was certainly weaker than Sorcerer's Stone. The book also did little to quell my criticisms of the original book. Indeed, it enhanced them and added a few new ones. We'll see where all this leads in book three."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I won't bother going over the plot line of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Plenty of other reviewers here have done it already and I do not want to spoil it for anyone. Instead I will begin by saying that I did think this was a fairly decent book, but had two problems that did not sit well with me.First:The author spends a lot of time in the story regurgitating information about the first book. Personally, this is a trait that I find annoying in any series story. I do not feel that the author should cater to those who do not want to put in the time/effort to read the first book in the series. When an author feels the need to spend time bringing some of the readers up to date on what they should already know it gives the story a feeling of &quot;marking time&quot; for those of us who have read the first book already, which just yanks a reader right out of the fantasy world and ruins the atmosphere that has been created.My second problem with this book is that it simply was not as well written as the first book. It wasn't bad. I just felt that in some places the author got a little lazy about creating the detailed fantasy world that she managed so beautifully in the first book. Having read the first book and knowing what the author is capable of, I found this rather disappointing."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"3 1/2 stars would probably be more accurate, but 4 is what it gets. I'll dispense with plot description, as I'm sure it's covered in at least a hundred other reviews, and limit myself to comments. First, where does this book stand in the series? It reads like an expository work, with a great deal of explanatory information. However, Rowling already did that in the first book, and more explicitly. Nor does it make a dweeper sweep into the plot, especially compared to the next two books. So, it's a misfit, and a book that reads almost as though it's just meant to get you through to the next year and book. Second, the characters introduced aren't particularly interesting or imaginative. Halfway through the book, I was ready to grab a black marker and destroy all of Lockhart's appearances, I was so aggravated. Dobby's character was only slightly less annoying to me. I presumed those mannerisms were given for comic relief, but they failed in my eyes. Okay, that's enough of why I disliked the book. Now for why you should read it. First, it's entertaining. Not as much as the others, in my eyes, but still an enjoyable way to spend a few hours. Second, it's part of the series. I know what this implies, that it wouldn't be as good a book on its own, but that's what I mean. As I said earlier, it contains key plot information, and, well, it's Harry Potter, the new Narnia chronicles, absent Lewis's religious piety."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Who in the English-reading world hasn't heard of Harry Potter by now? No need to recap the plotline details here. Harry is a great kid, just the sort of vulnerable, yet feisty hero that MOST parents would like to think their son is. He's an appealing character for adults and kids alike.I have read that these books are the most-banned in the US for the past year. That would be the doing of all those weird fundamentalist types who seem to think reading Hemingway turns you into a suicidal fisherman, or Pride and Prejudice encourages girls to elope with unsuitable army officers.The lovely thing about the books is that despite all the hype accompanying the publication of the 4th HP book, it was bubbling along by the best possible method: word of mouth amongst kids themselves.Harry and his friends Hermione and Ron are terrific creations, and will remain children's classics - deservedly so. They're terrific books to read along with the kids. I believe young people still enjoy their parents or other adults reading aloud with them even at the age where they could read these independently (the target age group is about 9 to 12). Any parent or other grown up who does so will laugh along and be as enchanted as the kids are!There is the much-loved English boarding school tradition, with the added magic and mayhem. Secret passages abound, and there are feasts and games (Quidditch is a marvellous invention!) Wouldn't you just love to be present sat one of the magical feasts and to snuggle up afterwards in a comfy 4-poster bed! No starvation rations and cold, comfortless dorms at this school!This book continues the the fun and mayhem begun in Book 1. It is longer than the first book, and by now, the reader is hooked and hungering more. This is a feature of each subsequent book - each longer than its predecessor. By the end of the book you are however, thirsting for more!In Book 2 there is an accretion of magical skills known to the youngsters, and more spells, potions, and paraphenalia available to them. Consequently, the evil is stronger too. It becomes more malevolent as the kids age and themselves become more powerful.I did find the character of Moaning Myrtle (the ghost living in a toilet) a bit of a pain after a while, though, like all other elements, she is integral to the plot.I finished Book 2 and immediately went out for Book 3."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"There is a scene in this book where Ron Weasley explained to Harry how some books could be dangerous. \\"Come off it, how could it be dangerous?\\" said Harry. To which Ron replied; \\"You'd be surprised...some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed.\\"Well, I must say that I think Ms. J. K. Rowling has casted a few spells of her own on these books. I honestly found myself up at 4:30am with about 100 pages to go trying to decided whether I should call it a night (morning) and finish the book the next day, or continue reading and worry about sleep some other time. And yes, I did prepare a few meals \\"one-handed\\" while I read.I'm going to try to force myself to take a break before I begin book three only because I need to pace myself. I don't want to finish books 3 and 4 and then have a terribly long wait for book 5 and beyond (fingers crossed that there will be more books to come).If anyone is having a difficult time trying to decided whether they should try these books, take it from this 26 year old \\"kid\\", they are well worth it. As for the \\"old witch in Bath\\", she must have been reading the Harry Potter books as well. :-)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read this book for the first time, I thought it was great. And the second time. But by the third time, it'd palled a little. The thing is, books 3 and 4 have so many revelations about various people's pasts, presents and futures that you can read and reread them loads of times, but book 2 doesn't have half as many. Also it doesn't have many new characters - Lockhart is ok but he gets tiresome, and the others - Ginny, Aragog, Tom Riddle etc - just don't have as much depth and interest as those in the next 2 books, Sirius and Moody, for instance. It's still a good book, with some clever twists, but the best is yet to come..."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The Harry Potter series will be around for a long time. This second book continues the page-turning trend started in The Sorcerer's Stone.This second book continues the developement of the mysterious Harry Potter.

Dobby informs Harry that he is in grave danger, and he should not return for his second year at the wizardry school named Hogwarts. From here, the story takes many twists and turns, and it always seems as if the odds are constantly stacked against Harry.The Chamber of Secrets has been opened for the first time in fifty years. The last time it was opened, a young girl was murdered at the school. Now, another creature is wandering the halls of the school, turning the students into stone. By the time the book is reaching its climax, nearly everyone is a suspect, making for an amazingly interesting plot.All of Harry's old friends and, of course, his enemies are back for the second year at the school. The storyline is outright amazing, loaded with lots of mystery and suspense. Once again, J.K.

In this book, Harry Potter goes to Hogwarts for his third year. Harry Potter goes through lots of horror and happiness at Hogwarts. At the end, he goes home safely.I like reading this book. I liked the book, because it makes me feel that i'm a Hogwarts student, too. I imagine myself following Harry and his friends(Ron and Hermione)to a place. \\"Harry reached the door at the top of the stairs, slipped through it, and found himself behind the counter of Honeydukes-he ducked, crept sideways, and then straightened up.\\" Honeydukes was a place Harry couldn't go. So I imagined myself going in there and eating all those candies.Another thing I like about Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is the action. There is lots of magic in this book. \\"A giant spider, six feet tall and covered with hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menacingly. For a moment, Harry thought Ron had frozen. Then-\\"Ridikulus!\\" bellowed Ron, and the spider's legs vanished.\\" I like it when lots of action goes on in this book. It makes me want to do some magic!My favorite part of the book is when Professor Lupin taught the students what the boggart can do. A boggart is a shape-shifter. It can turn in to whatever that can scare someone. Professor Lupin let the students do the magic, and I got to see who is scared of what. Harry never got the chance to do it.

Wondering what I would have done."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"With all respect the book had a wonderfull theme and great characthers, but poor illustration and a writing for childrens of 8 years; it surely was not boring but it was poor on details and a very rudde writing, but anyway i enjoy the book.Sergio Arguello."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"It had to be five stars...because how else can you rate a book (or the whole series) when you can't seem to stop reading, from the moment the book starts until the last page...After finishing (in one sitting) the first book in the Harry Potter series, I ran out to buy number two, which I also read as quick as possible. The characters that I came to know &amp; like in the first book were all there (Harry, Hagrid, Hermione &amp; Ron), the humour was there, &amp; of course the mystery was there...culminating in an interesting &amp; unexpected ending. If I absolutely HAD to look for a flaw in book number two, the only thing I'd say is that it's not that different from book 1. And therefore it doesn't take you so much by surprise as the first one does. The third book in the series (The prisoner of Azkaban) is, I believe, much better than the first 2 books. But anyway: these are all details: the point is that the Harry Potter books are clear, pure fun &amp; even if one is a little better or a little worse than the other, all in all, the four books (up till now) are all very worth reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"After watching the movie and reading the first book, I borrowed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets from a friend of mine. In this book, Harry Potter is now at his 2nd year of Hogwarts. However, just before leaving, he receives a mysterious visitor that warns him trouble will strike if he returns. Horror begins to brew in Hogwarts when the writing on the wall was revealed. &quot;THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN OPENED, ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE.&quot; The mystery gets deeper and deeper as you read the book and I found myself trying to find out whom was behind it all and how and why it happened. Comparison with the first book, The Chamber of Secrets is far more captivating with its plot. There are more characters, more drama and therefore, more complicating. It's hard to even try to guess who's behind everything as the mystery unfolds. As always, I couldn't much predict anything (Heck, I even thought it was Percy the Prefect at one point) but J.K. Rowling, a complete genius, turns up an absolutely brilliant ending that probably NO ONE would have EVER guessed. Kids, however might find the ending a bit confusing but it shouldn't be a problem for most readers. All in all, this is a wonderful book and I found myself reading it 4 hours straight, without putting it down at all."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I read this book and I thought it was great!!!!! JK Rowling is a great author. She describes things so well that you feel you are actually in the book. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE was a good book. It was filled with interesting characters, a fantastical setting, and some great dialog. However, much of the book was setting up the world in which Harry was entering. We, like Harry, had to have everything explained to us. This isn't a bad thing, but a lot of character development was delayed, because of the explanations.In CHAMBER OF SECRETS, J.K. Rowling doesn't have to do tons of explaining. The readers are already familiar with Diagon Alley, sorting, owl mail, and daily life at Hogwarts. This allows for more in-depth characterization and more intriguing story-telling.CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a fascinating and exciting book. Rowling continues just a couple months where THE SORCERER'S STONE left off. Harry is back living with the Dursleys and is miserable as ever. He hasn't heard from Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger all summer. Then one night, Harry has a surprise visitor and Harry's life turns from boredom to excitement. What awaits Harry and his friends at their second year at Hogwarts blows their first year adventures out of the water: flying cars; a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who has an ego problem; a deathday party; and a sinister creature who petrifies cats, people, and even ghosts.CHAMBER OF SECRETS is riveting. However, it is also slightly darker than THE SORCERER'S STONE. No one knows for sure what Rowling is up to, but like all great stories, you can't wait to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets was my favorite book because It had a lot of adventurous, magical moments.

If you hate it then I don't know what to say except that we all have our own opinions (Okay, that sounded really cheesy but it was the only thing I could think of.). Overall, it is a pretty AWESOME book. Oh, and to all you people that say that it is too violent, then you have probably have never read any of the Maximum Ride books. They are really good, but they make the Harry Potter books seem like books on how to plant flowers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is truly the best book I have ever read.

Rowling1999The plot is better than the first book's. The characters remain entertaining -- there's less world-creation, so more time can be dedicated to the main content of the story.And again, just as with the first, it's not a bad book. It doesn't \\"feel\\" juvenile, at all -- it has good characters and a well-thought out plotline.More of Harry's fears are explored -- and answered -- in this volume, as mysterious \\"petrification spells\\" roam around Hogwarts. As students are found frozen, some feared to be dead, naturally it will be Harry Potter who finds the root of the issues and saves the day.The rest of the old familiar faces are back, too, but though the spiraling new plot, there's no development of characters. Even after a year, none of them have changed, except perhaps for Harry who grows more ponderous. Old characters have new antics, yes, and new characters have new antics, but there's no more depth to them than in \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\". A pity, this...All in all, it's a fair successor to the first, which enriches the Magic World and explains more their dealings with the Muggle, human world.6.8/10"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the second book in the Harry Potter series. My daughter decided to collect all seven books in hardcover, so I purchased it for her for Christmas. She is obsessed with Harry Potter and is rereading all seven books. If your child or if you are a Harry Potter fan, you will have to buy this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"i loved this book. personally, it is my favorite of the series. my own copy will need the cover superglued back on pretty soon from so much rereading.i like the whole series a lot (Prisoner of Azkaban is also a fave) but i will not adress the book itself much here.i am 13 year old girl and i own the whole Harry series. i have a few things to say to the people who think harry is evil, teaches witchcraft and yada-yada-yada. for one, WHAT are you people so afraid of??!!!! magic isn't real, so how can a book teach magic(i hate when people put a 'k' on the word magic.....)?? for two, fantasy books are COOL. they are fun to imagine. i hate reading reality things because they are too ORDINARY. people read to ESCAPE from the ordinary and J.K Rowling's books allow you to do that, to be absorbed in the world she has created. on a totally side point, why give J. K. Rowling all the greif? i mean, if you wanted to stop kids from reading about magic, you'd have to wipe out more than half the books in the world. J. R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings also is a very magic oreiented series(i also read that series) and i don't see anyone complaining about that series.on a more personal level, i first heard Harry Potter in 5th grade. my english teacher read it aloud. everyone loved it. but, she had hardly got past the second chapter, when disaster struck. some girl with an overprotective mother told her mom she wanted this book for her birthday. her mother read it and the whole thing blew up. Harry Potter was banned from being read aloud in school the next day. face it people, kids are rebelious. the next week the effects were showing. when the classes were told to bring in books to read in class, at least five kids in every 4th grade and up class had a Harry book. including teachers. my 5th grade teacher BORROWED the fourth book from a student(her favorite char in the series was Professor Lupin)!so, you magic-hating-witchcraft-is-evil people out there...GET USED TO IT!!!!!!HARRY IS HERE AND WILL BE FOR AWHILE!!!!!!!!!who knows? the Lord of the RIngs series is over 20 years old and people still read it. maybe harry will be here for that long (hehehe...).to Harry fans out there: keep reading and never poke a sleeping dragon in the eye.To LOTR(lord of the rings) fans: keep reading and beware of the Enemy and of Mordor"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I have to say that it was slower than the first one. It took me a little longer to read it and it took me longer to get into it.But, by the end of the book, I was engrossed and I really enjoyed the ending.My one strong opinion - make sure you read these books in order. I would have been pretty lost if I had not read Book 1 first."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter books are great. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is one of the best. This book takes place during Harry's second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This book is sort of a mystery, and it is very interesting to read. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is even better then Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, which means it is Really, REALLY good. Harry Potter books are for all ages, not just kids. I totally highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the 2nd book in the Harry Potter series and I finished it almost in one day. Just to mention how good it was. To the people who have read the first book, either you like it or you hate it. But those who liked it will most certainly read all parts of the series.This time Harry goes back to Hogwards School of witchcraft and faces the secret of the Chamber of Secrets and what's in it. The book is totally written in the same style as the first book. You will learn more about the Wizards and Witches and the history of Howards School. I'm looking forward to the movie. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"For the longest time, I made fun and dismissed Harry Potter as a kid's fad that could not even come close to providing one second of entertainment. Someone lent me the Harry Potter DVD, and I must admit I was impressed, so I decided to pick up this book. After reading it, I must say it's not that bad after all.I can see why Harry Potter series is as popular as it is. It's an imaginative tale of magic and fun, throw in a magic school, interesting teachers, monsters, ghosts, and good old school yard camaraderie and rivalries, and anyone can see the appeal. I wish these books were released ten years earlier so I would have enjoyed it more.Harry Potter continues another school year with the same gang of characters, except right before school, he receives a hilarious but ominous warning about dyeing this year. What turns out is that a monster is loose at Hogwarts, causing havoc and fear for all. Harry and his friends must solve the mystery of the monster, who let the monster out, and how to stop it.I wish there were more dialogue and more action, as description after description could get tedious sometimes, especially for the young. However, it is still a good book, and I might continue reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I have read the whole of the Harry Potter trilogy(well, that of what exists so far.) I can honestly say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets AND Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire were my favourite books of all four. In this book, once again, Rowling amazes us with all the secrets of the wizarding world, through Harry's eyes, and makes us feel as if we are there as well. Anyone who has NOT read this book, should definitely get a hold of it for the summer (ALL FOUR OF THEM!) and I can ASSURE you, you will not be able to put it down, knowing that the next page will be just as good as the last!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I started reading the Harry Potter series with my 8-year nephew...and I have to say I am hooked. The second book in the series is just as good as the first. HP AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS lives up to the high standards set by the first book. JK Rowling does a great job of keeping the reader (no matter what age) excited about the book - constantly wondering what is going to happen next.Harry and his friends - Hermoine and Ron - are once again put in the middle of a mystery at Hogswort. The book begins with an elf-like creature warning Harry not to go back to school...there is danger. Harry does not believe the creature and decides to go back, after all danger at school is better than living with the Dursleys! Once at school, strange things start to occur. As the mystery unravels, secrets and questions left unanswered from the first book are revealed.I highly recommend this book to everyone - it is well written and keeps the attention of all readers. I can't wait to start the 3rd book in the series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a good book that is funier than book 1 but the first is still better.It begins when Harry goes up to his room and finds a house elf named Dobby. Dobby tells him he is in great danger and if he goes back to Hogwarts, terrible things will happen. Dobby has taken Harry's letters from his friends and tells him he will only get them if he promises not to go back to Hogwarts, but Harry refuses, so Dobby put a Hover Charm on Aunt Petunia's large ice cream and pudding mountain.Harry is locked up in his room, but the Weaslys come to rescue him and bring him to their house. When they get to Platform 9 and 3 quarters, the entrance to get onto the train is sealed. Harry and Ron use Mr. Weasly's flying car to get to Hogwarts. They land on the Whomping Willow, a tree that attacks, and get in big trouble.Soon, bad things are happening at Hogwarts, just like Dobby said. People are being petrified and strange writing appears on the wall about the Chamber of Secrets. Everyone knows it's the Slytherin's Heir that's doing it, but everyone (except his friends) think it's Harry! There's only one way to prove it's Malfoy, and Hermione, Ron, and Harry make the Polyjuice Potion to become Crabbe and Goyle (but Hermione turns into something else....). They ask Malfoy, and he says he's not, but he wants to know who he is to cheer him on.When Harry and Ron enter the Chamber, they find out a lot.But I'm not going to spoil it!This is a good book and you should get it (as long as you've read the first, you could read this one last if you wanted)"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"J.K. rowling's second book in the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter And The Chamber of secrets, once again takes the reader back into the world of witchs and wizards.

People are being Petrified, into a statue like state. Harry is on a mission along with his two friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to solve who is behind all this dark magic.I enjoyed this book a great deal and so did my two children ages 8 and 11.

I'm now reading them aloud to my 4 1/2 year old, who of couse doesn't get it all, but loves them anyway.Trust me, these books are absolutely fantastic!

I'm 8 years old, and even though Harry Potter is older than me, I can relate to him. I think that in this book the author did a great job on the details and how all the clues tied together in the end. I'm glad that even though in the first book Harry wasn't friends with Hermione the whole time, he is in this one. I like this book because it is fiction, and when I read a book like this it takes me out of the real world with all its confusion. I wish I could be in Harry Potter's world!

I won't tell you anything more, but: the ending is VERY exciting and thrilling and scary and great...!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets blends fantasy, mystery, and suspense in a way that presides over even the first book, Harry Potter and The Sorcerers Stone. Harry Potter is now to be a second year, but a nervous house Elf tells him to stay or terrible things will happen, and in an awful twist of fate, Harry is locked in his room by his heartless uncle Vernon. Yet, as always, he reins victorious when rescued by the Weasley brothers in, of course, a flying car. Yet terrible things do start to happen, for the legendary monster of Salazar Slitherin is released from the Chamber Of Secrets, and the liberator is suspected to be none other than Harry Potter. Read this book and you'll leara few things about Harry you never knew and at the same time meet up with a very old, and unwelcomed friend. Also read the other two Potter books, wich in my opinion are some of the best books there are. I'm also excited about the next book, Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament, wich is coming out in June (or is it July?)

It has a deep intricate mystery that will leave you guessing until the end unlike the other books which are still good but kind of predictable. It kept me so interested that I was up in the middle of the night reading it, I read it in less than three hours. I love it so much that I have read it 11 times since December 26. J.K.

I could not put the book down. When I went home I walked inside, and I started to read my Harry Potter and the \\"Chamber of Secrets,\\" till about 7:00 at night. That happened for about 2 days. You should read this book because it has great detailed charecters. I also liked this book because it is so much like real life. My favorite parts of the book is when Harry and his friends get into a problem. I like trying to figure out how to solve the problem. If you haven't read this book you should get it now!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"So far this is a great book. I haven't finished this book, but it is great. So far Harry has gone to Hogwarts school for Witchcraft and Wizardy, now for his second yeear. This time it's just a little different. Now the Chamber of Secrets has been opened somewhere in the school. The question is by who? What is attacking the kids? How do you stop the attacks? The only way to find out is to read the book.

This book blew me away. I felt like I was standing in Hogwarts, and it was wonderful. After reading Sorcerer's Stone, I was eager to get started on the sequel, yet doubted it could be any better than the first. Of course, I was very wrong. I finished this 341 page novel in nearly 21 hours. I began to read it directly after the purchase and was quite unhappy when I had to go to bed. The next morning, I read it over breakfast, at the bus stop, and on the bus. Sadly, I had to keep it in my locker during school, yet my mind kept straying from my lessons and focusing on the book in my backpack. I read it on the entire bus ride home and had my face buried in it while walking back home. I finished it at 5:00 that night. In my opinion, Rowling outdid herself in this book, nearly impossible, since she is such a terrific writer. The ending was loads more surprising than Sorcerer's Stone. If you've read it, you must agree. Though hard to believe, the Dursleys were even crueler than usual and Fred and George more prone to pranks. Ginny Weasley is properly introduced in this book, and she plays a significant role in the plot. Well, i know there is endless praise associated with this book, but I have a word limit, so I fear I must stop. Yet, I HIGHLY reccomend Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets if you have read Book 1. You'd be crazy not to."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Amazon says for readers up to 12 years of age. I am 16 and the Harry Potter series are by far my favorite books. Rowlings keep you in suspense through out all of Harry's ordeals.During the whole story, you feel for Harry. Your sad when he's with the Dursleys (his incredibly cruel adoptive parents), you're overjoyed when they escape detention, and you fear for him when he faces the evil that has been hurting the students at the school.I liked the book for it's new perspective on magic and people who can't perform magic. If you want to read another series in the same genre, check out the Chronicles of Narnia. Great books also.These books are great for all ages, little children will love the cool adventures as well as adults.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories that take you away from everything else. I also encourage Rowlings to keep writing. These books are spectacular."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"How could a reader not fall in love with Harry Potter?

Rowling keeps getting better and better as she writes. I only wish that Hogwarts would accept me for next years class!This series is destined to sit on the shelf along with other well read classics as The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, The Phantom Tollbooth and The Wizard of Oz.

I received the paperback collection of the first four books for last Christmas. I started with \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" which I finished. I moved on to \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" (which I must confess just finished reading), and last weekend I finished \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\". I recently began \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" but I haven't gotten far. Of all the books that I have finished reading, I have to admit that \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\" is probably my least favorite (if that is possible) book in the series. It is a very good book but it didn't captivate me like \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" did.In the sequel to \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\", Harry Potter is paid a visit by a house elf named Dobby. Dobby warns Harry to not to come back to Hogwarts. During this time, Dobby unintentionally gets Harry into a heap load of trouble with his relatives and finds himself banished to his room with only Hedwig as his companion. Thankfully the Weasley brothers rescues Harry and brings him back to their world of magic. It doesn't take Harry very long to find trouble. Students at Hogwarts are suddenly turning to stone by some magical being. Of course Harry and his friends immediately defies the rules set upon themselves to figure out who is turning their classmates into stone ala Scooby Doo. Despite that I prefer \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" over \\"The Chamber of Secrets\\", I still enjoyed this book. I am not into fantasy books for the most part but I really do like the Harry Potter books. I like how the books aren't geared for one particular age group. JK Rowlings has a wonderful imagination. Her colorful words really shows how imaginative she is as an author."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets deserves way beyond five stars. The second installment of Harry's life from Rowling is just as transforming as the last. Never have I read a book where I could not read it; where I missed my stop on the subway. Not once did I guess what was happening. I thought I had figured things out and than BAM! Rowling tricks us again with another twist.We meet Harry again in his house on Pivot Drive with his abonimble aunt, uncle and cousin. As wretched as they were the first time around, we feel for Harry more so because he has just spent two completely unheard of months with these people. This is when we meet Dobby, an engaging little house elf of the Malfoy's telling Harry not to come back to the school because of danger ahead.Harry does not heed to this warning and goes to the school. Harry finds out much more about himself, his friends, teachers and his peers. The language is descriptive, appropriate for the age the text was originally targeted towards with a hint of adult content.Rowling is imaginative and an author of perfection. I would rank her up with Roald Dahl."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was always skeptic of the Harry Potter series. I wasn't much of a reader either, but I have to say that reading the first two books really go me hooked. I read the first book after I saw the movie. Then I read the second book for school and that is when I got hooked on it. Something about reading these books really gets a person hooked. I remember I would stay up late just to read what would happen next and I never do that when I read a book. I have now moved onto the third and fourth book and I am looking forward to the release of the fifth book as well as the release of the third movie. I would strongly recommend reading any of the books. The good part is you don't have to read the first book to read the second book. Each book is a different story and she explains everything all over again in each of the books. Even if you don't like to read I would strongly recommend reading the book. You will find yourself unable to put it down and trying to read whenever you have a free moment. That is what happened with me and I never read for pleasure. I know that once a person reads the first two books they will want to read on in the series. She does a good job with detail and does a good job of \\"bringing you into the book.\\" Once again, I would recommend to all ages this book. This can not be classified under children, teens, or adults, because it is good reading for all ages."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is warned not to go to Hogwarts because terrible dangers await him there. When harry does not listen to this advice and returns to Hogwarts a series of attacks take place! And to make news even worse the Chamber of Secrets has been opened again. And because of a battle between Draco Malfoy and Harry at the dueling club shows Harry can speak to snakes; leaving the school to believe Harry is the one causing these terrible attacks. Since Salazar Slytherin the creator of the Chamber of Secrets spoke to snakes in the first place. Which makes some believe Harry is related to him in some way to continue what his long lost relative started. See how harry investigates Hogwarts to find out what and who is causing these terrible attacks, While still trying to prove his own innocence before the school is shut down. This book in my oppinion in my least favorite out of the series, but J.K. Rowling does a fabulous job at keeping you interested in every pages making you hang on to the last word."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter had finished his first year at Hogwarts. The second story began as the first. Harry was with the Dursley family. This time, however, it was only until Summer was over and the next school year began. While with the Dursleys, Harry received an unexpected visitor in his bedroom. It was Dobby, a \\"house elf\\" (think slave) of some wealthy family. Dobby begged Harry not to return to Hogwarts and gave many dire warnings. Failing that, Dobby took drastic measures. This time, however, Ron's little sister, named Ginny, was in her first year at the school. She had a crush on Harry since she met him.** The second book is just as fantastic as the first. I understand a movie based on this story is due for release around November 2002 in the States. If the movie follows the book, it will be a smashing success! Filled with suspense, good vs evil, and school rivalry, I foresee many awards for the book and movie alike!Extremely Recommended Reading! NOT just for the younger readers! **"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I have all four books by J.K. Rowling. Some people try and make these books out to be bad and not good for children. The books are fun to read and should be taken as fiction, which they are, and not a fact of life. Of the books I have read lately, this is the greatest and most interesting, best written and keeps your attention. For a good change of pace you can't find a better book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A year has passed, and Harry is on his way back to Hogwarts. But before he leaves, a mysterious creature arrives and warns him about dangers that will occur if he returns to Hogwarts, but Harry pays no attention to him and goes back to school. When he gets there, mysterious things begin to happen. Threatning messages start to appear, and one of them claims that the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" has been opened, but those who know about the Chamber don't believe it to be true. Now Harry and his friends must solve the mystery to the Chamber, because whatever has been released is turning Hogwarts students into stone statues, and Harry is hearing strange, bodyless voices. This book is darker than the first one, and it delves into Harry's and Voldemort's pasts. This is another winner written by Ms. J.K. Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A review by AndrewHarry, Hermione and Ron were trying to find out about the chamber of secrets all book and then they find that it has been opened. And the monster was out and petrifying all the muggle-born kids. Harry finds that he can sort of scar the snake away by yelling at it in passel mouth. Then all the kids think that he is the heir to Slytherin. This makes a lot of kids scared and mad.Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets is an exciting and fitting sequel to Book I. I think that J.K. did a great job of developing the plot and characters. If in Book 1 I felt Harry's emotions, here in Book 2 I ended up caring for Harry and his friends. I found some of the characters annoying and ridiculous (Lockhart & Dobby), they nevertheless paved the way to bring out Harry's best qualities. While Lockhart prided himself with his fame, charm and good looks, Harry has proven himself humble and not at all hungry for fame and publicity. Dobby, the house-elf who tried to keep Harry away from Hogwarts failed because of Harry's determination to go back, and was even more determined to stay upon learning of the threat against the lives of the Muggle-borns. The events that happened to Harry and his friends has proven once again that Harry is not just a wizard, but also a compassionate and self-sacrificing individual who will go to great lengths in saving another person's life. And although he was suspected to be the Heir of Slytherin because he is a 'passel tongue', it nevertheless showed that his inherent goodness has the power to outweigh whatever qualities Voldemort passed on to him on their first encounter where he ended up with the lightning scar.I recommend this book for all. I thought that this book was great, I enjoyed it greatly. I plan to read the rest, and others should too."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I started reading the first book (and...) only 5 days later (...) not only have I bought and read books 2-4, but I have also seen the movie. Nothing has ever hooked me like these books have and I bow down to Rowling for her superb imagination. The Chamber of Secrets was excellant, though not quite as good as the first."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The only things better than reading Harry Potter is listening to Jim Dale's narration, and the variety of voices that bring the story to life. You will not be dissappointed. My only caveat is that the tapes will probably wear out if you listen to it as often as my family does. Next time I'm going for the CD version."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good book and has a very good ending.Altough the beginning it is not that exciting and \\"dry\\". You have to be patient to read this book because you would never make it because you have to go through the boring part first. Other than the beginning it is really exciting. The ending is VERY good. It is definitly worth reading for the ending.I recommend this book to people who are patient and like mystery and adventure. J.K.

I completely reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you enjoyed the first book in the Harry Potter series, you definitely won't be disappointed with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second in the series. Harry Potter #2 is packed with adventure, magic, humor, and mystery, just like the first book, plus it also brings in some new characters and another mysterious plot that won't let you stop reading. Rowling does an excellent job of character developement and describing scenery with her broad vocabulary. You may find, that in many parts of the book, you don't realize you are even reading a book. You feel as if you are really at Hogwarts School. If you haven't read the first book, there are enough references that will still allow you to understand the storyline. When reading the book, you think that it is almost impossible for someone to have such a large imagination and to have written such a truly magical book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I loved this book also. I love all the Harry Potter books but this one was my second favortie. J.K. Rowling makes the book seem so real that it seems that you are actually in the book and you are one of the characters.

Although not quite as good as number three, which is the best, the Chamber of Secrets is right up there. J. K. Rowling wastes none of your time with a predicament within the first 15 pages. Poor Dobby, the house-elf, warns \\"Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts for his second year.\\" Thus starts the rollercoaster plot as we follow Harry through his tough second year. Along with Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley, Harry has to deal with the stuck up Defense Against the Dark Arts teach, Gilderoy Lockhart, an emotional ghost haunting the girls bathroom, and the unwanted affection of Ron's little sister, Ginny. Harry also struggles with Draco Malfoy, his enemy. Those problems are nothing compared to the misterious petrification of Hogwarts students. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened and all eyes are on Harry.Although the book was written for children, it suits readers of all ages.J.K. Rowling grabs your attention from the start and never loses it.

You don't have to take my word for it. Read it yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second, and in my opinion best, novel in the fantasy/fiction series of Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling, is Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. As you all probably know Harry Potter is a young boy with an extraordinary life, in the muggle world at least. Harry is a wizard, unlike his aunt and uncle with whom he lives. Harry has inherited his wizarding skills from his late parents who died at the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort. Harry grew up knowing very little about his parents or his magical past and how he had been named, \\"the downfall of Lord Voldemort.\\" During the first book Harry finds out he is a wizard, and is faced with battling the remains of Lord Voldemort.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets starts with Harry receiving a visit from a house elf warning him against going back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry ignores the warnings and after a few minor obstacles, he finds himself back at Hogwarts for yet another year.The school year seems to be going great, with the addition of a new defense against the dark arts teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. However, messages have started to appear written on the walls, walls in which Harry is hearing voices from. It seems that yet again the chamber of secrets has been opened, and by the heir of Slytherin. Even though Harry is a Gryffindor, students, and some teachers, suspect he is the culprit. If the messages on the walls aren't threatening enough the fact that students are being petrified surely is.Throughout all of the Harry Potter Books J.K. Rowling has created this wonderful fantasy world of wizardry, with the readers being able to really relate to the characters, and possibly learn from their struggles and triumphs. Not only does Rowling create such a positive and inspiring group of characters, but she does so in a way unlike many authors, that I can not even try to explain.So it seems Rowling has made Harry's second year at Hogwarts yet again difficult for him. From a deathday party, to a living diary, and a giant talking spider, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a very good read. Whether Harry is the true heir to Slytherin or not, I'm not going to say, so I recommend you go out and read it this book to find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I rate Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets four stars. The reason I didn't rate this book five stars is because I liked the first Harry Potter better. This book was written by J.K. Rowling. The book was about a boy named Harry Potter and his friends in their second year at Hogwarts. Doby (a house elf) tried to warn Harry not to go to Hogwarts, because Harry might have been in danger. Harry went to Hogwarts anyway, because he could not spend another day at the Dursleys (his aunt and uncle's house). At Hogwarts students were being petrified from a monster. Harry found out that he could speak parseltoungue, which means he could speak to snakes. When Hermione got petrified and Ron's sister got taken away by the monster, Harry is destined to find out where and what it is. To find out what happens next, read \\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!\\""},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In J.K Rowlings second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, she takes offright where she ended. Rowlings again mixes adventure, fantasy, and horror with Harryand his friends Hermonia and Ron. The problems pile up from the very beginning. Itstarts off with Harry's terrible birthday , in which he turns twelve. Again living with hisAunt and Uncle, he is mistreated only after they find out that he is not allowed to use hispowers while not at Hogwarts. With this he receives a warning not to return and is lockedup until school begins again in the fall. He is saved from imprisonment from thecupboard by his friend Ron and his brothers to live with them until their return toHogwarts in the fall for their second year.As in the first book Harry's life is again threatened. Of course Harry ignores thedanger and returns to school where students are being turned into statues. Harry is thenumber one suspect! Harry struggles with his conscience because he does not know if heis a good wizard or a dark wizard.Just like the first book, the Chamber of Secrets draws the reader into a magicalworld full of surprises and adventures. There are giant spiders, flying cars, and evilvillains lurking the campus. Three new characters, Professor Lockhart , Ginny Weasley,Ron's sister, and Colin Creevey, a \\"little first year\\", are introduced. They are not asinteresting characters as Hermonia and Ron, but they show once again the gradualmaturity that Harry is showing as he exposes Professor Lockhart as a liar, and phony,tolerates Ginny, and mentors the \\"little first year.\\"The ending is again predictable but exciting with a lesson. Harry takes on powersbigger and stronger than him, growing older and much wiser in the process. With theseencounters of knowledge he learns that problems do not always just disappear not evenfor wizards."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\" by J.K. Rowling is an excellent book that takes everyone who reads it on a magical journey full of excitment, fun, danger, and adventure. Rowling writes it for all audiences. Her writing style can be interpreted by children adn adults. The child audience will appreciate the amusing characters, and the fun plot. The adult audience will appreciate the unique writing style she uses throughout the book. Rowling is excellent at writing imagery and symbolism. She describes things in the way that children will understand, but adults won't get bored. The author has written a successful book using interesting imagery and symbolism to give the reader the best experience. The books literary devices create the interesting and somewhat odd world of Harry Potter and all his friends. Her use of imagery gives the reader a better understanding of Hogwarts and the entire wizarding world. Rowling also uses it to give the reader a sense of of how it really would be if there was a magical world inlike our own. Her use of symbolism is directed more towards the adults who read the book. Symbolism is harder for children to understand, yet they will not be missing anything from the book. Rowling knows how to write for children and for adults as well. One can see this in \\"The Chamber of Secrets.\\" She uses very descriptive words for children to grasp the novel even more. And she uses complex elements for adults to understand the unique form of the book. The book is a definite sucess for Rowling and the reader. The entire \\"Harry Potter\\" series will pull so may people towards reading, and it will touch their lives forever. Rowling has written a smash hit for all ages. Because of this books playful nature, and for its sophisticated sense of development, it will remain a classic for all time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I never really liked to read until I read the second book from the Harry Potter series in third grade. I read it in one day and it made me feel like I had a home at Hogwarts and a place on the Quidditch team. I met Hermione and Ron, Malfoy and Professor Snape. It opened me up to a world no other book could have. I could have never thought it up myself. But the movie made Hogwarts a lot less...well uglier than I ever imagined. Everything was dull and the sun always was shining. I interpreted (rather imagined) from the book that the castle was a glowing place on a big hill with a moat and everything. The sky was scarlet and you felt welcomed there. The Quidditch field, the lake. They were all there and the mountains surrounding Hogwarts. But Harry also found that he belonged there too. He got closer with his friends though danger was always near in this book. He proved to the whole school once more that Lord Voldemort (the bad guy) couldn't destroy the side of good. It's a wonderful novel and I think it is the best of all four."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I was hooked on the first book after a few pages. I just wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Now, I'm hooked again. J. K. Rowling takes us back to the wonderful world of Hogwarts (via a flying car) and allows us more adventure with young Mr. Potter. The imagination and creativity of the author are ever present and as addictive as the first book in this series. I have the feeling I'm gonna be a Harry Potter junkie. This book, as well as the first, if excellent reading for both children and adults---don't let anyone tell you otherwise! After establishing the story in the first book, Rowling can now plunge us into more storylines with action. If you enjoy top of the line entertainment, if you love to read, if you just enjoy having fun---this book is for you. Pick a comfortable seat and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"For so long I thought that Harry Potter books were just kids storys and never bothered to read them. My friends who did read them I thought were over exagerating. I only picked up this book when I had to have a British written book for a book report and figured I would give it a try with little hope. I was truely amazed and finnaly understood everyone who had been going on about \\"the famous, great\\" Harry Potter for so many years. This story holds so much imagination and creativity, with a plot I am clueless to how J. K. Rowling came up with, the book is beond words for me to describe, I think only she could do it. I never knew what was comming next and could not stop at the end of each chapter as they were great cliff hangers. I was astonished how it all comes together and fits so perfectly. Everyone, young or old should read this. A common question is weather this one can be read before the first one \\"The Saucerers Stone\\" and I say yes, I did and anything that is explained in the first one is easy to catch on in the second one. Read this to make your life complete!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Great Book, a Must Read.I have never read any Harry Potter books before. Frankly, I thought that they were stupid. I was wrong , I started reading this book and it was like what is going to happen next?

He does not like it there and wants to go back to Hogwarts School of Sorcery. But there is a great deal of throuble that will happen if he returns and a little creature trys to stop him from returning. Finally dobby (the house elf) gives young Harry Potter his mail and his friends come and get him. He lives with them for the rest of the summer and then returns to school. Or tries to get back to school anyway. As you read on in the book you will see. He arrives at Hogwarts and through out the year stange things start to happen and Harry Potter starts learning about the Chamber of Secrets. And trys to find out what is in it.

IT LED ME TO READ ALL THE OTHER BOOKS & NOW CURENTLY HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE IS THE LONGEST BOOK I EVER READ. I LOVED ALL 4 BOOKS!!!!!!!. It was also nice to see a bit of the magical world out-side of hogwarts and to get to know the weaslys a bit better. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of one problem with this series, the prevelent sexisim (the fact that even though the weaslys are poor Ms.Weasly dosn't work. Ginny is given the role of simpering little damzle in distress. Professor McGonagall nearly faints, for no reason, when Harry and his friends return from their adventure.) I hope books five through seven are much less sexsist. If they are then I will be able to enjoy them a hole lot better. I would also like to mention the amazing writing talent and imaganation of the book's Writer J.K.Rowling who's language and style take you into these books. When I finnished reading the first book I looked up and was nearly shocked that I was in my living room and not waiting in Kings Cross Train Station, I also got the same feeling from this book the first time I read it, when I had finished the first three books of this series, I decided to read them to my brother(who was nine at the time but has a learning disability and has trouble reading)who showed veary little interest in them until I started to read them to him, by the forth chapter of the first book, when we had finished the first book(with surprize ending which he hadn't gussed) he was that much more exsited to read the second book and the tables turned (while reading the first book I had to ask him to make time for reading, but durring the second and later the third book he was the one bugging me to read day and night). Sorry I sometime rant on and on and on...... Any how my other brother who has probaly never read an entire book in his life read through the Harry Potter series in just over a week, and convinced my mom that miricles really do happen. Probaly my favorite thing about the series and one of the things that make me want more and more is the surprise endings which convinced me that these books weren't talking down to teenagers, the plots are as thick and filling as any adult book I'v read and they deal with caracters that are my age instead of twenty and thirty and forty year olds."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"If you have children, I would force them to read it!

Supposedly she loaned it to my friend, who was halfway through by the time we were finished with dinner that night.

He was stuck up in his room whenhe meets a house elf named Dobby. Dobby warns him not to go back to Hogwarts because if he did, he would be in danger. Unlike the first book, this one doesn't take a long time for the story to get exciting. At the school, there was writing on the wall, saying about openening the Chamber of Secrets, and people were being Petrefied, or being turned into stone.In this story you will meet Ron's little sister Ginny, and how Harry was able to talk to the snake at the zoo in the first book. This is the best book I've ever read, and I think you would like to read it too. If you were a fan of Harry Potter and the Sourcerer's Stone, you will love this one."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read books by J.K.

For once, a sequel is actually better than the original. There was a lot more suspense, humor, and mystery involved. The Harry books are great for kids to read. I can't wait for the next book to come out next year. What I would really like to see is Tim Burton turn these books into his special animation movies (i.e. Nightmare Before Christmas). Only his unique vision and storytelling would give the perfect setting and feel of Hogsworth and the entire Harry Potter cast. If anyone knows Tim Burton (or you happen to read this) please let him know about these books and make him create a movie for them!!!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter is a fantasbulistick book. It feeds the brain scrumptious food that keeps it thinking about the supercalifragilistick story. Hermione, a muggle born witch with her mind set on &quot;A&quot;s in school, Draco Malfoy, an old wizarding family boy who loves tantering Harry, and Ron, a freckled faced wizard who helps Harry survive his years at Hogwarts School for Which Craft And Wizardry are their most scintillating friends and enemies.

This book really &quot;shines before it glows.&quot;"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is the best to me. I think this is the best book in the world, but that's my opinion. It is about Harry Potter. Mostly, I like chapter two. It is about this little creature that keeps on saying 'sir' at the end of sentences. The little creature is very wierd too. I think that he is an alien to me, and he is so wierd. There are other creatures too, and they have wierd names also."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book was obviously the best Book in the world. To better understand this book you might want to read the first book &quot;Harry Poter and the Sorcerors Stone&quot;. I think that this book is action packed as well as funny. I think that this book is just as good as the first one. I can't wait until they release the next book &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; this October. After that book they are going to release a Harry Potter book every year until they cover all of Harry's 7 years at Hogwarts. I hear that they are going to make a Harry Potter movie soon.

I had finished it within the same day however, and now must say that is the most original and captivating book that I have read in a long time. J.K Rowling's imaginative plot line made me feel as if I was part of the book. The characters are dynamic and the detail is extroidinary. I re-read it several times and each time I had completed it felt just as great. Chamber of Secrets is just as wonderful and I reccomend evreyone, young and old to read this wonderful series."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A thrilling sequeal to J.K.'s first novel, Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone.

I quickly finished the book and gave it to my dad to read. He has only read three chapters and is already as enchanted as I was. My entire 4th grade class at school has been in love with the book since my teacher brought it to school the day she got it knowing before she read it that it was going be just as good as the last.

I went out and bought this (the 2nd) book and it was greatness all over again. The characters are unbelievable! The magic and wonders of Hogwarts School and everybody in it (especially Harry) is fabulous reading for the whole family."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is a wonderful book. It is about Harry Potter going into his 3rd year of wizard shcool. He is in danger from running from the man that helped kill his parents. It had a lot of excitement and comedy in it. It draws you into it making you want to read more and more not wanting to put it down. Harry also finds the truth in really helped kill his parents and set a man out of prison who was wrongly accussed. I would recomend this book to everyone. It is a book that everyone would like even if your not a big reader. I have also read the other books in this series and they are very good to!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The worst thing about this book is that it ends. I was so mad at myself for reading it in one sitting that I started reading it again (so far I've read it six times) until I can get the next book. The story here is flawless. Even better than the first book. Not only has Rowling written a great children's book but a great mystery. Just when you think you've figured it out, you're wrong and then you're wrong again and then finally you'll slap your head for not seeing the obvious.I also have to commend Rowling for her use of classical mythology. Parseltongue, a balisk, a phoenix! My god by the time this series is over I wouldn't be surprised if Lord Voldemort takes the form of a bull and carries away dear Hermoine!My best advice is if you haven't read this book yet buy the next two when you get this otherwise you'll die of frustration!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"But certainly an excellent story. I admit, I am not a great fan of fantasy/science fiction, but I just had to see what all the talk was about. Although at times the dialogue was a little grim for youngsters, I found myself enthralled with the characters and their adventures.If you have time for a quick read, I would certainly recommend this book, and all of the other Harry Potter stories."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I'm thirty years old, and I love Harry Potter! If you are the type of person who still enjoys a rousing adventure (why are adventures always 'rousing'?), an enticing mystery, or a thrilling fantasy, try this book. Don't be afraid to stop being an adult and for just a little while, let the enchanting J.K. Rowling bring you back to a time when school was both a haven of friendship and pit of dispair. She remembers what it was like to be a kid and she gets it right.The characters in her books are not perfect. They make mistakes and sometimes they can be petty. On the other hand, there is such a feeling of veracity that you get swept up into the story. The Chamber of Secrets is not quite as exciting as The Sorceror's Stone. At least not at the beginning. After a promising beginning, the middle tends to drag, but near the end, be prepared for a roller coaster ride!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a marvelous book indeed! In Harry's second year at Hogwarts, trouble is brewing. Harry is sent a warning not to go back to Hogwarts or disaster will strike. Ignoring the warning, Harry goes back to Hogwarts, and disaster does strike. For, in the middle of the year, Hogwarts' students are being turned into stone. Could it be Hagrid? Who's past from being at Hogwarts and getting expelled has always been unusually strange? Could it Be Draco Malfoy? A more dangerous rival than ever? Or could it be who most everyone suspects, Harry Potter himself? Find out in, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I am a 25 year old college graduate studying to become a teacher. I just had to read a Harry Potter book to see what all the students that I taught were raving about. I now know why they love these books. They are great! I can't wait to read more. I just finished the first book in the series and I intend to read the rest in the series. I hope that more children and adults read these books. It fosters imagination through visualization and fosters creativity in children by their curiousities into Harry's adventures and brings out the child in all of us adults. I do not see what all the bad publicity is about these books. This is a book that is based primarily on fantasy I can think of many other books in print today that should be taken out of print due to their content. I find nothing wrong with the content of Ms. Rowling's books. I hope to be able to use these books in my classroom. We need more books like this that children enjoy to read and want to read. Otherwise, we will lose our children to video games and television, hence losing the imagination in our children's lives."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This book is a very interesting, enthralling sequel to the previous HP book. The way that JKR integrates the normal reactions of Harry, Ron, and Hermione (as 12-year-old adolescents) into a marvelous story plot is amazing. Each of them has their own, individual character and they don't change to much from book to book. Ginny adds her own charm to this book and makes you wonder just what she's up to. There are several hints as you go along that make you kind of unsure of what the ending will be - it keeps you guessing. The actual ending, from Harry going into the life of Tom Marvolo Riddle, to actually finding out Hagrid's secret, to the big surprise at the end, totally takes you by surprise. Another phenomenal success on JKR's list."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Ten minutes ago, I finished Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. I sat for several hours on my couch and resolved I wouldn't put it down until I was done -- and that I did. I thought I was a Harry fan after the first book, but now it's become a full fledged addiction! I can't stop thinking, &quot;What'll happen to Harry in the next book? &quot; And what's worse is...I'm not even twelve years old. I'm an adult, and I'm transfixed. There's something about the quirkiness of the Wizard World that keeps me hooked. I keep wondering what cool spell or magical object will pop up next. Harry's perhaps the most wonderful hero out there -- he embodies a bit of each and every one of us, and throughout every book we cheer for him. We want him to win in the end, and we're never let down. These books are wonderful. Don't stop reading them if you've gotten this far!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Rowling writes like a classic 19th Century writer, driving the story and not talking down to the targeted 9-12 audience. Both traits make her stories exciting and enjoyable for all ages.Although no book series is really deserving of the hype Potter is getting, the series is quality work and no one who enjoys reading should be disappointed.I have only one complaint about book two, it wasn't enough to knock it down from five stars, but a complaint nevertheless. Why did they spend all that time and trouble with the Polyjuice Potion to get info out of Draco when Harry could have simply used his invisibility cloak and followed Draco around for a couple days, listening to what he talked to his buddies about, and maybe even catching him in the act! It would have made an even more interesting subplot than the month spent brewing the potion."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This and all the Harry Potter books are much overrated both as to their force for &quot;evil&quot; and their status as &quot;great literature&quot;. They are comparable to the &quot;Hardy Boys&quot; with some supernatural stuff thrown in. If this book gets your children reading that's great but don't believe they are learning any great moral lessons. There are none. The characters are one dimensional. Harry's foster family is disgusting mean and ugly. Harry himself has more magic tricks than brains. When your children have read these books the next step is not the works of C.S. Lewis. Start them on Grimm's fairy tales."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"In this book, we read about Harry's second year atHogwarts. But this time, some strange things are happening: petrifiedpeople, odd voices, and strange writing on the wall. It's up to Ron and Harry to save Hogwarts and find out the mystery.I like Harry Potter, but this book was a let down to me. Most of you or few of you may be disagreeing with me, but in my opinion, this is a disappointment. Why am I thinking this? I'll tell you why. First, the plot of this story is similar to the first book ... Second, who cares about the chamber of secrets? Why does Slytherin have his own chamber of secrets? Why don't Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw have their own chambers too? Also, what's with this basilisk talking with Harry and paralyzing people? I think an idea of a basilisk seems unreasonable. Rowling could have replaced the basilisk with some made-up, more creative creature. Finally, why is Gilderoy Lockhart in the book? If he is such a bad teacher at Hogwarts, why did Dumbledore hire him in the first place? I find his character useless. He doesn't know any magic except for a memory charm. Dumbledore would have fired him if he knew what a stupid person Lockhart was. He just ruined another part of the story for me and was another let down.In my opinion, this book is the worst of all four Harry Potter books in the series. I recommend the other three books to any Harry Potter fan or any reader. I found this book to be a waste of money and paper."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This is the one of the worst of the books. It starts when Harry is living with his relatives who are so cruel to him it's unrealistic! Then some elf freak comes and tells Harry that he musn't go to Hogwarts, and this he refuses to do, giving him what he deserves; a barred window. Then the supreme geek known as Ron Weasly and his brothers rescue him, aware that they're doing it without permission. Then when they finally go to the Hogwarts Express the barrier to the platform is sealed (why for Ron, I have no idea), so they decide to let everyone see their magic car as they decide to fly there. Fortunately the car is wrecked.Then as Harry is at Hogwarts (after being yelled at by Snape) there are strange cases of petrification in the school by a monster (a HUGE offense for me, since it is revealed that it is a basiliisk, the so-called \\"King of Snakes\\"). Harry eventually finds a diary in an exotic bathroom, which somehow tells him that it was some spider (showing how stupid he is, since spiders can't petrify, and it's highly unlikely that a spider would kill someone). After finally convinced by the spider (whose name reminds me a lot of The Lord of the Rings, here), Harry is still not convinced that Tom Riddle is the heir and that he framed Hagrid. HELLO! Hagrid seems really stupid-minded to actually kill someone!Then when they finally get into the so-called \\"Chamber of Secrets\\", Harry is finally aware of Tom Riddle being Voldemort, and in the end, Harry gleefully kills the poor snake (and I bet Harry's going to have a career of mercilessly killing snakes after he's graduated Hogwarts)!Dumbledore reminds me a lot of Gandalf. SOME ORIGINALITY!! Also, more evidence of snake prejudice is that Fawkes (a wretched phoenix of a DANGEROUS CHEMICAL REACTION) is referred to as \\"he\\" by the author, while Nagini (Voldemort's pet snake) is the only snake referred to as a gender, and she's referred this way by only Voldemort.Dragonrider, on the other hand, seems more interesting since it portrays reptiles as GOOD (for once)! So for those who like reptiles, do NOT read this series!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I did not think Rowling could write a worse book than the first Harry Potter. I was wrong. This book, written as though Rowling did not care whether every word was spelled wrong had very bad grammar and word usage worthy of a four year old."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets by J.K. Rowling is a book put together with the use of the literary device of irony. It is said that Rowling puts together an excellent book thorough the use of the device of irony. Much of the book would have to be written differently if irony was not included.For instance throughout the book students at Hogwarts are petrified due to the sight of the \\"monster\\", later known as the basilisk, hidden in the chamber of secrets. Almost every time this takes place Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter are found at the scene first. Also it just happened to work out that the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher Gilderoy Lockhart is a fake and can't perform magic. Therefore Ron and Harry have to step up and take the lead in finding Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister who was captured by Tom Riddle.Although irony made it possible for every thing to work in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, it is said that there is too much. Everything in the book keeps happening because Harry, Ron, and Hermione happen to be there. Then it is argued as mentioned before the book would not have been able to flow with out the literary device. So all in all Rowling's book was made possible because of irony."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I wish they wouldn't put an arbitrary reading level on the books. I'm 53 years young and I'm on the third Harry Potter Book. I don't like science Fiction per se, but these Harry Potter books are very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I think that this book could have been much better...although I do not care for the Harry Potter series at all. They are really unimaginative and uncreative, and at times, rather silly and dumb. (with all due respect) I think that JK Rowling kinda copied it from the Lord of the Rings series, except she made it for younger kids. The movies are not as exciting as I thought they should be. I would highly recommend reading the Lord of the RIngs series instead. The Harry series is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I admit, the Harry Potter books are a fun read, but I found that they got boring halfway into this book. It lacked depth! The formula plot is as always: amazing boy escapes evil, tries to figure out evil, evil isn't what he thinks it is, always finds a way to beat it. You could always tell what was going to happen. There was something definetly lacking. There's many better fantasy books and authors out there, among them DAVID EDDINGS, C.S. LEWIS, BRIAN JACQUES, TERRY BROOKS.DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE HYPE!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The book is well written,but I do have a problem with the content, first there is alot of implied violence from the adult toward Harry,and a system of everybody for himself. The worst is the portrayal of there being good and bad witches,witches are witches regardless of thier intent. I know alot of people will wonder what the point is. If you convince childern at a young age something is o.k. they will beleive it.this book is dangerous in its content.I will not let my kids read it! also the book would be very confusing to the youngest readers."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read J.K. Rowlings first book, the Sorceror's Stone, Iwas very excited about the Chamber of Secrets. First, I want to tellyou that this is an excellent book, and a good sequel to the Sorceror's Stone. Mind you, a sequel is never as good as the first book, yet Rowling still creates a air of mystery. I only gave it one star because I wanted to get your attention, yet really it deserves four or five."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A penny + shipping.

Rowling, a well-known and now extremely rich British author, was inspired to write a best selling and enthralling book series, Harry Potter. The first book of this 7 series collection is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. This book is a fantasy, and became so popular by its bizarre plot and storyline. this book's theme is magic. It's full of both evil and good magic, and includes the story of a boys journey through discovering his abilities of magic. This books writing style is different from other books, with some British references, and splashes of color throughout the paper. Its a very enjoyable writing style to pick through, and clearly portrays life, well, wizard life, in London. The narrators voice is lively and descriptive, almost sounds like the agree and sympathize with Harry's thoughts and actions. This book is read in first person narrative. An example of the humorous context includes: \\"He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley's, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was.\\" In this quote, it is humorously referring to Harry, and his tremendous size difference to his cousin, Dudley.The setting of this book begins in London, but slowly travels to the magic school called Hogwarts. Hogwarts is the main setting for the rest of the book, and is basically present in the London like setting. Hogwarts is easily compared and contrasted to our world now. It is compared to a large castle like structure ,which all of us non-wizards are familiar with. The story describes its broad stone walls and enormous size. Of course, our world does not include angry trees who smash whatever falls in them, and magical staircases that shift while you walk. The author is able to paint a complete image in your head on what the characters were presently seeing at that very moment. As a reader, you are able to almost be transported to such a magical place, full of fantasy creatures that you dreamed up as a kid.The main characters in the book include Harry, Ron and Hermoine. They are just like you and me, curious and excited to learn new things they never imagined possible. These characters deal with the same emotions we do, fear, love and excitement. They each have a distinguished personality, Harry the leader, Ron the comedian best friend, and Hermoine the only girl genius. Hermoines genius is present in what she says: \\" \\"You're saying it wrong,\\", Harry heard Hermoine snap. \\"It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar' nice and long.\\" \\"A main reason this book is so popular is because of its different plot. The main plot is Harry's journey towards discovering his capability of new magic, especially after being the only survivor of the most powerful dark wizards magic.

At the time i took it for granted but reading it again and looking back I can appreciate them for what they taught me and for what they continue to teach me."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I started reading the Harry Potter series on the summer, because it caught my eye, the first book was impossible to stop reading, so then i buyed this book, i love it, it reaveals a lot of more things, than the first one, it's very exciting, thirriling, suspenful, smart, and with a lot of imagination, but stil, i think it was too darky, for example, to all the things that happen to Harry and Ron, but specially on Ron, hey, if you haven't read the book yet,i suggest you to stop reading this revoew, they are some spoilers coming on, okay first the Whomping Willow, then when Ron throw's up worms, and when he feels sick at the Halloween party, and at the end he vomits, but it's way very darky on all the characters, but still it's an excellent book, i also think that they are taking too extreme the popularity on this books, from the movie to the board games, to the clocks to the trading cards to the mugs to the clothes to the toys, by the way i consider stupid the way they judge this book, they say that is satanic, but that's not true, none of this book has anything satanic, they call it fiction for a reason, and the authors and witches and magicians mentioned they don't exist, OK?, SO ENJOY FOREVER HARRY POTTER!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I give this book 5 stars.

Anybody who loves magical stuff will really love this book.They say you can't judge a book by its cover but just by the cover page you can tell this book is great!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"The second Harry Potter builds well on the first. The characters continue to mature, as does the storyline. This tale, with more twists and turns then the original and with a darker, more complex ending, creates an exciting experience for readers of all ages. I'm not ready to place this series with the pantheon of great children's literature but Rowling's young magician definitely shows promise."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"When I read this book in the 7th grade, I could not put it down. With the fantasy, adventure, and mystery I might suggest this book. In the book Harry is back at Hogwarts for a second year of wizard training. J.K Rowling, the author, splendidly takes Harry through an action packed year. Then to make things better, peoples sercets will be revealed(hence the title Chamber of sercets). It will take you to new points of your imagination, I guarantee."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Well well well... what is there to say about J. K Rowling ? Only thats she has managed to capture the minds and imaginations of young children around the world yet again with the second book in the series of Harry Potter books. Its seems like magic how J.K. Rowling has managed to capivate the childs imagination with such a interesting plot and new twists and turns at the turn of every page of a Harry potter book combined with a few quick witted and fascinating characters. Although i may be old, both me and my sister (especially me) have learned to never put down a Hary Potter book once qwe start reading. The way in which the characters are portrayed adn the the suspense and Drama taht unfolds at the turn of each page is simply remarkable. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets immediaely transports us to Harry Potter's world where he is once again met by all the old characters, His aunt, uncle and dudley his cousin who are determined to give him a hard tiem once again. Hagrid the goal keeper of Hogwarts and of course Mr Albus Dumbeldore the principal of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Also added are a few new faces Moaning Mrytle who haunts the girls bathroom and the new teacher. Well this book seems to have a boost of zest and suspense added to it making it even more interesting to read and more harder to put down."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I never thought that J.K Rowling could do any better then the first Harry Potter but she has. This is one of the greatest books ever. This book has even more adventue and drama then the first one, it makes you want to drop on your knees and beg for more Thankfully there is more. There are still little connections and hidden things in an adventure even more adventurous then the last adventure. The Climax is still at the end, but it is leading up to it from the very begining, when Dobby comes to see Harry Potter. This is avery well written book with a fantastic plot and storyline. Another fantastic book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Greeeat book! Real page turner :)I'd highly recommend this book to any reader of any ageBrilliant!

I learned numerous things throughout the book that points to the end. I loved the book and JKR's story telling. It's enchanting."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I will not be writing a normal review regarding this book seeing how it is pointless. Either everyone's read it or they haven't. Like my other review for the first book I will just compare it with the movie.I love the movies, I have seen them so many times it's insane. However, now that I am finally reading the books I can finally piece together the parts that are missing in the movies. This is great because with the movies there are just little things that were missing to tie up the who's and why's to certain parts. Such as how Hermoine became petrified. Yes we know that she was looking for a clue and that was the piece of paper in her hand or they they drank the polyjuice potion. In the movie they never really cleared up how she turned back to human. Just little things or how they came across the petrified cat. yes they were walking down the hall but we didn't really know what they were doing in the book know.I am enjoying the books and I love the little details of the world. I definitely urge those who are a fan of the movies but who have not read the books to do so. It will completely fill those gaps in the movie.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"This second Harry Potter book is very interesting and I am sure this review will make kids want to read it. Every page of this book has something new to it, something magical. This book is nothing but fun. This book turns you into a child for sometime. I recommend taking a trip with Harry Potter back to Hogwarts into the chamber of secrets. This book turns you into a child for sometime. I seriously think every child must read this book or any other Harry Potter book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was a treat. Rowling created a highly imaginative world filled with good and evil characters. She then delivered a plot filled with more twists and turns than a ho-down. She couldn't deliver a successful sequel. Could she?Well, thankfully for the millions of Harry Potter fans, she did. In fact, she has improved upon the first. Chamber of Secrets is a delight from start to finish.Harry Potter books always begin with Harry and the Dursleys. The horror that is the Dursley house is a sort of purgatory before Harry enters the Paradise that is Hogwarts Wizard School. Fortunately for the reader, we don't have to live with the Dursleys and can enjoy their strange eccentricities. Dudley and his family are more comic than villianous. In Chamber of Secrets we get to meet Harry's best friend Ron's family. They also provide comic relief. It is the way that the humour is mixed with the suspense that makes a Harry Potter book so riveting.The suspense in Chamber of Secrets is almost too much. There are a number of sinister characters and we, as Harry does, question everybody (apart from Ron and Hermione). Sinister characters remain from the first. Professor Snape continues his terror on Harry. Draco Malfoy is even more involved this time as is his father. Other less sinister characters introduced this time are Lockhart, a new teacher with a very high opinion of himself and Percy (Ron's brother), who is prone to snobbiness due to his position as prefect. I'm hoping that Lockhart remains in the third. He amused me.There's a lot of talk about killing and death and as I mentioned the tension may become too much for younger Harry Potter fans. It was too much for me at times and I'm 19. Advise to Parents, read it yourself first, if you are worried about your sensitive children. There are scary elements to the book but it never decreases the reader's enjoyment. In fact, it only proves how much JK Rowling respects her readers to write such a mature novel.Chamber of Secrets continues this successful series magically. To use the cliche, it's difficult to put down. In fact, I can't put Harry Potter down full stop. I'm now half way through Prisoner of Azkaban. Keep them coming Ms Rowling."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"A wonderful book. You'd think the book is just for kids but there is enough intrigue and fantasy and complexity to keep adults interested as well. Once you get into it you'll have a hard time putting it down. If you have kids, it makes a great bedtime story, and will surely give them dreams to remember, that is, if you can get them to go to bed and let you save some for the next night. It's probably the best book of the series to start reading."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"I give &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; five stars because the story was written so well that it was the only book I was ever able to read and picture a movie the whole way through. &quot;The Chamber of Secrets was so good I was not able to put down. The first thing I thought about the book was this was going to be a good book. The story is about a boy who parents were killed by a man named Voldemort. On Halloween Mrs. Norris, a cat was frozen by something unknown. For the rest of the book Harry, Ron and Hermoine try to find out what it was. My favorite part was when Harry was in the Chamber of Secrets. I loved the ending it was sssooooooo tense. The ending was explained well, and I've never read anything like it."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"At first I thought the book was boring but then I got into it and finished it.

I liked the ending because it fits well with the book."},{"Title":"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets","review":"At first I thought it was boring, in the beginning.

Before returning to Hogwarts, a creature appears, a creature by the name of Dobby. Dobby warns Harry that if he returns to Hogwarts terrible things will happen &amp; disaster will stike.
