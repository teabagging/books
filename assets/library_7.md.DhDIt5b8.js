Definitely a great read!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Stephanie Lauren's writes sort of an old-fashioned late 70's romance, but that's exactly why she's so appealing. We've all been hungering for a return to our roots lately and ALL ABOUT PASSION definitely provides that."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"One day I went into a book store looking for a good romantic read. I brought a Stephanie Laurens book, Devils Bride the 1st in the Cynster Novels, it was good, just what I was looking for. A few weeks later I brought All About Passion, let me just say, this book is ALL about passion. I LOVED it. This book, in my opinion, is her best work ever. Since then i've read a few more of her books but All About Passion remainds my favorite. Get it."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Ok, I finally decided to take a go at a few Stephanie Laurens books, and checked out several, including this one. After reading them, I have come to a few conclusions about Ms. Laurens and her writing ability.First, she creates rich backdrops for her stories. You almost feel like you are there, in the environment she details so richly. Some of her subplots are well thought out and interesting.But....Ms. Lauren goes back to the same words over and over. She is in desperate need of a Thesaurus apparently. Our heroine \\"humphs\\". Endlessly. And over and over we see \\"ruched peaks\\", and \\"fractured gasps\\"......which leads me to the most important point.Ms. Lauren basically writes soft porn. I tried to keep up with the story lines, skipping over the pornographic portions, because I usually found the story at least a bit engaging. But after three books I had to give up. I think I had finally had enough after Ms. Laurens describes the TASTE of our heroine's vaginal secretions as her lover performs cunnilingus on her. Enough. Pretty packaging, it still adds up to porn. I love historical romances, and don't object to a few racy scenes here and there. But I am done with Ms. Lauren's brand of \\"historical\\" novels."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I loved the characters, excellent plot development, extremely sensual, what more could a reader ask for?"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"My last Laurens book.Standards re-hash of the tired old Cynster novel. I did not even finish the book it was that bad. Mystery plot was as transparent as a window and the ending entirely contrived.Laurens either needs to change her template or just hope that her readership is not filled with people who read more than one book of hers.One star was for actually getting an editor to release this book to the public, second star was for having less than the normal amount of typos and also the overall legibility of the novel."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"A Kingdom of Dreams was the best book I've read in a long time.Judith McNaught is one of the best author's I've read. The love story between Jennifer Merick and Royce Westmoreland is so heart warming it made me laugh and cry. The ending was one of the best .I was very glad to see that her family got what they deserved.It is a real keeper so you can read it over and over again."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"favorite scene with francesca-the final showdown with franni.favorite scene with gyles-rescusing francesca on the horse.favorite scene together-the final showdown with franni."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I will only ask this question once: Could somebody PLEASE write a good romance novel that has a good plot and doesn't contain page after page of an unappealing couple practicing the Kama Sutra? I was ready to give up on this book after so many pages of \\"tangling tongues\\" and so on until somebody was obviously trying to kill Francesca. Now THAT caught my attention. Unfortunately, it was only her goofy cousin whom Gyles had at first mistaken for his betrothed, proving to be a huge waste of time. I do not like weak romance novels and, unfortunately, this is another one of them. If you want a good romance novel that isn't offensive and is completely engaging, try Pig in a Park by Pauline Baird Jones."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"When I saw Stephanie Laurens' latest book on the shelf, I snatched it up and read it in two days! If you are a fan of her Bar Cynster series, you will not be disappointed! This is the tale of Chillingworth, the character who has gone from Devil's arch-enemy in Devil's Bride to close friend and honorary Cynster in All About Love. Let me tell you that as a leading man in a romance novel, he held his own with the Cynsters! I am also delighted to report that our leading lady, Francesca, is a well-developed character who manages to be high-spirited and strong without being whiny, manipulative, or self-centered. The plot is well-formed and the relationship builds and grows throughout the book- just as it should. The thread of suspense is also interesting without being too distracting, and even though fairly transparent, I was still hooked to the end to see how the situation would resolve. I highly recommend this to all fans of historical romance. However, if you have not yet read the first six books in the Cynster series, you're missing out! I'd start with Devil's Bride (the first and best!) and move on from there. Enjoy Chillingworth and Francesca!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I loved this book, and I will try hard not to spoil the plot, but this is a LOVE STORY. Yes, we know how it ends...IT IS A LOVE STORY. It is, however, a really good love story. I hope you enjoy All About Passion, but let me warn you: First, Chillingsworth isn't a Cynster, he doesn't act like one. Yes, he follows a strict code of acceptable behavior, but he wasn't raised with a large number of close relations and his actions are those of a single son. Second, Francesca was not raised to be English, so she doesn't act like a Cynster wife, he should be glad she didn't resort to a gun. Third, we were only reading the book; we aren't living it. Don't complain because the people in the story behave in a socially acceptable manner for the time period while trying to find the villain. And, by the way, my older brother didn't immediately realize that I was the one who broke his toys, and he was pretty sharp.The development from physical desire, to companionship, devotion and finally to love flows well. Happily, there is no sonic jump of emotions. I hate stories that have the heros in one scene fighting bitterly then, in the very next scene they can't breathe without the one another. So irritating, but luckily this story moves very smoothly and logically and, even better, has enough intrigue to keep you wondering what will happen to the villain, and the sex scenes are hot without becoming silly. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I, but please remember he isn't a Cynster."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I waver between 4 and 5 stars for this book. Overall, Stephanie Laurens is very, very good. She consistently turns out satisfying books, mixtures of some mystery and lots of romance. When both elements (mystery and romance) are \\"on\\", she can't be beat. When one element is \\"off\\", she's still pretty darn good. A few of her past books - Captain Jack's Woman (which was really a dry run for a Cynster novel), Devil's Bride, A Rogue's Proposal, and All About Love have hit both nails on the head. All About Passion is one of her very best romance stories - but the mystery/suspense story never really gets off the ground. It's blatantly obvious who the \\"villain\\" is and the pathetic red herrings that are thrown in mix into the story like chocolate sprinkles on a beer. On the other hand, I think she could have really used our boys (the Cynsters) more to round out the story. Devil plays a bit of a role and Harry (Demon) shows up on one scene, but that's it. As for the story between Chillingsworth (always one of my favorite minor characters in the Cynster novels) and Francesca - it's superb, one of the best in this series. Of course, his obsession about not falling in love is absurd, but you always have to suspend reality when you're reading in this genre. She's one of the best heroines in the series, too. As always, Laurens writes some of the steamiest copy around, but you get a feel for the personalities and character of both of the main characters. Overall, a pretty darn good read - probably could have used a bit more time in the writing process to make it perfect."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I just finished reading this story and was absolutely thankful that Chillingworth got the story...and the girl that lived up to all the teasing Ms. Laurens has done to us over the past stories. He was everything and more that you would expect form this group....Dashing, arrogant, sexy and oh so ready to take the fall that Fate had coming his way in the form of Francesca, the one woman brave enough to see past all the masks and insecurities of the suave rake to find and care for the heart of the man.Again, I found the thing(s) I read in other reviews the main point of interest in this book. The reasons not to love stemmed from others experiences via the \\"Ton\\" and a life-altering event that affected his life and the lives of his family. He was afraid of the loss of control that love would bring...very important things to those Cynster men (even though he's only honorary). Plus the villain, although obvious to us, was unthinkable and completely unexpected to them.I loved Francesca's spirit. She was, next to Honoria and Alathea, one of the best heroines to date. I recommend this story for the in depth look into these characters souls and how their relationship moves from passion, to friendship and then love...all the while having a WICKEDLY fun \\"ride\\" in the process. Thank you Stephanie for sharing these characters with us and making us laugh, cry and fall in love along the way (Can't wait to read the next installments and to, also, see how it all began...*BG*)."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"&quot;All About Passion&quot; confirms that these days the best regency romances are being written by Stephanie Laurens. This is the story of the Earl of Chillingsworth, a secondary character who appeared throughout Laurens' Bar Cynster series. Chillingsworth is every bit as complex and appealing a hero as the Cynsters, and thankfully he isn't burdened with one of their silly names (Devil, Demon, Lucifer, etc.). He recognizes that he has a duty to marry and beget heirs, so he cold-heartedly sets out to contract a suitable match. Thanks to a childhood trauma, he is leery of deep emotions, and wants his marriage to be a politely distant one. Much to his surprise, his bride, Francesca, turns out to be the antithesis of what he was expecting. Francesca is simply a great heroine. She's smart, self-confident and passionate. There's very little plot in this book besides the primary characters trying to work out their relationship. However, since they are so well-developed and interesting, it makes for a good story. If you don't read romance novels, you won't get much from this book, but romance fans will find it thoroughly satisfying."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Gyles Rawlins, the Earl of Chillingworth, was a minor character in several of the earlier Cynster books. Now that the Bar Cynster members are all married off, Laurens turns her attention to other characters in their environs, and her first - and very welcome - choice is Chillingworth. Of course, this development was trailed very clearly when, at the end of All About Love, the Duke of St Ives declares Chillingworth to be an honorary Cynster. He's determined not to go the same way as his friends, however, when it comes to matters of the heart.So, yes, it's another hero who is determined not to fall in love. But Chillingworth seems to mean it; he has decided to contract an arranged marriage with a suitable female, and preferably the sort who will be indistinguishable from the wallpaper in his various homes. If she happens to come with strategically-important land, such as the segment which was cut out of his own lands some years ago, so much the better. Such as his distant cousin, Francesca Rawlins.Francesca, he believes, is quiet and dull; the kind of woman he can marry, bed and then leave safely buried in the country while he carries on with his normal lifestyle. What Chillingworth doesn't know is that the young woman he saw wasn't Francesca but her cousin Frannie (why Laurens felt the need to give the two women such similar names is beyond me. It certainly wasn't necessary for the plot).Anyway, Chillingworth and Francesca marry, and are very attracted to each other - this is not the kind of marriage Chillingworth was looking for, however! He's determined not to fall in love, and so his behaviour towards Francesca is very odd; he keeps sending her mixed signals. He's warm and passionate in bed, and yet very distant elsewhere. She, on the other hand, is finding her new husband more and more irrestible. But if he doesn't want her, is there any hope of happiness?My sneaking liking for Chillingworth in the earlier books was confirmed in All About Passion, and I also liked Francesca very much. This is quite a bit better than a number of the other books in the Cynster series, largely because it's *not* a carbon copy of the other books. It's still similar, but at least this time I didn't feel as if I was reading exactly the same book yet again. This could have been a very enjoyable and interesting study of an arranged marriage which turned out to be something other than what Chillingworth had intended. But, as usual, Laurens had to bolt a dramatic plot onto it, in this case murder attempts. The villain, as ever, was predictable, and in this case it was a particularly offensive use of stereotypes. I wish this book had been purely about the relationship; if it had been, I would have rated it more highly."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I almost never submit reviews, but this book was such a huge letdown I just had to. After having read all ofthe Cynster series, I was prepared to be just as thrilled. How dissappointed I was. The Cynster series worked because there was a strong plot in which the characters grew closer as they worked together. In this book, the author spends the first 100 pages on an obvious mistaken identity. It was so excrutiating waiting for the obvious discovery that you knew was coming. And she never explains why Chillingworth has decided he can't love. It is so illogical that he would be so close to the Cynsters, who have all found true love, but he has decided he should never love his wife. That just doesn't ring true without a very compelling reason.Then, the rest of the book drags out a plotline so obvious and elementary you wonder what is so smart about the hero and heroine. I certainly hope with the next books on Amanda and Amelia we return to the intrigue that is so much the strength of the Cynster series.If you are a Cynster fan, skip this one and wait for the next."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I have never submitted a review, but this book was such a disappointment I felt the need to. I've read all the other &quot;Cynster&quot; books and thoroughly enjoyed them. As I started the book, I kept reading thinking that the story would pick up and it would get better. As time went on it became a real struggle to &quot;make myself&quot; finish the book. It was long and lacked much of a story."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"The character of Chillingworth always intrigued me. He seemed the ultimate rogue - the eternal bachelor. And I hoped his downfall would be exciting and passionate. Well, it was and it wasn't.First of all, the whole thing about Francesca learning about sex from watching her parents (on multiple occasions) was more than a little disturbing. She didn't just walk in on them. She spied on them and learned her sex moves from them. Can you say, creepy?! Come on, that is downright bizarre. But, if you could get past that, the story was decent.This book was all about Chillingworth. The author gave very little insight into Francesca's character. We know nothing about her parents, her life growing up in Italy, and what she thinks and feels. She is a very 2 dimesional character. She is half-Italian, passionate, and hot-blooded. But rarely does her passionate nature shone through. She is content to rein herself in to capture Chillingworth's heart - noble? Maybe. A little boring? Definitely.This was a nice read (aside from the whole sex/parents thing). Definitely not my favorite, but decent."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I loved this book! I picked it up at the library not really expecting to enjoy it too much (it wasn't, after all, about the Cynster men). Even after reading a few pages, I almost just put it down. I am so glad I kept reading. This is by far one of my favorites by Stephanie Laurens (The Promise in a Kiss is my all-time favorite).I enjoyed seeing the married life of Gyles &amp; Francesca, not just the &quot;courting period&quot; like the other books. I loved that we got to see Gyles fall in love with Francesca &amp; that he had an actual reason for not wanting to admit &amp; succomb to that love. Francesca was wonderful herione, strong, passionate, loving, intelligent &amp; Gyles was just as wonderful. I truly enjoyed reading this book &amp; watching these two fall in love."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I found this book fascinating. Stephanie Lauren's has a way to bring you back in time like your there. I have been hooked since the first story!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"The story is bone melting.

Each of her books stand alone yetsometimes have characters that will be gone into in greater detail. This is the Earl of Chillingworth's time for trueromance. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"It was great to read more about Chillingworth, long time friend of the Cynster family. He was featured in all of the Bar Cynster novels and therefore swore to never fall in love like them. But, as you know, the best laid plans.... Francesca is the perfect foil for his personality and there is enough &#34;misunderstandings&#34; and intrigue to offset the obvious fall of such a roue."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I have had mixed reviews about the Cynster series, loved the first book, hated the second, so-so to okay about most of the others. I really liked this book because Francesca was intelligent and smart, knew what she wanted and went for it while it followed the development of Chillingsworth's emotional, trusting side. From the book title I was expecting lots of passionate sex and there was plenty of that, but I felt this book was about more than sex, and I appreciated that."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"Working my way through the Cynsters.

She is a great author and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"This book ranks up there with Devil, Demon and Gabriel's stories. Those were the best of the Bar Cynster Series I think. While not a real Cynster, Chillingworth was an honorary Cynster and had many of the same tendancies. I loved his parts in the other books and was so glad he got a story of his own. The thing I loved about this book was that the intrigue was secondary to the love story, and oh what a love story it was. One of the best. Gyles's resistance was not silly or overblown, you could really feel his struggle to let go and to let himself love. And Francesca is by far my favorite heroine out of the series. She's just different. She's not about to deny her passion, but she's also not going to force a man to do what he doesn't want to do. Way to go Stephanie, another great read!!"},{"Title":"All About Passion","review":"I love this book. I am so glad she brought out a 'bit player' and gave him a life.

As politicians like Kirchner, Morales and Chavez to a certain degree argue against what they see as the social cost of privatization, this book clearly shows that if the goal is to have increased state revenues aimed at social spending, privatization will more likely than nationalization bring that about through increased tax revenues (private companies in general pay more taxes than state companies), sustained job creation and reduced liabilities such as public debt accumulated by inefficient money-losing state companies.The authors and editors deserve praise for having produced a well-written book on the topic, with ample documentation and no political agenda beyond looking at the myths and reality of privatization in Latin America.(This is an excerpt of a longer review I wrote in Latin Business Chronicle, March 2006)."},{"Title":"60 Progressive Piano Pieces You Like To Play","review":"The condition of the book was near perfect.

He presents the reader with the contemporary clash of free enterprise versus global ecological issues. He has a lot to say between the lines about parenting, and he has some great insights into the methods of dealing with bullies.\\"I've never read his adult books, but I sure hope Hiaasen writes more books for kids. HOOT is one heck of a first step into the world of children's literature.\\"So I was, of course, ecstatic that both the 2003 Newbery committee and 2003 Best Books for Young Adults committee recognized HOOT.I was somewhat less thrilled about having to wait three long years for the pleasure of reading a second children's book by Hiaasen. And while FLUSH is a completely different story, everything that delighted me three years ago about reading HOOT is equally applicable to FLUSH.\\"The deputy told me to empty my pockets: two quarters, a penny, a stick of bubble gum, and a roll of grip tape for my skateboard. It was pitiful.\\" 'Go on inside. He's waiting for you,' the deputy said.\\"My dad was sitting alone at a bare metal table. He looked pretty good, all things considered. He wasn't even handcuffed.\\" 'Happy Father's Day,' I said.\\"He stood up and gave me a hug. 'Thanks, Noah,' he said.\\"So begins FLUSH, the story of what happens after Paine Underwood pulls the plug on the Coral Queen and willingly gets arrested for doing so.The Coral Queen is a three-tiered casino boat owned by Dusty Muleman. Dusty has been making a killing off of the boat's operations because he worked a deal with the local Native Americans to park the boat in a marina on their lands, give them a cut of the take and, thus, avoid having to take the customers a few miles offshore to gamble like all the other casino boat operators are required to do. What Noah's dad is so hot about is that he is sure that the raw sewage periodically washing up on Thunder Beach is the result of the Coral Queen's holding tanks being emptied illegally into the water.A 60 Minutes piece about the author that was broadcast last month, \\"Florida: 'A Paradise of Scandals' \\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/15/60minutes/main688458.shtml, introduces Hiaasen:\\"In a little less than a century, the state of Florida has been transformed from a largely uninhabited swamp to the fourth-largest state in the union. And no one has written about that transformation more successfully than Carl Hiaasen.\\"Part humorist, part muckraker, his satirical novels about greed, crime and corruption in the Sunshine State have become fixtures on the best-seller list and embraced by influential literary critics who compare him to Mark Twain and H.L. Mencken.\\"He is also an award-winning children?s author and a former investigative reporter-turned-columnist for the Miami Herald.\\"And he has made a career of documenting, analyzing and interpreting what may be the most bizarre state in the union -- and one, Hiaasen says, is 'a victim of its own geography.' \\"In the 60 Minutes interview Hiaasen talked about how being out on the water in his skiff is like church for him. In that regard, reading FLUSH feels like you are peering in even closer at the heart of Carl Hiaasen.When I discussed HOOT three years ago, I mentioned that it contained humor, a bit of sadness, and a touch of suspense. All three qualities are once again present in FLUSH. So are the wildly quirky characters, from the bully (Jasper Muleman Jr.), to the brute (Luno), to the buxom blonde (Shelly), the bum (Lice Peeking), the bumbling attorney (Mr. Shine), and the mysterious pirate.Carl Hiaasen is a master at storytelling. That he has utilized his superb talents to once again write a satirical novel about greed, crime and corruption in the Sunshine State for children (and me) is cause for celebration.Thanks, Carl!"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"There aren't many books that can appeal to both a grandfather and granddaughter, without leaving one or both of them feeling just a little shortchanged. Flush is that very, very rare exception!Carl Hiassen has mixed in his usual elements into a froth that's appropriate for youths, but remains equally appealing to adults. There's a comic bad guy who values profit over quality of life (in this case the owner of a floating casino); a few witless thugs (both adult and kid-sized) and a man with anger management issues (a little reminiscent of the guy in Sick Puppy). But the heart of the story rests with the narrator, Noah and his little sister Abbey, two kids that share their dad's love for the Florida Keys.Noah's dad has already tried to stop the Coral Queen casino boat from dumping raw sewage into water around the Keys, by sinking it. Unfortunately, the efforts of the local sheriff have restricted his ability to follow through once the boat is raised and reopened within a week. That leaves Noah and Abbey to find a way to shut down the boat, and clear their dad before their mom loses her patience and leaves him. But how do you prove that a specific boat is the source of foul bacteria and worse, especially when there's rat in the Coast Guard office that tips off the boat's operator whenever they are about to pop a surprise inspection?It helps if you're resourceful and don't mind riding your bike everywhere. It also helps if you befriend a semi-rough blonde with a barb wire tattoo, and can stay clear of the boat owner's bully of a son.I bought this book for my 10 year old granddaughter and she loved it! Then I read it and loved it. Within a month or so I suspect that everyone in the family will have finished it, with similar results."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I enjoyed flush just as much as I enjoyed Hoot. My only word of caution is that the book has many more adult overtunes, and there is one entire chapter that gets the book kicked out of my outloud reading program at school. I think that even kids as young as 13 may lack the maturity for some of the situations in the book."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"As a big Hiaasen fan, I had to check out his second juvenile effort, and was well rewarded for it. While seriously toned down in comparison to his books for adults, \\"Flush\\" maintained the off-beat flavor of his other works, as if one of them was written from a kid's perspective.Noah Underwood is seriously worried his parents will get divorced when his father's latest stunt has him behind bars. Paine Underwood, an environmentalist, just can't sit back and do nothing while Dusty Muleman pollutes the waters with sewage from his casino boat, so he sinks the boat. Unfortunately, it was only in twelve feet of water, so it's only a matter of days before the \\"Coral Queen\\" is back in business.Noah wants to help his father nail Dusty Muleman, but it seems hopeless, since witnesses won't cooperate and the casino owner seems to have the coast guard in his pocket. Then, Noah and his sister Abbey concoct a great scheme to stop the polluter once and for all.Hiaasen does a great job with the characters in this story, from the bullies bedeviling Noah to the mysterious old pirate who keeps coming to his aid (alas, not Skink). He gets his environmental message across, as well, in a non-preachy way that both kids and adults can relate to. I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"This was an excellent book , with a great story line, that doesn't keep you guessing but definately keeps you at the edge of your seat.Flush is about a boy named Noah , and the things he has to put up with , because of his father Paine ( who can be a real Pain ) who sunk the Coral Queen a casino boat who has been dumping human waste into the ocean. This is not only disgusting, but really unhealthy for ocean life and people. But no one believed Noah's father when he told them the reason he sunk the Coral Queen. He was actually put in jail. So Now Noah has taken it into his own hands to prove his father right. It's amazing what he gets himself into, and how far he is willing to go.This is a great realistic Fiction book for middle school boys, because the book is told from a boy's point of view and has that boyish humor to it."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Carl Hiaasen comes through again with a zany, entertaining, and poignant novel for tweens to adults. The heroes are Noah, age 14, and his sister, Abbie, who is several years younger. Everyone else, especially the adults, are deeply troubled and/or utterly wacky. Together, Noah and Abbie mainly keep their well meaning but impetuous father out of jail and hatch a bold plot to put an exceptionally vile, sewage dumping casino owner out of business.As usual, Hiassen infuses an abiding love for nature and an abiding fury at those who would harm it. Mostly this works, but the book sometimes teeters on the brink of sappiness in this respect. Still, it's a fun and engaging read overall.As a final thought, I'm the moderately over-protective dad of a twelve-year old and an eight year old. I wouldn't let my kids anywhere near Hiaasen's many adult-oriented books. But like Hoot, this book is completely tween friendly, and my 12-year old enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"This time I didn't make the mistake of not realizing that Flush was a \\"young readers\\" book when I ordered it as I did with Hoot, his first such novel. I didn't care, because based on my prior experience, I expected an entertaining and pure Hiaasen adventure and I was not disappointed.Hiaasen has a way of writing his pro-ecology novels whether for us seasoned citizens or for younger readers which demands constant refueling on the part of the reader. His villians are alway very villanous and his good guys are often flawed, but always but always endearing.In this book the good guys are a family named Underwood, Mom and Dad (Donna and Price) and the kids (Noah and Abbey). Price has taken offense that a bad guy named Muleman who owns a casino boat tied up in their harbor sees fit to simply empty the boat's holding tanks into the harbor rather than into a pump out system. To deal with the issue he has gone aboard the boat and pulled the seacocks sending the Casino Queen to the bottom. Following his arrest Price refuses to let his wife bail him out and decides to use his incarceration as a bully pulpit to talk to the press about Muleman's activities. He references Nelson Mandela as his role model.Muleman has insulated himself from investigation and prosecution in numerous ways and the remainder of the book involves getting Dad out of jail and keeping him out, exposing the truth about Muleman and generally seeing that justice is done.As usual it is done in a very entertaing and creative way. There are other characters who populate the book you will enjoy as well. So, no matter that Hiassen wrote this for young readers. You are only as old as you feel and after reading this you will feel yound indeed."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"There is a lot to love about this book. For confirmed Hiaasen fans, and I am one, he finds his groove here and stays with it until the end. His characters are complex ones for any genre but especially young adult fiction. They are, like most of us, a very human mix of desirable and undesirable traits merged to create complex people facing difficult situations. Hiaasen doesn't preach, he doesn't dilute and he doesn't dumb down the book for its intended audience. He remains true to his themes of environmentalism, respect for others and the power of the brain over brawn. All are good lessons for his intended audience and for their folks as well.The book is well written, the vocabulary rich, the story complex and exciting and Hiaasen keeps it real. The parents (Thank you!!) are not some dumb, clueless dopes who can't get a handle on their children. The children do not have the run of their house. There are consequences for your actions for both the adults and the children in the story. Carl Hiaasen keeps the relationships between parents and children so real in this book. I just can't say enough about how really good this story is.For those of you who have enjoyed Hiaasen's adult novels through the years, take heart. Though he remains true to the high adventure that has been his trademark he has lost the language that has sometimes marred his storytelling. This cleaned up, PG rated novel is the best book I've read in a very long time. I hope that many of you will enjoy it with your child like I have mine."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Flush is about a teenage boy, Noah, who tries to save the environment, by following his dad's footsteps. The story begins with Noah's dad in jail accused of sinking a casino boat after realizing that the owner of the boat had been dumping sewage waste into the water ruining the water quality and habitat of turtles and fish. Noah and his sister then try to explain their dad's action by trying to document and find evidence of the dumping.I think Flush is a fascinating book. The characters have unique and interesting personalities. I especially like Noah's courage and his dedication to helping his family and to protect the environment. I recommend Flush to anyone who is concerned with saving the environment."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Quick-pacing, wacky characters, and concern for the environment are hallmarks of all Carl Hiassen's bestselling books. FLUSH is his second children's book, and although it isn't quite as funny as HOOT (which garnered him a Newbery Honor), it satisfies on all levels.Brother and sister Noah and Abbey (named after the late Edward Abbey) are out to prove their dad wasn't making it up when he claimed a local casino boat owner had been dumping sewage illegally overboard, where it fouls a local beach. Unfortunately their Dad, taking a cue from THE MONKEY WRENCH GANG has gone a little too far to make his point -- by sinking the boat -- and is put in jail, where he compares himself to Nelson Mandela and begins granting media interviews.One man's civil disobedience is another's sabotage, and Noah finds himself in the middle, as his mother is angry enough to use the D word (divorce). Noah and Abbey set out to prove their father's motive was pure, and after many plot twists, they manage to do so in a thoroughly satisfying way."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"The book I read for my book report was Flush. Out of 10 stares I would give it a 9. This book by Carl Hiaasen has some action in it. I would recommend this book to people who like interesting stories and action stories.Now I will give a summery of this book. This book is about a boy named Noah and his sister Abbey. There father is in jail for sinking a boat called the Coral Queen. There main subject is to try and get him out. But he only sunk the boat because they were dumping swage in the water. Noah and Abbey will do anything for proof. Even sell there favorite boat to lice, who is a big jerk. But there also worried for there mom. She keeps on bringing up the word divorce. At one point he gets out of jail, but you have to read the rest to see what happens next.In my conclusion I think you should read this book. There is action and maybe even murder. This book has a lot of twists and turns to it. If I liked it I think you will to!!"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Flush has all the ingredients needed to make an adventuress, page turning, young adult novel. The adventure unfolds when Noah and his sister Abbey take action one summer when their dad is jailed for attempting to sink the Coral Queen, a gambling boat. Their summer turns from dull to eventful in just a few pages. After his father is jailed Noah decides to take it upon himself to find out if his father's motivations were true. Carl Hiaasen has done it again. He truly has a gift, his book is inspirational in the fact that it encourages teens to take action. One can tell that this book will be an interesting book based on its cover, which in itself is a masterpiece"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Flush continues Hiaasen's passion for the environment and Florida, the Florida Keys in this case. Like Hoot this book is marketed not as an adult fiction novel but as novel for younger readers. In comparison to Hoot which I couldn't really tell any difference from Hiaasen's usual masterpieces except that kids were the main characters, Flush is written more like a young adult novel. Like with Hoot though, readers of all ages will enjoy this except I have to say Flush isn't as fast paced as Hiaasen's masterpieces such as Sick Puppy, Skinny Dip, Lucky You, Stormy Weather, Native Tongue and Strip Tease like Hoot was. Those books from the first page you just could not put down until the final page. Flush just lacks that but it is still a worthwhile read and one all Hiaasen fans no matter what their age will enjoy.In Flush, Noah and Amy's dad is in jail after a failed attempt to sink the Coral Queen, a gambling boat which is pumping its toilets directly into the sea. Much to their dad's disgust the Coral Queen is soon operational again and Amy and Noah who witness a loggerhead turtle nearly die decide to clear their father's name of being a troublemaker and prove once and for all that Dusty Muleman is dumping the sewage. Dusty has everyone else convinced, including the coastguard that he is not and is just the victim of an insane man. Even when it becomes apparent that Dusty and his henchmen will stop at nothing, even murder to continue their practice Noah and Amy do not give up in their quest to prove their father right and gain justice for the Florida marine life.If you have read all of Carl Hiaasen's novels and are still hungry for more of the same then check out the author C.J. Box who writes similar surreal novels set in Wyoming instead of Florida with passionate extreme environmentalists, corrupt public officials, dim-witted rednecks and other Hiaasen style characters. Open Season is a good book to start with."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"FlushBy Carl HiaasenMysteryFlush is about a 13 year old boy named Noah, whose dad has just gotten arrested from sinking a gambling ship, and putting it out of business.

Noah's dad accused him of dumping the boat's sewage into the ocean, but can Noah and his 11 year old sister Abbey prove what really happened.Flush relates to my life, because I have a sister, but her name isn't Abbey, who is cool sometimes, but sometimes she just gets on my nerves. My dad is also kind of crazy, but he wouldn't sink a ship would he?Carl Hiaasen's writing is amazing, because you never get left behind. You are right alongside the hero of the story the whole time.I loved this book, but the reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I thought the story was kind of weird. Weird but believable.I can't exactly recall any books that relate to Flush, it's one of a kind."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"This book is about a boy named Noah who's dad sunk a man's casino boat for dumping raw sewage into the ocean and is now in jail.

Hopefully, as was done with HOOT, a feature film will be made from this one."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Flush by Carl Hiaasen was one of the best books I have ever read.

It was a great book, and is a book for almost all ages."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"This is not in the same league as Skinnydip but then I gave that 10 * as opposed to the measly five presented here. It's a fun read - light, hilarious, slightly juvenile (the point of view is from a rather unbelievably cleancut teenage boy). As usual, it is an ecological problem, this time the dumping of waste into the ocean from a floating gambling boat.And, as usual, the bad guys are stupid, wasteful, mean while the good guys are virtuous, witty, resourceful and politically correct. Still, despite the rather heavy-handedness of the message, it's a great read. Populated with some unforgettable \\"characters\\" - and I mean that in the true sense of the word - we meet a slice of Florida beach life. SHort & Sweet."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"The whole book was wonderful. Carl Hiaasen writes so well. He makes the book funny, sad, mad, scared, and everything else you could feel. When you read the book it feels like he is including you, like you are the main character. Or you are the one doing all this stuff. There was not a single boring page. When the author is talking about Noah's plan \\"Operation Royal Flush\\" he makes it fun to read, for a kid, but any grown up would love it too. As I said before, this book remindes me of Fig Pudding. Fig Pudding is a book about two kids saying and doing what they think is right about what their grandma cooks. Anyway, Flush has many good traits that pulled me in to read it. I loved the book because of the action that Noah and Abbey did. Expectially, in the middle of the book when Noah starts his \\"Operation Royal Flush\\" plan.By: Jessica Stuart"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"A very funny story about a boy and his sister, their loyalty to their dad and their cleverness in proving unlawful sewage dumping off a casino boat in the Florida Keys. Hiaasen seems to have heard his critics about glorifying eco-terrorism in Hoot, because in this book, the eco-terrorist father is jailed for much of the story. Excellent read! Good for boys and girls given the dual main characters."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I was disappointed, as I generally like Carl Hiassin. The book really drug on with lots of un-funny toilet jokes. It was too much like several other books of his that I've read, seems he has a formula."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Middle-school aged youngsters, and probably boys especially, will almost certainly enjoy this story of a son's heroic, but very human, efforts to prove his father right about an ecological wrong. Hiaasen writes fluidly, and this tale is engrossing--filled with true-to-life, sometimes gritty, characters. He writes for young people without a hint of condescension. The author's values are the underpinnings of his tales for youngsters, but he never preaches. He teaches also, but without a bit of pedagogy. Our grandsons have enjoyed the Hiaasen books we have sent them; the titles alone have immediately captured their interest."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"My 11 year old is not a lover of reading but she loves this book and we love reading it with her.

We just found one!"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Flush By Carl HiaasenBook ReviewBy Anna HollingsworthPart of our responsibility as humans is to care for the environment and each other and to try to do what is right. These are the main themes of Carl Hiaasen's book \\"Flush.\\" In this book a twelve year old boy named Noah Underwood tries to help his dad catch an environmental polluter, while working to keep his family safe and together. This is an excellent book for young adults because it is cleverly written, it focuses on strong family ties, and it teaches right from wrong.One of the main reasons this book is so good is because Hiaasen does a great job describing and developing the main characters. He not only explains in detail how they look, but he gives you a real sense of their personalities and why they act the way they do. Many of the characters in the book, including Noah's long lost grandfather and the casino- owning polluter Dusty Muleman are quite wacky, but still believable. For example Noah's grandfather Bobby is described has a craggy faced, silvery hair tough old sea captain with bare feet and a scar on his face the shape of a \\"M\\". It should be difficult to believe in such a crazy character, but Hiassen makes him seem real.The book focuses on strong family ties. One of the main examples is the close relationship between Noah and his sister Abbey. For instance, twice in the book Abbey bites someone to protect Noah. Each member of the family supports the others when they are in trouble. Noah does everything in his power to help his father fight Dusty Muleman. Hiaasen stresses the importance of family ties by having Noah's long lost grandfather Bobby return to Florida, where the book is set, to help fight for Noah's family.I like that fact that this book focuses on how important it is to try to do the right thing. Hiaasen makes it clear that we need to care about others and part of doing that is also caring about the environment. I am glad that the truly bad characters in this book get what they deserve. The author makes it clear, however, that just because you are right about something doesn't mean you can act any way you like. While Noah's father is right to fight against Dusty Muleman polluting the water, he is wrong to break the law to try to stop it.I would recommend \\"Flush\\" to young readers because it is so well written and it deals with family relationships and the importance of doing what's right. I would give this book a 4.5 out of 5 because it had an exciting plot, it had interesting, but believable characters, and it made me laugh. I didn't want to put it down. As the School Library Journal book review stated, \\"Readers will be hooked"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I very much enjoy Carl Hiaasen's adult novels. Complicated but silly plots, cheerful sex, crackling dialogue, engagingly odd-ball characters, arresting deadpan dialogue - they are great reads. So the question is, can Hiaasen translate into the young YA world. As in \\"Hoot\\", the answer, at least for me, is \\"yes\\".Of course, he had to lose the sex and the creative obscenities. The plots had to be simplified a bit. The odd-ball-ness of the characters had to be made a little more \\"PG\\". But Hiaasen has been able to do that while still retaining his unique voice, his Florida worldview, his environmental messages, and his sense of fun.That's quite an accomplishment. So, if you are looking for a novel that is something of a transition piece for a younger reader to more adult fare, this book is certainly worth considering."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"FLUSH: An Example of What Every Book Should IncludeI can't help myself. Whenever I read a book I'm always analyzing how the author pulls it off. How does he or she weave together the different elements needed to produce an engaging book for young readers?My recent read, FLUSH by Carl Hiaasen, is a great example of this type of book. It has:A great beginning that hooks the readerThe deputy told me to empty my pockets: two quarters, a penny, a stick of bubble gum, and a roll of grip tape for my skateboard. It was pitiful.\\"Go on inside. He's waiting for you,\\" the deputy said.My dad was sitting alone at a bare metal table. He looked pretty good, all things considered. He wasn't even handcuffed.\\"Happy Father's Day,\\" I said.(I dare you not to want to read more after that!)Memorable charactersPaine Underwood- who is jailed for trying to prevent a floating casino from dumping raw sewage into the Florida Keys.Noah Underwood- his son who supports his dad's crusade--even when his father gives up on it himself. (his name really fits him!)Abbey Underwood- Noah's tough younger sister who has a very mean bite.Donna Underwood- who is tired of her husband Paine's crusades. She vacillates between understanding him and thinking he is a selfish jerk who she should divorce.Antagonists that readers love to hateDusty Muleman- the greedy, scrupulous casino operator (his name fits him too).Jasper Jr. Muleman- Dusty's bully son and Noah's #1 enemy.Interesting Minor CharactersShelley- a bartender with an attitude, guts, and her own axe to grind against Dusty.Grandpa Bobby- a mistaken pirate with a wild past.ConflictYou name it, this book has it. Man vs. nature; man vs. man; man vs. self; man vs. a machine.

This book was so good that I read it so fast because I LOVED IT!!! I can't wait till I read Hoot."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"The book Flush was better than I thought it was going to be. I thought that it would have been a lot worse than Hoot, but it turned out to be very good if not better than Hoot. Carl Hiaasen does a great and creative job at making people aware about our ecological problems, and makes it easy enough for kids at the age of 9 understanding it. The book starts with a boy named Noah. Noah is a normal boy and his father is in jail for sinking a local gambling boat called the Coral Queen. His father had done this because the Coral Queen had dumped off a lot of raw materials into the water. There are many twists and turns to this story as well. Since his father is always in jail for a good cause Noah's mother is always home alone and there may be a divorce. This book is very different from his other best-seller, Hoot, because in this book there are not multiple story plots. It is only one person's point of view and it doesn't veer off into other people's views. Another great thing about this book is that it is very entertaining. There are always hilarious parts that want to keep you reading. Noah and his little sister Abbey are determined to make things right as they set a path to show what is right. They encounter the ship owner's son a couple of times. Abbey and Noah also make new friends in the book, Shelly, the bartender aboard the boat and a man with white hair. They plan to use red food coloring to expose the ships waste that they have left behind. Instead they head right for the Florida Keys. To find out what happens to Noah, Shelly, Abbey and the mysterious white haired man I would read Flush. It was a great book and I highly recommend it if you had ever read and enjoyed the book Hoot. Thank you."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Sure enough, as soon as my son realized that I had finished \\"Hoot\\" he was standing there in front of me with his outstretched hand holding a copy of Carl Hiaasen's \\"Flush\\" for me to read. I smiled and promised that I would read it as soon as possible, which meant that evening else he would remind me of my promise every hour of every day. Ha.I've always enjoyed Mr. Hiassen novels so I read it. Again the author proved that his writing skills are fertile enough to create an impressive novel, and certainly a novel worthy of the attention of young adults.The story takes the reader down to the beautiful state of Florida where there is a casino boat, the Coral Queen that is discharging its raw sewage into the Florida Keys. Just that irresponsible act was enough to get me riled up. Here comes the interesting twist in that Mr. Hiaasen's characters, Noah and Abbey set out to prove that their father was justified in sinking the casino because of all the damage it was doing to the waters. With their father in jail, there are more surprising scenes, for these young people and it will take all their zeal and determination to close down the casino and expose the nasty casino owner.I'm not sure if its because I enjoyed Hoot so much that I favor it over Flush, but still both books are great reads with an education into our fragile environment and I believe both books are worthy of your attention. Regards."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Carl Hiaasen has written many best-selling books but none of them better than this one. This latest work \\"Flush\\" looks at greed, (Dusty Muleman a multi-millionaire casino boat owner) the environment, which is represented by Paine Underwood&egrave;, an environment fanatic and a father of Noah and Abbey. Its all about sticking up for what is right. Between them, Paine, Noah, Abbey (Paine's children) and Shelly (Dusty Muleman's ex-girlfriend) attempts to bring down Muleman who has recently been dumping human waste in to the Gulf of Mexico. Would you believe that a toilet plays an important part as well!Most children might not understand the environmental issues that are going on today and how they connect to greed and even crime and corruption.. The connections are that most of the harm to the environment is caused by consumerism and pollution. This book helps the reader to become more aware of the disastrous issues that are going on these days. For example, in the book Dusty is polluting the ocean by dumping human waste into it. By doing this, he doesn't have to pay for the collection of the sewage. Hiaasen is a great teacher to his young readers who don't have the knowledge of what is happening now around the world even though they live in it.Flush is filled with suspense and rising action. Moreover, the language this book uses is a lot easier to read then most books I have read. That is probably because the story is through the eyes of one of the main characters in this book, Noah (Paine's eldest child), who also encourages the reader to take action on pollution.No flUsh in the pan this book!

He lives with his father who is quite the opposite personality.One day Noah went to go visit his father in jail. His father sunk the Coral Queen a popular boat used to gamble. His father, Paine claims he only sunk the boat because Dusty Muleman, the owner was dumping trash into the ocean which is illegal. Paine tried to explain his case about Dusty but the Coast Guard, but Dusty had insiders and always knew when was the right time to dump the waste. At this point Noah had become his dad's only hope to catch Dusty in the act. Noah and his two sisters Abbey and Shelly planned a perfect plan to expose Dusty and clear their dad's name.One character that I feel that I had a similar personality is Noah. We have similar personalities shown throughout the book. An example of Noah and I similarities is when he stands up for his father and always having faith in him. If my dad were in his position I would behave the same way. In conclusion Noah and I have the same outlook on helping others.If you loved this book as much as I did you will love the book Hoot. Hoot is by the same author as Flush. The book Hoot is a spectacular novel about a book that finds his love for animals. It has a meaningful story line to keep the reader interested. Both books are a wonderful story for any age and pleasing to everyone.I thought this book was extremely captivating from the first page to the last page of the book. It was captivating because of the beginning. From the moment I saw the title I was intrigued. I'd had never seen a book with a fish and a hook on it before and it made me want to pick it up.

I am saving them for when they want to read them on their own.So even though my kids enjoyDiary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Feverand Judy Moody booksThe Judy Moody Star-Studded Collection: Books 1-3they also like something that is fun and also has a storyline that has added value."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"As a teacher of Ecology and Environmental science, I found this a raucous adventure of an overzealous parent and their sympathetic kids in their fight against local polluters.

Light reading; at the same time engaging. Having spent five years in South Florida, this series is especially fun.

Noah's dad gets so angry that he sinks the casino boat called the coral queen. He was trying to stick up for what was right but sinking the boat wasn't the best answer. So Noah and his little sister Abbey set out on a journey to continue what their father has started and prove to everyone that their father wasn't just making everything up and that the owner of the Coral Queen is guilty. This is an exciting non-fiction book.This book is on top of my list because it is an interesting novel to read. Each page makes you want to read more and see what's going to happen next. I definitely recommend this book. It's a wonderful realistic book. I think that anyone 12 and up would enjoy it. Most likely people who are into more realistic books,While reading this book my mind didn't wander at all. Every time I put down the book I couldn't wait to pick it back up and continue reading. It wasn't hard to concentrate on the book. It kept you interested and it was easy to keep up with everything that was going on in the story. The genre of the book was interesting.

Who could believe that someone who has spent the most of his career writing adult novels could make such darn good kid's books? Outrageous! Noah Underwood and his friends are just as real as you or me, with every bit as much attitude. Hiassen clearly cares about teaching kids to respect the enviorment, seeing that both his kid's books have been about just that. Most of his ideas come from the non-fiction column he writes for the Miami Herald. Isn't it crazy how reality can be even weirder than fiction?! He is currently working on another adult novel, but parents, beware because after that he intends to write another chldrens novel, and your kids'll be begging for it. To find out what he is considering visit [...] and go to FAQ's. So try this book, and other titles by Carl. Trust me if you like the kinds of books I do, you won't regret it. Also, try HOOT.

The boat was dumping sewage into the river, which led to the beach where kids swim and animals play. His dad sunk the boat, but no one believed that the Coral Queen was dumping sewage. Noah and his sister try to prove that their dad is speaking the truth, along with others. After many disappointments, they devise a plan. The plan is to put environment-friendly bright fuchsia food coloring in the casino boat toilets, and then flush. The bright color will seep into the river, and the boat's owner will be jailed. The plan worked, but the owner blackmailed the government and paid only one night's earnings. During the book, Noah also is beaten up, has a newspaper interview, and meets his supposedly \\"dead\\" grandpa and more. Flush is suspenseful, encourages saving the environment, and has unique characters.Flush is suspenseful, like when the security man nearly shoots Noah and Abbey when they are trying to leave the marina after Operation-Flush, and when Noah's parents wake up to find Abbey missing from her bedroom (when she was taping the boat dumping sewage). It was also suspenseful when Noah and Abbey were in a boat on the water and couldn't get back home, because the motor quit.Flush encourages saving the environment, because saving the environment is what the book was about. The whole Operation-Flush thing was about saving the environment (so illegal dumping could be stopped), Noah goes into contaminated waters to save a baby turtle, and this book also talks about the kids picking up litter on the beach.Finally, Flush has many unique characters. One is Shelly, Lice Peeking's girlfriend who lives in a trailer park. Shelly is a bartender and she was the one who got Noah onto the boat to dump the food coloring into the sewage, so without Shelly, the plan would've failed. The next is Abbey, Noah's little sister who had many good ideas and was a childhood biter. That helped when Abbey and Noah were at the boat marina and the security guard caught the two. Abbey bit him, and he felt it. And, one of the most interesting characters is Grandpa Bobby. Grandpa Bobby was supposedly dead after a voyage to Central America, but he showed up in the Keys and hung around for a while before revealing himself. Grandpa Bobby had great stories to tell and had treasure to give to Noah and Abbey (a gold medallion and emerald earrings). Grandpa Bobby got the kids out of tough situations before they knew him, like when Jasper and Bull were beating up Noah. Also, when the security guard was about to shoot Noah, Grandpa was there to save the day.Flush is a great read, since it is suspenseful, environment conscious, and has a ton of interesting characters.-from the desk of E. Hubbard"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Once again, Carl Hiassen uses a collection of interesting individuals and a bit of an oddball mystery to create a funny and entertaining book. But this time it follows in the path of Hoot and addresses a young adult audience. Noah\`s father is in jail for sinking a casino boat because he contends that the owner is dumping the raw sewage tanks illegally in the bay. Noah and his sister Abby, who has a nasty habit of biting people, have typical reactions to their father's very public and embarrassing behavior and they would like him to promise not to do anything else to bring shame to the family. But they eventually get drawn into the situation and become as involved, and perhaps more actively involved than their father was. And of course, there are the requisite quirky, even eccentric characters that are common to Hiassen's work like Lice Peeking, a habitual drunk who used to work for the owner of the casino and Shelly, Lice's current girlfriend who was formerly the girlfriend of the same casino owner.Like Hoot, Flush deals with environmental concerns that younger readers can understand and support. The situations always border on being too unbelievable, but you always want to know what happens next so you stay hooked. Flush is a delightful sail through two kids' adventures in making their community a better place."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I am a sixth grader. The book I read was Flush, by Carl Hiaasen. I liked this book because it had a distinctive plot and that it meant something to me. The book was about a boy named Noah, his dad, his sister Abbey, and a woman named Shelly. The thing it meant to me was that anybody can do something good, even if it is very hard. The problem was that a man who owned a gambling boat in southern Florida was dumping human waste into the Gulf of M&eacute;xico, instead of putting it into tanks, which would cost more. That polluted the water at a beach where many young children like to swim. Noah's father is opposed to people who treat the environment with disrespect. As a result, Noah's dad sinks the man's boat. His dad gets thrown in jail. Noah finds out that his dad is telling the truth when he's told about the dumping. Noah and his sister meet Shelly. She used to work for the dumper, so she knows him personally. She tells Noah that she will help him take the dumper down. She gets a job as a bartender on the dumper's boat after it gets fixed. Noah tries to think up a plan. But, his sister runs away in the middle of the night. When Noah's family finds her, she has a camcorder, and she says that she caught the dumper dumping.

With a little help from Lice Peeking (former worker of the COral Queen) and his girlfriend, the blonde and tough Shelly (former girlfriend of Dusty Muleman), Noah and his sister Abbey, might come off catching Dusty Muleman \\"red-handed\\", or to be more exact, \\"fushia handed\\"......Once again, Carl Hiaasen's second book for young adult readers has the same kind of feeling that has brought us to love Hoot, with characters like Noah and Paine Underwood from Lice Peeking to Dusty Muleman and the bald ape Luno, and even Abbey's and Noah's conscience angel, a certain elderly pirate with an M shaped scar. A fast paced book that's sure to never make you put it down, from the 1st page to the end!"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I like books that explore serious issues. Books that are fun to read but still make you think. Flush by Carl Hiaasen is really about pollution and how people who pollute will deny it, even though they are guilty. Noah's dad sinks a casino that's polluting the water. You have to wonder if two wrongs make a right, but when the casino owners denies it and eveyone believe him, then you really want to see the the casino owner end up in a lot more trouble than Noah's dad. Despite the serious situation, all the goofy characters made me laugh at times. Other books with serious messages that I really liked recently are An Audience for Einstein and the classic novel Flowers for Algernon."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I've read A LOT of Haissen. While I found this book very enjoyable I didn't find some of the things that I see in other Haissen books (like Hoot, a definate 5 star read). For example, we don't get the sort of trade mark glimpses into the lives of the \\"bad\\" guys like we have seen in other books. There is also sort of a premature climax to the book. The last couple of chapters just seemed like padding...Like I said, I did enjoy this book. I wish Amazon would allow me a half star though because I really would have gone with 3.5 instead of 4 if I had the choice.If you are just starting to look at Haissen's books, do yourself a favor and go read Hoot first and then come back to this one later.--David"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I enjoyed this book, which I read aloud with my ten-year-old daughter.

But I was a bit surprised by the sordid settings in some of the book -- trailer park, with two drunk characters passed out on the floor after having fought over a bartender/girlfriend. If you don't want to explain these plot elements to a young child, then you should let this book wait a few years."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Too many curse words and adult references.

It had all the proper ingredients: a good mystery, fascinating and sometimes amusing characters, and a salty plot positively packed with adventure and excitement.In the book, Noah Underwood and his sister Abbey are facing the difficulties that often come your way when your father has been thrown into jail...again. There is a conflict with their mother, who is threatening divorce, and with a couple of local boys, who often get into fights with Noah. But through it all, the Underwood kids are determined to prove their father innocent and get to the bottom of this mystery.I give Flush a 5-star rating because it had a twisted humor that kept my eyes glued to the page. I've re-read it several times, and it never ceases to make me laugh."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Flush, by Carl Hiassen, is an exciting and excellent read for young adults. It has an interesting collection of characters and a story line that is full of twists and turns. It is entertaining and has many hilarious moments. The main character is Noah and he has to function with his dad in jail. His dad was accused of sinking a casino boat for allegedly dumping toilet waste into the bay. His dad's behavior embarrasses Noah and his sister Abbey. Noah decides to help his father and works with his dad's friends to spy on the casino boat and eventually catch it dumping sewage in the bay. Noah has to deal with the casino owner's son who bullies him.The book is a great read for young adults, especially boys who have challenging families. Girls as well as boys will get a kick out of reading the book. The long list of sub plots brings a reality to the writing. The mom possibly leaving dad, Noah dealing with a bully, the grandfather showing up out of the blue, and Noah having to be the man of the house without their dad illustrate the many facets of the characters.The book is a quick read. I listened to it on CD and was able to listen to it in a couple of days. Being on the top ten list for teens was the main reason I chose to listen to the book.

Adults may be familiar with his earlier mysteries, but Hiaasen has since branched into children's literature. Flush is the story of a family and how they deal with the father's well-meaning but legally questionable attempts to make things right where they are wrong. We meet Noah at the beginning as he is waiting to meet his father in a visitor's room...at the local jail. This is not an unusual occurrence, but this is the first time it is for a more weighty reason: Noah's father has sunken a casino boat because he believes that the owner is dumping sewage into a protected area of the Florida Keys. Unfortunately, he does not have substantial evidence that this is the case. Noah's father is a strong believer in doing the right thing, but he doesn't always like to do things by the book. It is more efficient, after all, to do things himself rather than try and get the law involved. Noah and his sister become involved in helping prove their dad correct and have enough adventurous experiences and humorous interludes to fill a book (pun intended!). Along the way, they learn a lot about how there are many different ways of doing the right thing and they don't all have to end in an orange jumpsuit. I loved reading Flush; it's great for kids 10 and up. Adults may enjoy it too, and if you're a Carl Hiaasen fan don't hesitate to read his books for young readers! There's nothing wrong with grown-ups reading kids' books: I do it every day, and meet many other adults and parents who also do so. A good story is a good story, is what I always say."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I understand this book is geared more for young readers, but I just couldn't resist a Carl Hiaasen novel.

The book has the trademark Hiaasen humor, concern about the environment, an ability to turn a plot upside down on a dime, and reverence for what makes youngsters laugh. It's great fun!The main difference between Mr. Hiaasen's \\"adult\\" books and this one shows up in his gentle way of describing everything. He's much harsher in the adult books, but I think the gentle style is actually more appealing. As a result, I heartily recommend this book for young readers \\"of all ages.\\"The book opens with a \\"glug\\" as Noah Carmichael visits his dad in the local jail on Father's Day. No, Noah's dad didn't get drunk: He got even by sinking a floating casino that he believes has been dumping its sewage into the water. There's just one little problem: Noah's dad has no proof. His dad has a heart of gold, but he acts a little impulsively sometimes (how about all the time?).As a point of principle, Noah's dad decides to stay in jail. This creates certain tensions in the family as Noah's mom is overhead to mention the \\"d\\" word that no youngster wants to hear parents use.Eventually, a fully calmed down dad arrives home . . . and swears off tackling Dusty Muleman and his casino while agreeing to pay damages and take anger management classes. At that point, Noah and his sister Abbey decide that they will have to get to the bottom of the toilet bowl. In the best tradition of Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher, the youngsters hatch up and execute a hilarious scheme to catch Dusty \\"red-handed\\" with dyed evidence that tracks back to the casino boat.In between the various comings and goings of the heroes and villains, Noah and Abbey find themselves fighting off Dusty's bully son and his henchman. Abbey's sharp teeth are more than a match for the two. When a mysterious stranger shows up, the Carmichaels become invincible.Before the book ends, there's an unexpected adventure that shows just why you need to be prepared for whatever comes you way.The book's ending nicely resolves all the plot conflicts and deals justice as poetically as it should be dealt. You'll be cheering after many close calls where the authorities seem to be siding with the wrong people."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"'Flush' is a very enjoyable, \\"mystery-light\\" novel that transports the reader to the Florida Keys and are entertained by some shenanigans encountered by a couple of young teens and their too-good-for-his-own-good father. The crime is pretty straightforward: casino ship dumps in waste into the pristine waters of a local bay and beach. It is up to our heroes to come up with creative ways to get the bad guys caught. They get help from some colorful locals, and it helps that the bad guys aren't terribly bright!Hiaasen has inserted all his positive literary qualities into 'Flush'. It is funny, it has a few plot twists, and the characters are either endearing or very much \\"out there\\".

At the beginning of the book, Noah's dad is in jail because he sunk the Coral Queen. Dusty Muleman, the owner of the boat, was dumping sewage in the ocean. The reason why Noah's dad sunk the boat is so that none of the sewage would get in the ocean. Noah and Abbey try to make up a plot to get Dusty Muleman busted for eternity for dumping sewage into the ocean, to prove their father's innocence.My favorite thing about this book was how the book took place in Florida. The plot was really twisty with lots of surprises you never see coming. Watch out, there is some cussing in it! There are fights with a gun and with things blowing up. Read the book Flush: it has adventure, fights, and explosions. This is a five star book and they should make a movie from it! Have fun reading Flush!"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Carl Hiaasen has done it again!

Unfortunately for him, the local authorities disagreed. So while he sits in jail, Noah and his sister, Abbie, set out to find a way to prove that their dad was correct about the toxic dumping and see if they can find a way to protect the local waterways.Hiaasen's story is clever and has great easy to love characters. This book for younger readers has the same tone and humor as do his adult books. And it is so well written that adults will enjoy the story as well. It is a shorter, less involved book than his others, but Hiaasen doesn't \\"dumb down\\" anything for his younger readers. The plot is still rich and exciting and full of savory personalities.

(He didn't, but hey, I'd love to read what the Governor would do after crossing paths with a couple of equally idealistic Florida kids.)"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"There was too much padding in this book for my liking and not enough substance. I read it to my ten year old daughter over three nights and was aware that she was becoming easily distracted. I live in Florida too and as a plus it was comforting to identify with some of the places and things in the novel.However, this could have been shorter which would have created a tension that was ominous by its absence.

Paine Underwood is not your typical criminal. He's just a former Florida fisherman who gets steamed when he sees anyone doing something wrong to the environment. Even Noah admits, \\"Dad just has to work on his self control.\\"Dusty Muleman, owner of the casino ship the Coral Queen, is not being very good to the environment (or so Mr. Underwood says). Noah's father has been arrested for sinking the ship after he speculates that the cheapskate owner is dumping the sewage tank (eeeww!) directly into the ocean rather than paying for the removal of it.Mr. Underwood enlists his son Noah to help prove that he was right about the Coral Queen. Unsure of his father's claim himself, Noah decides that family loyalty wins over his doubts and a quirky mystery ensues. The cast of characters includes Noah's strong-headed sister Abbey, as well as their mother, who doesn't find the whole arrest very funny.

I just thought that it was a good story and I knew that I'd read a sequel or anything else by this author. When this book came out I read it because I didn't have anything else to do.WOW! It was so good. The plot was funnier and more believable than Hoot. THough the characters and their situations were essentially the same, I prefered this one because I liked the protagonist better than the one from \\"Hoot\\" and his little sister was really cool! The best part was the Grandfather. I won't give it away, but it's kind of obvious. He's really awesome, but my Grandfather's cool too, in a different way. The crazy dad is pretty awesome too, and his fixation on Mandela is hilarious!This is, like \\"Hoot\\" and environmental novel, but unlike \\"Hoot\\" it focuses on an entire ecosystem rather than a single species. It delivers the same basic \\"kids can do it\\" message but Hiassen is an amazing author. Seriously, he might be one of the best author's I've ever read. He can take a topic that has been recycled hundreds of times and make it fascinating, absorbing, and completely fresh.Wow, it's late."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Before this book, I hadn't read anything by Carl Hiaasen, though I have heard a lot about him because of Hoot's success. Without even reading the summary, I knew that this novel would probably take on some sort of environmental issue, but I didn't expect it to be so good. This is a book I would have loved as a kid, and is still a good read as an adult. It has a lot of action, intrigue, and great characters.I really liked the relationship between Noah and his little sister Abbey. Their interactions were realistic and Abbey added a humorous element to the story, which I appreciated. I also liked how Abbey is portrayed as a stronger personality than Noah, even though she's his little sister. I'm a sucker for strong female characters, and Hiaasen definitely includes them in this novel.The story itself is awesome. To clear their father's good name, Noah and Abbey take it upon themselves to prove that the Coral Queen is dumping raw sewage into the harbor and enlist the help of a couple of others. Some plot twists were predictable, but there were a few surprises Hiaasen threw in that completely shocked me.Michael Welch's narration was perfect. I love listening to audiobooks when it's told in first person, because it gives an heightened sense of simply being told a story. It's even better when the narrator is able to capture the main character's personality and add some quirks, which is exactly what Michael Welch does.Overall, this story is enjoyable, full of surprises, and carries a good message. It's about kids taking matters into their own hands and helping to right wrongs.

Despite the fact that everyone in the community thinks his dad is crazy, Noah sets out to save him by proving the casino boat owner, Dusty Muleman, is guilty just as his father thought.With the help of Abbey, Noah's curious and brave younger sister who can do anything her minds put her to, and Shelly, the casino boat's tattooed bartender who dislikes Dusty, Noah devises a plan to catch Dusty Muleman. Together, they face dangerous men and risky moves to help Noah's father, but they always find a way out of their problems. Sneaking around in the middle of the night, encountering many dangerous men including Dusty, and stealing private property is just the least of their problems.While trying to save his father by proving Dusty guilty, Noah's adventures gain him friendship, strengthen his family, and help the local environment. Noah gains all this plus greater independence and learns that he has a voice and that his actions can make a difference in the world!I thought this book had an enticing story. I read it for a school project and couldn't put it down. The plot was exciting and full of many twists and turns. The environmental theme of the book is very inspiring and current. It shows its young readers that even they can make a difference in the environment. Haaisen's unique and humorous writing style really brought the characters to life and made them relatable.Despite the fact that there were some holes in the story line and some of the characters including Lice and Grandpa Bobby, weren't fully developed and were somewhat confusing to keep track of, I would recommend this book to anyone that would enjoy reading a heart-felt, short, and funny story."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"This was the first Carl Hiaasen book I read, so perhaps starting with one of his books geared towards young people was an odd choice. I enjoyed this book immensely, and often laughed out loud while reading it.Noah Underwood's father often does wacky things because of his passionate concern for the environment and the human and animal inhabitants of Florida. When he discovers that the local floating casino is dumping raw sewage into local waters he goes to far in his protests and lands himself in jail. Despite a threatened hunger strike and please to the media, Mr. Underwood is not believed and instead is made out by the press to be a looney. Noah's mother is losing patience with her husband, and when Noah's sister Abbey overhears her using the d-word on the phone the siblings realize that the only way to save their family is to prove that their father's allegations of illegal dumping are true.Hiaasen's protagonist is witty and the rest of his family is delightfully quirky. This book has a lot to offer both adults and bright young readers."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"\\"I'm not sorry for what I did, Noah. The only thing I'm sorry about is that you've got to see me locked up like an ax murderer.\\"Imagine if your father was thought of as a crazy hooligan that needed a psychiatrist! Not just by your mother, an environmental lawyer, or your sister, but by all the people in your community! Wouldn't that be ghastly? Paine Underwood, Noah's dad, is held captive in prison for sinking the notorious Dusty Muleman's casino boat, the Coral Queen. His reason: The Coral Queen dumps it's \\"sewage\\" into the water, polluting marine wildlife. You might think, well that's just stupid! But when it comes to the environment, Paine Underwood takes serious measures to help! His drastic deeds land him in the local jail, and he can do nothing to prevent Dusty from repairing the sunken boat. Which is why he asks Noah to complete the job. With school, bullies, and the divorce of his parents, now Noah has a handful of problems to take care after. How will he manage to save the divorce, protect himself, and \\"flush\\" Dusty Muleman scheme out???Personally, I loved this book!!! It's filled with cliff-hangers and suspense-it's sure to keep you up wondering about the outcome! My favorite part is when Noah, his sister, and Shelly (a helper) conduct the Operation \\"Flush\\". I would recommend this thriller to and mystery-fanatics. So if you want to find out what happens in the end, read the book!!!"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"It was a good book GREAT for mystery and adventure seekers.

This book never ran out of things to talk about. It kept on going. As I read it felt like hours were seconds, that's how much I was into it. This book was most definitely a page tuner because you want to know if Noah and Abbey would nail Dusty. It felt like there were two investigators, Noah and myself. As I kept reading I was trying to predict and figure out the end. I would positively recommend it to those people who love mysteries and try figure problems on their own."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Carl Hiaasen has written many best-selling books but none of them better than this one. This latest work \\"Flush\\" looks at greed, (Dusty Muleman a multi-millionaire casino boat owner) the environment, which is represented by Paine Underwood&egrave;, an environment fanatic and a father of Noah and Abbey. Its all about sticking up for what is right. Between them, Paine, Noah, Abbey (Paine's children) and Shelly (Dusty Muleman's ex-girlfriend) attempts to bring down Muleman who has recently been dumping human waste in to the Gulf of Mexico. Would you believe that a toilet plays an important part as well!Most children might not understand the environmental issues that are going on today and how they connect to greed and even crime and corruption.. The connections are that most of the harm to the environment is caused by consumerism and pollution. This book helps the reader to become more aware of the disastrous issues that are going on these days. For example, in the book Dusty is polluting the ocean by dumping human waste into it. By doing this, he doesn't have to pay for the collection of the sewage. Hiaasen is a great teacher to his young readers who don't have the knowledge of what is happening now around the world even though they live in it.Flush is filled with suspense and rising action. Moreover, the language this book uses is a lot easier to read then most books I have read. That is probably because the story is through the eyes of one of the main characters in this book, Noah (Paine's eldest child), who also encourages the reader to take action on pollution.No flUsh in the pan this book! It is every bit as good as any book this reviewer has read in the past year."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"The book I read is called Flush and it's about this kid who try's to get his father out of jail. His father went to jailby sinking a casino boat which was polluting the water. So the kid is trying to prove that the boat is one that is polluting it. This book is kind of a boring book because it takes a long time to get to the climax in this book. The climax is end of the bookie would maybe recommended this book if your a person who likes action, I wouldn't get this book. If you like mystery, buy this book. You choose. I also think this book is a cliffhanger because you want to know if the person will get arrested for polluting or the kid will go to kid jail for destroying the boat again. But they might even win the battle and the war."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Flush was a book full of adventures and interesting characters. When I was reading Flush my mind always thought of what would happen next or what would happen if Abbey and Noah got caught trying to catch the boat dumping raw sewage into the water. This book was defiantly a page- turner at sometimes but not always. Last I would recommend this book to everyone that likes adventures and exiting characters."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Hiaasen scores in his second kid-aimed novel, that can be enjoyed by all. There are enough political and historical references to keep adults interested."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"This was my sons book club reading selection for this month. It is a great book for parents and kids to read together."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"If Ed Abbey came back from the dead, moved to Florida and wrote for kids, maybe this is what we could expect. It's funny, fast, great characters, highly entertaining. Casinos on the waterfront dumping toilet waste in the water is enough to make anybody into an activist--the kid-stars of this novel will endear themselves to all budding environmentalists for sure. I have to admit Hiaasen is a hard name to spell, but the book is a breeze to read. Middle schoolers will love it, especially the boys."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"I had to read this book forn school. My first impression wqas, \\"Wow, nice cover!\\". But this book is so much more than that. Great book from start to finish. I reccomend it to all ages from 6-60!!!!"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"As a fan of HOOT, I was really looking forward to this book. Now I'm disappointed. For one thing, the whole book seems designed to please conservative librarians. The environmental message lacks the subtlety of HOOT's; it's so obvious, it won't offend anyone. And all the *little* messages! No one smokes or drinks without our getting a lecture on the evils of smoking and drinking. No one gets in a car without our noticing that they put on a seatbelt. No one gets in a boat without our being told about putting on a life jacket. Is Hiaasen subbing for Officer Friendly, or what? Also, the ending was dumb. The climax comes off without a hitch, so the author has to throw in a stupid \\"suspense builder\\" that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Worse, we have to learn the entire history (colorful as it is) about an extremely minor character. Seriously, you could yank this guy out and the story would lose nothing. Now, I'm sure most 12-year-old readers won't mind the stuff I've mentioned, and there are some funny moments. But this is not a book that's going to stick with me. Don't pollute. Yeah, Carl, we got it."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"5 star by far!This book kept me on my feet the whole time,what a super amazing book to read. go Noah"},{"Title":"Flush","review":"Carl Hiassin is a favorite!

I didn't like Flush quite as much asHoot, there just wasn't as much mystery. That being said it was still a very good and entertaining book; it touches heavily on environmentalism, corrupt business practice, and family issues.Noah Underwood's father has sunk a gambling ship and been thrown in jail. Noah's dad is positive that the gambling ship is emptying sewage into the ocean. It is up to Noah and his sister Abbey, to prove their father's allegations, to help get him out of jail. With Noah's dad's history of taking extreme action against people who commit environmental crimes, things are also becoming stressful on Noah's parents' marriage. Now it isn't only getting his dad out of jail that is the problem, but trying to keep his parents together. Noah and Abbey set a trap to catch the owner of the gambling ship in the act, but they are in more danger than they originally thought.This was a well done book; it is well-written, easy to read, and moves along at a good clip. I love how Noah's family deals with things and how the theme of environmentalism dominates the story. I think people of all ages can enjoy this book. It is witty and well thought out.Noah learns a lot about corruption and environmentalism throughout the book. Some of the crazy characters involved keep the book fun. It was never boring and never slowed down. As I mentioned, I did enjoyHoota bit more.Hoothad a lot more mystery to it and was more suspenseful than Flush.Overall, another great eco-thriller from Hiaasen. I am looking forward to readingScattoo. Everyone will find something to love in this book it is engaging, discusses some good issues, and is very entertaining.

Carl Hiaasen creates environmental books that keep my students thinking. A must read for all school shelves."},{"Title":"Flush","review":"This was my first venture into Hiaasen's work and I was delighted by both the writing and the plot. As a teacher and avid reader with a special interest in literature for adolescents, this is an engaging read for both kids and adults alike (well...mostly adults with a light-hearted sense of humor). Hiaasen is a master of sarcasm and suspense, and both come together to create a read that is thought provoking and filled with plenty of implications to keep adults laughing and kids reading (Teachers - these also make for great discussion topics). His exploration of ecological issues is timely and yet the story is not the least bit dry or preachy. His situations and characters allow multiple opportunities for connections and reflections. Younger readers will undoubtedly see some part of themselves in a character and the story creates many roadways into discussions about morals and ethics while helping readers develop a desire to know more about current environmental issues. Sometimes the solutions to the mysteries seem to be too apparent, but usually Hiaasen leaves the reader with just enough information to keep guessing and keep reading. Along the way, his cast of characters add believable, quirky, endearing elements to the story as they race to figure out how to expose Dusty Muleman's mischief aboard the Coral Queen. Hiaasen has a original blend of mystery, science, and humor that is unlike any author I've found yet...but that might be because I've been drawn to read his other works and haven't had much time for comparison. I've seen the same is also true with students introduced to his writing - they want to know where they can get more!

On the cover's inside is the inscription \\"Teresa Lee McNeel, December 1930, From Mother.\\" From that, I infer it was given to my own mother by my grandmother on the former's twelfth birthday. While the book has been in my possession for decades, only now have I taken the time to follow Mom's reading trail eighty years later.\\"Now order the ranks, and fling wide the banners, for our souls are God's and our bodies the king's, and our swords for Saint George and for England!\\" - Sir Nigel Loring, rallying the White CompanyTHE WHITE COMPANY, by Arthur Conan Doyle, was first published in serialized form in 1891. It has been asserted that Doyle regarded his historical novels, THE WHITE COMPANY being one of them, more highly than his (now) better-remembered Sherlock Holmes exploits.The place is England and the Continent, the year is 1366 during the reign of the King of the English, Edward III, and his realm is twenty-nine years into The Hundred Years' War with France.The male heroes of the story are three plus one: Samkin Aylward, a grizzled archer of the White Company, an English mercenary force, Alleyne Edricson, a twenty-year old clerk raised by Cistercian monks in Beaulieu Abbey since infancy who's now sent out into the larger world to learn something of it before choosing a permanent vocation, and the red-haired giant Hordle John, a disgraced Brother of the same abbey tossed out because of his self-indulgent ways. The trio then joins a fresh contingent of the White Company raised by the renowned and veteran knight, Sir Nigel Loring, at Castle Twynham in the Hampshire town of Christchurch. Alleyne himself is taken on as Loring's personal squire and, for the two months prior to the company's departure for the Continent, is the tutor of Sir Nigel's teenage daughter, Lady Maude. Edricson is, naturally, smitten, and he goes off to war carrying her green veil as a token of favor.Doyle's novel, written during the time when the Empire still spanned the globe, is, above all, a paean to England and its common men that transformed themselves into their country's stanch expeditionary warrior forces. As a song in the book has it:\\"What of the men?The men were bred in England:The bowman - the yeoman -The lads of dale and fell.Here's to you - and to you!To the hearts that are trueAnd the land where the true hearts dwell.\\"As might be surmised, THE WHITE COMPANY is also a coming-of-age story and a great road adventure. Emerging from the protective cocoon of Beaulieu Abbey, Alleyne is a completely blank slate, a slate upon which will be writ the learning experiences of a journey that will take him to Spain to fight in what will later become known in history as the Castillian Civil War, a peripheral conflict of The Hundred Years' War. Doyle ensures that the values learned mature Edricson into his ideal of a proper and true-hearted Englishman.A main thread that runs through the entire work is chivalry as practiced by an honorable knight, the poster boy being Sir Nigel. A 21st century reader of this 19th century book may find the romantic view of this warrior philosophy somewhat quaint if not downright ridiculous, as perhaps reflected in these words by Loring to an innkeeper when the former learns of the presence of an anonymous but otherwise bellicose knight within:\\"Go tell him that a humble knight of England would make his further honorable acquaintance, not from any presumption, pride, or ill-will, but for the advancement of chivalry and the glory of our ladies. Give him greeting from Sir Nigel Loring, and say that the glove which I bear in my cap belongs to the most peerless and lovely of her sex, whom I am now ready to uphold against any lady whose claim he might be desirous of advancing.\\"Loring is, of course, inviting the other knight to meet him in personal combat on the spot. The contemporary reader may be tempted to mutter, \\"Oh, puhleeeze!\\" However, in 1891, such a challenge, and the courtliness it stemmed from, was likely to be fondly remembered and admired.There was a flip side to chivalry, however. It was a code of conduct that governed relations between members of the nobility only, i.e. from knight on up to princes and kings; there was no obligation for the aristocracy to treat the lower classes similarly. Indeed, a noble landholder could treat his villeins abominably and still be considered chivalrous; only the Church might perhaps prevail upon such a lord to treat his serfs more justly and charitably. Doyle does not shirk from referencing this in the storyline.THE WHITE COMPANY contains thirteen color plates by the painter N.C. Wyeth in a magnificent illustrative style that hasn't been employed in decades.Not surprisingly, Doyle's adventure novel has an old-fashioned air to it. It's a solid tale with a fairly predictable story; there are no plot twists that cause a mental double-take or can claim a \\"gotcha.\\" It was undoubtedly recommended for the adolescent and young adult readers of the period much as I, in my youth, devoured the epic adventures by author Joseph Altsheler, particularly theClassic American Fiction: Altsheler's Young Trailers Series, all 8 novels in a single file, with active table of contents. That said, THE WHITE COMPANY grandly accomplishes what it was penned to do, both entertain and teach moral values."},{"Title":"Ravenskull","review":"I read it myself and loved it--especially reading the sounds, which made my imagination go wild.

She learned English, became a U.S. citizen, eventually earned a Ph.D. in Spanish language and literature, won prizes in photography, poetry and for literary criticism, and became extremely involved in community activism to improve the lot of Latinos in her adopted city of Reno, Nevada. She also traveled back to Chile to help Las Arpilleristas, the mothers and wives of those who &quot;disappeared&quot; under the Gen. Pinochet reign of terror and who were trying to locate the whereabouts (or remains) of their loved ones. These women made tapestries to both publicize and raise money for their cause. Sepulveda helped make a documentary about these women, and it won a Peabody Award.Twenty years after she arrived in the United States, Sepulveda ran for the state senate from her local district. In a grass-roots, pavement-pounding, door-knocking campaign, she got first-hand glimpses into not only the lives of recent immigrants but others among our society's disenfranchised: children and senior citizens in poverty, single mothers and divorcees working low-paid jobs. Her encounters with disaffected gun nuts and others are a bath of cold water, although a measure of humor is included. Sepulveda visited the halls of power not only in Nevada but in Washington, D.C., to raise money for her campaign against a well-heeled, white Republican male, Nevada political insider. The reader may end up feeling as if he or she has run a political campaign.Sepulveda's blow-by-blow account of her campaign - dirty campaign tactics and all (including phoned death threats) - is a captivating chronicle of present American society and our democratic election process. It also spins a compelling tale of an immigrant's journey (early chapters describe life in Argentina and Chile and the Allende saga), and paints a portrait of the slowly emerging clout of Latinos in our country."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Projects Using Microsoft Office Project Server 2003","review":"After having been spoiled by Mr. Chefetz's Project Server 2002 book, I was disappointed in this work. My primary complaint with this book is that it is much less complete than the earlier book. As another reviewer mentioned, this edition does not even have an index. In addition, the coverage of enterprise outline codes, enterprise fields, Project Web Access views, built-in functions and the differences between Project Center and Project views was all less than stellar. The other gripe I have is that what was deliverd in one book before (Chefetz's 2002 book), is now separated into two $50+ books. Is this a conspiracy by the publisher to sell more books?That being said, the basics of MS Project Server were covered, and this book should serve well as an introductory treatment on the subject.I'm still looking for a solid reference manual for the 2003 product.James T.

The first on Project Server 2002 was excellent, just the chapter on how to install and configure Project Server was worth the price of the book. This book \\"Managing Enterprise Project Using Microsoft Project Server 2003\\" is a very good hands-on tutorial style book. It does not give you a tremendous amount of background information around project management or on how to structure a project management office using Project Server as a tool, or why it is that you would do something one way as opposed to aother. But it is a very good intoductory and hands-on book. I have also purchased another of the author's books, and to be honest there is about an 80% overlap in content. Same text, same screen shots, with possibly two chapters being substantially different. So I would caution anyone to purchase more that one title from the author because of the high redundancy factor in the different publications. He has the word processing template down cold. It struck me that the author would make an excellent consultant, because the books tell you enough, without you yourself really being able to do it yourself, which then means you have to rely on their consulting services.

Therefore, even the novice will be able to tie all patterns that are in this book.For the pro the book offers a lot of interesting variations on the topic of tying emergers. I can't wait to get my new patterns on the water."},{"Title":"Tying Emergers: A Complete Guide","review":"Emergers are great because they are easy to tie; fish like dry flies; catch fish like subsurface flies; take advantage of all the glitzy new materials; and are cheap to tie.The Dynamic Duo have another wonderfully well produced fly tyer's pattern book here. The fly selection is broad and tips it's hat at some big names, while covering a lot of great patterns. This is not a how to fish emergers or a field guides. It's about the flies, and will mostly interest tyers.My only complaint as with other books by the dynamic duo is that whoever ties the flies is not a particularly talented tyer. Cross-reference flies tied by, say, Best or Stalcup with the same patterns here, and the ones in Emergers look like badly rolled cigarettes. This is too bad because it leaves a lot of beauty out of the book that should have been here. Some of the patterns covered here look quite alike, but that would not be so if the authors had tied them properly. Also, many new tyer may push through this book tying new pattern in order to build their skills, and will learn many careless habits from these badly tied flies. It does not take a particularly talented tyer to accurately copy the style of a master, and more care should have been taken in providing the flies tied here. In some cases the versions shown here may not be as effective as the originals, or they may work just as well. But the book does not work quite as well without well tied flies.The strength of the overall book still deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Tying Emergers: A Complete Guide","review":"This book starts with a graphic table of contents that I think is so sensible that I wish that all tying books were the same, though I suspect that it could drive up costs. There are photos of each pattern along with a graphic representing the insect type (mayfly, caddis, stonefly, midge), and the patterns are arranged according to tying style, e.g. Tuft Emergers, Parachute Emergers etc. This makes it very easy to look up different patterns, especially because individual pattern names may be all but meaningless; a \\"Perky\\" doesn't mean anything more to me than an \\"MP43\\" unless I can see them.There are three text chapters following the introduction. The first, on emerger design and materials, is very interesting, and provided me with some information that I did not previously have.The next, on basic tying techniques, is probably unneccessary for many tyers who already possess the requisite skills for tying most of the patterns in the book, but I suspect that the publisher insists that a chapter like this be included in case a beginner picks it up as his or her first tying book. I would not recommend this book for a beginner, even though many of the patterns are fairly easy to tie. On the other hand, the intermediate tyer (and I put myself in that category) might find the chapter useful at times as a reminder for certain techniques.The third text chapter, which is about trailing shucks and bubble sheaths, is particularly useful and informative. It provides techniques that tyers like myself may not have mastered or even have been exposed to. I wouldn't be surprised if advanced tyers might find this information useful as well.The rest of the book is devoted to the individual patterns. Each chapter begins with a brief discussion of the individual pattern style, followed by tying instructions for each individual pattern. As always, Schollmeyer and Leeson's photographs and instructions are clear and well presented. I particularly like that the finished pattern has a green background whereas the photos of the tying steps have blue backgrounds. This is a nice organizational touch.It is possible that the authors have overlooked some patterns or techniques, but this book provides more than enough information to keep most of us busy for a long time. In fact, my only criticism, and it really isn't one, is that there are so many patterns and techniques that I want to try that I sometimes don't know where to begin.Though it is not really a good book on basics for the beginner, Tying Emergers is a worthy addition to any tyer's library."},{"Title":"Tying Emergers: A Complete Guide","review":"Book is great and is a very good addition to my library.

My interest in this publication is twofold, stemming primarily from having grown up in the area covered by the survey and secondarily from an ongoing curiosity about the history, archaeology, paleontology and geology of the Upper Trinity River.I gave this \\"survey\\" two stars simply because almost anything from the 1965 surveys for the Forney Reservoir (Lake Ray Hubbard), archaeological, paleontological or geological is in the rare book category as far as the lay public is concerned. Why this is the case baffles me because, as scientific surveys go, most of the Rockwall/Forney Reservoir materials I have managed to track down are notably devoid of detailed information.So far Bob Slaughter's little pamphlet takes the prize for cramming the least amount of data into the least number of pages. The maps are perhaps the most valuable elements in this publication serving as nostalgic artifacts harkening back the Antediluvian (pre-'65) world of the East Fork River bottoms and cottonfields some of us remember. I'm not knocking Professor Slaughter's expertise; I just wish he had shared more of it with us. As it is, the crux of the biscuit in these little liner notes is: \\"We need to send some grad students over to Rockwall to comb through the piles of dirt and rock the draglines are heaping up. They're likely to find some nifty new fossils and it will hardly cost anything.\\"Great advice but if anyone followed it, I have not yet found any evidence of it. Maybe they were just as tight lipped as Bob.You can get more out of the old Soil Conservation District surveys which are still available if you look long and hard enough. If you look longer and harder, K.E. Walker and George Wilson's geological surveys of the Upper and Lower Rockwall Quadrangles from circa 1948-1949 done as Masters thesis papers provide some truly quality data sets.Dessamae Lorraine wrote some companion pieces from the archaeological perspective but I've been told they are just as skimpy as Bob Slaughter's laconic little opus. Just the same, I scanned all 11 pages and saved them in my archives. You never know when an obscure sentence or two will pull the whole thing together at some future point and despite my disparagement, I do sense the presence of such in Dr. Slaughter's book.The final word to my fellow snipe hunters: snag copy if you find one but don't pay more than five bucks including shipping."},{"Title":"Perspectives on Paul","review":"A very scholarly and educated look at Paul as he was known by scholars in 1969-1971.

It is a series of four novellas contained in two books, each novella involving one of the four Trek television series, with a prologue that involves the fifth. Not only is the concept intriguing, but DeCandido does a wonderful job with the first book. It contains a wonderful mix of the characters we know and the ones that he has created, along with characters who were briefly shown in a television episode whom he has fleshed out to a great degree. The first book is a knockout punch, and I enjoyed it very much.DeCandido has created a very logical way to bring the five television series together into one set of books. It does feel a bit stretched, as yet again the main cast of each show are involved in the same events, but at least DeCandido involves other ships and people as well, lessening that impact a little bit. DeCandido makes good use of the formerly incidental characters from the television series to flesh out the story. Even better, though, the stories are told completely from their viewpoint, so that all of the familiar characters that we know and love are seen from an outsider's view. I found this very effective, as we got to see our heroes as other see them without delving into their thought processes.In the first story, DeCandido has created a vibrant crew that is interesting to read about. Decker is the only character from the television series, all other characters being original. Decker matches what little we know about him from the series, and the rest of the crew comes across very well also. Takashewada is Decker's no-nonsense first officer who keeps him in line when he wants to go against the book. She's completely against the imposition of martial law on the planet and is ready to tell Decker in no uncertain terms about it when she gets the chance. Fortunately for Decker, she never does, as the situation is resolved before that can happen. She's very determined but you can also tell that she really likes Decker, and that he finds her a very valuable officer. Dr. Rosenhaus is a bit too much of a Dr. Bashir (from the series Deep Space 9) clone, given that he's a young doctor excited to be out on the frontier. He's arrogant and thinks he can fix anything, as well as thinking that he knows better than some of the old hands. However, the relationship he develops with Dr. McCoy of the Enterprise is wonderful. When they first meet, sparks fly as arrogance clashes with experience and McCoy's crotchetiness. Soon, though, a healthy respect develops, especially after Rosenhaus goes off half-cocked and almost kills an experimental subject. Rosenhaus learns some humility when McCoy doesn't berate him (too much) for what happened. Other crew members do well in the limited parts that DeCandido gives them, and all of them seem to have distinct personalities no matter how little screen time they have.Much the same can be said for the second story, and the crew of the Odyssey. DeCandido tries to do a couple of things in this story. In the television episode in which the Odyssey appears, there is a healthy dislike between Keogh and Lieutenant Dax. This story gives us the reason why, which helps flesh out Keogh and also provides another dimension to the episode. There aren't as many new characters in this story, but DeCandido does a good job with them as well. Especially effective is Orta, who is a Bajoran terrorist from a Next Generation television episode. DeCandido gives him a lot of background and broadens him a lot. He's a terrorist, not a freedom fighter. He fought Cardassians because he hated them, not because he wanted to free Bajor. DeCandido paints a wonderful picture of a man who's lost in his own insanity. When Orta finally makes his move, his reasoning keeps on changing as Kira and Dax point out the logical holes in each story he tells. Descending deeper and deeper into madness, you almost start feeling pity for him for what he's gone through and what he has finally become.What I found most effective about these stories, at least to me as a Trek fan, is the sense of tragedy that is evoked. Both the Constellation and the Odyssey were destroyed with all hands in the television episodes where they appear. Both of these stories take place shortly before that. We are getting to know these characters, getting to like them, and then we realize that they are not going to survive much longer. I liked that, and it's a tribute to DeCandido's characterization that we wish we had more time with them. Also, the fact that most of the crew is created by DeCandido gives us the possibility that not all of the characters will survive the story, which provides a nice bit of extra tension.There isn't a whole lot to say about the plot. The stories are interesting, but nothing that special. I found the characters much more interesting than the plot, which is just as well. The plots are almost Trek-by-numbers, which isn't always a bad thing, especially in a franchise series of books. They do their job well, and don't get in the way of the characters. I liked that. We don't get a lot of information about the Zalkat Union, which makes the artifacts little more than McGuffins, though they are at least used in each story. It's the characters that make this book worth reading, and any Trek fan will enjoy it because of that. If you like Star Trek, I think you will like this book. I just hope the second book in this series is as good as the first.David Roy"},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"Star Trek: The Brave and the Bold, Book One written by Keith R.A. DeCandido is the first book in a so far two book series that will encumpus all of the Star Trek genre.This first book starts out with with Captain Jonathan Archer and the crew of the Starship Enterprise NX-01. This portion of the story takes place shortly before the \\"Enterprise\\" first-season episode \\"Breaking the Ice.\\" This adventure spans three generations of TREK as we will eventually fine out.This whole story starts to unfold as Archer and his crew find evidence about what will be known as the Malkus Artifacts... four very deadly machines that wielded absolute power to the person who controlled them. One was capable of controlling the weather, one imparted a fatal virus, one served as an immensely powerful energy weapon, and the final device could be used to channel telepathy.Archer decides to issue an all out alert warning to other vessels that the Federation needs to find these machines before they fall into the hands of those who would do ill with them... you see these machines emmit an energy signal that is unique to these machines, when they're active.Now, the book carries us to the ST-TOS timeframe. This portion of the story takes place shortly before the STAR TREK first-season episode \\"Balance of Terror.\\" This is where the artifacts are now being found. You see they were scattered throughout the Alpha Quadrant to keep others from getting total control of the awesome power when combined.This book starts at 2151 in the Trek Universe, next 2266, and then 2370. So, we get a good sprinkling of the characters in these time frames. Captain James T. Kirk and the U.S.S. Enterprise and Commodore Matt Decker of the U.S.S. Constellation come across the first artifact on the colony world of Alpha Proxima II. This colony is plagued by disease... a mysterious plague that has the Federation has to stop. Order on Proxima is getting to a fever pitch where a cure needs to be found or all will be lost, the location of the artifact is paramount to the solution.Now, around a hundred years later, Commander Benjamin Sisko of Deep Space Nine, it's good to see his character in this book series again, is trying to start a farming colony on Bajor's second moon with the help of Captain Declan Keogh of the U.S.S. odyssey. You, guessed it the second artifact has been discovered and now a massive scales destruction threatens this operation. Bajoran terrorists, headed by Orta, are at the heart of this uprising.This book is a very fast read and the action-adventure flows well as the Federation's best and brightest try to solve this very ancient mystery. I hope book two of this series is as good as this first one was, until then... I will report soon on the second book."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"Star Trek The Brave and the Bold is a great book for thos who want a light read. The plot spans three decades, three Enterprises. They aren't short stories but they sort of reads like short stories. They each have a connection to each other. The first \\"story\\" i set in the time of the television show \\"Enterprise. It basically introduces you about what the Malkus artifacts are. It's only a couple pages long. The second \\"story\\" is set one hundred years later in the time of the show \\"Star Trek\\". The two star ships U.S.S. Constalation, and U.S.S. Enterprise(both Federation starships) are investigating a plague on the planet \\"Alpha Proxima\\". The next \\"story\\" is set another hundred years in the twenty third century. The two starships Oddysey and Deep Space 9(DS9) are working together to build a farming colony on \\"Bajors\\" second moon. But when a Bajoran terrorist named Orta who disguised himself as a farmer plans to hijack the Oddysey they see his what he truly wants.The Brave and the Bold is a good light read.

The best stories are the ones that have some reference to past shows. This one does a good job with the Decker character Kirk meets in the episode &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot;. I wish there was more about Decker's rise to the captain's chair. He came up from the security department and has a much different view of the world than Kirk. Perhaps we can see prequel or short story in the future about the crusty Captain Decker."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Since I am an amateur Star Trek chronologist, I really enjoyed the notes at the beginning of each section placing them in to Star Trek timeline. I wish more authors would do that.The book was well written and it was refreshing to read stories about characters other than the series regulars. I would recommend the S.C.E. series to anyone who liked this book. They both are about new and different characters."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"The series is a familiar concept among books; weapons of mass destruction, but the idea of bringing in crews to help the familiar cast was unique in that these crews meet fatal ends later in the show itself. We know this is true because the shows have been televised, so it's not really a surprise to say this here. What is the surprise is being able to catch a glimpse into the lives that were snuffed out by one tragedy or another.DeCandido's writing is true to the characters and he captures each interaction very well. There are also spurts of humor or the occasional one-liner that you would expect to find within a Star Trek novel or show. Some of the points of history I found a little confusing, however, such as the fact that the new farming colony Kira is helping to build on one of Bajor's moons is called New Bajor, which was actually a colony in the Gamma Quadrant. It didn't put me off from the book, though and would probably only make the more intense fans of DS9 scratch their heads.I look forward to finishing the second book, which should be easy to do since these books are well written and easy to get lost in. They're also quick reads, good for a few hours of free time spent with your favorite characters."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"Closer to three stars than to five, still, I'd say that this book (made up of two related novellas, one featuring Kirk & the Enterprise, one featuring the cast of DS9, and an intoduction featuring Archer & the \\"Enterpise\\" cast) is enough better than average to merit four stars. The plots seem to be a bit formulaic, but not too bad for all of that, and the characters are handled reasonably well, especially those minor characters that we only saw as expendable extras in the episodes that they originally appeared in. The character of Commodore Decker, in particular, seemed quite true to what we saw in \\"The Doomsday Machine\\"."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"I was first introduced to DeCandido's writing while attending a Northwest Fandom Convention where I had the pleasure of observing him as a panelist. I was curious if his unique perspective and point-of-view was maintained in his writing. To my pleasant surprise it was.DeCandido presented the major characters in all of the Star Trek series with a fresh and new prospective, by allowing the reader to view the old, seasoned characters from an outside viewpoint. This book is a wonderful chance to see Kirk, McCoy, and Spock through the eyes of the crewmen on the USS Constellation and watch the characters of Deep Space 9 as perceived of Captain Keogh and the crew of the USS Odyssey.This is truly great adventure for the Star Trek fan."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"...&quot;Brave and the Bold&quot; is for you.

Pretty straight-forward for both plot and characters w/enough twists and turns to keep things interesting..."},{"Title":"The Brave and the Bold, Book 1 (Star Trek)","review":"In recent years there has been a disturbing trend in \\"Star Trek\\" to rehash previous material ad nauseum and here is yet another example. The basic premise for this two book series is actually clearly [an imitation of]the animated \\"Star Trek\\" episode \\"Slaver Weapon\\", written by Larry Niven and based on his non-Star Trek story \\"The Soft Weapon\\". There is even a hint of the episode \\"The Lorelei Signal\\" thrown in for good measure as well. Not that I'm surprised by this, if you look carefully the horrendously bad incarnation of \\"Star Trek\\" that was \\"Voyager\\" also frequently rewrote episodes of the animated \\"Star Trek\\", yet the original versions were always more intelligent despite being conceived for a juvenile audience. I think it says a lot about the state of modern \\"Star Trek\\" writers and fans that this should be so. Anyway back to this work and after a mildly enjoyable \\"Enterprise\\" introduction the writer delivers a largely pointless \\"Star Trek\\" adventure that has about as much life as a Vulcan stag night; while finishing off with an equally bland \\"DS9\\" story that also seems to have ejected its' warp core. Gone are the interesting characters of old, gone is the action and excitement, and gone is the intelligent drama. Instead we have another soap opera in space with weak characterisations, laughable action, and a plot so stupid even a Pakled wouldn't find it mentally challenging. So the sorry decline of \\"Star Trek\\" continues, and it looks as though after all the battles with Klingons, Romulans, Borg, and Cardassians, the enemies that will finally finish off the Federation are [weak] writers.

Rabbi Twerski is a Torah scholar, a practicing psychiatrist, and a professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine.In forty brief chapters, which include an introduction and an epilogue, Rabbi Twerski covers such issues as \\"Romance Versus True Love,\\" \\"Reacting to Criticism,\\" \\"Communication,\\" \\"Anger,\\" \\"Sharing Responsibilities,\\" and \\"Gender Differences.\\" He also touches on sound child rearing practices and the particular difficulties that people face when they marry for the second time. Throughout this book, Rabbi Twerski quotes passages from the scriptures and imparts words of wisdom from great Torah scholars and other professional marriage counselors to illustrate his points. He also includes examples of newly married couples who run into trouble because they are immature, fail to communicate, carry heavy emotional baggage, or lack understanding of gender differences.Rabbi Twerski's writing style is clear, concise, and compassionate. Having worked one-on-one with many troubled individuals throughout his long career, he understands thoroughly the saying by the Roman dramatist Terence: \\"Nothing human is alien to me.\\" This book contains the usual advice about the importance of respect, the advisability of talking over important issues before the wedding, and the value of counseling. The book's added dimension comes from its emphasis on spirituality and an adherence to Torah-true principles throughout one's life.In a chapter called \\"Rambam: The Supreme Marriage Counselor,\\" Rabbi Twerski quotes the great sage, Maimonides, who said: \\"A husband should respect his wife even more than himself and should love her as himself.\\" This seems to reverse the Talmudic text, which says: \\"A husband should love his wife as himself and should respect her even more than himself.\\" Why does the Rambam place respect first and love second? Being a practical man, he understood that loving your spouse as much as you love yourself is a very difficult plateau to reach, considering how self-centered most people are. However, a man can and should treat his wife with respect from day one. Mature marital love usually takes much longer to achieve.If you want to give an engaged couple a truly useful gift, consider buying them this handbook and/or Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis's \\"The Committed Marriage,\\" both of which have sound advice about how to make your marriage satisfying and fulfilling while living a life dedicated to Torah and mitzvot."},{"Title":"English from the Roots Up, Volume II: Help for Reading, Writing, Spelling and S.A.T.

I initially thought I would not read the technical stuff, as this does not interest me. However, because it was so well and so clearly written, I have read it all with great interest. The illustrations throughout are superb.Because I plan to travel in Eastern Europe, I had hoped for more information on the rail journeys in that part of the world. There is little coverage of rail travel there, and I can only assume that this is because there are no great rail journeys to be taken."},{"Title":"The Catskills,","review":"This book, though published in 1918, remains readable for anyone interested in the Catskills and the outer reaches of NYC generally. Longstreth made his trek on the eve of the time when the Catskills were yet to become an annex of the City, and they were still, with a little imagination, Rus, even downright wilderness. They were already a Park, however. The book is full of lore, quite a lot of it woods lore; people were still killin' baars on this tree, some of them. But the author starts out by describing an argument between himself, a committed walker, and an automobilist who never walked anywhere. So things were changing. Nonetheless, even today, look out the window of an Amtrak train (put away the smartphone, for the love of God) at these mountains, when you're rolling through the Upper Hudson Valley. A little imagination, just a little, should restore these flat-topped monsters to something unmistakeably prior to Borsht Belt BS. Hey, the Three Stooges got started at Coney Island! Leave the Catskills to the Catskills!"},{"Title":"The Prince Who Ran Away: The Story Of Gautama Buddha","review":"This is one of the most moving and best books for children about Buddha's life. There are many other good books, but this one is really straight forward and clear in his life's details. I would use this books with others to teach about Buddha, but this book would be the cornerstone while teaching about his life on Earth."},{"Title":"The Prince Who Ran Away: The Story Of Gautama Buddha","review":"This is a wonderful, simple story about the life of Gautama Buddha with beautiful illustrations. It covers all the basic \\"facts\\" of the story of Prince Siddhartha. The images (and story) are strong and I worried my 5 year old might be frightened as she is easily upset. However, she LOVES this book and is fascinated by both the story and illustrations."},{"Title":"The Prince Who Ran Away: The Story Of Gautama Buddha","review":"This book is well written, well done and informs on the life of Buddah. Absolutely fascinating. My 4-year old daughter wants this story every other night..."},{"Title":"The Prince Who Ran Away: The Story Of Gautama Buddha","review":"This is a must read for any parent, auntie or friend of a child who is interested in the story of Buddha-how his parents tried to protect him from the world, how he rebelled and what the consequence of that was!! He truly gave his life for the benefit of all beings!!"},{"Title":"The Prince Who Ran Away: The Story Of Gautama Buddha","review":"This is the first children's picture book I've seen about the life of the Buddha, so I find it interesting for that alone. It is beautifully, though at times a bit garishly, illustrated but with the Mara depicted in it, this might have been what illustrator Fahimeh Amiri was going for. Regardless of subject, however, I sometimes think there are simply too many colors in a few illustrations when I believe a subject demands subtler colorings, but this is likely just a matter of personal taste. Besides that, the illustrations are fine except for the one of Siddhartha in his ascetic phase when he, in this picture, resembles one of those extra terrestrials I've seen in movies before. Also, in the illustration of the prophet looking at baby Gautama's feet, the feet look to be half the length of the baby's body. I say these things not to be picky but because they distracted me from the story, which I think is relevant. There are some perfectly beautiful illustrations too, that do not distract with either too much color or with distortions. One is of the Buddha meditating under the Bo Tree, when Mara is sending down fierce rains and the king of the cobras shelters Gautama from the rain. There's a color theme at work here, too, rather than the clash visible on other pages.The story proceeds as is known--prince is born, mother dies, prophecy induces king to shelter prince from sorrow and pain, prince finds out anyway and, after a brief marriage, sets out to find the cure of suffering becoming, ultimately, the Buddha. No surprises here. Suffice it to say, however, that my 7 year old son is mad about this book, stares with wonder at the illustrations and listens intently to the story.As an introduction to the Buddha for elementary school kids, it's a good choice."},{"Title":"The Prince Who Ran Away: The Story Of Gautama Buddha","review":"I read a great review of this years ago in \\"Tricycle\\" magazine. Finally, I bought it (quick service in good condition). My son, age 8, read it and did not like it. Siddhartha's encounter with death made my son sad, and he never read it again.More recently, my younger son, age 4, asked to be read it. He was okay, but when my older son heard it he got sad, again. The next day he began thinking that, one day, he will die. I know every kid thinks this at some point, but it was interesting that this book was the trigger.Colorful and well told (perhaps too well told, for my son). Inspiring and not insipid."},{"Title":"A Long Undressing: Collected Poems 1949-1969","review":"It is clear from the titles A LONG UNDRESSING first published in 1971 and COMING UNBUTTONED, James' autobiography published in 1993 thatJames liked to take his clothes off.

If you look on a world map, you'll see it was because India and Israel are not really that far away from each other by sea. It turns out that India was good for the Jews. Because of the region's tolerance for ethnic diversity--the Indians saw Jews as just another cast--a Jewish community flourished in Cochin for thousands of years, without prejudice or pogroms. Women had much more equality within the Cochin Jewish community than they have had elsewhere. Anthropologist Barbara Johnson first met Ruby Daniel, one of the outspoken members of that community, when she visited Cochin in the 60s and formed a deep friendship that continues today, although Ruby, now in her 80s, has immigrated to Israel with most of the community (even the synagogue was transported, thanks to wealthy American benefactors, and is now on display in the Jewish Museum). The book is told in Ruby's marvelous voice and is a fascinating tale. I gave it to my mom as a gift and she loved it."},{"Title":"Ruby of Cochin: An Indian Jewish Woman Remembers","review":"its one of the fantastic reveiw of the jewish life in india and particulary cochin, unknown to the jewish people around the world even in israel"},{"Title":"Ruby of Cochin: An Indian Jewish Woman Remembers","review":"After living in India and visiting the famous Paradesi Synagogue, I was interested in learning more about the Cochin Jews. This once thriving Jewish community has now diminished to less than ten Jews. Ruby of Cochin: An Indian Jewish Woman Remembers provides a first-hand account of life in Cochin during the first half of the twentieth century.Ruby Daniels was born in 1912 and immigrated to Israel in 1951. With the assistance of Barbara C. Johnson, an anthropologist, Ruby describes what life was like during that era. A wide array of black and white photographs enhances this memoir.Initially, I found it difficult to become engaged in Ruby&#8217;s story. The narrative was cluttered with facts and details, but at the same time included information that might be lost without her recollections. Once I started focusing on the major ideas, I began to see how important Ruby&#8217;s writing contributes to our understanding of Indian Jewry.She candidly talked about the clashes between different groups of Jews, discrimination against women, and her experiences working for the Indian government and Women&#8217;s Royal Indian Navy. The chapters that focus on traditions and customs enhance our understanding of Indian practices, superstitions, and ethnic songs. Apparently, Hindu superstitions permeated the neighboring Jewish community. The latter part of the book provides insight into why most of the Indian Jews immigrated to the Israel and Ruby shares her vivid memories of adjusting to life on a kibbutz.In retrospect, I wish that I had read this book before visiting Jew Town in Cochin. Anyone planning to visit the Paradesi Synagogue should definitely read it as well as anyone interested in Indian Jewry or Jewish women around the world."},{"Title":"Ruby of Cochin: An Indian Jewish Woman Remembers","review":"Interesting book. It features the memoirs of aJewish woman and describes a Jewishcommunity living in India."},{"Title":"Ruby of Cochin: An Indian Jewish Woman Remembers","review":"Deftly written with the assistance of Barbara C. Johnson (Assistant Professor of Anthropology, Ithaca College), Ruby Of Cochin: An Indian Jewish Woman Remembers is the personal memoir of Ruby Daniel, a Jewish woman born in the East Indian community of Cochin in 1912 and educated at a convent school, and then attending St. Theresa's College. In World War II she served as a member of the Women's Royal Indian Navy, and subsequently immigrated to Israel in 1951, and currently resides on an Israeli kibbutz. Ruby Of Cochin is a rich and engaging autobiographical story enhanced with historical legends, folk tales, and women's songs in the local language of Malayalam. Highly recommended reading, Ruby Of Cochin is a simply fascinating window into one woman's life in East India."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"This book was hilarious and the title was funny enough to sucker my husband into reading it. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"I did review Pregnancy Sucks, and found it a bit humorous. While in the bookstore I had also taken a look through Pregnancy Sucks for Men.Mind you, in the other review I mentioned that this was one woman's personal story through one pregnancy. This is the flipside, her husband's story. And... well, if my husband had been anyone who needed this kind of advice, my pregnancy would suck as well.I don't know if the fact that I don't have a Y chromosome (and therefore couldn't \\"get\\" the humor) or that I wasn't in a receptive mood... but this really wasn't all that funny. Husband must humor the pregnant wife, husband must be given a clue about what all is going on, husband must smile and nod at his wife's antics. Give me a break, wasn't this stuff covered in the old Honeymooner's episodes? How many years ago?I know my husband would be offended by this book. But hey-- there are tons of people out there who may enjoy what really turned me off, and if they learn something out of it, then bully for them. While I did enjoy Joanne's book, Jeff's was left at the bookstore. My advice is to actually take a peek inside and decide if its humor is for you."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"I bought this book for my husband to read (and I was surprised that he actually read it), but I ended up reading it, too. There were some funny parts to this book, but overall, I liked it because it was a quick, easy read and it was a nice change from all of the very serious Pregnancy books that I was reading before having my first child."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"\\"Your wife might take a dump on the delivery table\\"...is just one of the great sentences in this horrible book. Oh yeah...and if the doctor cuts her, don't worry, this book tells her just to get a \\"happy husband stitch\\". Nevermind that lovemaking will be incredibly painful for her....!! Oh, unless you have a c-section, in which case it will just be your hormones to deal with.What a terrible book."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"I agree with the other reviewer, this book is utterly condescending. Give me a break. I need to be told to take the trash out when my wife is eight months pregnant? I need to be told not to go buy a new leather jacket because we need maternity clothes?Why dont they just go the extra step and tell me I should really loosen my \\"woman's\\" chain that has her locked to the stove during the seventh month!If you are actually relatvely mature, and scared about all to expect during pregnancy, you should read some of your wife's books-If you are a high school junior, and about to become a father, tips like \\"Turn off your playstation and rub her belly\\" and \\"Don't tell her she has more nipple hair then you do\\" may actually help you out....I know this book was trying to be humorous....but..ughhh, give me a break... it made me feel like a caveman...and for future refererence, I dont need to be told to kiss my wife's belly and talk to it to \\"make her feel better and make her feel like you are trying to bond\\" NEWS FLASH.... I am trying to bond!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"My wife and I found out we were pregnant and it was a HUGE surprise to us because we were not planning it. So I went out to buy some books to calm my nerves a bit. This book was a WRONG choice from page one. I think this poor guy who wrote the book had a miserable wife that experienced the worst pregnancy EVER!!! My wife didn't go through half of this stuff, neither did 80% of my friend's wives. If you like being scared out of your socks and prepared for the worst, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"This book is an outrage. The people who have commented that it is funny, and OMG, their husbands actually read it, are fools. If you are looking for educational value, you have come to the wrong place. I would be surprised to know that the authors of this book are not in some way affiliated with the anesthesiologists bank accounts, considering all they do is sing praise to the epidural Gods, and encourage vaginal brutality- aka: episiotomys. But wait, is there any mention of what exactly an epidural or episiotomys is?? Not exactly, there is nothing stating the facts, risks, pros or cons of any of the above. Perhaps that is because there is nothing AT ALL in this book informational. I would be horribly embarrassed to associate with any man (or woman) that got any enjoyment out of this demeaning, worthless book. Please, I beg any of you who are hoping to learn about healthy, positive, birthing options, stay far, far away from this book, and encourage others to do the same. It deserves no stars, not one, but I didn't know if no stars was an option."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"The world does not need another book that plays on all the negative stereotypes about pregnant women and the \\"yes-dear\\" men who must put up with them. Not every pregnant woman is an irrational, raving bitch, and not every husband is a Neanderthal who needs to be instructed to be sensitive and kind to his pregnant wife.Typical line in the book \\"She got her head out of the toilet just long enough to nag at me\\" (I don't have the book in front of me, so I'm paraphrasing).This book is best for clueless frat-boys, but anyone with a little maturity can find much better books for expectant fathers (\\"Husband Coached Childbirth\\", for example)."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"I bought this as an alternative to the what to expect series, which I found to be a bit clinical for my taste. I liked how funny it was, just what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"This book was better than all of the other typical pregnancy books out there for the women to read! It was informative and hilarious! Of course my husband didnt read it unless I made him or read it to him, but it was something funny for him to relate to and to follow along with the pregancy. Every chapter dealt with the phases of pregnancy and informed him the reasons behind the cravings and to obey the hungry prego, too funny! I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone and it is a great gift for anyone that has a sense of humor!!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"If you're a first timer, this is worth the read. A few small gems in here for every man. Not that I personally agree with everything written, this does however provide some useful insight into what we expectant fathers might have coming our way and also what we can't possibly imagine that lay ahead, waiting for us."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"I bought this book for my husband when we got pregnant and reading and laughing about the things in this book gave us something fun to do together. This book is intended to take the bad things that happen during pregnancy and make it into something you can laugh about with your partner. It's good to find the humor in things but if you can't laugh at yourself a bit, I wouldn't buy this book. Otherwise, I'd definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"Bought this for my son-in-law and my daughter got hold of it first and laughed till she cried. My son-in-law who is not much of a reader, absolutely loved this book. The author definately has a way with words that will have you in stitches and puts a definate different spin on the man's point of view when the wife is pregnant. Well worth the read:)"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"This was recommended by a friend, and as I started reading, i was unimpressed. I kept it up because I figured I'd at least say I had one pregnancy book while my wife was pregnant. By the time i caught up with where we were (month 4), i kept a month ahead and realized that no sooner had I read about it, it would happen. Now, the writing style isn't always my favorite, and I skipped most the quotes (personal preference) but the general info and expectation setting is pretty good. I will recommend this to my friends with the caveat of take it as a guidebook, not the gospel and its helpful.It does not go into philosophical debates about breastfeeding or tell you to massage your wife's back all the time because you should give up your soul... but it does help explain why/when your wife may start asking for a back rub. and for me, it was helpful to get a little heads up and understanding so at least there was a chance I'd say yes. Recommended."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"I love What To Expect When You're Expecting and all those books that get technical and super detailed but Pregnancy Sucks is a nice something else. I bought Pregnancy Sucks For Men for my husband to give him some perspective on pregnancy that the technical books couldn't give him. I think it's working. I enjoy reading Pregnancy Sucks For Men also because it lets me know what he thinks about whats going on with me.I dig it.*The title gives you the vibe for the book.

After we received Pregnancy Sucks for Men for a shower gift, my husband and could laugh and relax a little more about the prospect of becoming parents. This book was very funny. Both of Kimes books Pregnancy Sucks and Pregnancy Sucks for Men are hilarious as well as informative. I am going to give them as gifts for every baby shower!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"When my wife was enduring some very un-funny complications (near tragic), this very funny (and informative) book was the emotional medicine I needed in staying the course as the rock of support. Until I read this, it was very difficult to find reason to laugh."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"When we found out that we were going to have another child, we were very excited. The day after we let my Mother-In-Law know about her daughter's pregnancy, I was given this book. I looked at her, and rolled my eyes. This was our second child, having had a boy 8 years ago. However, I decided to humor my mother-in-law and read the book. The book counts upwards, starting with the \\"Art of Conception\\" to the \\"Ninth Month\\" to \\"Home Sweet Hell\\". In reading the book, I found out that I seemed to have forgotten most of the things that happen during pregnancy since my first child. The author has an amusing account of when he and his wife went through their pregnancy, and the many things/obstacles that the husband will have to face. I would always read the book next to my wife at night, and then would read her parts of the book, told from the husband's point of view. Some parts we laughed together, and others I was playfully hit for agreeing with the author.I did enjoy the book, and had to give thanks to my mother-in-law after reading it on making a good choice. It was interesting to read certain parts, and compare this pregnancy to our first one. Where the first pregnancy was filled with morning sickness, extreme moodiness, and food cravings.... all we had this pregnancy was the extreme moodiness.Some of the reviewers here did not recommend the book, because they thought it would scare expectant fathers. My feeling is that everyone gives you advice on what to expect when you are expecting. Some of it is good, and some of it will be bad. And some of the horror stories you hear from fellow parents can definitely make you question what you have gotten yourself into. This is just one long humorous account of advice that has some very good points, and then a couple that may or may not happen. Every pregnancy is different, but in the long run will produce the best thing that has every happened to you. Enjoy !"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. My husband isn't much of a reader, but wanted some information that would be helpful to him during our first pregnancy. We thought that since this book was co-authored by a man and had a funny title it would be a fun read and a suitable guide for how to deal with a \\"crazy pregnant\\" wife.The book seems to have been written exclusively by the female co-author with the man's name listed as a co-author simply to lend credibility and make you believe it's from a man's point of view. My husband only read a few pages in before discarding it. So that it would not be a total waste of money, I attempted to read it also and discarded it after suffering a few chapters. Overall, the tone of this book is insulting to both men and women - treating men as self-centered children and women as whiny entitled princesses. I rarely rid our library of a book, but this one was so bad that I feel the most appropriate place for it would be the trash bin.Sean Bean's \\"Show Dad How\\" was a much better purchase that both the husband and I have thoroughly enjoyed and referenced many times."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"My wife was pregnant with my first child when given this book as a gift. It is the perfect book for a guy who has a hard time reading the same books your wife is reading (what to expect, girlfriends guide) because those were all written for the female. This book speaks in guy terms and is a humorous (yet accurate) approach towards dealing with pregnancy. I have passed on my copy to other friends and have purchased many copies for friends who are expecting babies. This is a great read!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"yes, there are many insulting statements in this book, but, they are true!! so don't pay any attention to the thin skinned last reviewer, the book was funny and also had a lot of little practical real life advice & heads ups that you certainly don't get from the dry, banal, and general \\"what to expect books.\\" My husband actually didn't read this, I did, and I got something out of it and some laughs too-- and glad to know I wasn't the only one experiencing some of the taboo details!"},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"He doesn't read. Not anything. Not ever. So when his sister sent us this book right after we found out I was knocked up, I rolled my eyes and mentally Gibbs slapped her. I was curious what the view from the other side might be like. My cousin had already sent me the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy, and I'd been basically overwhelmed with advice, admonitions, anecdotes, and antidotes. I opened this books and started reading. I got so darned tickled reading the first chapter that I was giggling too hard to turn the pages. My husband became curious and wanted me to read the funny parts to him. Since then, I've read a chapter to him at the beginning of each month. It's not all jokes, whole sections are delivered in a matter of fact, bare bones kind of way. This couple doesn't hide any of the ugly truth, and let me tell you some of it's not pretty at all. The folks who say pregnancy is a wonderful, beautiful experience are lying. Lying! But the end result is supposed to be worth it. This is my first go round, so we'll see. Unfortunately, I'm pretty sure the hospital doesn't give refunds... (joking!)The book is divided into 10 chapters, one for each \\"month\\" of pregnancy (yeah, go figure. I always thought there were 9, too...) It's crude, funny, and vulgar, but it's also informative. It exaggerates, but who doesn't when they're reliving these experiences? It's like the proverbial fish tale, only concerning your own tadpole and the strange ways things in your household change during this transitional gestation period. It gives simple checklists of things that may happen for the particular time frame being addressed (morning sickness, flatulence, bloating, mood swings, cravings, etc.), and suggests ways for the male part of the partnership to make things better, help, or just cope. Not all of the advice is really constructive (i.e. sleeping on the couch to escape her snoring, although that might actually work out for us both to get better sleep), but it amusingly addresses real issues that a lot of couples are blind-sided by, especially if this is their first pregnancy.We both have loved it. We're both rather rude, vulgar, and a little crass. If you're easily offended, or you think that pregnancy should be treated as some sort of sacrosanct transition of awesomeness... don't even read the back cover. Your sensitive sensibilities will be offended. But, if you can laugh at your own discomfort and awkwardness, or find it easier to turn serious issues into jokes to get through them (because really, sometimes all you can do is laugh or cry, and laughing is way more social), then pick it up."},{"Title":"Pregnancy Sucks For Men: What to Do When Your Miracle Makes You BOTH Miserable","review":"My husband seems to enjoy this light read, and will compare notes from the book to my pregnancy.

I can't imagine how much time has gone into perfecting the Cuaderno and the DVD. The Cuaderno is well formatted and organized. The exercises are there for all the concepts, but the course allows you to focus on the ones you need the most help with. The DVD is great; the telenovella style really helps keep the students interested. I am guessing I am not the only one who can barely wait to see the next episode. Will there be a second season?Because the DVD allows you to listen to native speakers and record and listen to your own voice and accent, my oral proficiency, or at least my confidence in using it, has increased greatly with this material. I am able to speak freely to my patients and their parents in my clinic. Of course, I can't say and understand everything, but I know enough to be able to ask for their help and describe what I mean until we all understand. My patients seem to appreciate it immensely and it has really changed my relationship with some. They seem to respect my efforts to speak with them and always treat me as such. I think they genuinely see me as a resource in our department. I know the people I work with appreciate it also. I can call and schedule appointments, give directions, and pre-care instructions to people. I am able to explain procedures and answer the many questions that my patients have.There is so much information in the Cuaderno and the DVD, I could go through the book again and learn just as much the second time around. I have my cuaderno in my office as a reference.I would recommend A Su Salud! to all health care professionals with an interest in improving their Spanish."},{"Title":"A Su Salud! (set): Spanish for Health Professionals","review":"I can't say enough wonderful things about this educational resource. I used the DVDs and workbook consistently for 4 months in order to refresh my Spanish skills with the hope of finding a job in the field of health education. I knew I would be a more marketable job candidate if I could get my Spanish proficiency back to where it had been 8 years earlier. The package is very user-friendly and the plot of the telenovela is as entertaining as the best soap operas around. The storyline teaches you about a huge range of health topics in a culturally appropriate context (HIV/AIDS, diabetes, domestic violence, immunizations...). The activities are fun and you can pick and choose those that will be most helpful to you.I am now working in NYC counseling people who are HIV-Positive -in English and Spanish. Without A Su Salud! I would not have been hired for this job. The workbook is sitting in my office and I am still using it. I have used a range of education resources to improve my proficiency in Spanish and this one is by far the very best."},{"Title":"A Su Salud! (set): Spanish for Health Professionals","review":"I am a nursing student who just completed the University of North Carolina's online course, Spanish for Health Professionals, using A Su Salud! and it was a wonderful experience. The Cuaderno and DVDs provide vocabulary and grammar exercises in typical health care scenarios. Since the language exercises are ranked according to their degree of difficulty, I could use the materials to both refresh and challenge my Spanish skills.Thanks to A Su Salud! I now have a working medical vocabulary in Spanish and a better understanding of the cultural differences faced by non-English speaking patients and clients. I would highly recommend A Su Salud! to health professionals wishing to improve their Spanish skills."},{"Title":"A Su Salud! (set): Spanish for Health Professionals","review":"I took a course that used this workbook+DVD while working towards my Master's in Public Health at the University of North Carolina. It was a great way to learn Spanish vocabulary related to health care professions and to revisit basic grammar.In the workbook, each lesson is divided into a vocabulary section and a grammar section, each with accompanying exercises ranked for difficulty (in 1-4 peppers). There are also short culture sections. The DVD follows the themes found in the workbook, and also has a telenovela episode for each lesson that tells the story of a small community health center. It is a pleasantly and surprisingly engaging soap opera. I felt accomplished when I understand everything the actors and actresses were saying, and I also enjoyed the actual story.The course I took required weekly 15 minute conversations with the professor and with a buddy. If you are not taking a college course, I would suggest finding a buddy and setting aside 15 minutes a week to have conversations in Spanish and to keep each other on track with the workbook. It helps to have accountability and it's fun to talk about what happened in each week's episode or to practice perfecting verb tenses and adjective agreement during regular conversation. I also found it made me much more confident to talk to a buddy who was on the same level of Spanish as me.The take home points of this review are basically that this is a great set to use if you want to get your feet wet with the Spanish language again, or if you want to use it to learn how to use Spanish in your professional life. I highly recommend the set, even if you aren't taking a college course to accompany it."},{"Title":"A Su Salud! (set): Spanish for Health Professionals","review":"Update: I just wanted to add that, while I remain unable to watch the videos from the CD, I managed to contact the makers of this product, and they provided me with an alternative viewing method that is working fantastically.Original Review: I'm reluctant to write an negative review about this product, because from what I can tell, the content is simply fantastic...the perfect solution for the intermediate Spanish speaker who wants to broaden their medical vocabulary and improve their fundamental grammar skills. The workbook appears well-organized, and the software and video look slick. After rummaging around on the A Su Salud website a bit, I was able to find some lesson plans that I plan to use as a self-study guide.My problem? Despite meeting all system requirements, and going to painful lengths to try to get it to work (including installing different versions of Windows on other computers, downloading multiple codecs, and researching the inner workings of the OnStage plugin), I can't get the videos to play within the software itself. I *can* look at them directly off of the DVD, but it takes me a while to figure out which file is which, and there are some that I have never been able to find. Technical support has been slow to respond via email, and no one answers when you call their long-distance number. When you do receive guidance, it is nothing short of asinine. (No attempt was made to get to the root of the problem; I was told, essentially, to reinstall everything.) I'd like to think that I'm the only person who has had these types of problems, but I can't be sure...I asked tech support about it over a week ago, and I haven't heard anything back.I'm probably going to keep the program and hobble my way through the program as best as I can, because I think that the content is worth it. (Plus, I've been trying to get this thing to work for over a month, and I'm not sure I'd be able to send it back.) But if I were less motivated about learning, or not particularly knowledgeable about computers, I'd think twice about buying it again."},{"Title":"A Su Salud!

The reason why i did not give it 5 stars is simply the lack of instruction in the book on how to install the program. You simply see some references to the activities in the dvd's but NO MENTION of the steps required to install the dvds. YOU MUST USE A COMPUTER to run the DVD's. The program to run the DVD's will not be found on any computers or dvd players - it is found only on the CD. If you don't install the CD program first, you will be watching only a stupid soap opera version of the video. Then you can play the DVD's using your computer (not a dvd player). The dvd is then played only as a small fraction of the didactic program installed on your computer. DO NOT RUN THE DVD WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM INSTALLED, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. The program is very tedious, and has some weakneses. There is not a built in dictionary, and subtitles are present only on some of the video clips. It is helpful to have a dictionary handy as you do the program, or to refer to the glossary in the text book. I believe that one can not complete this program very well unless one had intermediate working knowledge of spanish. I am struggling with it as is with 2 years of college spanish, but I know the programs will make me 10 times more proficient at working with hispanic patients if can can complete it through the end. The strength of this program is that it can keep one entertained enough to stay with the computer program directed learning. The weakness is that they do not have an \\"online\\" easy access dictionary to translate the lessons. But I guess that is the whole point of an \\"immersion\\" setting, where you are piecing bits and pieces of the puzzles together without drowning in it. In reality, I much prefer learning spanish via the method of LoMastv where you can forward, backward, and slow the video and subscripts for ease of learning. With de su salud, the video can not be forwarded or backwarded. The annunciation in some clips are hard too hear - even if you replayed it several times. Lomastv uses yabla player, and allows you to click on any words in a song or movie, and it translate it immediately for you. You can't do this here with de su salud. Fortunately, I have a dictionary on my computer called lexibase express, which I can pop up at anytime to translate words for me. This dictionary came free with the 8 disc CD program called Talk to Me I bought on amazon.com for about 30 bucks... The dictionary is invaluable, as de su salud does not let you minimize the program and open other programs, except for lexibase express. If one can complete this program, I am sure one can converse much better in a clinical setting. I will let you know how I do in 2 more months..."},{"Title":"To Soar With Eagles","review":"This is long overdue, albeit, brief view of a long and lustrous career of a man who never received the accolades in this country that he should have. Many musical luminaries in the world have paid tribute to him, including his friend Miles Davis. This book covers about a 10 year period in his career, mostly in Europe. It details elements of his career and the friends he made while there. There is a section of the book with photographs of many of these frriends and some of his family.. Other members of my family have read the book and found it to be informative and an interesting story of this renowned classical musician who never really attained the kind of fame many of his comtempories received. I recommend it highly if you are looking for an autobiography of a remarkable man and just a small part of his career."},{"Title":"Shadowed Dreams: Womens Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance","review":"In &quot;Shadowed Dreams: Women's Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance,&quot; editor Maureen Honey collects a compelling body of texts from one of the most important literary currents in African-American history. Honey notes that these poems span the years 1918 to 1931. Each poem is accompanied with its original publication data.Represented in this anthology are such important African-American women authors as Georgia Douglas Johnson, Alice Dunbar-Nelson, Angelina Weld Grimke, and Helene Johnson. In addition, there appear many authors whose names may even be unknown to specialists in the field of Black women's literature: Esther Popel, Marjorie Marshall, Isabel Neill, and more. Where data is available, Honey provides brief author bios at the end of the book. She also contributes a substantial introduction.The poems are grouped into four sections: &quot;Protest,&quot; &quot;Heritage,&quot; &quot;Love and Passion,&quot; and &quot;Nature.&quot; I must admit, I didn't particularly care for this breakdown. Because the works of individual poets are scattered among two or more sections, I think this editorial strategy dilutes the possible impact of seeing a larger sampling of a single poet's work in one place. Also, the headings seem to impose a particular, limited reading upon each piece.Still, this is an impressive anthology. The poems range from formal constructions to free verse. Highlights include Georgia Douglass Johnson's passionate pieces &quot;The Heart of a Woman&quot; and &quot;I Want to Die While You Love Me,&quot; Dorothea Matthew's solemn &quot;The Lynching,&quot; Anita Scott Coleman's sentimental &quot;Black Baby,&quot; and Angelina Weld Grimke's haiku-like &quot;Dawn.&quot; Particularly impressive are the technical proficiency and linguistic richness of Helene Johnson's poems. &quot;Shadowed Dreams&quot; is an essential volume for those interested in United States literature of the 1920s, African-American studies, and women's studies."},{"Title":"Shadowed Dreams: Womens Poetry of the Harlem Renaissance","review":"This anthology answers the question, who were the female poets of the Harlem Renaissance era? Also, What were they writing? This book printed duirng the 90's successfully answers and is still the definitive book on the subject of female poets of the Harlem Renaissance era. From Angelina Weld Grimke, Helene Johnson to Georgia Douglas Johnson's famous poem, Heart of a Woman, to some of the poets who are not well known, such as Mary Jenness and Ruth Dixon, this book explores the themes of the notable and less notable in poetry. This book is divided into three sections, Protest, Heritage and Love &amp; Passion. This book gives a wonderful taste of poetry with little or no commentary. This is a must read and must have for anyone who has ever contemplated the question, who were the female writers of the period and what did they write? This will answer sufficiently that question or will tease the tongue for more about these poetesses of the era."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"This is an interesting book set apart by it's narrative strategy. Each chapter is from the perspective of a different character. Frankly, I found this strategy confusing and difficult to follow. Particularly if you couldn't remember some of the minor characters. That aside, this book does an excellent job of showing what a coach's wife's life is like. Everyone knows coaches work long hours. Kincaid shows the real toll on the family.What's not fully brought out in the publicity of the book is that it also deals with race relations in the south as well as that area of the country's obsession with college football. This book gives another perspective of the vicious tactics used by boosters when a coach is not performing to their expectations.What is also interesting is that Ms. Kincaid is married to Dick Tomey, the Arizona coach who recently resigned after great success because the pressures from fans were just too great. Kincaid's biography touches on the fact that she was previously married to another coach who worked at Alabama (clearly the fictional school in the book) and Arkansas State. My guess is she may have formerly been married to Ray Perkins but none of the articles I read gave her first husband's name. If you know, please email me.In summary, I enjoyed this book and read it in two days. It touches many important points about college athletics and race relations."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"Being a fan of Nanci Kincaid, I am working my way thru her books with reluctance ONLY due to the fact I will soon run out of her reading material!BALLS is a great book. The title may be a little misleading as when I first saw it I thought it would be a total sports book. How wrong! There are sports moments, but the story revolves around the women involved. READ THIS BOOK!!!This book tells the story of Dixie and Max, childhood sweethearts who marry. Max becomes a college football coach and Dixie is left to tend to the children, home, and, sadly, herself. I loved Dixie and her Southern charm and Southern style. Her girl friends, mother, sisters-in-law, mother-in-law, friends, and daughter all help make the story flow and go.This book is told in the narrative form, but what was most interesting was the fact that every woman involved in Max's life tells her story. Some of the \\"chapters\\" are one-half page long. This made the book so much more interesting and exciting being told from sooooooooooo many points-of-view. However, this form of story-telling DID NOT make the book confusing in the least.As a NBA fan, I am constantly aware of coaches, their coaching staff, the job changes, the media, the love/hate affair that the public has with them. However, this book is from the WOMEN in their life's perspective and it is so good. When I see a coach standing on the side lines now I will think HIS POOR WIFE! There is SO much social status, politics, and CRAP involved, not to mention the toll it has to take on their personal lives. HATS OFF TO ALL COACHES AND THEIR FAMILIES!!!!!!!!!!The women telling their stories are smart, wise, rich, poor, black, white, educated, uneducated, happy, sad, you name it -- how Ms. Kincaid was able to make each and every character DIFFERENT and have her own style and voice was amazing to me.Don't miss this book. It IS good, as are all of Ms. Kincaid's writings -- check them out and read them. You will not be disappointed.I was startled to see how long it has been since this book has been reviewed. Hopefully, people will find this book, read it, and enjoy it as much as I did!Thank you!

I bought this book for her when it first was published, and told her to highlight sections she thought were realistic. When we got back together to discuss the novel, we had both highlighted the same sentences over and over again. The novel is written by someone who knows how families, and marriages, get sacrificed on the altar of athletics. I can only shudder at the thought of being married to a college coach. High school level is enough for me. The book completely captures the experience of being necessary for the obligatory parts you need to play at banquets and during appearances with darling children in the stands. Way to go, Nanci."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"this book was bought on a whim. it was one of the best novels i have ever read. the way nanci kincaid writes is so unique that i was able to see the storyline from so many different positions. it was fantastic. everything about it."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"I loved this book. I read it in three days. This was very true regarding the demanding, stressfull, trying life of a coaches wife. I am sure that there were many more chapters that the author could have included. She is a gifted writer. This book will be kept and read again."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"When I started this novel, I thought Ms. Kincaid was suffering from a bad case of hyperbole gone to seed. Surely she was exaggerating in her portrayal of Mac Gibbs and his obsesssion with coaching football to the exclusion of everything else, including his wife and children. On the Sunday I finished this hilarious but ultimately sad novel, however, the esteemed newspaper of the east, the NEW YORK TIMES included a book about a football star in its book review section; and a football news story made its front page. I now suspect Ms. Kincaid may have been too kind. Her bio indicates that she has been married to two football coaches so she probably knows firsthand about that which she writes.BALLS is set in Alabama, begins in 1968 and is told from the viewpoints of multiple women characters including Dixie Gibbs, Mac's long suffering wife; her mother Rose; her mother-in-law; other coaches' wives; a maid; et al. No males ever speak. They wouldn't have time anyway since they are too busy with the game of football. Ms. Kincaid divides her book into sections labelled \\"Pregame,\\" \\"Kickoff,\\" \\"First Down,\\" \\"Second Down,\\" \\"Third Down,\\" and \\"Punt.\\" She gets the times and accents right and certainly knows the lay of her land. You as coach certainly must recruit black athletes to play on your team, but what do you do when one of them gets your white daughter pregnant? Kincaid's universe is filled with cheerleaders, prom queens, Tastee-Freezes and the Baptist Church of course. (Although Mac's mother believes \\"the Lord\\" is working in his life, Mac opts for a career in coaching rather than in the pulpit.) His brother Marvin who is \\"different,\\" has moved up east and rarely returns to Alabama. He doesn't want to embarrass his successful coach brother but does give his sister-in-law advice on hair: \\"'I mean, damn, girl, you got the same hairstyle you had back in high school. That pageboy is tired. You need a change.'\\" Dixie's mother Rose worries that her daughter is too smart, the daughter who thought her life was ruined when she was sick the week of cheerleader tryouts. She was elected homecoming princess anyway. \\"It was like you got to be commander in chief without having ever been a soldier.\\"Sometimes the constant changing of narrators gets in the way of the flow of Ms. Kincaid's story, but that is a very minor flaw in this often very funny tale. You can like BALLS even if you do not have the slightest interest in football since it is about anyone who sacrifices a family for a career."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"BALLS, the 1998 novel by Nanci Kincaid, tells the story of Mac and Dixie Gibbs, high school sweethearts in Alabama. Mac plays quarterback for the Birmingham University football team during college and, after not being picked in the NFL draft, he turns to coaching as a means to stay connected to the game with his new bride by his side. He starts as a high school coach and gradually works his way up the ladder until he is the head coach of his college team, the HamU Black Bears.The story, which begins in 1968, chronicles the relationship of Mac and Dixie through all of its stages: from the rosy beginning when living in a rundown duplex didn't matter, as long as they were together, to the later days, when Dixie and her two children begin to play second fiddle to Mac's team. The story is told in the voices of the women who surround Mac: Dixie, her friends, her mother, mother-in-law, and daughter, the wives of other coaches and the mothers of Mac's players.BALLS is a novel about the Southern football tradition, where the sport is a religion in itself, where the holy day is Saturday and players are nicknamed \\"Miracle.\\" Kincaid not only reveals what it's like to be a woman caught up in this tradition, always coming second to the game--she also reveals a darker side of the sport, where race relations are strategically upheld and corruption reigns supreme. Her female narrators touch on all of these issues in their narratives: love, marriage, sex, race, illegal activity. Their voices are exhuberant, their insights raw, poignant, and surprising. \\"I learned long ago that the big 'W', so sought after and revered, does not stand for 'wife,'\\" Dixie muses at one point late in the book.BALLS is not just about the game--it's about what goes on before and after the game, from the perspective of the women in the stands who live the life of a coach's wife. It's about the politics of the game--recruiting, staffing, bribery. And foremost, it's about Dixie, who transforms from an inept new bride to a seasoned wife and mother and finally refuses to be second anymore. And it's about Mac, a good man who lets the job overtake him. And it's about all of the women who surround Mac, and the stories they have to tell. Kincaid balances her narrators successfully; her Southern women's voices are dead-on, and she is clearly writing about a topic that she's familiar with since she herself has been married to two college football coaches. Her insights about pressure from fans are also accurate--I know this because I myself live in a football town, where our hometown coach is alternately God or the devil, depending on if he puts a 'W' or an 'L' on the board for the team. Overall, BALLS is an energetic, sad, funny, and honest portrait of the life of a coach's wife, from first down to punt."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"I was thoroughly entertained at the tales of the wives of the various football coaches. Their lives were sad and shallow, in a way, in that they revolved around the game of football. It was an enchanting view into a world where football is a religion. It was also interesting to see some of the women mature, while their mates did not. There is also some interesting takes on African Americans dealing with whites and the interactions of mothers and their children. This is the kind of good read to take on a trip to the beach."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"I am the wife of a football coach. This book was the story of MY life!

She knows football after being married to two high profile head football coaches.Please get this book. It also makes a wonderful gift for any coaches' or player's wife."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"Having been an intern for 4 years for a Division 1 University football team, I can honestly say that this novel could not be more true. I adored the coaches I worked for, admired them for their accomplishments, their passion for the team, and for the &quot;majic&quot; they brought to our University town. I loved the players too. I screamed my heart out for them every Saturday and knew many of them like I know my own brother. But I can't tell you how many times I lied to a coaches wife, did a players homework, and wore a skirt while a &quot;hot&quot; recruit was visiting, because I was told to. I think I know all of the people Nanci Kincaid was talking about. In a country of sports, sports, and more sports, Nanci Kincaid opens up a point of view that we don't usually hear-a womans!"},{"Title":"Balls","review":"What a funny book and what a sad book. There are no bad guys in this book - no male bashing. Everyone's just doing the best they know how. Kincaid clearly knows the life of a football coach and the life his wife must lead.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"Love love love this book. I am a huge Nanci Kincaid fan, but this is the best of the bunch. If you are Southern, you will feel as comfortable as sleeping at your grandma's. If you're not, you'll have an insight that is real, not people trying to imagine what the deep South is like. This book chronicles twenty-odd years of Dixie, a SEC football coach's wife, whose identity is so entwined with her husband, Mac, that she is oblivious, by choice. She outgrows this identity, molasses-slow. Kincaid transitions seemlessly minutes, days, weeks and years page-by-page. I was completely satisfied with the novel."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"Wow, Nanci Kincaid understands the scene of a naive-in-love coach's wife. And having been such a wife for nearly twenty years, I clearly see myself, my former spouse, our coaching staffs and teams and players in Kincaid's storyline.This is my second Kincaid read, having started with \\"Verbena\\". Having liked it, I was surprised upon perusing amazon.com to find \\"Balls\\", and its summary enticed me to order it. I read it in two days.The first person narrative as told by the women of the story, with Dixie as the principle story teller, makes the reader feel at home, as if listening to the story in video clips, a sort of oral history documentary.Experiencing Dixie's maturation from a privileged only child status to the unswervingly loyal, and mostly inept, bride to the veteran wife who maintains her life and her children in the absence of her workaholic coach husband is very touching. It is obvious that Dixie's life mirrors the lives of many women who marry for love, and end up always being second best in their husband's lives, the lives of men who place their career first and foremost.I found it especially ironic when Lilly, the family maid and mother of super successful professional football player, Jett, described the world of coaches and football players as being that of men who never really grow up. That is so true! It is a big business beyond a naive fan's understanding.Living in a football state, having sons who never measured up to the athleticism of their coach father's fondest dreams for them, I clearly understand the emptiness of the life Dixie lives in \\"Balls\\". No matter how much she maintains her coach's wife status with dignity and support, her union with Mac Gibbs is a shell, a guise, a front for the public and her children.I especially loved Dixie's devotion to her Christian ways, including huge donations to Unity Prayer, but found great pleasure in her development as a writer and her refusal to further fabricate the Christian legend of her warrior husband coach. The only thing Dixie did not succumb to was the use of the zodiac to help her husband's team win. And of that, even I was guilty while living the life of a coach's wife.There is warmth and humor and some earnest Southern culture in \\"Balls\\" and the legendary importance of high school and college sports is right on track. The men, black and white, are not dark, despicable characters, no more than their women are shrews. The integration of the races in athletics is important in this story and the place of football as a stepping stone from poverty to wealth underlies the larger cultural issue. There are shades of moral turpitude being addressed, not just clear cut sanctimonious preachings. In other words, the story is very real.Kincaid's work is not as polished as it may become, but this is a good start in her writer's portfolio. All coaches' wives should read this novel, if they can stand it."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"This book was an excellent portrayal of the lives of women and the importance of football in the Southeast. The characters were very true-to life, and this book was so well-written that I really felt for all of the narrators. It was both entertaining and literary, and these two things rarely come together. I've ordered her other two books in the hopes that they are as good as this one."},{"Title":"Balls","review":"While there are an awful lot of characters (narrators) in this book, they all combine to tell a great tale of marriage, men, women and misguided ambition. Mac and Dixie have a story, that while told over and over in fiction, is particularly interesting with the college football background. I read this in 2 days."},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"OK, so some of the quoted conversations made me say &quot;Now come on, this time you've gone too far&quot;. But mostly it was a fascinating and very moving story. And an important way to expand my mind and open up to understanding a different culture and the medicine of the spirits. There's alot we can learn from sangomas! (By the way, I found multiple new copies of this book at a used book store in Chicago)"},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"James Hall takes us on his personal journey as a midwestern America who slowly gets drawn into the world of African healers. The story is personal, poignant, and very detailed. It lets us look into several windowns we don't ordinarily get to look through - everyday living in rural Africa and the world of the african healer.From 1977 to 1980 I taught at a major university in Africa and spent 2+ years working closely with sangomas. Most of my acquaintances were Zulu or Sotho, but there are not very many differences to the Swazi that Hall talks about. What does differ considerable is whether or not the spirits are from the river or from the land, but that's another issue.Hall gives a precious insight into the role of the sangoma and the personal issues that sangoma must face. My own work was in the urban areas, and it's very different from Hall's rural adventures.Anyone interested in africa, african healers, and stories of personal growth will find this book very interesting and informative. It is suitable for young adults as well as adults."},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"Sangoma depicts the fascinating tranformation of a talented American writer into a 'second career' of a full-fledged, African traditional healer. Having visited with James Hall in person, his story becomes credible, and genuine.A must for anyone, within and beyond the health professions, who seeks to better understand a form of alternative medicine used by millions of Africans.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"James Hall made me feel that I was an African. The view was from thse eyes.Americans can really feel and see the people of that community.A fine read to get a total world view and not the myopic view that we Americans have of the world and others.Please let me know where I could find him now and get caught up on his life. His kids would be about 14 1nd 20 now. let me know bob huffbob_huff@comcast.net thanks"},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"Another interesting book on indigenous cultures, this book tells the story of a westerner who underwent the rituals to become a Sangoma, a Zulu medicine man. What makes this excellent is that it is easy to understand the religion of the Zulu because it is filtered through a western view yet still understood. If you enjoyed this book, I also suggest that you check out Malidoma Patrice Some's &quot;Of Water and the Spirit&quot; as well."},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"Interesting look at a disappearing culture. Despite the author's immense egotism, the fascinating world of traditional healers comes to life."},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"This is the first book my godmother recommended that I read to give me an idea on what African American shamanism is all about. Even though the author is a Caucasian and the system that he is being initiated into is in South Africa. He does a very good job in his presentation, which helps those raised in the west to get a more profound understanding on what African spirituality is all about. It doesn't just consist of going to church but is a gumbo of various practices all meant to accomplish one common objective or goal.Because Hall is born and raised in the West and is a Caucasian, he spends a lot more time and effort describing and explaining the concepts and principles to the public. This is what makes this a great book. I recommend this book to anyone interested in any form of African inspired practice or tradition because it will help them to see how African inspired spirituality is all a form of healing despite what the media and filmmakers and some misguided practitioners claim.Hope this was helpful."},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"This book was an honest and sensitve overview of the Sangoma training.Anyone studying Shamanism would find this book of interest. And luckyfor me, I just happened to receive a signed copy. The book seller wasvery prompt, packaged the book carefully, and was true to the ratingof the condition."},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"This book depicts another white man's life journey in Africa. Miriam Makeba, the famous singer, suggested to James Hall (the author of \\"Sangoma\\") that there may be more than meets the eye in his fascination with Africa and African-American women. Hall followed her advice and consulted a Swazi witch doctor (\\"sangoma\\") who declared, to surprise of all, that Hall was destined to become a sangoma himself. This book depicts his travails leading to his initiation into the circle of Swazi healers.It was a bittersweet path, filled with encounters with supernatural (Hall turned out to possess access to many different spirits, including those of a Native American, a NY advertising executive and - wait for this - a fetus). In addition to description of his training, Hall provides valuable accounts of his interactions with ordinary Swazis (some good, some bad; there seem to be as many racially intolerant people in Africa as everywhere else) and, especially, with women. Hall shows that relationships between men and women in Swaziland are pragmatic, based on exchange of material goods and services rather than sentimental.Throughout the book we participate in Hall's inner life, his decisions and his torments as well as in his decision to adopt a parentless child and marry the woman he fell in love with. Hall now lives and practices in Swaziland and I think Swazis are lucky to have such a courageous, dedicated, life-affirming and generous sangoma."},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"This book really absorbed me during the two days I read it. I could not put it down before I had finished the last page. James Hall gives a candid and vivid account of how he became a traditional African healer, a sangoma.This is not just an outstanding adventure story but remembrance to all of us that more exists than meets the eye on the physical plane. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to further his/her horizon and enjoys a great book.Andreas Biebl"},{"Title":"Sangoma","review":"James Hall's odyssey into the spirit world of Africa makes nearly the entire output of today's spiritualists and self-help gurus- and much of the non-fiction of the past several decades- obsolete and insignificant. His biographical portrayal not only honors the spiritual and spiritualist's history as it is and was in African culture, a giant antithetical perspective to the Newtonian/Keynesian world of the West with our comfort in the worship of material objects and the acquisition of wealth from that perspective. It honors the spiritual world in total, and in so doing redeems the human spirit via the transformational path of action, self-awareness, enlightenment and active service to something greater than one self that could not by definition fit into comfortably established forms of sensibility and recognition. Sangoma can easily be compared to Herman Heese's Siddartha and the like, and should be on the booklists of every college course in literature as well as anthropolgy, religion and Africana studies. The only drawback, however accurate, was his depiction of many African natives as deceitful, in the context of his presence and study of the rituals of the Sangoma healer, without a further mentioning of the hostilities they suffered at the hands of the Western world before his arrival. An altogether wonderful and inspiring book that leaves you feeling like something beautiful in you has been powerfully affirmed."},{"Title":"SMASHING THE ATLANTIC WALL","review":"This book's subtitle, \\"The Destruction of Hitler's Coastal Fortresses\\" more accurately reflects its subject matter than does the more dramatic \\"Smashing the Atlantic Wall\\". The author focuses his attention on the capture or screening of the French and Belgian ports from Brittany northward during the 1944-45 campaign in Northwest Europe. The Allied units involved were from the American First, Third and Ninth Armies and the Canadian First Army with a smattering of units of the British Second Army.This was the first, and most likely the last book by Patrick Delaforce that I will read. I found the research sketchy, the analysis poor or non-existent and the writing pedestrian. There are no footnotes or end notes and the bibliography is a scant one pager. While the narrative is relatively short at 224 pages, it feels padded with extensive quotes that don't add much. For example he includes the entirety of lengthy Fuhrer Directives rather than referencing the relative portions. He also devotes almost a third of the book to general background information about the buildup to the D-Day landings. Why?This subject had the potential to be an interesting study. Who came out ahead? The Germans by denying the allies the access to supplies these ports represented or the Allies, since Hitler tied up significant troops manning the fortifications which might have been better used elsewhere. This book provides little insight, just a superficial narrative."},{"Title":"Doctor Who #007: And the Talons of Weng-Chiang","review":"&quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; is one of the favorite serials from the series, with Tom Baker doing his best Sherlock Holmes, giant rats, and Leela at her most homicidal. This novelization is quite faithful, albeit a bit on the perfunctory side. Characterization is skipped in order to keep the action going while, conversely, the more gruesome scenes are glossed over. Still, it's a fun read."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I bought this book and read it in one day. I literally could not put it down.The story of Rubin Carter, who began his early adulthood as a violent predator in the ring, learned an ever-increasing lesson about power, injustice, and ultimately, humility. This is the predator's tale of learning what it feels like to be the hunted one, and is one man's journey to self-actualization, albeit at the hands of an inhuman society.While the movie gave a semi-authentic account of the legal transpirations, it gave very little detail as to the actual dynamics of the Canadian commune, particularly as to Rubin himself once he had gained his freedom. This book fills that void, particularly as to Rubin's relationship with Lisa and her domination of all in the group. What stands out in my mind is Skeet McClure's statement to Rubin about his relationship with the group -- &quot;You've traded one prison for another.&quot;This book is dynamic, moving, and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"The More you read about Rubin Carter the more Compelling he is.the odds he overcame&amp;the way he stayed Mentally Strong when it seemed he had no hope.this book is very Honest&amp;detailed.his story will have you Hooked for days.it's very sad.How Many times does this still happen today? The Realitys of this Book doesn't make me feel Free as A Black Man.cuz Injustice is way more often than not Associated with Us.very powerful book."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"The life of Rubin Carter is certainly worth reading about regardless of what side of the debate you are on. Many people feel passionate about both his innocence and guilt. This book may help the reader decide for himself or herself, but it obviously has an innocent slant to it which the author makes known and makes no apologies.The story as many of you know involved the conviction of Rubin Carter and John Artis for a triple murder that took place at a bar in Patterson, NJ. The men always maintained their innocence much to the chagrin of prosecutors. Whether Rubin did this crime or not is besides the question considering he got released from a Federal Court over a writ of habeas corpus issue. The court did not rule on whether he was guilty or innocent even though he had been convicted twice before for the triple murders. The Supreme Court judge that decided to overturn the convictions cited a \\"racial revenge\\" motive and prosecutorial withhlding of information as reasons to overturn the case. Therefore, after many intense struggles with personal demons and many years in prison Rubin Carter was released a free man. The book recounts his troubled life as a juvenile, his violent temper, his prize-fighting boxing days, and his many years spent in different prison institutions. Apparently while in prison Carter transformed these former attributes by personal study and reflection. He found some people from a Canadian commune to help go to battle for him and eventually won his freedom. It's a powerful story with a few problem areas. One problem area is that there are so many legal meanderings throughout the book that you begin to feel as if you are undertaking a tedious chore sorting through all of it. You lose the zest and earnest interest you first had when you started the book. The other problem area is it's obviously a very opinionated book meant to portray Carter as an innocent man wronged by the system. However, after reading about Carter's past, his media provoking of local authorities, and his temper, I came away feeling very ambivalent. Whereas, I expected to become totally convinced of his innocence I began to feel I wasn't for sure. Nevertheless, it's a compelling story if you can get past the legal \\"John Grisham\\" feel of the book.Rubin Carter continues to fight to this day to overcome the hardness and emotional devastation he had thrust upon him while in prison. We learn that while he is thankful to be out he still has a long way to go to live the life he yearns for. To put to rest the demons bothering him (such as alcohol) and to be able to trust people is one of the great challenges he faces. One can only hope that justice was served in this instance and that he picks up what he has left of his life and makes the most of it."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I have not seen the movie but I was looking for a good book and took a chance on it. I could not put the book down! This is a GREAT book. And very well written. The story of his life will touch anyone. I mean this guy went through hell.As far as how correct the info is....who is to say. I only have what is in this book to go by as far as guilt or innocent is concerned. Obvisouly, the info about his case that is provided in the book makes him look innocent. And if the evidence in his first trial is in fact what we read about in the book, then this guy was innocent. Again, without having other details, there is no way of knowing if they selectively ommited more incriminating facts.Buy this book! You won't regret it. Now I have to go rent the movie to see if it can even hold a candle to the book."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I read this book and then saw the movie. This is a familiar formula for disappointment. The book is much better and richer than the movie. The movie portrays Carter as some kind of saint, deeply-principled, who is railroaded by the justice system. As the book reveals, Carter was a deeply troubled individual during the 1960's. Carter was a very angry person who seemed to antagonize authority. He was also an alcoholic and had selfish, chauvanistic attitudes towards women. These traits are overlooked in the film. In fact, the movie shows Carter a suave, kind person. The filmmakers probably skipped these aspects of Carter because they wanted the viewers to like Carter and root for him. In reality, Carter didn't seem a likeable person.HOWEVER, the fact that Carter was a troubled, angry person doesn't mean he's guilty of murder. Some people seem to invest their dislike of &quot;hollywood justice&quot; and the &quot;cause celeb&quot; aura surrounding this case, into convicting Carter for the murders. Don't confuse the issues. Carter was not a saint but he's still entitled to justice. Part of this book is the story of the unraveling of the prosecutor's case. As a federal district court found, the prosecutors withheld vital evidence from the defense - evidence which the defense was legally entitled to. The prosecutors also resorted to prejudice during the trial to persuade the jury of Carter's guilt. This is the so-called racial revenge theory advanced by the prosecution.The other important and most fascinating part of the book is the transformation of the man. During his prison sentence, Carter transforms himself, with the help of others, from an angry, troubled individual to a much kinder and complete human being. The movie, by overlooking Carter's bad traits, robs the viewer of this incredible growth of one person.My advice is to skip the movie and read this excellent book."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"\\"Here comes the story of the Hurricane, the man the authorities came to blame, for something that he never done, put in a prison cell, but one time he could have been the champion of the world\\"- Bob Dylan in his song \\"Hurricane\\". This song was written in support of a man named Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter who Dylan believed to be innocent of a conviction of triple murder. Carter, a professional boxer at the peak of his career, who happened to be in his hometown of Paterson, New Jersey at the time was pulled over by the cops while driving down the road with an old high school acquaintance, John Artis. Carter who has had many run-ins with the cops before, most often because he was a black man in a white man's society, did not know the reason he was brought to the police department this time. They accused him and John Artis of triple murder. The two of them had received three life sentences each for a crime that they did not even commit. They had many appeals which usually never favored him. The journey of this man is amazing, and to find out how the story ends get the book. I know that you think that you can predict the ending from this, but let me assure you that your idea is far from the truth.This book is easily one of my favorite novels of all time. The whole idea of the story is crazy all in itself, but the fact that it actually happened makes the book that much better. Hurricane, being such a fantastic book reads very quickly and there is not one paragraph anywhere that is not either inspiring or filled with wit and humor. For these reasons I definitely recommend this book to anyone at all."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed James Hirch's &quot;Huricane.&quot; I found the story to be well written.

Unfortunately there were no eyewitnesses to the murder. After taking a lie detector test, the police chief knew Carter was innocent, although he guessed that Carter knew who the killer was. That was enough. He was tried with an 11 man 1 black man jury in paterson, N.J. The mayor was seeking re-election and wanted no publicity that would change his winning. The real murderer was never found. Carter spent 20 years in prison as an innocent man. Whilke in prison, he refused to wear the prison uniform, so he wore clothes worn in other parts of the prison, such as a barber's smock. In 1974,. he wrote his autobiography &quot;The Sixteenth Round:From Round 1 Contender to #45472&quot;. He sent a copy to Bob Dylan, the poular song writer of music dealing with social injustice. For a short time his pligt was brought to the public attention. In 1980, 16 year old bot, Lesra Martin, from Brooklyn who was almost illiterate read the autobiography. He began to write letters to Rubin Carter in prison. His Canadian foster family believed in Carter's innocence, along with Lesra. He began visiting Carter in prison and so did his foster family. They all eventually moved to the Uniter States of America in order to help prove the Criminal Justice System that Rubin did not commit these muders. They began looking for evidencethat was missed during the original trial that could help clear Carter ogf the charges. I do recommend this book. I recommend this book to people who like sports, civil issues, and human interest. This book was written in an excellent form, good wording, and okay in details. James S.

There are some things that I believe on both sides of the story. I do believe that Rubin did have a violent juvenile past, and was an angry man. Yet, if a person who is facing oppression on a daily basis i'm sure you would tend to have violent tendancies as well; it's easy to make statements about a man's life when we are in a prosperous 21st century and not in the 1940 - 1950's. I do agree that the film does cut out the large part of Rubin's transformation from a violent individual to a more spiritual one.I am a young Australian who is not of the age to be around when Rubin Carter was set free. This case was so badly stuck together it provides a good look at the judicial system considering it kept an innocent man in jail for 19 years.And one of the most insulting facts of the case was that when Rubin was set free from jail in 1985, he was set free because of the biased and racial case that was built before him. NOT because he didn't do the crime.

In fact, this book pointed out the much less glamorous and hard side of Mr. Carter. The movie romanticized a person the book reveals to have been a rather unloveable, sometimes mean, ugly human being.I came to love Mr. Washington's version of Hurricane Carter, I can only fear the one in this book.Did your mama ever tell you, &quot;I don't know what you did but I know you did something.&quot; Did you get spankings for things you may not have done, only to know that you really had done something even worse?

It's time africans forget about the past and live for their own future. Slavery has been banned for over 120 years. How long will it take us to free ourselves?"},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted book about one of the most insidious evils with which we still struggle, about 2 men who had their lives taken from them, and extraordinary people who made freedom for Mr. Carter their full time passion.The quote of this review is still pathetically true; the statement refers to &quot;we are looking for two Negroes&quot;. This story is not unique; it's tempting to say it's not unusual, but that would be letting the cynics win, and Mr. Carter never allowed that to infect him. And many of the historical clich&eacute;s just won't work with this story.Racism in the South or Deep South? no, New Jersey.Southern Klan? no, Northeast Yankees.Takes place before The Civil Rights Acts, before we were supposed to be evolving as people and citizens? no, Mr. Carter gained his freedom when he finally was legally exonerated on February 27, 1988! This was after 2 decades, 140,000 plus pages of documents, several trials, all generated, pursued, and ended only when the State Of New Jersey had no legal options left. Only when the State agreed not to try Mr. Carter a THIRD time, as long as he did not pursue a Civil Suit against the State! After 21 years of the pursuit of 2 men that were suspected, arrested, tried, and convicted for the color of their skin, New Jersey was worried about money!The Author opens the book with a reference to Mr. Richard Bruno Hauptmann. This man was executed for his alleged killing/kidnapping of the child of Anne and Charles Lindbergh. Mr. Hirsch sets this book up brilliantly by mentioning a man who while most probably involved, was in no way deserving of death, and thought by many to be a victim, to a much lesser degree perhaps, than Mr. Carter. So the book opens with Mr. Carter a few cells down from the electric chair upon which Mr. Hauptman was killed. Wonderfully crafted opening, a clever parallel sketched if not drawn, and the book goes on and never slows until the end.Mr. Carter is remarkable. The &quot;Canadians&quot; were unique, as were Mr. Carter's lawyers. They never quit until they had won, until the State of New Jersey had run out of options to pursue their case which Judge Sarokin had at various times called; &quot;...insufferably galling. It is akin to plucking a man's eyes out and condemning him because he cannot see. It has consistently been the misconduct of the State, under the color of law, which has frustrated and prolonged its realization&quot; (it, refers to the 2 accused and their case which &quot;have never enjoyed a full, fair and unforced disclosure of the facts to which they have been constitutionally entitled&quot;.)When Mr. Carter's Father died his obituary proclaimed him to be the Father of &quot;a convicted triple murderer&quot;.Mr. John Artis who was the co-defendant of Mr. Carter, is another extremely rare type of human being. In all the years, trials, interrogations, he never, never, ever, cut a deal for himself in exchange for implicating Mr. Carter. Was this Hurricane Carter a life-long friend, a good friend, how about they barely knew each other the night of the crime? Mr. Artis got a ride home that evening. And Mr. Artis was indirectly sentenced to death by The State Of New Jersey's persecutors. He contracted a disease in prison attributable to the conditions he was wrongfully incarcerated for, and that has cost him 6 amputations of digits and toes, and will eventually claim his life. This man would not cut a deal for himself, or harm a man he was a casual acquaintance of, if he was even that.No one from The State of New Jersey who persecuted these men suffered, no one was punished for what they had done, and asked if an apology was owed, Mr. Belsole of the New Jersey State Attorney General's Office, &quot;believed that amends or apologies would have mocked the criminal justice system&quot;. Certainly he and everyone involved with the prosecution/persecution of these men are indeed experts on what mockery, and mockery of justice is.Mr. Carter's enemies still claim he was released on a technicality, a charge that Leon Friedman, one of Mr. Carter's attorneys, responds to with &quot; It was a technicality - it's called the U.S. Constitution&quot;."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"As a lawyer and an African American I vaguely remember the story of Rubin Carter but did not follow it closely. When the movie came out I read the reviews with great interest. The reviews all said that the movie did not give the full story and it's obvious that you can't cram a whole life time and years of legal battling into a two hour movie. When I saw the movie I was intrigued by the story and ordered the book. I found the book well written, with excellent details. It tells the real story and gives the details of the legal battle in a reable form that is understandable by any reader. You get to know Rubin Carter by reading this book in a way that could never happen in the movies. It's well worth reading, although the story itself is a sad commentary on the rights of African Americans."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"..superbly written, gives a disturbing glimpse of our criminal justice system.warning: may cause you to review your position on a variety of social/legal issues.foremost,this book gives an astonishing account of the human spirit,there are many hero's in this one. read it!"},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I love controversial books so I decided to pick this one up. I was not disappointed! This one makes you sad at times, angry at others (over the travesty that is the American Justice system). If you are interested in the case of Rubin Carter, or even about the mistreatment of blacks in the US, this is worth your time and money."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I bought this book because I heard Rubin Hurricane Carter interviewed on NPR radio. In fact, I listened to the interview twice, I was so enthralled with the human spirit and wisdom that came through over the airwaves. Now that I'm reading the book, I'm even more taken with this man's journey. The book does not portray Carter as some kind of idol but as a many-sided human being who refused to be dominated and ultimately triumphed over his circumstances. Philosophically, the book gives me much to think about, and it's a riveting read, one of the best books I've read in the last few years (and I read about 400 books a year!)."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"Jim Hirsch gives a gripping and balanced narrative of Rubin Carter's struggles. It's a first rate read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I was fortunate enough to meet Hirsch and Carter recently, and the experience only added to my enjoyment of the book. Rubin Carter is an amazing speaker, and the emotion he exudes cannot properly be described with words. However, Hirsch is able to tell the story of how an angry man, wrongfully imprisoned is now able to look at every day as a gift that should not be wasted."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"This is an &quot;authorized&quot; biography, meaning that its subject (boxer Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter) cooperated in its production, but that doesn't mean that it's a hagiography. Hirsch produces a book that generates a sense of outrage at the injustice Carter suffered without minimizing Carter's difficult personality.Carter's story is familiar to many. Accused of triple murder in Paterson, New Jersey, in the late '60s, he was convicted, despite dubious evidence, and imprisoned for nearly 20 years before his conviction was overturned. With the help of Bob Dylan, he became a cause celebre in the mid-'70s, won a new trial, and then, incredibly, saw his conviction upheld, forcing a return to prison, at which point he became nearly a forgotten man.Nearly forgotten, but not entirely, because of the efforts of an obscure and enigmatic commune in Toronto that championed his cause and worked tirelessly for a decade in the cause of his relief. Hirsch effectively documents Carter's ambivalent relationship with this group, particularly its leader, with whom he became spiritually and romantically involved.Hirsch chronicles in his book Carter's journey through a legal system that abused him and through his own psyche. He was at times an unreasoning, violent man who battled not only opponents in the ring, but alcoholism, fits of rage and purposeless impulses to battle the system through criminal acts.Hirsch's thoroughly researched book ultimately sounds a cautionary note. Carter succeeded in his quest for justice, but only with the help of extremely dedicated attorneys and friends. Thousands of hours were expended in battling state power. One wonders how many, without benefit of such resources, have languished in prison, unable to muster the resources to mount a legal counter-offensive.Hirsch's clean, powerful prose renders an unflinching portrait of a flawed, but brave man. Recommended reading."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"After seeing the movie, I read this book and it filled in a lot of missing pieces. (what happened to the different players, who were the cops responsible in NJ, did Rubin and the Canadian lady have anything more than a friendship, what happened to Lazarus ...etc).I couldnt put the book down and found the story even more disconcerting in book form than the movie; since actual names and people were portrayed (in the movie for instance the changed the evil cops name...).In the book there is also an update (since the movie) to what has happened to Rubin et al, although, curiously, no mention of the movie itself."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"This is an exhaustively detailed account of the life of Rubin &quot;The Hurricane&quot; Carter, told in a compelling, fluid style. Great detail is given not only the the life of Rubin Carter, but of all those persons involved in Mr. Carter's decades long struggle for freedom after having been twice wrongly convicted for a 1966 triple murder. The background detail of places and events provides an impressive depth and understanding of the political undercurrents and feelings of the day. Mr. Carter has strong feelings about the criminal justice system in the United States, and a strong basis for those feelings. Mr. Hirsch's meticulously researched 'hurricane' provides the reader with a well written 'Journey' not only of, but with Rubin Carter."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"This is a good book that has a positive message, but it also exposes some of the evils in human nature. Two men, Rubin Carter and John Artis, are convicted of murders they didn't commit and are sentenced to life in prison. This story shoes the struggles that Carter goes through in prison and it is only his knowledge that he is innocent that gets him through it. He changes from an angry and confrontational person into someone wiser with a better understanding of his role in the world. Carter's story is an excellent example of determination and perseverance."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"This book makes you want to read all day long.

It is obvious that Hirsch did countless hours of research to complete it.The detail, whether it is on the actual cases, his life in prison, his encounter with Lezra, or just the background, is incredible. I liked the fact that he took this overabundance of meticulous, detailed information and spewed it out into a very cogent and readable format.Carter's story is one of perserverance, courage, and inspiration. Hirsh captures this perfectly in this well-written book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"James Hirsch does an excellent job with his biography of Rubin Carter. I read about one non-fiction book to 20 fiction books; this one could influence me to raise the percentage. They say that fact is stranger than fiction ... the story of Hurricane Carter gives credibility to that statement. Hirsch had me hooked from page one. His matter-of-fact style is rift with descriptive passages that lend themselves to the stuff good novels are often made of. The story itself: unbelievable! As a die-hard fan of historical fiction, I would recommend this tale to anyone. Tough to put down and not meant to be read through multiple sittings."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"Rubin Hurricane Carter is really one of my greatest idols. What he went through was a mixture of discrimination, racism and hate. He was robbed 22 years of his life for something he didnt do and was denied several appeals. This book displays Carter at his very best. Not only did Carter manage to find true love in a prison where he was filled with hate he also manages to have such inner strength that he was able to block out the prison from his mind and refused to co-operate with the so-called legal system. Through the time Rubin suffered in prison he began to stop training his body and began training his mind and read books by ghandi, malconX, nelson mandela and ouspensky. When Rubin was freed (with the help of a loyal canadian commune) he began living his life in peace and speaking out against wrongs. He now doesnt support boxing and believes its barbaric. Rubin was once said to never have a strip of fat without 10 layers of muscle around it. But now Rubin is even stronger then before. Using the saying \\"Mind over matter.\\" This book isnt just for boxing fans as it goes far beyond boxing it speaks loud about discrimination, one man against the world, and about finding inner strength. This book tells a miraculous journey in the most full-filling way."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"James S.

Based on that I always felt the guy was probably framed. After reading this bio, I feel he was probably guilty.By the first third of this book I found myself not liking Carter. It seemed obvious to me that this was a very angry and violent man who was also very dishonest. This book attempts to make a martyr of a man who seemed like trouble even before he was convicted of the alleged murder. It also attempts to explain away every bad thing this man did (and there were many) by trying to make him look like the victim.The author nor Carter never once admit to any wrong doing on Carter's part regardless of what it may be. If just ONCE Carter had taken responsibility for some of his nasty behavior and poor dealings with other folk, I may have had a more open mind. But this is a blatant attempt at reaching for excuses for every thing that went wrong in his life. Carter and the author want everybody to believe that Carter was the victim of frame-ups, conspiracies, and racism at every turn in his life. I was not convinced.The pattern that I found apparent in Carter's personality is that he only opened up to folks who could give him something he wanted and once he got it, he changed his personable and trusting come-on and threw them on the scrap heap. Often rationalizing his using of those who helped him by twisting it into some delusional offense against him. The best I can say for Carter is that he struck me as a very cunning con-man who ultimatley beat the system by using people for his own needs until he was portrayed in the main stream media as a martyr and a victim. I no longer buy into that portyrayel after reading this book."},{"Title":"Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter","review":"I really wanted to like this book because I was so intrigued by Rubin Carter's story.

Plain and simple. She is no national treasure. She is no pillar of the press. She is however, a symbol of what the White House Press Corps has become...a drumbeat for the Left, a wing of the DNC and an irrelevancy in the journalistic history of the Republic. Their bias against the current administration is so great that they have lost credibility with main stream America. For far too many years, Ms. Thomas considered herself the pom pom girl of the press corps.At eighty-six and relegated to the back of the room and mostly ignored she has raised the only voice she has left to once more vilify Bush and castigate the other members of the press corps for not being even more outrageous than they already are.The Lefties here apparently love the book.

However, the editing is a little odd in that it reads like a bunch of random thoughts. Maybe it was a bunch of random thoughts. Who knows.I find myself wanting to know more of the story a lot of the time.I wouldn't skip this one if you think it sounds interesting, but don't get too excited about how much insight you'll get."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"This book sorely disappointed me for two reasons. I strongly agree with the thesis of the title, that the media largely abandoned their important duty as watchdogs of democracy in the run-up to the War in Iraq, HOWEVER, this issue amounts to a grand total of ONE chapter in her entire book. The rest is a bunch of anecdotes tied loosely together. In fact, it reads more like an anthology than a unified work.The second thing that disappointed me was also something of a shock: Helen Thomas, Grand Dame, Dean of the Washington Press Corps, is a lousy writer! I am serious. I read on average one or two political/nonfiction books a month, and this is one of the most poorly written I have read yet. Some of the books I have read are by \\"regular\\" people, some by pundits, and some by politicians. Nearly all of them write in a more interesting and engaging style than Mrs. Thomas. Her tone is often conversational at best, and her stories seem to be told as much to discuss presidents' interactions with the media as to tell you what an interesting career she has had.I could not in good faith give it one star. It isn't horrible. It is just extremely disappointing."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Helen Thomas has a long and distinguished career covering 9 U.S. Presidents. In \\"Watchdogs of Democracy\\" she voices her concern that the press has gotten soft - especially vs. Bush II and the rationale for Iraq. Ms. Thomas is probably right, but in the heat of the 9/11 moment, and Bush et al's willingness to take advantage of the situation, it is not surprising - especially its recent vicious attacks and threats of criminal action against the New York Times. Since then I think the press has improved somewhat.\\"Watchdogs of Democracy\\" begins wondering how much GE (NBC), Viacom (CBS), and Disney (ABC) care about freedom of the press when access to the White House is at stake, or when they risk losing advertisers for airing provocative viewpoints. The former point seems to be a new concern, though the latter has always been an issue (eg. the risk of running a story berating a certain auto brand vs. losing its ads). She cites CBS' \\"The Reagans,\\" pushed to Showtime in response to some Republicans that it showed President Reagan in less than an adulatory light, and calls from Rice and Powell against airing bin Laden tapes because they might contain coded instructions to sleeper cells. Ms. Thomas is particularly concerned that the press give Bush II a \\"free ride\\" prior to the Iraq invasion.The book goes on to provide an overview of press secretaries, new management by various administration, anonymous sources and leakers (often those within an administration), the legality of withholding sources, and her opinion of the best reporters in modern U.S. history."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"The highlight of this book are the anecdotes that Ms. Thomas relates. Most of the book is a series of essays about what is wrong with journalism today, with White House press relations and certain presidents and other government officials past and present. Other than the anecdotes and some interesting history there is little that is not intuitive. I agree with a lot of what Ms. Thomas writes, I just don't find it very original or new or presented in a new/unique manner. Save your money and borrow it from a library as I'm not sure I spent my money well in buying this book. FWIW, it is well written and is a fast not-long read."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"This is a rambling, disjointed, biased, personal accountof what should be an important public issue. The titlehas a question mark, and the subtitle identifies theculprit and makes an accusation. So how does \\"Watchdogsof Democracy? The Waning Washington Press Corps and HowIt Has Failed the Public\\" measure up? Not very well onthe subject, but better as a collection of snippets.The foreword drones on and on for ten pages. Chapter 1tells us Journalism is an honorable profession inspite of Jayson Blair and a few others.Chapter 2 mentions several scandals uncovered by thepress. Chapter 3 has anecdotes about presidents withthe press. Chapter 4 is about press secretaries.Chapter 5 is about spinning the news.Chapter 6 is about leakers and whistle blowers.Chapter 7 admits that the news business is a business.Chapter 8 complains about the FCC.

There is over 11pages of closely spaced, double column index,but no references.Thomas seems to think there is little in Washingtonexcept the White House. The other branches, and thebureaus and departments are seldom mentioned.Some Republicans will be bothered by some of herattacks, and some Democrats will be delighted.There are attacks, and both Democrats and Republicansare the targets, perhaps in equal numbers, but theyare treated differently. Democrats tend to get thepassive voice and quirky little adjectives.Republicans tend to get the active voice andmalicious adjectives.

The only timeI was tempted to put it down was Thomas quotingherself giving a speech disguised as a question ata White House Press Conference."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Perhaps I wanted the wrong thing out of this book. I was hoping for some probing assertions and introspection about the role of the media, its relationship with the public and the government, and its future. There was some of that, but it was incoherent and tied more to specific examples than to an overarching idea.Page after page were tenuously connected stories where she tried to tie together a theme, but ended up completely disorganized. When she did hit on a major theme like conglomoration of the media into only a few corporate hands, she automatically assumed that would lead to a narrowing of the viewpoint without explaining how the proposed bias would actually accomplish that. From someone with an inside track, I hoped for more than just assumptions.Similarly, her discussion of protection of source confidentiality was completely one-sided, with not even a mention of the ways it can be abused (aside from its over use). The perfect example even looked her in the face, and after pages writing about the Plame incident she still had no comment how, for example, confidential leaks can be used for political gain and disinformation.I was frustrated after about 30 pages, but stuck it out through most of this book. If you are new to liberalism or haven't heard the horrors of the Bush administration then it might be useful. Otherwise, it's not worth reading."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"This book was clearly written for profit. Many sections of the book are only weakly connected back to the main theme and nowhere does Helen Thomas make her case-in-chief directly. Instead, the reader is treated to a series of vignettes which all too frequently bear only a tenuous relationship to one another and which make no effort to maintain continuity. While each chapter has a reasonably strong cohesion (though those boundaries frequently intersect in a way which would make any Venn diagram lover proud), they work together not as a fine Swiss watch, but instead more like a Rube Goldberg machine.There is one theme which appears time-and-again: the idea that an objective and vigorous free press is a necessary part of democracy. This point is made consistently throughout the book from a cornucopia of different, albeit predicable, angles, and is artfully shown both implicitly and explicitly through excellent and enjoyable anecdotes accumulated during the author's sixty years as a White House correspondent. Unfortunately for the reader, her anecdotes frequently seem to be included for their value as self-platitudes rather than for intrinsic value or thematic attenuation. Also unfortunate is the inconvenient truth that Helen Thomas is no longer the type of reporter she praises, but the type she opines against: an opinion columnist.There are certainly gems in the rough scattered throughout the 201 pages, but the author's tendency both to ramble and babble makes them difficult to find and detracts from their value. With regard to Thomas' periodic attempts a historical organization, her comments at the conclusion of chapter four are revealing: \\"There were other press secretaries and other spokespersons. I have mentioned only a few who stand out in my mind, for better or worse.\\" Indeed, it seems she deemed fit to simply write down a train of thought as it occurred to her in the shower; that is to say, while not devoid of organization, the linking up of subjects is tenuous at best. Perhaps the most interesting and enjoyable aspect of Helen Thomas' writing style in this book is her robust use of vocabulary, which includes a scattering of excellent words on every page (some of which I even had to look up)."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Helen Thomas, the venerable grand dame of the White House Press embodies what it means to be a professional journalist. Page after page reveals her love of her profession and her disappointment in how it has evolved.Having been a journalist for more than 60 years and as a member of the White House press corps since John F. Kennedy, she is waiting and hoping for a new generation of journalists to achieve the stature of an Edward R. Morrow or a Walter Cronkite--reporters who seek to report the truth and refuse to be cowed by intimidation.In this short book, she provides numerous examples of press manipulation by the Bush administration and the acquiescence of a somnabulistic press corps that have become adminstration stenographers rather than investigators:* President Bush's desire to be known as a war president even before the terrorist attack on 9/11.* \\"No weapons. No ties to terrorists. No threats. No apologies. No explanations. No remorse. Under those circumstances, Americans were told they were fighting a war in Baghdad for liberty and democracy throughout the Middle East. Bush could shift the rationale in the blink of an eye with no apparent qualms.\\"* The Downing Street Memo which revealed that we were fixing the intelligence and the facts around policy so we could invade Iraq.* Previously selected White House press with preplanned questions that the president knew of in advance of the actual press conference.* White House Press being marched into the press room in columns of twos like they were school children.* The Pentagon paid millions of dollars to plant positive stories of the American occupation in Iraqi newspapers.* The administration paying actors to pose as reporters in fake video news promoting its Medicare prescription drug plan.* Planting letters from veterans to their hometown newspapers until someone discovered the similarities in many of them.* The Bush administration giving press credentials to James Dale Guckert a.k.a. Jeff Gannon, an auto mechanic and male prostitute. Gannon always asked questions with a false premise or one that knocked democrats in the actual question.To these acts of lawbreaking and indiscretions, Ms. Thomas expresses displeasure with a press that found them unnewsworthy.This is an excellent book to remind us of what we should expect and even demand more from our press. It is an excellent expose how conglomerates with singular points of view are buying the communications media to filter the news we receive. It reveals how newspapers and TV networks cave in to right wing pressure to fire reporters for telling the truth, or getting a network to withhold a story of Ronald Reagan because it was partially unflattering.Helen's words are a siren song that illustrate how we are in danger of losing our most important freedom--our freedom of the press. We need bold leaders but an even bolder press. In the words of Edward R. Murrow whom Ms. Thomas quotes, \\"No one can terrorize a whole nation, unless we are all his accomplices.\\"Our indifference and acquiescence makes accomplices of us all."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Thomas's book is a good overview of the evolution of the Washington press corps and its relationships with various presidents since the 50s. Anyone who wants to gain insight on the current press corps' lapdog relationship with the Bush administration would do well to read this book.And, contrary to what John R. Linnel would have you believe, the book is not a hysterical diatribe against the Bush administration. While Thomas is critical of Bush in places, she is an equal opportunity curmudgeon, lashing out mainly at what she sees as the dangerous abdication of the press of its central role as watchdog in a democratic society.The book drags in places, but it's nice to have the voice of long experience to help give shape to one's view of an important democratic institution."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"It is something to be known as the \\"dean of the White House press corps\\" and Helen Thomas, more than anyone else, has been there and seen it all over a career that has lasted for decades. Now it is her turn to tell it all, and she does with dead-on accuracy. She's earned it.Covering every president since JFK, Helen describes each one and the press secretaries with whom she has had to deal. Mincing no words, she reserves some of her harshest judgment for those in the press who fell asleep at the wheel after 9/11. For those of us who wondered who was asking the tough questions, Helen Thomas answers it....they weren't. While we know where the author stands with regard to the current administration she fleshes out her feelings about why this Washington crowd is the worst in years.She spends some time toward the end of the book reflecting on journalists she admires and I was glad to see her include an acquaintance of mine, Pauline Frederick, whose job covering the United Nations was exemplary. Helen had other favorites, too.....Mary McGrory, Scotty Reston and Walter Cronkite, to name just a few others.What is so good about \\"Watchdogs of Democracy?\\" is that is not just a collection of remembrances. Helen Thomas also paints a bleak future for \\"serious\\" journalism as we now have FOX News passing off as the real thing and a decline in the amount of time news organizations devote to non-entertainment news.Helen Thomas has had a remarkable career and \\"Watchdogs of Democracy?\\" is a terrific journalistic addition for those of us who remember the days of the men and women she covered and wonder about the direction of journalism in the twenty-first century. I highly recommend her book for its wisdom and insight."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Ms. Thomas is a great lady, a national treasure, and one of the last incorruptible members of the fourth estate. In an exhaustive tour-de-force, she charts every aspect of the state of journalism, from plagiarism scandals, the repeal of the fairness doctrine, the major Supreme Court decisions, corporate media control, the criminal laxness on reporting the Iraq War to the current scripted infomercials of the Bush administration. Through her decades-long coverage of the White House, she details the war against the press by every president: but she reserves a special place for the sleazy practices of both Richard Nixon and George Bush. Her conclusion at every turn is that the current press is indeed failing America through cowardice, sloppiness, corporate bottom lines and pandering - they are forgetting that they occupy an essential place in our democracy, questioning those in power.I have had the personal pleasure of meeting and talking with Ms. Thomas in an informal gathering, and she, not failed directors of the CIA, deserves a Medal of Freedom for her long and great service to truth -- pretty unthinkable from the current administration."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"The strongest portion this book is the author's critique of each of the Presidents she covered from kennedy onward in terms of the relationship with the Press. Ms. Thomas pulls no punches and that is the strength of this book. You get the real deal from her and an understanding of why she was barred from the Press room by Bush Jr. for asking his administration t tough questions."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Helen Thomas has been the true \\"Watchdog of Democracy\\" -- covering every president since JFK. Her insights into how press coverage of the White House has changed and evolved (not always for the better) should be required reading for all voters, and students of history, political science and journalism. Written in an easy, conversational tone, it is informative, educational and fun! Republican, Democrat or Independent -- you won't be sorry you purchased this book."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Note that individuals such as John R. Linnell submit asinine ravings about politics, but do not review the text at hand.

Ms. Thomas, who pitches hardball questions during press conferences if she is allowed to do so, has very coherently and successfully produced a well-reasoned text about why the press corps failed the American people by not investigating the shenanigans surrounding the present administration. This is a necessary read for journalism students and probably for those interested history and political science."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"A chunk of this book is accolades to outstanding reporters and news peers of Thomas's, but most of it points out ways in which reporting has failed to be probing and questioning of authority, with a complete collapse of that function in the Bush years. Traces the history of how White House news has been increasingly managed and scripted over the last 4 or 5 decades, and how news has generally become more sanitized and shallow over that time. Troublesome food for thought, and a general wake-up call about asking hard questions and what it takes to be an informed public (or to inform the public). As a writer now dealing with news analysis I found this particularly helpful in thinking about the ethics and greater purpose of news-related writing."},{"Title":"Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public","review":"Helen Thomas has covered the White House since JFK and her insight into how the media has failed in the recent years to cover the White House and be the Watchdogs of Democracy is \\"Right on Point.\\" There are very few \\"Real\\" Journalists like hardworking Helen Thomas around anymore!!"},{"Title":"A Song of Longing: AN ETHIOPIAN JOURNEY","review":"This book, of great scholarly significance, also happens to be a thrilling read. It tells how a distinguished scholar goes about her work when that work is both demanding and dangerous.Kay Kaufman Shelemay's sojourn among the Beta Israel in rural Ethiopia in the 1970s was accomplished against great odds, and stands as a monument to anthropological field work. Think of it: before she ever went, in preparation for work in northern Ethiopia and while still an American graduate student, she studied Hebrew and Amharic in Israel, then more Amharic and Ge'ez (the liturgical language of Ethiopian Christians and Jews) in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. And, now in retrospect, the study of these difficult languages appears as the easy part. She often had to work without any of the comforts of Western life, sometimes while bullets were literally flying around her. How many people bring so much courage, so much mental, emotional, and sheer physical determination to a study of anything ?Once her work was accomplished, Shelemay was able to join the small handful of distinguished scholars who, in the course of about twenty years, revolutionized our understanding of Ethiopian Jews. Among the others are, most notably, Steven Kaplan (\\"The Beta Israel (Falasha) in Ethiopia,\\" 1992) and James Quirin (\\"The Evolution of Ethiopian Jews: A History of the Beta Israel (Falasha) to 1920,\\" 1992). Shelemay's own major work is \\"Music, History, and Falasha History,\\" 1989.To put it briefly, these scholars have shown the Ethiopian Jews to share with Ethiopian Christians a long history of Judeo-Christian culture in Ethiopia. It is not for nothing that the Ethiopian emperors were considered descendants of King Solomon. These scholars have shown Ethiopian Christians and Jews to share a now-sacred language (Ge'ez), as well as much of their liturgy and their religio-cultural outlook. If one were to look for something to fault Shelemay, it may be her emphasis on Christian-Jewish similarity to the exclusion of some very real differences. This latter task, clarifying the differences, has now been undertaken by a younger Israeli scholar, Hagar Salamon (\\"The Hygena People,\\" 1999).\\"A Song of Longing\\" only touches lightly upon the results of her field work. Most of the book is taken up with a very detailed account of the nuts and bolts of doing the work: all the unbelievable difficulties, all the dangers, and, perhaps most striking of all, the details of the Marxist takeover that occurred while she was there and that ultimately ended her stay in the country. There is even a love story with a happy ending, but I must leave that to the reader to discover for himself.In a book of such exceptional quality, the editorial blemishes can almost be overlooked. Almost, but not quite. The publisher and his copy editors were clearly asleep while this book was in production. It is riddled with typos, grammatical errors, malapropisms. The index is almost a joke. The Ge'ez language, so crucial to the author's story and frequently mentioned by her, cannot be found in this index ! The publisher owes it to his own conscience -- not to speak of the world of scholarship -- to prepare a corrected edition forthwith."},{"Title":"A Song of Longing: AN ETHIOPIAN JOURNEY","review":"Kay Kaufman, a graduate student in Ethnomusicology, went off to Ethiopia in 1973 to study the music of the Beta Israel, Ethiopia's Jewish community, otherwise known as Falashas. Though she managed to collect a considerable amount of religious music in a village east of Gondar, a town in the provinces, the immense changes that accompanied the overthrow of Haile Selassie and the Ethiopian monarchy, overwhelmed her research and she finished by studying Ethiopian Christian liturgy in Addis Ababa. Meanwhile, she met and married a Jewish businessman, Jack Shelemay, from a Middle Eastern (Aden) family permanently settled in Ethiopia. A SONG OF LONGING is not then an academic book about Ethiopian religious music, rather it is a tale of Kaufman's fieldwork experience. It is also a story of cross-cultural marriage, the foreign population of Addis Ababa in the early \`70s, and a descriptive narrative of the early years of the Ethiopian revolution. Woven together very deftly, it reads easily. The reader goes back and forth from descriptions of ritual and village life, rural travel, problems for female researchers in a society where most women stay at home, life among the Shelemay family in their luxurious apartment block, and sketches of various expatriates that the author met during her stay. Unfortunately there are no photographs. Books like Paul Rabinow's \\"Reflections on Fieldwork in Morocco\\" may give more attention to actual problems of fieldwork---this is a rich description of anthropological research in a most difficult time. It would be a useful book for everyone planning to do research in a politically unstable area. (See also Stephanie Kane's \\"The Phantom Gringo Boat\\")As a result of her research and further work on Ethiopian history back in the USA, Shelemay realized that the Beta Israel had not maintained an ancient tradition unbroken from the time of Solomon and Sheba. They were not in fact descendants of Jews who had arrived from the Middle East at some point in antiquity. They more likely were Ethiopian Christian mountain people who had preserved a form of local Christianity which was already highly Judaized and which had arrived in their remote villages with monks back in the 1400s. The repercussions for the treatment of Ethiopian Jews in Israel and their status in the Jewish world could have been great. It seems to me that Shelemay's conclusions are valid, but after over 100 years of growing exposure to mainstream Jewish tradition, the Falasha are certainly as Jewish as anyone else who claims to be. While her findings may set history straight, they should not reflect on anyone's Judaism today."},{"Title":"A Treasury of American Prints A Selection of One Hundred Etchings and Lith ographs By the Foremost American Artists (First Edition)","review":"I pick it up, I start leafing through it, and I can't put it down. I want to own all of these images in the originals. I like this book.In 1939 Craven edited this astonishing accumulation of American prints and lithographs.This was a middle-brow affair: quality reproductions of 100 prints from premier American artists on attractive, linen-like, buff paper in a spiral binding in slipcase. The book explains that the binding was designed to allow purchasers to easily detach prints and frame them.(So, heads up, collectors -- many copies have missing prints. One of the oddities of the 1st edition is that, while the plates themselves total 100, the List of Plates index appears to stop at 99; the last plate is out of alphabetical order -- Good's \\"Valse Brillante.\\")There's not an abstract print to be found here. Outside of that, it is difficult to generalize about this rich collection of images. They are excecuted in many styles. They contain a balance between portrait, landscape, but mostly depict Americans in utterly American environments: on the road, in their homes, in cities, in the land. This was produced at the end of the Great Depression, after all, and there is an heroic yet unfiltered eye directed to the American spirit in much of this work.Here's how Craven puts it in his introduction. He maintains that now American art has become, well, American art -- \\"a decisive victory over provincial ignorance, anemic imitation, cheap internationalism, and the postwar hang-over of esthetic snobbery [1920's decadence?].\\"The following artists have at least one plate in this book: Peggy Bacon, Thomas Benton, Aaron Bohrod, Alexander Brook, Andrew Butler, Howard Cook, John Curry, Adolf Dehn, Wanda Gag, George Grosz, Edward Hopper, Kuniyoshi, Reginald Marsh, Boardman Robinson, John Sloan, Harry Wickey, Grant Wood, and Mahonri Young."},{"Title":"Other \\"Titanic\\"","review":"Simon Martin manages to write in sure a way which makes you feel part of the story, both when the ship hits the reef, and when the salvage operation takes place. Goes into detail over the operation, but keeps it light and interesting to all. Great peak into the ways of life on the Shetland's Isles as well. A real joy to read."},{"Title":"Other \\"Titanic\\"","review":"The Other Titanic is the story of two divers - Simon Martin and Alec Crawford who went to the Isle of Foula in the Shetlands, and managed one of the most remarkable salvage operations in modern times, the recovery of the valuable non ferous metal from the White Star liner Oceanic which had been wrecked off Foula in 1914.Apart from the incredible story of the salvage operation which was undertaken on a shoestring and with minimal heavy lifting gear, the reader also gets to know more about the RMS Oceanic which prior to the Olympic class liners had been one of the White Star Line's greatest and most magnificently appointed ships. The book features pictures of the Oceanic in her prime and also shots of her magnificent and sumptuous interiors. A book not to be missed for Titanic and shipping fans generally."},{"Title":"How to Win at Super Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Games","review":"If you want a super nintendo book, this is definetly the best one.

My husband had a blast playing a Black Fury male. A great synopsis of how the tribes relate to their Kin, written from the POV of a Fianna Kin. My only problem is that to get all the Numina, you need two or three other books. This book gives great templates and directions for creating human and wolf Kin, as well as ideas for creating Kin for other Changers. Gives a rundown on BSD Kin, as well as the infamous SkinDancers. You know, the ones that ruined it even more for the other Kin."},{"Title":"Kinfolk: Unsung Heroes","review":"The thing to understand about Kinfolk is, even though it is a book with rules for creating characters, this is not a product for players of werewolf games unless you are really wanting something unusual. The best application of this publication is the creation of NPCs and allies. Storytellers get information to add a great deal of depth to the supporting group of Werewolf, kinfolk.This is part of the Year of Allies run, and is a sister book to Ascension's Right Hand and the Ghoul book. This book allows players to play an almost unimpressive human, with only a slight gnosis rating at best and a shot-gun standing between them and the creatures of the night. However a storyteller that really puts the extra effort into their games can detail their NPCs heavily with this book. I would suggest it as reading for players to get a better understanding of the world, but every storyteller needs access to this book, even if you aren't playing a Werewolf game just so they can design something new for those vampires to fight."},{"Title":"Kinfolk: Unsung Heroes","review":"I thought that it was a very good book, it had everything you want to know about kinfolk and more, it told the differences the kin have towards each other, it even had discriptions about the black spiral kin."},{"Title":"Kinfolk: Unsung Heroes","review":"I was wary to buy this book, but now that I have it, I'm completely pleased. The writing is simply fantastic, and much of the information is presented in a fascinating first person approach. The only problem that I have with this book is that I wish that it was twice as long. I think I've read it through two or three times now, and I've only had it for a month. The art is not as fantastic as it is in some White Wolf books, but the clever approach to presenting the information makes up for what lacks in illustration."},{"Title":"Kinfolk: Unsung Heroes","review":"Wowee. You get to play a person who knows about Garou and the Wyrm, but with no actual powers? Kinda like being Frank Stallone or Roger Clinton. I bought this book mainly to find out what it was to be a Kinfolk. And granted, there's a lot of informative stuff in here. But the book tends to be less than expected. While the chance to be even more of an outsider in the World of Darkness might appeal to some, this book is of more use as a one-shot game than any part of a serious chronicle.

As a master's level student in the field of psychology, with the upbringing of a Baptist preacher's kid, I loved Allport's efforts to point out both the pro's and con's of fully psychological or fully religious worldviews. Long before CBT became the therapy method of choice, Allport was pointing out the cognitive fallacies of being singularly grounded in either topic. He paved the way for future generations of psychologists to realize the strength that religion can be when the transcending goal is individual well-being."},{"Title":"The Individual and His Religion: A Psychological Interpretation","review":"This book is a classic in the psychology of religion. Allport provides the foundation for his later distinction between \\"intrinsic\\" and \\"extrinsic\\" religious orientation. Any researcher who uses these later measures needs to know what Allport originally meant to convey in the term \\"intrisic\\", mature religion.Gordon Allport was a personality psychologist, and believed that mature personalities needed to have an overarching philosophy by which to organize the various components of personality. Allport thought that a mature religious worldview could serve as this overarching philosophy, and that compared to other possible worldviews, mature religion might fulfill this function best."},{"Title":"The Individual and His Religion: A Psychological Interpretation","review":"The book arrived pretty quickly, and in pretty good condition - as advertised.

Sometimes on the border of being sentimental, it's very sweet. The prose is elegant,the words and ideas simple, without being simplistic. My favorite passage reads &quot;Whatever seemed unfinished once now is undefinable. I had thought God interested in creating puzzles out of life when He had meant for me to stand in awe of beauty. What an easy thing to feel that is when it's messenger stands before me.&quot;Another passage, worth noting, reads &quot;Your fingernails, little as they are, have small white moons sailing over their crests.

And others, like writer and teacher Ellen Braverman absorb the joys, the sadness', the ups and downs and not only learn---they share their wisdom with the rest of us. And that's what One Woman's Journey Towards Self is all about.Ellen gives us, in beautiful poetic metre, a sampling of her fears, her searching, the horrors and the blessings of life. For instance, about searching (Many Roads) we read, \\"Many roads/ many paths/ which one should I take?/ Does it really matter?/ or/ do they all lead to the same place?/ a/ new beginning.\\"And about fear, Ellen writes, \\"I didn't come here to always be in fear./ I came/ to experience/ the joy/ of being human/ on this Earth/ at this time/ no matter/ what!\\". Her poem, Love is about blessings, \\"Loving yourself/ is/ the greatest/ gift/ you can/ give/ to/ yourself\\".Ellen's poem about horror is titled I Am the Jew and it speaks to the holocaust. \\"Mountains of bones/ of burnt flesh/ of gassed men, women and children/ of empty holes./ I am the Jew/ who shoveled this/ all into/ one neat pile./ I am the Nazi/ who ordered the Jew/ to shovel all this/ into one neat pile./ I am the Jew/ and/ I am the Nazi/ that I see standing before/ me.\\"One Woman's Journey Towards Self is poetry that is heartfelt and as timeless as humanity. Ellen Braverman sees, feels and has a wonderful talent to put her observations into words that are both moving and thrilling.

There was no &quot;Y2K Crisis.&quot; Civilization as we know it did not come to an end at one second past midnight on the morning of January 1, 2000. So if you got into an argument with someone who said it wouldn't happen, and maybe suggested that his doubts were due to a limited mental capacity, or that he was simply too lazy to consult the latest &quot;information&quot; on the subject, then perhaps you owe that person an apology, because nothing that was predicted to accompany the arrival of the year 2000 due to the absence of two decimal places in the year fields of programs and operating systems EVER happened! NOTHING! I know because I was there, along with about 6 billion other people. And many of us monitored the progression of the new millennium as it began at the International Date Line and moved west through Asia, Australia, Europe, to where I was then living in the Chicago area, and beyond. Our public utilities continued to function, our computers continued to work, and our nuclear missiles remained in their silos. People on life-support systems in hospitals didn't turn up dead, refrigeration systems didn't fail, and our water supplies remained safe. In short: nothing happened. NOTHING! Even though virtually every important industry in our global economy admitted that the &quot;Y2K Problem&quot; was still years away from being completely solved, and that the &quot;Y2K Bug&quot; would still permeate our systems for quite some time, NOTHING HAPPENED. The supposed &quot;bug&quot; that was going to be responsible for the &quot;problem&quot; that would inevitably lead to a &quot;crisis&quot; that would send us back to the Dark Ages while perhaps triggering Armageddon NEVER happened! Was there ANY result from this Y2K fiasco? No. Instead, the ultimate mega-event of all recorded history became known for primarily one thing: that nothing happened. We waited for something to happen. We looked for something to happen. January 1 went by. January 2 went by. January itself went by, and through February and March of 2000 we still thought something might happen, but nothing did. Nothing, that is, except that for a certain cadre of unscrupulous authors, such as the ones who edited and wrote this book, the party was over, and there was no more money to be made off uninformed and/or gullible readers from THIS particular scare scenario.

I live in Arizona and have done a lot of travel in the Southwest. I read the whole book but was only interested in some of the areas covered particularly those that I had visited. Those particular chapters I would give 5 stars but other chapters that I had no interest in would only rate a 1 or 2 stars, not because it wasn't well written but because I just wasn't interested in that particular area.

The West is not all John Wayne and it's definitely not all citified and soft. I liked his stops in the Bitterroot Mountains of Idaho, Chief Joseph country in Oregon, and the American River in California. Some of the low ratings by certain reviewers almost sound/appear as though they have an axe to grind, or something personal against the author.

Though dated, recommended reading - 1998 was not that long ago, especially in the West."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"Egan's direct, profound insight make this socio-history of the West remarkable. From tracing the paths of writers like Edward Abbey, to carving out a new perspective on the way the West is currently being won, Egan's book is an important read, especially for easterners and midwesterners removed from the issues the book presents. The West's immigrant communities and its continuing demographic migrations, as Egan points out, will shape America's future. The only criticism I have is that he doesn't delve into California sufficiently. The book ends with a look at California and some broad, bold statements about it. But, he doesn't present the same kind of historical analysis on California as he does with the rest of the West, and this leaves a reader wanting more or at least and explanation for his statements. However, for great insight into the modern sociology of Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, this book offers a thorough and entertaining analysis."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"With his mixture of current topical events and delvings into forgotten or buried frontier history (the Mormon massacre of the Arkansas pilgrims was a shocker to me), Egan delivers an excellently written, witty and informative exploration of several towns in the Southwest and Northwest.

A good read."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"The best book I have read this year. Call me sentimental but I cried as I turned the last page of this book. We in Seattle are blessed with having probably the three best &quot;travel&quot; writers in America today: Egan, Jonathan Raban and John Krakauer. Egan is probably the most expressive of the three and he sows his words and sentences together to create a tapestry of the American West that is as true a picture in less than 250 pages that I have ever read.Not to disparage another writer, but I read Lasso the Wind right after completing An Empire Wilderness which basically covers the same territory. There is no comparison in style, insight or emotional involvement.Having just completed a swing around the Northwest quadrant of America on an extended camping trip I can associate with every footstep the author took in gathering his material. Hopefully this book will create the awareness that is needed to save us from &quot;progress&quot;"},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"I don't often read nonfiction books that make me laugh out loud, but this one did. Egan is something of a gonzo journalist, taking on the vast subject of the American West and finding in it cause for both wonder and humor. The book is a collection of 14 essays, in which the author travels to places in 11 different states, giving readers plenty of local history, descriptions of dramatic landscapes, and a portrayal of \\"custom and culture\\" that reels under colliding visions of what the West should be. At every turn, he has an eye for ironies that both reveal and entertain.After an introduction that takes place at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, he begins his journey in New Mexico and Arizona, then moves northward, swinging through Colorado, Montana, and the Great Basin states, ending in California. There is much about cowboys, cattlemen, and Native Americans. We also visit London Bridge at Lake Havasu, an ostrich ranch outside Denver, the pit left behind by the Anaconda copper mining company in Butte, the casinos of Las Vegas, and the site of an appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the back of a road sign in Sunnyside, Washington. There are accounts of fishing in the Bitterroots of Idaho, river rafting on the American River above Sacramento, and hunting for Anasazi petroglyphs in the canyons of the Escalante in Utah.Meanwhile history comes alive from a colorful and sometimes jaundiced perspective in stories of the conquistador Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate's conquest of the Indians at Acoma in New Mexico, the massacre of a wagon train of settlers by Mormons at Mountain Meadows, Utah, in the 1860s, and the California Gold Rush. There are historical figures who make vivid appearances, including Theodore Roosevelt, John Muir, Lewis and Clark, and Brigham Young. The most affecting story is the author's retelling of Chief Joseph and the fate of the Nez Perce.Egan gives us a whirlwind trip across a vast area of the U.S. He touches on themes that are common in books about the west -- the follies and vanities of those who have defied the realities of its arid climate, laid waste to natural resources, decimated its wildlife, and attempted to eradicate its native populations. While there is much to lament in what it reveals of the devastation brought by settlement of the West, it also seeks earnestly for signs that the spirit of the West still survives and can eventually thrive.I highly recommend this book as an addition to any bookshelf of Western nonfiction. As a companion volume, I also recommend Frank Clifford's \\"The Backbone of the World,\\" which recounts a similar journey by a journalist across the states that lie along the Continental Divide."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"I am an Australian who has never been to the United States, so I might be coming at this book from a different perspective to many.I thought the writing was wonderfully evocative, both in the positive descriptions (eg. the Western landscape) and the negative descriptions (eg. the stupidity of cows). I got a real sense of the beauty of the land.I thought the social and political aspect of the book was also really interesting because it took a view of American history which doesn't assume that you know who Thomas Jefferson was, but still requires some intelligence from the reader. Rather than just rubbishing traditional Western lifestyles, Egan engages with and explores them. He then offers some possible future solutions which are interesting and seem practical.I found the way Egan combined natural and political and social and demographic history into one whole comprehensible theory fantastic."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"As a native Californian who has visited most of the places in Egan's book, I can say he got it right. This is one of the best books I've read this year because it cleverly mixes sociology, history, travel book and future-predicting. Between this book and Tony Horwitz' Confederates in the Attic (which is a similarly mixed book about the South) I learned a lot about the South and the West. Now if only someone would take on Northeast and the Midwest..."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"After reading 'A Good Rain' a number of years ago, I couldn't wait for Egan's next book. And I was not disappointed. Egan casts aside the romantic visions and fanatasies about the real West, and gives his readers a large dose of reality and fact. As with his previous book, I felt myself both incredibly drawn by his accounts, descriptions and history of his subjects - while at the same time agonizing for the atrocities carried out by my predecessors. Egan's prose perfectly captures the geography of the west in a way few authors have been able to.'Lasso the Wind' falls under the \\"must read\\" category for anyone living, working or studying in the West...regardless of whether they are a 5th generation rancher or a 1st generation Sierra Club volunteer."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"In choosing his title, Lasso the Wind, Timothy Egan establishes the ironic metaphor for his collection of essays on the New West. Here is an evasive hydra-headed monster of ranchers and cowboys, Indians and explorers, movie stars and utopian visionaries, poets and painters, politicians and poor folk. The multifarious populations are depicted in an epic struggle for identity and definition, where the frenetic forces of politics and economics have destroyed centuries of culture while laying the precarious ground for new dreams. The underlying unity of the fifteen essays that comprise this book is to be found in the historical narratives of redefinition that have made the West a land of layers and buried stories. In his early musings, Egan observes that the vastness of the land has been the source of an almost delusional sense that the land can be anything that the Newcomer wants it to be. And millions of dollars and whole populations of people would shift and groan in the wake of those impulsive creations. In time, the land itself would pose its restrictions and exert a kind of revenge. As the land became part of the United States of America, it was subject to a dizzying barrage of exploitation: digging, damming, cutting, stomping, muddying, mining, fencing, buying, and selling. Now, as these various exploits are exposed, there is a kind of enlightened potential being explored: We can persist and hold tight to old myths and visions, or embrace the new.In his summary essay on a raft trip down the American River in California, Egan sees the recent denizens of the West \\"Radically altering the land, living on phony myths, ignoring the best features or trying to kill them. And it is Western glory in its own fine way: a new society, with a tolerance of fledgling souls, embracing the possible.\\" When enough folks embrace the possible over several hundred years, it's time for a writer like Egan to come around and sort through the pieces. Lasso the Wind is an attempt to do just that, and to offer a perspective from which to understand the current changes that are occurring in the West of today."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"Extremely well written, with use of irony, sarcasm, humor to make the reader realize how ridiculous the pioneer, shoot-em-up western image is, when compared to Native American customs. There are some spooky people out west."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"Egan's 14 chapters on various locales of the interior West slowly, but completely, demolish the mythology of perhaps the most mythologized part of the United States -- the West, or more properly, the West that is east of the Sierra Nevada and the Cascades.Those politicians and groups who are out to &quot;save the West&quot; from city dwellers, newcomers and environmentalists will not like this book, but everyone interested in the West will find Egan's description and commentary arresting."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"It's taken me a little over one hour of searching on the internet to finally find this title. From what I remember, although not written as 'gonzo' and down-to-Earth as I would've preferred, it was an outstanding book in that it covered the states I was interested in moving to and talked about the past, present and future cultures of those places. I believe that type of thing is called the 'Deep Map' or 'Bio-Regionalism' style of 'travel writing'?Anyways, love that kind of multi-disciplinary approach and will be buying this book (after renting it from the library a few years ago) ...we'll see if it holds up to my memories of it....the fact that I remembered it and have taken so much of my morning searching it out should say something about how unique it is, at least for me!:)"},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"Timothy Egan has expanded his entertaining essays geographically from the Northwest (The Good Rain) to the &quot;Real West&quot; in Lasso the Wind. First of all, his definition of the West is dead on - it's not California, it's not Texas, and it's not Oregon or Washington (at least West of the Cascades). The snapshot stories gathered here give a caption on past and present life in this region. Very well written. Having visited many of the same places, I found myself agreeing with his view of the destruction and development of the West. Enjoy this book - Egan should now be regarded as one of the voices and defenders of the West. Let's hope more people listen."},{"Title":"Lasso the Wind: Away to the New West","review":"Not until after I finished Egan&#65533;s Lasso the Wind did I realize how fast the book went. Egan is the rare writer who can easily combine a meaningful and entertaining story. OK then a well-written story explains why the book went fast. Or maybe the fast pace is due the fact that Egan covers some 11 western states in the span of 250 pages. The book&#65533;s tempo seems to come from someone who lives in New York, New York. I wonder if Egan has been making too many trips to The New York Times corporate office to pitch stories to his editor. Its probably not a coincidence that the author takes advantage of the &#65533;no speed limits&#65533; to rocket through a stretch of Montana, only to get the attention of a state trooper. Driving habits aside, Egan manages to get in touch with the heart of issues that are unique to the Western states. I enjoyed really getting to see these special places through his eyes. Throughout the book, Egan sees the West with a candid and objective eye, but always remains hopeful. An excerpt from the end of the book on California really depicts Egan&#65533;s thinking of the West:&#65533;But every Westerner should look at California&#65533;s story; as it turns out, it is their own history and the fount of most of their follies, a mirror across the Sierra. Radically altering the land, living on phony myths, ignoring the best features or trying to kill them. And it is Western glory in its own fine way: a new society, with a tolerance of fledgling souls, embracing the possible. What is different is that California has done it all faster, with more excess and greater consequence than any other Western state. To believe California is dead, then, is to believe that the West is dead, or soon will be. I cannot.&#65533;"},{"Title":"The Golden Era: West by Rail with the Harvey Girls","review":"This paper doll book covers the years from 1922 to 1927. In addition to the five 8-inch dolls and their outfits, there is a journal. The journal tells the story of the characters and the clothing they wear. Each doll has a variety of costumes including uniforms, everyday wear, and dressy clothes. Various hairstyles are provided for the females. This book is very well done. The dolls and clothes are printed on glossy cardstock and paper. The colors appear to be the correct hues for the time. Beside each costume is a short description with fashion notes and the year. The fashion notes vary in contents. They may contain the materials used, the names of the colors, the source of the clothing, or when it was worn. Many of the outfits came from the Sears catalog. Unlike many paper doll books for the Twenties, this one shows ordinary people not movie stars or the rich and famous. The book also includes a brief glossary of fashion terms and a bibliography. The back cover has a map showing where the events of the journal occurred and a picture of Fred Harvey. It packs a lot of information in its few pages. After carefully removing the pages of dolls and costumes you can reassemble the book and have the complete journal. If you cut out the fashion notes and attach them to the back of the outfits, you will have them for future reference. If you're interested in fashion of the Twenties, the history of the West or the Harvey Girls get this book. (I was personally disappointed in the book only because I wanted the Harvey Girls of an earlier period. The description of the book didn't include the dates when I ordered it.)"},{"Title":"The World Treasury of Children's Literature : Book 1 and 2 in slipcase","review":"This was my favorite book when I was little, and I have read the entire book many times.

Nothing could be further from the truth. There is a certain pleasure to be derived from such tales that take us back to the days when life was simple and so many things were still possible. As adults, we find it too easy to consider things impossible. So much so that we can convince ourselves not to do things simply because we have lost our sense of wonderment. If you talk to scientists, of which I have been one, they will say that to be successful, you must have an overpowering curiosity and a passion to learn how things work. In other words, never lose the child's sense of wonder and discovery and still believe in the fairy tale. As the late, great baseball player Roy Campanella used to say, \\"You have to be a man to play this game, but you also have to have a lot of little boy in you.\\"I read fairy tales often, as refreshing interludes between writing and reading technical books in mathematics and computing. I have found the tales in this book to be very refreshing, having read my favorites many times over. The stories by Hans Christian Anderson and the Grimm brothers are my favorites. While the situations are of course fantasy, the points of the stories are very true, still applicable centuries after they were first put on paper. I once made myself very unpopular in responding to a business initiative by ending an e-mail with the acronym BTEHNC (But The Emperor Has No Clothes). After a day of angry responses, the proposal was recognized as the empty balloon that it was and it was quickly canceled and forgotten.So much of our cultural heritage appears in the folk tales that were orally passed down for generations before they were finally committed to paper. We owe it to all future generations, starting with our children, to make sure that these tales stay part of our cultural memory.

Even at this point, I can only say that WIDE SARGASSO SEA is an ingenious work of poignant contradictions.I actually first heard of this book a few years ago, when I rented a movie by the same name. I watched that movie and, despite a few minute clues, did not until the very end recognize it as being prequel to one of my all-time most beloved novels: Charlotte Bronte's JANE EYRE. This story chronicles the untold tale in Bronte's novel - the history and mystery behind Mr. Rochester's secret in the attic unveiled, the madwoman in the attic endowed with a soul. \\"Bertha\\" Antoinette Cosway-Mason is a Creole heiress living in Jamaica and Dominica in the 1830's whose isolated and tragic upbringing is augmented by the cultural chaos of that place and that time. Shunned by both the English and white population and the recently freed slaves, then further burdened by her manipulative relatives and insane mother, Antoinette's childhood and early adulthood was as intensely oppressive as was the beauty of her surroundings. The first chapters of this novel are told in her voice - and what a marvelous voice it is - such richness, such poetry - \\"Great splashes of sunlight as we ran up the wooden steps of the refectory. Hot coffee and rolls and melting butter. But after the meal, now and at the hour of our death, and at midday and at six in the evening, now and at the hour of our death. Let perpetual light shine on them.\\" The tempo simply flows right through you; it is beautiful.Rhys's lyrical prose is beyond doubt a manner of genius; and I do believe this book is worthy of a classic. It really could have been brilliant, but it is riddled with flaws. First of all, the language is so exquisitely overflowing that it's almost a distraction. Yet within the context of the first section of the story - Antoinette's voice, encompassing her life before her marriage - I suppose may be overlooked and given up to the whims of the narrator.The second section, however, is from Mr. Rochester's point of view - from his first acquaintance with his bride and to their home in the West Indies, nearly through the balance of their time together on the islands. Rochester, who at the time is a very young English gentleman: a second son raised within the stringent confines of British landed gentry - arrives in a place totally alien to anything he has ever known, completely wide-eyed and ignorant of everything, from the temperamental weather patterns to the quirks of the denizens of that place. Yet Rhys gives him a lush, worldly and poetic voice, not at all unlike that of Antoinette's. In fact, when the narration switches briefly back to her, it's only distinguishable by studying closely the sway of the narration and pronoun use. Antoinette, incidentally, never refers to Rochester by name at any time during the entire book. Truly, though the author had essentially free reign with the character of \\"Bertha,\\" as that entity was only faintly drawn out in JANE EYRE, she was considerably restricted when it came to Rochester. In drawing him out, Rhys has failed on two counts: the first in that his language sounds too embedded within the lyrical rhythms of the alien landscape he supposedly fears and does not understand, to ever ring true for a young man of his circumstances; the second in that, notwithstanding the anger and bitterness felt toward his father and elder brother, Mr. Rochester's actions in this story do not in any way ring true to the man as Bronte wrote him. He's barely recognizable.The third, and final, portion of the story reverts back to Antoinette's point of view - this time from the garret room of Thornfield Hall. Though the writing here remains quite pretty, the narration completely loses its coherence. This loss may be construed as understandable - as the narrator would by now be quite mad - but it just doesn't strike true. The language is inconsistent - smooth and flowing in places, choppy in others. The tragic consequences of a bitter young man's revenge and a damaged young woman's confusion gets entirely lost here in the author's imposingly scattered prose.I am sure that, judged in its own right, this novel can quite easily be classified as a work of art. But loving JANE EYRE as I do, I am sorely unqualified to make the distinction. Yet I cannot deny that I was mesmerized by the overwhelmingly lush impact of the writing in WIDE SARGASSO SEA. Sick with a lingering fever and lamenting his fate, the young bridegroom makes the trudging maiden journey with his new bride to their honeymoon house in an island place called Massacre ~ \\"Everything is too much, I felt as I rode wearily after her. Too much blue, too much purple, too much green. The flowers too red, the mountains too high, the hills too near. And the woman is a stranger.\\"Ah, yes indeed ~"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"So, one of my friends from book club told me not too long ago that I expect the author to tell me the story...and I thought, well yeah no kidding that is their job. But now I get what she was really saying... That sometimes the reader needs to figure out what is being said beyond the dialog between the characters. And I realize that I don't do that as much as I could when I'm reading. One of the great things about being in a book club is that you can tap into the genius of your fellow readers and have things illuminated for you that you may have overlooked. It's also helpful if you are lucky enough to have really smart friends, like I am.This is one of those books that is saying a whole lot more than the words being exchanged between the characters. I honestly would have missed a lot of it with out our group discussion. I also found that I liked the book more after our discussion.This book is interesting because it gives the character \\"Bertha\\" from Jane Eyre, a voice, a life and a history. I don't think I would have appreciated the story as much if I hadn't already read Jane Eyre. Reading this right after Jane Eyre might have been even better than letting time pass before reading \\"Bertha's\\" story.The book is written from alternating perspectives. From Antoinette's point of view we learn about her childhood and the culture and political climate where she grew up. We later learn about Mr. Rochester, he is a second son who will never inherit his family's vast wealth. He decides to achieve his power and wealth through marriage to a woman in possession of her family's fortune. Ironically his father and brother both die before he returns to England and he inherits everything.This story is rich with symbolism, irony and symmetry. And I think that it's really about Imperialism, power and domination. And while it's not my preferred flavor of fiction, it's \\"shadowy and ambiguous\\" (to quote one of my smart friends again) and doesn't offer a lot of detail, it tells a story that stirs the reader emotionally.When I read Jane Eyre I saw \\"Bertha\\" as the barrier to Rochester's happiness, she was almost a caricature, I didn't really consider her as a person, she was the scary, crazy, pyromaniac in the attic. After reading 'Wide Sargasso Sea' I can see Antoinette as a person, sympathize with her struggles and agonize over how badly things turned out for her.In Wide Sargasso Sea, Rochester is the caricature, the example of Imperialism. He is the proud, self-righteous white man who will take whatever he wants and thinks so much of himself that he believes he deserves to do so. While at the same time he sees something that is new and different from all he has known and criticizes and dislikes it because it is different.The story is poignant because it could have turned out so differently. We already know from reading Jane Eyre that \\"Bertha\\" ends up locked in the attic as Rochester's prisoner. But there is a point in their relationship when it seems that they do truly love one another and could have gone on to have a happy life and marriage. But Rochester feels that he has been cheated and tricked and uses his anger to punish Antoinette for her past and her family's history.In Jan Rhys's hands \\"Bertha\\" has become the sympathetic character with a sad and unfortunate upbringing who falls under the power of a greedy, angry and unsympathetic husband who takes her away from the only place she has ever loved and eventually from the world.I would have appreciated a note on the history of the West Indies and the Emancipation Act. It would have offered insight into the context of the political situation during Antoine's childhood.I found the story much more complex than I initially realized. I recommend reading it with a friend or two...pick smart ones."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I have always loved Jane Eyre; in truth, it is one of my favorite novels and I've always been fascinated with Bertha...who was she, why was she insane, and what was Rochester's relationship with her? I was happy to find this book as it helped to provide me with some of those answers. I loved the lush imagery, the history of the land and the similarities between the land and Antoinette herself. The woman, the land, were overripe, exploited, misunderstood, wild. Rochester, like the Europeans, wanted to have the land/woman in his/the land's own terms, but the beauty and wildness of Antoinette and Jamaica were broken by the control. I wish that Rochester's character was better portrayed...sometimes I felt that his motives were not clear, his thoughts were never explained to my satisfaction. All in all, though, I enjoyed the novel and appreciate another perspective on a beloved old tale."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is a deceptive book--at first glance it appears much shorter and more accessible that its putative motivator and predecessor, Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" But the novel is fragmented, impressionistic, a pastiche of dreams and shifting viewpoints from inscrutable narrators. It's not at all an easy story to grab on to, yet it contains passages of undeniable evocative power, ranging from the Dionysian seductiveness of the tropics to the hysteria of a land in oppression and revolt.The reader who stays with the story--not once but two or three times--will be amply rewarded by an author capable of suggesting so much more than what appears on the surface. Rhys conveys the island culture, exposes its people and classes, but she also penetrates the psyche of a proud and brutal British colonist as well as the inner realm of fear and desire belonging to his prey: a woman and a culture in flux, both more wronged against than the other way around.The reader looking for a sequel to \\"Jane Eyre\\" is bound to be initially disappointed. Bronte establishes a style that, among its excellences, comes to represent an authoritative narrator and a decidedly confident Western point of view (albeit from a woman's angle of vision rather than a man's). By contrast, Rhys' style is so different as to strike the first-time reader as that of someone speaking, writing, and thinking in a language other than English--a language that the reader only gradually recognizes as his own.But that's much the novel's point--the strangeness and disorientation resulting from the invasion of a defenseless island by a stable, civilized, patriarchal society frustrated by its inability to assert its customary order and, above all, control. The Bertha Mason the reader meets in this story may be disappointing, unrecognizable, a construction as far removed from Bronte's and the reader's experience as a character from a completely different world. But that's who Bertha Mason is, the \\"real\\" Bertha Mason--and her difference should in no way exclude her from the reader's sympathy, curiosity, and desire to know more about her. Unlike the unnamed Rochester (who is certainly no less a stranger, especially to himself, than Bertha), the challenge for the reader (and all of us) is to learn from her and through her--the better to know ourselves.Though we may find the nightly television images from Haiti disturbing, we cannot afford to avert our eyes, to close our pocketbooks, to dissociate ourselves from the people of Haiti even as they die festering in the streets awaiting the bulldozers to plough them under. Bronte had some vague notion of the painful consequences of depriving others of their freedom, running heedlessly over their identities, and finally simply hiding them in some dark attic and throwing away the key. Paradoxical as it may seem, this latest catastrophe may be a first step toward unlocking the door. Contrary to Robertson, Limbaugh, and some of the other false prophets who purport to have access to higher wisdom, Haiti may not be God's punishment but our opportunity. The punishment could come should we fail to act to right a situation that next time could be much worse--and closer to our own shores.[Note: Despite Amazon's reference to the edition (above), this is the novel by Jean Rhys.]"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"\\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" was initially published by Jean Rhys in 1966. The novel functions, brilliantly, as a prequel of sorts to famed British 19th century novelist Charlotte Bronte's bookJane Eyre. However, Rhys has shifted the action of her book from the 1810s, in which Bronte's was set, to the 1830s, shortly after the emancipation of the slaves in Great Britain and the British Empire. \\"Sargasso\\" tells the unhappy backstory of West Indian heiress Bertha Mason, as she was to be known in her later life; she was to be the first Mrs. Rochester, the madwoman in the attic whom Jane Eyre must defeat in order to become the second Mrs. Rochester.Surely, in the history of Western literature, there can have been few more inspired ideas than that of Rhys's: to develop the tragic kernel at the heart of \\"Jane Eyre;\\" and few writers better equipped to do so. For Rhys was the daughter of a Welsh doctor who'd gone to the West Indies, and a third-generation Creole woman of Scottish descent. The author was born Ella Gwendolin Rees Williams, in 1890, in Roseau, Domenica, British West Indies. Rhys knew her homeland well; its snobbish, repressive, patriarchal culture; and the uneasy social position of the Creole woman, who was generally understood to be not necessarily entirely of white ancestry, but was merely accepted as such as a matter of social necessity. (The expression \\"West Indian white,\\" also meaning one who was not necessarily quite white, was also current at the time.) These women, as you can imagine, had an uneasy relationship with the blacks of the Islands; several of whom find a chance to tell Mr. Rochester that all Creole women are crazy. (And, at one point in the story, a servant calls Mason a \\"white cockroach,\\" a slur that I understand was frequently directed at Rhys herself in her early life.) This dichotomy will, of course, create tensions that will be difficult for such women to handle, and can be seen as a major cause of Mason's later madness; in addition to the fact that she has been taken away from her homeland to England, as she thought she wished. And she hates the cold grayness of that country, and fails to understand Rochester, or the English, properly.\\"Sargasso\\" runs less than 200 pages, and has not an extra word in it. Part I opens in the Caribbean, with Antoinette Cosway, the sensual young woman who is to be sold into marriage with Rochester. The author's descriptive writing here, on the flora and fauna, the social and economic lives of the Islands, is simply outstanding, passionate and powerful, almost hallucinatory. Part II gives us Rochester in the Caribbean: at one point, he says he has come to hate the Islands so much that he \\"would give [his] eyes never to have seen this abominable place.\\" (And those of us familiar with \\"Jane Eyre\\" will know that the first Mrs. Rochester will, indeed, cost him his eyes.) In Part III we see the unhappy Bertha Rochester, as she is now known, become the madwoman in the attic of his English home.Rhys is widely esteemed as a feminist author these days, as are all her works, but most particularly \\"Sargasso,\\" and its heart-wrenching tale of a woman at sea in an alien, hostile culture. As a writer, Rhys had fallen silent for many years, mid-career,until publishing \\"Sargasso.\\" The novel won the prestigious W.H.Smith Literary Award, also the Royal Society Literary Award. She said about it all:\\"It has come too late.\\" She was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1966, and a Commander of the British Empire in 1978, a year before her death."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I rate this book as one of the most beautiful ever written. It's also incredibly powerful &amp; sad, but mostly beautiful - all the senses are heightened by Jean Rhys's writing. Passionate &amp; delicate at the same time. Magnificent."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I, too, had to read this book in school, several years ago. I've reread it several times since. I'm always struck by the sheer beauty of the prose--the endless description. I don't feel it detracts from Jane Eyre, which I adore. If anything, it adds to it--provides another point of view. The themes explored are profound. This book makes an excellent companion to Jane Eyre, and stands equally well on its own. A beautiful, poetic novel."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys's novel offers the reader an indepth view into the mindset of Antoinette Cosway. Suddenly, the 'mad' woman in Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is brought to life. Rhys probes into the conflict between the Creole, Jamaican, and British in the Caribbean. This novel addresses the issue of race and culture, but it also addresses the inner thought processes of a woman confronted with cultural chaos. Jean Rhys has done a superb job in bringing Bronte's &quot;Bertha&quot; to life. I recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in Charlotte Bronte and/or Caribbean literature"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I enjoyed The Wide Sargasso Sea very much. It is absolutely haunting in its ability to evoke mood and the mystery of place. The book is divided into three parts. Part one is narrated by Antionette. Part two is narrated by Rochester and part three returns to Antionette, now mad Bertha who inhabits the tower at Thornfield. This story gives you a look into madness and suggests much more than organic causes for it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean RhysOriginally published 1966110 pagesFeminist; Classic4/5 starsSource: LibrarySummary: A postcolonial and feminist novel exploring the life of \\"Bertha Rochester,\\" immortalized as the madwoman in the attic, the wife of Jane Eyre's love Rochester. But was she a madwoman? Where did she come from? How did she come to such an end?Thoughts: Somehow I thought this was part of my FITG challenge which is why I picked it up. But apparently my memory fails because it is not. Still I wanted to read this response to Jane Eyre; I'm not a big fan of the Bronts as I think I've made clear but I still keep trying to force myself to like them.I really liked it. I wasn't sure what to expect and it was confusing at first as I tried to understand the social position of the Cosways. They are a former slave owning family, surrounded by former slaves who loathe them. Yet they are not rich and are not fully European. They are caught between two worlds and this is particularly important to understanding Antoinette (Bertha).It alternates between Antoinette and Rochester's point of view (although I'm not sure he was ever named). She narrates her childhood. Then he comes. He is slime; sent there by his family to marry wealth, he grows to despise her. He takes her money, has a sexual encounter with a servant right next to her room, and hates her. She wants his love desperately and he refuses. In the end, he takes her to England where she eventually starts the fire that takes her own life. She feels it's better that way...and I don't think she's wrong.The importance of names and their power is seen here. Originally she is born Antoinette Cosway; then her mother remarries and her last name becomes Mason; then she marries and is known as Antoinette Rochester; then he renames her Bertha. He ******* RENAMES her because he doesn't like her original name! I'm so angry about that.As a next step, I would like to read literary criticism of it because I think that will help me get more out of it. Although I am not the best reader of classics, I am trying to read more in order to become a more well-read person. There are probably a lot of things I missed, although I still enjoyed the book.Overall: I would recommend this to people who've read Jane Eyre with the caveat that the style is very different."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"After years of reading and re-reading JANE EYRE in high school and college, I discoveredthat there was a companion novel of sorts--WIDE SARGASSO SEA by Jean Rhys. Born on a Caribbeanisland, Jean Rhys emerged from years of isolation as a writer with this stunningly beautiful,well-crafted, and haunting novel.WIDE SARGASSO SEA is the mesmerizing story of a young mixed-up Creole woman namedAntoinette. From childhood, she is surrounded by a voodoo priestess, spirits,and political upheaval. That's enough to disorient anyone. She meets Rochester, a manshe believes she loves. She tries everything to gain and hold onto his love. 21stCentury women have the opportunities of going to college or pursuing a career.For a 19th Century woman like Antoinette, she must marry or be doomed. In Antoinette'scase, she's doomed anyway. Once she marries, Rochester has complete control of hermoney and convinces everyone that she is crazy.As I read WSS, I kept thinking, She's not crazy. I'm convinced Rochester was notthe Romantic hero Charlotte Bronte portrayed him to be. He was a money-grubbing cad.(Today Antoinette would have gotten a pre-nup.)Thanks to Jean Rhys for giving us this perceptive novel and letting us decidefor ourselves. WIDE SARGASSO SEA is, in my opinion, Jean Rhys' best novel.--Yolanda A. ReidAuthor of Porridge & Cucu: My ChildhoodPORRIDGE & CUCU: MY CHILDHOOD"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Here is the haunting story of Antoinette Cosway, a young girl growing up in post-slavery Jamaica, whose late father had been a slave owner.Jamaica is lush, beautiful, and roiled by racial tension. Author Jean Rhys, herself a native of Dominica, captures its brooding allure with prose that is as vivid as it is spare. Antoinette's widowed mother, isolated and fragile, can do little for her daughter. Antoinette's few real advocates include a biracial cousin who is in love with her, and a wise family servant who turns to Obeah when her stern practicality fails her. Neither can protect Antoinette from English society in Jamaica, when she graduates from convent school and her stepfather marries her off to the kind of ne'er-do-well Englishman who was then sent to the Caribbean to find his fortune with a Creole heiress. Antoinette will be a pawn in a world in which race and gender are powerful forces that determine destiny.The terrible mismatch is told from both points of view: the fearful, sensual, vulnerable young Antoinette, and her suspicious, austere, destructive husband. In the end Antoinette becomes the famous character from Jane Eyre; the mad wife Rochester keeps locked in the attic--a character Jean Rhys evidently sympathized with. Her desire to tell her story produced a canonic work that is an astounding, intriguing odyssey that I have read again and again for years."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea is the story that Charlotte Bronte did not tell - and Jean Rhys's masterful job in doing so. I had first heard about this book in an introduction to literature class I took Fall of '11, but although my interest was caught, I was floundering under the heavy weight of homework and recovering from a car accident, so the title got pushed to the back of my mind.Then, Spring '12, in my British Lit class, once again the title came up. We had been discussing Jane Eyre and Bertha - the mad woman in the attic, and batting around various theories. One of the theories that caught my interest was how Bertha was the parts of Jane that she had suppressed through years of practice. This was brought to mind especially with the similarities between the two characters. But then, once again, the title of Wide Sargasso Sea was put onto the board and I remembered that this was one I wanted to read.Then, fairly recently, an article was posted to Twitter of \\"modern literary adaptations\\" of classics that should be read. Once again, there was Jean Rhys's book .. so excuses aside, off to the library I went.Wide Sargasso Sea is a short, but meaty read. I actually read the book twice - two afternoons in a row. The story is one of Antoinette (known later as Bertha) and the path that led to her madness. Jean Rhys gives a powerful voice to the mad woman in the attic and, as expected, the story behind Bertha was a tragic one which parts a very unflattering picture of Mr. Rochester.If you would like to keep a romantic ideal of Mr. Rochester, I'd recommend steering clear of this title - however if you, like me, love Jane Eyre and would like to see Bertha given a voice (because, really people, she was LOCKED away in an attic), then I recommend picking this book up and letting it blow your mind a little."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean Rhys is written as a prequel to Jane Eyre and tells the story of Bertha Mason, Mr Rochester's \\"mad\\" wife. The story is set in the West Indies and is divided into 3 parts. The first is about her childhood, written from her perspective, the second details her marriage to an English man (who is never named, but who is assumed to be Mr Rochester) during which she begins her descent into madness, told from the perspective of Mr Rochester and the third is during her time locked up in the heights of Thornfield Hall from Jane Eyre with her carer Grace Poole from whose perspective this section is told. It was a great read, short, but very well written. Jean Rhys certainly had a talent for beautiful and sensory descriptive language and this was definitely what I loved most about this novel."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Rhys wrote this as a response to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics) (note: while there are cheaper paperback editions of Jane Eyre, I highly recommend you purchase the Penguin Classics edition because of the brilliant, unmatched introduction by the novelist and academic, Stevie Davies, as it provides much insight, wisdom and appreciation about that novel), in order to re-position the character of Mrs Rochester, the \\"mad woman in the attic\\", into a primary position, rather than being voiceless and without any expressed identity of her own, as in Charlotte Bronte's story. Rhys does this by setting her story prior to the events in Jane Eyre; effectively the novella is a prequel to the latter. Most importantly, she prioritises the white Creole, Antoinette - her original name: in Jane Eyre we know her only as the mysterious madwoman in the attic, until later, she is explained as being Bertha, the first Mrs Rochester. As a result, her character in 'Sargasso', being placed front and centre, creates an entirely different set of interpretations and emphases, not least that Antoinette achieves her own identity and humanity here, rather than being relegated into a prison space of madness and silence, one in which Mr Rochester himself was responsible for.This is a powerful, deeply haunting and hallucinatory, deeply poeticised novella (the style, in this regard, is reminiscent of Toni Morrison's Beloved (Vintage Classics); it is an original and heartbreaking of love unrequited, leading to madness. The story is split into three parts, the first set in Jamaica, from the viewpoint of Antoinette as a child and in her youth, living on her plantation; the second section in Dominica, regarding the marriage and written both from Mr Rochester's imperialist viewpoint and sense (he only marries her as an arrangement established by his father to gain Antoinette's sizeable dowry and land), and Antoinette's increasingly troubled self (she knows that Rochester has had a sexual relationship with one of the female servants, while being with her); all the while you experience Rochester's own confusion and increasing disgust with the local people and the way of living, the heat and the tropical intensity of the place, so alien to him from his English, cold viewpoint. And, the third and most dramatic part, in which we once again return to \\"Antoinette\\", now Bertha, not only abandoned, but left imprisoned - the original \\"madwoman in the attic\\" - in Rochester's house in England; a world she neither understands nor values, and in which there is no love for her, no interest; she is effectively made persona non grata for all the years she is locked up there.Throughout the story, you experience the intensity of all those involved, the stifling physical environment, you feel the insecurity and uncertainty of the prescribed gender roles between Antoinette and Mr Rochester, and the locals, including servants. There is no ultimate exit or freedom for the female; for the male, there is simply the repetition of the male-dominated power structure, such that it deprives the male of any real identity, beyond that of his family's expectations and a prescribed role for his own masculinity and authority. 'Sargasso' is a powerful read, troubling and passionate, and a unique and profound creative take on issues of identity (especially including Colonial, slave, and the power dynamic between England and the Caribbean), sexuality and madness. It is a fascinating, moving and clever re-interpretation of the story told in Jane Eyre, and is highly recommended.PS - NOTE FOR STUDENTS (who may be obliged to study this novella): This is a genuinely worthwhile and helpful edition for students. Hilary Jenkins, who has written the editorial material, has done a good job. She provides not only a clear introduction, highlighting the distinctive qualities and structure of the story, but also a brief chronology of the author's life, very helpful notes on Creole language and phrasing, as well as historical points, exam- and essay-related questions you'd expect to have to answer as a student, as well as a separate section on the story's geographical and cultural, historical setting/context. Importantly, Jenkins concludes with Critical Responses to the novella, as well as suggested further critical/academic reading."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This short and exquisite novel is a study of manners, race and culture. It is not only about the restrictions of marriage and English culture but the wounds and mistrust lingering in the minds of the colonized and the slaveholding classes. Miss Rhys grew up in the West Indies, mother was Creole, her father Welsh, and it is doubtless that she saw and felt these contradictions.She describes with such poignancy and economy the beauty and newness of the forested island, the always-inhabited shadows of night, the lush and almost hard green of the tropics and the shock that florid life presents to English eyes. The newly-emancipated and dirt-poor blacks who serve the whites and the fearful English 'youngest son' who marries the innocent girl (for a price) confront one another. They are prisoners on this island, having no money, no status, no safety, suspect the others' motives and seem not quite human to each other. The feeling that one can lose one's footing at any moment is skillfully hinted at throughout the story and a fall into madness is possible for every character."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I loved the biogrpahy of Jean Rhys which gave me motivation to re-read all her books. None held a candle in my opinion to her last novel, this masterpiece. It pulls you into the sensual Caribbean, it gives so much in the way of the relationship that began in Charlotte Bronte's \\"JANE EYRE\\"... You don't have to know the Bronte story to totally enjoy the atmopherics here. There is love and hate, black and white, lush descriptions and even when you aren't sure who is talking, this novel is a complete gem, rare and quite a miracle given Jean Rhys' life, how she wrote this toward the end of it, how she wrote like an angel. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys' \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" derives from \\"Jane Eyre\\", but is an entirely different work and stands independently as a masterful piece of literature. While the plot-line is somewhat prosaic, the writing is superb; spare, beautiful, poetic and exotic...Rhys' prose is hauntingly evocative of the island setting. It equals the more famous descriptions of Joseph Conrad (\\"Outcast of the Islands\\", for example) and Richard Hughes (\\"High Wind in Jamaica\\"). It compares favorably with the writings of Victor Serge (read the chapter in, \\"Unforgiving Years\\" on the Mexican sojourn of the agent \\"D\\") and with the clash between the idealized vision of rural life held by the planter, Morin Dutilleul and Bossuet Metelus, the Obeah magician in Philippe Thoby-Marcelin/Pierre Marcelin's \\"The Beast of the Haitian Hills\\". Rhys easily ecplipses current-day South American writers of the \\"magical realism\\" genre (Gabriel Garcia Marquez, for instance), who can only grasp at what Rhys has achieved in this novel.With the exotic flora, weird sense of isolation, mysterious interpersonal interactions and vaguely portentious overtones attendant upon the well-established and foretold denouement, Rhys' book is simultaneously whistful and depressing. Having visited Jamaica and living in a rural home for about 6 weeks in 1969 (this being shortly after independence from the UK), I can attest to the continuity of perspective existing between the residue British-Jamaican whites and the \\"native\\" Jamaicans: these seemed to be grafted intact from the 1830-era of \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\".Unfortunately, the brilliance of the writing has not been a guarantor of commercial success and, as a result, this fine work has languished in relative obscurity.Despite what another nearly forgotten author (L.P. Hartley in, \\"The Go-Between\\", 1953) wrote, \\"The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there\\", Rhys demonstrates in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" that, at least some continuity between past and present exists, in that nothing much changes with respect to individual's capacity to hurt others; Il en sera tourjours ainsi, I suppose."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"The voice of Christophine, the former slave in the household in Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea, is able to talk in the voice of both colonial and post-colonial vernacular, \\"she could speak good English if she wanted to, and French as well as patois.\\" (p 21, Norton 1982) What is far more compelling is that a former slave of indeterminate age becomes a life-giving force. In the beginning of the novel Antoinette's mother says, \\"we would have died if she'd turned against us.\\" To answer the question of why two generations of Cosways would have perished without Christophine's help is to understand how Christophine and other islanders operate in the present, unhurt, unhurried, and unbowed by the colonialism that wracks most of the islanders in Rhys' novel.Daniel Cosway, Rochester's erstwhile blackmailer knows that \\"the English and the French fight like cats and dogs since long time.\\" (p 96) The use of the grammatically incorrect word since with a phrase that stands for extended time passages transmits the past into the present, showing that wars come and go but the island inhabitants remain to carve out their identities. Daniel uses the phrase to considerable effect when confronting Antoinette's husband to imply he has been cuckolded all along, \\"[Y]our wife know Sandi since long time. Ask her and she tell you. But not everything . . .\\" (p. 140)From the first pages to the last, Rhys allows several characters to employ a somewhat innocuous phrase nearly twenty times throughout the novel. \\"Long time\\" establishes Christophine's prominence, entreats readers that much of the past is contained in the present as well as the reverse, and literally if not figuratively defines love, \\"[Y]ou only know a long time afterwards what it is, the life and death kiss.\\" (p. 186)Christophine chooses to speak in her patois, to practice her obeah, and, in her own unhurried way, to live a life with the Cosways, knowing that one of the cornerstones of story-telling, \\"A long time ago,\\" means a long time now and forever but especially in the present."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book is a real gem, which can be analized on many levels. This is not simply a passionate love story. It is a wonderful description of the Caribbean plantation society of the late 1800's, and an excellent account of the relationship that existed at that time between the new class of Caribbean Creoles and the members of the metropolitan European society. The author brilliantly uses the unequal relationship between a man and a woman to symbolize the historic colonial relationship. In addition, the novel is an important contribution to Caribbean literature in the sense that it was able to take the European classic Jean Eyre and bring it into the Caribbean context. A wonderful book for anyone studying Latin America or the Caribbean"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Takes the character of Mr. Rochester and turns him into a monster. Cheap rip-off of a great classic. Worthless."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea is a reworking and reanalysing of Jane Eyre's contrast Bertha. The style is careful with every line potentially meaningful. Antoinette, Bertha's real name, is a worthy character to mould and examine. Rochester is worth having a dig at. After all, he is an aristocratic, morally obstinate, brick in Jane Eyre so he's no different in Wide Sargasso Sea. The dig is aimed at the British Empire and the problems that slavery brought.As some other reviews state Wide Sargasso Sea is a modern classic, with modernists twists and turns and psychological analysis. It's not depressive but realistic and a valuable expression of the author's intentions."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I did not read this book out of choice...it was cruelly forced upon me by the board of education.

Having to read this for my English class I found it to be a chore. Rhys expanded on a character who was ment to be a mystery. Although it did have it's moments (the uprising of the slaves) it lacked in the delopement of Rochester of Antionette (Bertha). I cannot say it was not teh worst piece of litureture I have read for nothing compare with Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, but I did feel left a little empty as to why some of things happened the way they did. I would recoomend this novel to anyone who as enough time to comprehend the true nature of it."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I am a student in an advanced english class and read both Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso.

It is compleatly incoherent with just a touch of insanity. I'm sure if Charlotte Bronte had read this she would have wished she had never written Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Excuse my insufficient english.I really loved the book \\"Jane Eyre\\" because of the complex and flawed characters.After I read it and watched different movie versions I thought that Rochester was kind of selfish,that his self-righteous sins against his wife were forgiven. Therefore he was blinded after he tried to save her out of the flames.This reminded me about the Christian way of thinking in regard to sin, suffering , revelation and gratification.He took his wife to England, a country totally different from Jamaica. Was she really mad when they met? I mean, if she was mad, why didn't he notice that sooner? The claim, that he was decieved by Mason and her beauty struck me as odd and a far to simple explanation. Was that intended by Charlotte Bronte?Who knows?Rochester is also rather sadistic to Jane and deep down I always had my doubts about his views on equality.He teases her and seems to misuse his position as a Master. They get to know each other and form a deep bond. Rochester, in control the entire time of how the relationship could develop and with his wordly wisedom and years of experience, should have forseen the problems that would occure later on.By using Blanche Ingram to make Jane jealous, is very disturbing and unequable in regard to both.He is an intelligent strategist, ruled by his passion for Jane.Rochester proposed to Jane with the knowledge about her views, his legal marriage to Bertha (rotting in the attic) and the shame Jane would be exposed to, just to satisfy his own selfish, self-righteous and passionate reasons.However,in the end he comes out as a better and wiser man, who regards Jane as his equal in every aspect.I'm intrigued and fascinated by his character, because he is so real, not like all the other picture perfect prince charming's but a real human being.The mystery about Bertha's madness always interested me and I was exited to learn that such a novel exists.Unfortunatly, I have to say that I'm disappointed with the \\"wide Sargasso sea\\".Well, nature and culture are described in an interesting way but Edward's character lacks development and depth in my opinion.The author's psychological reconstruction of Antoinette's diastrous childhood ,for example the loss of her brother and home was ingenious. I enjoyed the demonstration of her mother's strong but labil nature, a trait Antoinette seems to inherit.Jean Rhys set's the foundation for a young, labil and disturbed girl in a manner that is psychological comprehensible and satisfying.It captivates me to see a young woman who could have been happy in her life but is doomed due to circumstances, controlled by men.However, I get the feeling the author looked for excuses and an explanations to justify Antoinette's descent into madness.I know that Rochester is no perfect hero in the manner of a Mr. Darcy but he is vilified in this creation beyond recognition.He is alienated by Antoinette's behaviour in general. They have a different culture and attitude towards life, that is all comprehensible to me.What I can't comprehend is the unjustified way he treats her . He is suprised by the way she touches the former slaves but in turn has an affair with a black girl.Hmm, touching with the hand is inappropriate but using his reproductive organs is totally Okay?? This is really contradictive and in my eyes the author's mistake, made by carelessness.Another aspect in this scene is, why does he sleep with the slave girl, within earshot of his wife, at their honeymoon?He bonds with the slave-girl for no apparent reason and even seeks her advice. WTF?The scene where he renames her Bertha, after her mad mother, is even more out of character and shows him as a cruel beast with incomprehensible reactions and the way he talks doesn't remind me of Rochester at all.In the second part, the story is told out of Rochester's perspective but switches with Antoinette's, time and time again and can be rather confusing. Rhys should have told the story just out of Antoinette's perspective because she seems unable to put herself into the psyche of an british gentleman, living in Victorian England. Rochester is potrayed as stereotype, like Antoinette in \\"Jane Eyre\\". Although in \\"Jane Eyre\\", Bertha's character is rather a symbol for Jane's repressed sexuality.Jean Rhys had a wonderful idea, she could speak about her own experience in form of Antoinetta Mason and clarify Charlotte Bronte's understandable ignorance in reference to other customs and traditions.However, Charlotte Bronte's unintentional racism (personal interpretable. I personally don't see it that way) is answered with racism and ignorance in return.The wide Sargasso sea leaves you with a bad aftertaste.The combination of the two books, in regard to psychology, would be wonderful, without condeming the other side.Still, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a masterpiece on it's own and Bertha could have had it worse in an Asylum.Result: -Attic was the better solution-Clarifying of other cultures and seem-able missunderstood character, ended up being a revenge novel"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book is a must read for fans of Bronte's JANE EYRE. Jean Rhys depicts the life of Berthe, the madwoman in Bronte's novel. The author shows it from the perspective of both Berthe (a.k.a. Antoinette) and Rochester. By the end of the novel it is understandable why Berthe became the madwoman in the attic. Rhys takes the reader through the tortured life of Berthe as a young girl into womanhood and her eventual marriage to Rochester. Clearly, there was not much hope for Berthe within her environment. Furthermore, Rochester gives up on his new wife too easily, forcing her to retreat further and further into herself. He falls quite short of being the loving husband. This book causes the reader to see both Berthe and Rochester in entirely different lights. When reading JANE EYRE, Berthe seems the nasty culprit. However, after reading WIDE SARGASSO SEA, the opinion you originally had may change drastically. All in all a wonderful read. It answers all the questions you may have asked yourself when reading JANE EYRE."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I found this book to be more trouble than it was worth.

Therefore, I was quite excited to read this one because it has been touted as a wonderful novel in its own right AND an interesting prequel to \\"Jane Eyre.\\" I was pretty sure that I could not go wrong with this choice.Oh well. While some books have something for everyone, this book has something to disappoint almost everyone. The writing was O.K., but it is nothing special. The characters are thinly developed. The plot is scanty and of little consequence.

What I liked best, however, was Rhys' competent depiction of a time and place that I am wholey unfamiliar with. The setting of \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" was certainly new, fresh, and exotic to me.

An enjoyable work and truly Rhy's greatest contribution to readers of Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Crazy and Worse Besides: The Madness of Antoinette Cosway Mason\\"Humanity does not start out from freedom, but from limitations and the line not to be crossed.\\"~ Michel FoucaultI. The MasculineThe historical criticism of Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea has focused largely on either postcolonial or feminist readings of the text. The dialogue has been so focused on claiming the text, the author, or the protagonist that it has become known as \\"the Helen of our wars\\" by the Barbadian critic Kamau Braithwaite (qtd in Su 388). There is, I feel a critical approach missing from the debate. Carine Mardorossian states, \\"[Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea] constantly thwarts an easy identification with the white Creole protagonist\\" (1071). As a male reader, I can understand this lack of identification with Antoinette. From this standpoint, I propose a masculinist reading of Wide Sargasso Sea. The critical debate over the text has washed over the main male character and has made him represent many different things to many different people. Usually his appearance is structured as representing the dominate ruling class ideology, oppressing the minority group that the particular reading is trying to claim the text for, either as masculine power or the empirical dominance. However, I argue otherwise. The character is not powerful as representative of anything within the text. Caroline Rody notes, \\"Rhys rewrites him as an anonymous, lost voice in a place where the very existence of his fatherland is questioned\\" (219). Antoinette's husband has no home that he is able to move comfortably within the text. A sympathetic reading towards the main male character is possible in a masculinist reading of Wide Sargasso Sea: this will be done by examining the Rhys's work in context with Jane Eyre, and then the focus of the paper will be an examination of Antoinette's madness and the possible actions available to her husband.A sense of trepidation creeps over the soul of the critic who might want to wave a flag and claim a masculine reading of any text, as any reading issuing forth might easily be construed as latently masculine. An acknowledgement of power structures is in no way inherently misogynistic. Noted feminist critic Nina Baym repudiated the entire formulation of feminist theory, noting that it \\"addresses an audience of prestigious male academics and attempts to win its respect\\" (45). At the time of her writing, even having to identify as feminist created acknowledgement of the power structure. Feminist theorist claimed status as outsiders, but still recreate the structure found within the dominant taxonomy: \\"This repetition of authoritarian structures betrays an infatuation with male forms and deconstructs the feminist project\\" (Baym 45). As Baym was writing in the in the 1980's, it is evident from this defense that much has changed in the criticism since that time, as an openly masculine take needs its own justification.II. The Wide Sargasso Sea Stands Alone.Many commentators on Wide Sargasso Sea have debated on the role that the novel plays when considered in context with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. The main question being: Are Bertha and Edward Rochester were indeed the same characters as Antoinette and her husband from the text of Wide Sargasso Sea? To determine this, one of the easiest ways to disconnect the two sets would be to demonstrate a temporal discontinuity between the texts, a task easy to do. In Wide Sargasso Sea, there is only place where the time is tied down concretely, \\"I will write my name in fire red, Antoinette Mason, n&eacute;e Cosway, Mount Cavalry Convent, Spanish Town, Jamaica, 1839\\" (31). It is at this point the reader knows the date and can place the text within its historical context.This historical context, however, is not quite the one present in Bronte's work, \\"When she set out to rewrite Jane Eyre, Rhys deliberately shifted dates to write about post-emancipation times; indeed, Jane Eyre's acquisition of the recently published Marmion locates the events occurring in Bronte's novel around 1808 and not after 1833\\" (Mardorossian 1086). From this information, it is easy to separate the two texts. If the events of Jane Eyre were happening in 1808, it would be impossible for Antoinette Cosway Mason to be even alive when Thornfield estate was burning and Bertha Mason Jumped from the roof, since \\"[Antoinette] would have been born in 1822 or 1823, well before the emancipation act, which did not go into effect for another year after its enactment in 1833\\" (Erwin 209).The fact that this is even a question within the scholarship on Wide Sargasso Sea implies that there is a familiarity with Bronte's text even before approaching Rhys's work. Michael Thorpe argues in part, that if there was a connection, \\"[Rhys] did not assume that her readers' remembrance would be anything but dim, and perhaps composed of stereotypes\\" (173). This knowledge allows the reader to approach the text with little, if any, bias, as Thorpe reads the connections as tenuous. This can be important for any reading of the text. Within a masculinist reading though, this lack of bias is extremely important as Rhys crafted the character of the husband to be a black slate, an enigma that can receive many of the masculinist reader's projections. The disconnection also frees him from the sins and transgressions of Edward Rochester and allows him to be answerable only to his own actions. For this matter to be settled, it can be illuminating to go back to authorial intent. Over the course of the decades Rhys worked on this slim novel, she had many different names intended for the text, including The First Mrs. Rochester. In her mind there was a connection, but in a letter to her editor, Francis Wyndham, as the novel as nearing completion in 1964, \\"I think there were several Antoinettes and Mr. Rochesters. Indeed, I am sure. Mine is not Miss Bronte's, though much suggested by \`Jane Eyre'\\" (Letters 140 emphasis mine). From the words of Miss Rhys, it is finally possible to separate the two texts, and declaim along with Sandra Drake, \\"the novel stands on its own\\" (149).III. Its MadnessThe character of Antoinette's husband has no champion easily seen in the history of the criticism, even though he can be read sympathetically in the text of Wide Sargasso Sea. The readerly projection available for the masculine reader of the text allows the reader to become the character. He has no name, no history. Whatever the masculine reader wants him to be, he can become. Although there are points in the text where a readerly identification with the character can cause discomfort, by and large he is a sympathetic character, a victim both of the system of primogeniture that sends him out to the West Indies to seek his fortune and of a wife suffering from mental illness.Yes, mental illness. Although modern systems of psychiatric categorization were not available in the time period in which Antoinette lives, the systems were around when Rhys was writing Wide Sargasso Sea. It can be too facile to construct Antoinette as \\"crazy,\\" but there seems, in the historical imagination, a binary between sane/not sane. Humanity has a tradition of fascination with mental illness, in part because it is possible to define what you are by what you are not. Michel Foucault notes that \\"[Western Culture] maintained a profound, passionate relationship with mental illness, perhaps difficult to formulate for ourselves, but impenetrable to anyone else, in which we confronted dangers most vivid to us as well as what was perhaps the truth closest to us\\" (292). On the edge of the binary every person walks, and with every passing decade, the named pathways for slippage increase. Crazy, insane, and mad have blossomed out and diversified into many well-defined categories and sub-categories of mental impairment. With this knowledge, it becomes possible to recast the historical imagination and address the accusation of John J. Su in his discussion of the text, namely:The absence of any medical basis for his accusation, not to mention his curious unwillingness to seek out a \`cure' for her, reminds readers that applying the category of insanity to women has historically been a means of enforcing cultural and religious values on them as much as a diagnosis of physiological or psychic pathology (391).While it can be argued that the classical first step in subjugating a class, gender, or race is to remove their humanity, this is not entirely at issue here. Instead, in this context, there is a definable medical basis, and through a historical lens, the curiously unwilling search for a cure is not so \\"curious.\\"IV. More Precisely, Its SchizophreniaElizabeth Abel, in her article, \\"Women and Schizophrenia: The Fiction of Jean Rhys,\\" identifies a thread running through the entire fiction corpus of Rhys in which all of her significant heroines are afflicted with madness that can be constructed by modern standards and defined as schizophrenia. She speaks generally about her texts, but Abel is still able to determine that madness is the central issue in Wide Sargasso Sea (172), and that more specifically her heroines:Manifest several specific symptoms of schizophrenia: impoverished affect, apathy, obsessive thought and behavior coupled with the inability to take real initiative, a sense of the unreality of both the world and self, and a feeling of detachment from the body (156).Abel begins her examination by looking at the degeneration of Rhys's characters: \\"Although Rhys describes her heroines' progressive degeneration, often in excruciating detail, she fails to provide an adequate explanation for this process\\" (156). It is through this thought process that Abel conveys realization that her heroines are schizophrenic; they \\"experience the world as a hostile environment and lead lives of isolation, detached from family and friends, unable to establish real contact with others\\" (156). This isolation is important for the development of Wide Sargasso Sea... Antoinette is seen early in part one, after the incident where Tia steals her three pennies and her dress, exclaiming, \\"Visitors! I dragged up the steps unwillingly -- I had longed for visitors once, but that was years ago\\" (Rhys 14). The reader is able to see that she is directed inward, at an early point in her life, before she encounters her future husband or even her stepfather. Her young psyche is still under construction and this divide between her self and other has been so internalized that she can recognize a point when she wanted human contact, but in a distant past. This sentiment is echoed by Carine Mardorossian, noting, \\"The first section of the novel abounds in scenes that show Antoinette's inability to comprehend the relationships between the few individuals that people her world\\" (1072). Not only is Antoinette isolated, she would not know how to identify relational structures if she wanted to.The discussion of the disease in Abel's article continues on issues of causation, where \\"schizophrenia is a legitimate and not uncommon response to certain interpersonal interactions\\" (157). These are often traumatic events to the subject, Abel explains, \\"Because the real self attempts to remain unembodied in order to escape the threats to its identity, it tends to grow increasingly detached from concrete things\\" (158). Antoinette's sense of identity is at issue in part one of Wide Sargasso Sea. The best illustration of this identity crisis is her relationship with Tia. Even after being called \\"white cockroach\\" by Tia, young Antoinette continues to identify with the native child. But the act of violence in the scene at Coulibri between the two physically separates the two: \\"I saw the jagged stone in her hand but I did not see her throw it. ...We stared at each other, blood on my face, tears on hers. It was as if I saw myself. Like in a looking-glass\\" (Rhys 27). Even with this act of violence, Antoinette identifies with Tia more than any other character in the book. An important note is this is the last place the reader sees Tia as a concrete defined character and not as part of Antoinette's constructed world within the text. This identification puts Antoinette into this vague middle ground where \\"she is not b&eacute;k&eacute; like you but she is b&eacute;k&eacute; and not like us either\\" (93) in the words of Christophine. Antoinette is left in the lurch, and had no real reference point from which to begin constructing a \`real' self.This scene is the defining point in the text, as Antoinette wakes up from her fever brought on by the incident with Tia, and her biggest concern is the mark on her head: \\"\`My head is bandaged up. It's so hot,' I said. \`Will I have a mark on my forehead?' \`No, no.' [Aunt Cora] smiled for the first time. \`That is healing very nicely. It won't spoil you on your wedding day'\\" (Rhys 28). Besides foreshadowing Antoinette's upcoming wedding, the concern for the mark on her head allows for an amazing moment of clarity from Antoinette later in part two, \\"But I think it did spoil me for my wedding day and all the other days and nights\\" (Rhys 80). Rhys shows that Antoinette is still capable of self-knowledge, humanizing her somewhat, but that knowledge is that she has been allowed to spoil. Important again is all of these events happened prior to the arrival of the unnamed husband into the text.This humanizing self-knowledge sets Antoinette up in opposition of the construct that society structures around her. \\"Antoinette, like Rhys's other heroines, is necessarily split between the image thrust on her and her own knowledge of herself.\\" (Abel 172). Antoinette is identified as unbalanced in the later section of part one by a menacing child in the street: \\"\`Look the crazy girl, you crazy like your mother . Your aunt frightened to have you in the house. She send you for the nuns to lock up'\\" (Rhys 29). This construct is self-fulfilling. The more Antoinette is isolated, the more she internalizes the mental divide, and the more reason there is keep her separate from larger society. Antoinette searches for identity throughout the text: \\"I have been too unhappy, I thought, it cannot last, being so unhappy, and different things will happen to me.... In that bed I will dream the end of my dream\\" (Rhys 66-7). Sadly, she knows that her own trauma is an exponential function, and that the dream must end.Like most exponential functions, the logical conclusion is infinity, or the highest point possible. It is at this high point, England at the top the world that Antoinette is sequestered at the close of Rhys's novel. At this point of her self- deterioration, can the reader find the most outward manifestations of her disease: \\"Antoinette's schizophrenic symptoms are quite identifiable: she ultimately loses all sense of time and comes to gauge reality by private criteria.\\" (Abel 173). In conversation with Grace Poole, Antoinette says, \\"Only I know how long I have been here. Nights and days and days and nights, hundreds of them slipping through my fingers. But that does not matter time has no meaning\\" (Rhys 109). She has totally turned inward. The outside world has very little meaning anymore, and the chronology the rest of society has fallen apart for Antoinette. So has her vague sense of place: \\"That afternoon we went to England. There was grass and olive-green water and tall trees looking into the water. This, I though, is England. If I could be here I'd get well again and the sound in my head would stop\\" (Rhys 109). The world is cracking around her; there is no identification. Judith Raiskin identifies that \\"Antoinette continues to split the idea of England in two, maintaining an idea of an idyllic England separate from the reality of the England that has denied her freedom and civil rights\\" (256). Antoinette has entered the looking glass.And from the looking glass, she turns around and sees herself, not as she has constructed in her mind, but as others see her. \\"It was then that I saw her - the ghost. The woman with streaming hair. She was surrounded by a gilt frame but I knew her\\" (Rhys 111-2). In the mirror Antoinette can see the ghost of the woman she once was, but not the idea of the self she has constructed in her own mind. Remember, this is in her dream; this is in a world she once called \\"Hell\\" (RHYS 36) in a more cogent time. In this, the end of her dream, she sees Tia, and the old way of life, and wants to escape, to return to an idyllic place that never existed except in her own mind. In this sense, \\"Antoinette's \`real' death is not a demented suicide in the flames of Thornfield hall. That projected death is really only the one \`everyone knows about'\\" (Drake 200). Antoinette has long been dead to the world. What began with Tia, was compounded with her husband, and has reached what can be constructed in the schizophrenic mind as the logical end, where \\"I know why I was brought here and what I have to do\\" (Rhys 112).The novel closes with Antoinette walking away, certain of herself for the first time in the text of Wide Sargasso Sea. The decontextualization of the novel with Bronte's text creates an ambiguous place, where the reader cannot be certain why she was brought there or what she has to do. Antoinette has always calmly accepted her dreams, even if frightening. The dreams have served as prophecy to her, beyond her control. However, after awakening from such dreams, she has a new sense of agency, knowledge of self stronger than previously seen in the text. She may fulfill the prophetic dreams and alight to the spire, but she could also walk out the front door, to the England she always wanted to see.V. What is to be Done?Rhys allows the reader close contact with Antoinette's husband. Michael Thorpe says. \\"Part Two, which takes us at once into his consciousness, makes possible a sympathetic insight into him also\\" (178). This part, in fact includes most of the book, so much so that the reader is able to see many sides of the character, even if he remains this nameless cipher. Two points in the text illustrate the character's moral fiber in which he will do nice things for those less fortunate than him.The first illustration in the text is a conversation between the character and Richard Mason prior to the wedding of Antoinette and her husband. \\"\`She won't marry you.' ... I said, \`If she won't, she won't. She can't be dragged to the altar. Let me get dressed. I must hear what she has to say'\\" (Rhys 46). At this point, right as the reader is getting to know the character, he allows himself the possibility of doing something selfless in the name of her happiness and desires. This selfless act might free Antoinette from herself, but that speculation goes beyond this examination.This same man is gentle and caring with even the smallest, most helpless creatures. When a moth falls into a candle flame: \\"I took the beautiful creature up in my handkerchief and put it on the railing. For a moment it was still and by the dim candlelight I could see the soft brilliant colors, the intricate pattern on the wings. I shook the handkerchief gently and it flew away\\" (Rhys 48). He is able to admire beauty and treat with kindness even the smallest animals. One could consider the actions to foreshadow the plot, where Antoinette is a small moth, wanting to be set free.When these aspects of the character are taken into account, his plans to \\"go back to Jamaica to consult the Spanish Town doctors and her brother,\\" (Rhys 96) should be given the full benefit of the doubt. He states later that he will follow that advice (ibid). Wide Sargasso Sea's chronology is hard to locate, as discussed earlier, the time jump between the last two parts could reasonably have months or years. One can assume there was the consultation of the doctors on the best care that could be given to Antoinette at the time, and part three represents the given advice. To examine this idea, it would be illuminating to look at a possible alternative to the comparatively humane treatment she receives at the hands of husband: incarceration in London's famed Bethlem hospital perhaps as representative of care Antoinette would receive elsewhere.Since the period of the novel cannot be firmly placed generalizations will have to suffice on this point, but should be illuminating as there is a sense of glacial change in the way the mad were treated until the rise of modern psychotherapy and the rise of pharmacology. Schizophrenia had not been formally identified as a disorder, so a broadening of the boundaries will open the gates to the point where Antoinette is \\"mad\\" once more.In this history of Bethlem hospital, Roy Porter notes, \\"Between 1728 and 1852, Bethlem's physician's all came from the Monro family ... Continuity was the keynote. They brought in a few therapeutic innovations - cold and hot baths for instance - but Bethlem's mainstays were the familiar purgatives and emetics, with a routine spring bloodletting, and manacles for the troublesome\\" (42). This shows that hospitals, even London's Royal Hospital, were using medieval devices for treatment. Not medieval in a hyperbolic sense, but in a literal sense. To think that madness could be treated with such methods strikes the contemporary reader as disturbing at the least.Porter describes that there have been constant scandals at the treatment of the inmates and the conduct of the supervisors at Bethlem for almost as long as it has been in existence. After one of these minor outrages, a parliamentary committee toured the facility in 1815, and took notes on the sights seen within:\`We first proceeded to visit the women's galleries,' testified Wakefield, \`One side of the rooms contained about ten patients, each chained by one arm or leg to the wall. The chain allowing them merely to stand up by the bench or form fixed to the wall, or to sit down on it. The nakedness of each patient was covered by a blanket-gown only.' (Edward Wakefield qtd in Porter 43).Compared to the contemporary measures taken for those identified as mad, Antoinette's confinement is seen in rather comfortable terms. She is free to move about her room, and possess clothing. There are no chains or manacles, only locks. Her keeper is sympathetic to her plight, knowing the \\"world outside can be a black and cruel world to a woman\\" (Rhys 106).Antoinette's keeper, Grace Poole, brings the discussion back to the husband's magnanimous nature. His concern to keep his wife in the best possible situation makes him pay Poole \\"double, treble the money\\" (Rhys 105) if she is good enough and maintains consistency in her care. His situation is not one to be envied, and he knows it. Ultimately, he is a victim, lamenting, \\"And do you think I wanted all this? I would give my life to undo it. I would give my eyes never to have seen this abominable place\\" (Rhys 96).VI. But...This point is by no means the end of inquiry into a masculinist reading of Wide Sargasso Sea. There are many points an observant critic could identify within the text to counter that Antoinette's husband is not the most sympathetic character. He is by no means an exemplar of the human race, he is just one man adrift in a swirl of the culture, which subsumes his life and colors his perceptions of the world. A masculinist reading only allows for the viewing of more viewpoints.Works CitedAbel, Elizabeth. \\"Women and Schizophrenia: The Fiction of Jean Rhys.\\" Contemporary Literature. 20.2 (1979): 155-177.

Jean Rhys transforms the words to experience. It's almost as if the reader is able to smell the island flowers, feel the breeze, hear the sounds. Not only is the writing superb, but the message is profound, drawing paralells between the subjection of women and colonialization which leave the reader thinking long after the reading is complete."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I had no interest in reading a story about Rochester's first wife but this book kept popping up everywhere, recommending itself. When I saw it on Modern Library's Top 100 list (I've since lost some trust in the list due to this and other books on it) I decided to try it.In a word, Madness. Not just in Antoinette and her mother, but in Rochester too, in the island, in the narration. I kept thinking that Rhys had a 'fever' herself, as Rochester did, when she wrote it, especially when there were parts that seemed nonsensical that I couldn't understand at all. There are also gaps in the story which make the story disjointed and even stranger. Only Christophine, Antoinette's nurse seems sane but hints are left that something is amiss with her as well. She's also into Obeah (what Jamaicans call spiritism).I didn't like the portrayal of Rochester as crazy and cruel, which I didn't think was true to his character in Jane Eyre. Not that he was a saint but the crazy, weird things he did really irritated me, such as when he started calling Antoinette 'Bertha' telling her that she looked like a Bertha, as though trying to drive her mad. I think that was unfair to make him that nasty, though maybe Rhys is trying to blame Jamaica for bringing this out in him. And maybe that he never got rid of his fever and also didn't see things clearly when he somehow ended up married to Antoinette.The part of the book where Antoinette comes to England is short and makes an unsatisfying segue to Jane Eyre.What I most disliked was the way Jamaica and Jamaicans are portrayed since my husband is Jamaican and I love the country and the people, though I don't know what it was like after their slave emanicipation and now I'm curious to find out--one good result of reading this book. It was implied that there is something 'in the air', an ancient darkness, a miasma in everything Jamaican that especially affects whites who are like aliens there, negatively, including those that are born there and feel it's home as Antoinette does. I don't know if Rhys, herself a 'white creole' from Dominica felt this way about Dominica. Maybe as a child Rhys saw some things that her childish mind twisted into strange scary things. There is lack of clarity in the writing and along with this strange negativity which dominates the book completely, rather than giving the book a haunting quality which maybe the author was trying for, it just makes the whole think dark and crazy, at least for me."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This was perhaps the most boring book I have ever read.

I know exactly what will happen to this character in the end (not that I expect a happy ending, especially from Jean Rhys). That being said - I think it was a pretty good idea for a book. She took this character out of Jane Eyre who basically has not purpose other than to have created children and to keep Jane from being able to marry (if there's more to it than that, forgive me, it has been a long time since I read Jane Eyre and I didn't really like it), and she turned her into this amazingly three dimensional character as she follows her descent into madness, helped along by her husband.The writing, as I would expect by Rhys is very descriptive and beautiful and the style of switching back and forth between the characters is quite interesting. Again, Rhys has written a very compelling novel."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"The silly idealism of Jane Eyre is brought harshly down to earth with a work that forces its reader to view the characters as human beings rather than plot devices. It defends the characters Bronte marginalized and attacks those she portrayed as heroes, making the state of the universe more balanced, confused, and real.This book does not blame Rochester for the failure which takes place; nor does it blame Antoinette; it blames the cultural divide which made the whole conflict inevitable. Its ability to portray a tragedy without guilt dumped on a villain's shoulders is admirable. It is not a comfortable book or an easy read; it turns a fairy tale into a biography, a painting into a photograph."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Meh. Just meh.

It is a romantic tale that intrigues the reader. I thought it was an exotic tale. It was an enjoyable read, but I can't say that I would read it again. There are more enjoyable pleasure novels out there. If you really love Jane Erye and are looking for a free reading book than I would suggest this. If you didn't really enjoy Jane Erye and aren't into exotic books than this isn't the book for you."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre as a child, I wondered about this woman. There seemed to be such an injustice behind the story -- one that even the creator of the novel didn't recognize. I always hated Rochester and his treatment of his first wife. He was below contempt. It seemed to me that these two cold English people destroyed this warm creole woman. Anyway, this is the perfect story of what could have happened -- and it is well written and quite enjoyable."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book was actually worth the money no scratches, no dents, or anything of that sort"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"My son needed this book for a college class. We had a hard time finding it. We were very pleased with the book and the amount of time it took to get it. Now I am reading it for fun."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Firstly, if you haven't read Jane Eyre I would go as far as to say don't bother. The Wide Sargosso Sea is the story of the character Rochesters' mental wife Bertha who is rather the mysterious non-being in Jane Eyre.In this novel Bertha is made real. But the book is written mainly through her eyes. A woman who has a difficult life and goes through life mentally at a distance from everyone she comes into contact with, it results in the whole tone of the novel being quite distant and in a way cold. In contrast the setting and description is very rich, hot and exotic to the extreme.You must remember though, Bertha is going mad and at times looking through Bertha's eyes, you'll get the same feeling.A book you will either love or hate, not an easy read, aimed more towards a literary minded person. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"As a prequel to the classic, Jane Eyre, Wide Sargasso Sea lives up to the expectation of Bronte's novel. Carefully crafted around the most minute details Bronte used, Jean Rhys constructs a novel that is poetic and figurative in its language to describe the life of the woman in the attic. Rhys changes Bertha Mason's name to Antoinette Cosway as the first step in painting the Caribbean landscape which is carried through most of the novel, until the final part where Bronte's work threads through. Giving a voice to this mysterious character that Bronte chose not to detail sheds enormous light on Rochester's future perspective on relationships. Although short and succint, Rhys novel will surely give Jane Eyre readers a new light through which to analyze the time - honored novel.I reccomend reading Jane Eyre first, even though this is considered the prequel. Understanding Jane Eyre will allow Rhy's work to have more depth, especially at the end."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"&quot;They say when trouble comes close ranks, and so the white people did. But we were not in their ranks.&quot;The sense of alienation that Antoinette Cosway experiences as a child never lets up in this harrowing tale of the first Mrs Rochester.Whilst Jane Eyre of the original novel manages to leave her painful past behind, Antoinette is unable to fight against the oppression of her surroundings. Her husband, bewildered by her passions, cannot understand her and seeks instead to contain her during her inexorable descent into madness.In my opinion this book is as worthy of acclaim as the great novel that inspired it. &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; is in no sense a pastiche of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Rhys evokes, in her beautiful, laconic style, the haunting beauty of the Caribbean, the uneasy relations of the islanders after the abolition of slavery,the love Antoinette and her husband initially have for each other, which makes the inevitable end so much more painful.It is said that it took Jean Rhys nine years to write this slim volume, but the result is an enduring masterpiece of the English language."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is an enlightening version of the 'mad woman' locked up in Mr. Rochester's mansion in England. If Jane Eyre was a real person, one might have been tempted to warn her that, save for a few twists in circumstances, she could have been the wife driven crazy.Despite having a strong mentor in her nanny, Antoinette Cosway doesn't know how to save herself. Society isn't set up to give women of her generation much power or independence. She didn't have much of a father or mother figure, and only Christophene seems willing to truly try to protect her. A childhood filled with violence and fear has created a woman afraid of shadows who lacks self-confidence. She looks towards others to help her feel 'safe', but nearly everyone in her life betrays her in some way.In Rhy's eloquent style of writing, we are smoothly transported into the atmosphere of Jamaica after the 1830's. Though Antoinette is clearly a victim, I found Christophene's character refreshing and empowered. She's a former slave who is feared because of her knowledge of 'Obeah'. She isn't afraid to stand up to Antoinette's white husband, and comes close to helping the young woman re-gain her freedom. In my opinion, had the story ended with Mr. Rochester allowing his creole wife to remain in Jamaica under Christophene's care, Antoinette's broken heart would have mended and the signs of madness vanished. But because his troubled bride is treated as a 'possession', he takes her away from all that she loves, refuses to return any of her family fortune, and shreds her last piece of identity by calling her Bertha instead of her given name. Is this reader sorry that Thornfield Hall was burned to the ground? Not after digesting the first Mrs. Rochester's version of the story, so masterfully written by Jean Rhys.Chrissy K. McVayauthor of - Souls of the North Wind"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys has put together a wonderful story of British Colonialism in Jamaica and Dominica set during the period from 1839-1845. In fact, this native of Dominica used this focus on Antoinette Cosway to explain how Bertha in Jane Eyre had become mad and kept locked in the attic. This follows many other novels focusing on the effects of British Imperialism. It depicts a time just after the emancipation of the slaves in Jamaica. A mother (Annette), Son (Pierre), and daughter (Antoinette), living on a plantation estate that is allowed to grow wild and unkept. There were no people to work the land since slavery was abolished. The black natives hated the remaining white colonists and often referred to them as &quot;white cockroaches.&quot; The mother had remarried and one night their home is burned down by angry masses of ex-slaves. Pierre is killed in the fire. As they were escaping, Annette tries to run back for her parrot. They would have all possibly been killed by the mob if not for the parrot flying out of the window while on fire. The superstitious natives fled at the sight. Her mother grows insane and is locked up. Antoinette is raised in a convent and later married to a Mr. Rochester. He married her for her money and through some twists and turns they end up in England. He locks her upstairs to forget about her and hires Jane Eyre as nanny to his child. Later he tries to marry her and that is when Bertha's presence is disclosed. She is now quite insane and burns the house down, killing herself in the process. There is a symmetry here in that at the beginning of Wide Sargasso Sea, the Cosway's home is burned down by angry people trying to reclain their identity as humans. Later, Antoinette who later became Bertha when Rochester changed her name to a more English sounding one, burns down his home in trying to recapture her identity as a human being. Why did the mother and daughter become insane? This was not genetic but rather the result of two women being pushed or oppressed in some manner throughout their lives. Annette lived at a time of slavery and was thus remembered as an ex-slave owner. The natives despised her for this and harassed her as when they poisoned one of her horses. Also, the loss of her estate and son helped push her over. Antoinette was also despised for being the daughter of a slave owner. She grew up white with a native culture though and felt divided within her identity. When taken from her island home and deprived of her identity by being locked away all alone for years without even a mirror to see herself, this formed her into an &quot;insane&quot; person. Much symbolism is used within this story to depict division of self. Mirrors and watery reflections are used to show how one gains a self-concept. That is, we derive our sense of self from comparing ourselves with others and our perceptions of how we look to ourself. There is passion of course in the beginning of the marriage between Rochester and Antoinette. He later sleeps with Amelie (servant) and believes himself poisoned by his wife for unknown reasons. Being from England, Rochester is not comfortable in the island atmosphere and takes his wife back to England with him. She is distraught over losing her green, beautiful, lush, tropical eden."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Even thought I didn't enjoy the film too much the book itself is phenomenal. The story of Bertha, the first Mrs. Rochester, \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" is a not only a brilliant deconstruction of Charlotte Bront's legacy, but is also a damning history of colonialism in the West Indies. This novel addresses the issue of race and culture, but it also addresses the inner thought processes of a woman confronted with cultural chaos between the Creole, Jamaican, and British in the Caribbean.Told from different points of view, the text is a tapestry weaving Bertha's story with Edward Rochester's early life. Like the seaweed the book is named for, the structure floats in and out of artistic consciousness as though on a sea of many unwritten stories. Although some might argue that \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" detracts from \\"Jane Eyre,\\" I feel that Jean Rhys gives us a fuller understanding about the cultural historiography that produces \\"great literature.\\" As a champion for the silenced voices, Charlotte Bront herself was all too aware of societies' injustices.While today, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is generally accepted as a tract on social class, feminism, and conscious production of art, 150 years ago, Bront was lambasted by contemporary critics as unchristian, seditious and a poor writer. I can not help but think Bront, as social critic, would have cheered the publication of \\"Wide Sargasso Sea.\\" A wonderful book for anyone studying Latin America or the Caribbean."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"caught between two worlds, Black Jamaican and English, belonging to neither one. Antoinette Cosway was used and abused by people closest to her: Her mother, stepfather, best friend Tia, and, of course, her husband. She was forced in a loveless marriage to Rochester, who made no bones about his contempt for her, Creole culture, and Jamaica and who was only there to help his beleagured family. At first, the marriage seemed loving until an anomynous man came to him with letters disparaging Antoinette and her family and his(Rochester's) unease with living in Jamaica. Things started to go downhill after that, with Antoinette's insanity and eventual lockdown in the attic of the Rochester estate in England.This book tells where Jane Eyre left off. It's Antoinette's story about how she got to be the madwoman in the attic and the things that shaped her life prior to her coming to England with her estranged husband.The book is so deep in the matrix of race, gender, class, culture clash, personality, belief systems(Creole, Black, and English), and public and private pain of those involved."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"To those who love books, there are various categories; fiction, social history, history, e.t.c.However, every now and then, you come across this one book that just touches your soul, who you want to be. There is, sometimes, this one story that makes you remember how you felt as a child, how you felt before you were told how you should feel. Such books thrust you back to your innermost feelings, make you stand face to face with who you really are. When reading the &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; for the first time, I felt naked in terms of my emotions, with reference to others, me, everything I had experienced as an &quot;adult&quot;. It made me long to go back to who I originally was. In terms of literary value it is by far one of the most poetic novels I have ever read. Its words, sad and poignant are music to my ears, harsh tough they may be at times. Anyone looking for themselves should read it. The story-line is immaterial; the connection to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is really, at the end of the day irrelevant.

She catches the eye of an Englishman, and their passion for each other is powerful. They need each other for financial reasons as well. She must have a husband to claim her wealth, while he, as the second son, cannot claim his family fortune at all. The erotic feelings that the couple expresses for each other is only fleeting. Antoinette becomes &quot;too much&quot; for the 19th century English gentleman, who has been raised in a society that with holds passion.Eventually, quickly, he becomes disgusted with his young wife's need for exhuberant, physical attention. Anntoinette becomes desperate to experience the passion that her young husband had initially, openly and happily lavished on her. Once an errupting volcano, their relationship becomes implosive. The young man, who becomes intolerant of Anoinette, desperately avoids her. She becomes hysterical because as his wife, she has no control of anything in her life: love, ,sexual attention, money, or home. The English husband learns of an opportunity to return to England, and since Antoinette is his wife, he plans to take her with him. But she would never fit in the oppressive English landscape, so he has her declared insane, and takes her home to Thornfield, realizing he will never marry again as long as she lives. She is locked in a remote wing of his gothic mansion on the moors of England, and is lost to the world until she re-emerges as Bertha Mason in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. Beautifully written, Wide Sargasso Sea, was Jean Rhys's answer to a question many Jane Eyre readers have had. Who was the mad woman? Some of the questions I had also were answered. Who else would Mr. Rochester want but a young, pure thing who would adore him and revere him. Jane asked only for his spoken word never any passion. Jane was accustomed to dishonest and confusing relationships while she lived at the orphanage and her aunt's home as a child. When she arrived at Thornfield, Mr. Rochester was exactly what she would fall for: a man who possibly could rescue her, but who also would be dishonest and confusing. Jane Eyre is great literature as is Wide Sargasso Sea, but neither story has characters who are capable of good relationships. The film version is equally well done."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Antoinette is Rochester's dark side that naive Jane Eyre never thought to explore. The girl just wanted a good husband; she never wanted to hear his horror stories. If you read Jane Eyre in school like I did, you loved Rochester and thought he was fabulous..then as you get older you think, &quot;so why did he lie to Jane about having another wife?&quot; He was imperialistic, deceptive, furtive and a user..Jane just got him at a time in his life when he was older and broken...lucky her!! In WSS, Jean Rhys showed that people aren't always what they seem. Rochester loved Jane's innocence; he didn't know her at all. But Antoinette did. Finally somebody exposed the ugly side of the man who didn't deserve someone as pure as Jane, but got her anyway.The dialect in some parts may have been difficult for foreign readers."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Antoinette has a tough childhood. She is a white child living in Jamaica when the slaves are freed. Her family is ostracized and in danger. Her mother eventually remarries and they leave their family home in flames, burned by the angry and vengeful people of the village.Years later, Antoinette is married to a man she's never met. On their honeymoon to Dominica, her husband starts to feel uneasy about their marriage. He doesn't like the overgrown environment of Dominica, and he really doesn't like the black servants working for them, especially Christophine, who was a slave of Antoinette's family when Antoinette was a child. He finds out distressing information about his wife's family and blames her for the position in which he feels stuck. As revenge, he withholds all love and affection from his wife, and calls her crazy until she becomes so.Antoinette is moved into the attic of her husband's home in England, where she lives out her days under guard and slips through the sleeping house at night, thinking of revenge.This is a devastating story of a woman trapped in her life. Throughout her life she doesn't have any choices, and her attempt to make things better between herself and her husband backfires on her.The connection to \\"Jane Eyre\\" is nice, and it's an ambitious project to attempt to speak for a character who has no voice in that novel. I didn't feel like I had the chance to get to know the characters well enough from this book, though. It was so brief, and told in alternating viewpoints, and I didn't feel like I had a firm grasp on why Antoinette's husband was so awful and how Antoinette spiraled down into madness so quickly. I would have liked more time to get to know these characters, and perhaps gain more insight into their personalities."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"'Wide Sargasso Sea' is certainly an interesting read. Although a prequel to 'Jane Eyre', it can be read on its own merit. The story is about a rather disturbed young woman in the West Indies and her husband who both tries to understand and escape from her. The author captures the time period (1830s) perfectly and has obviously researched the lifestyle and the language of the local people. She is also a brilliant writer; her prose and characterizations are of a high caliber. Yet since much of the book is written in the first person of a stressed, emotionally unstable woman, I found it sometimes difficult to catch all the subtle nuances. Thankfully there are appendices in the back of the book which proved most helpful.Bottom line: a very different, at times difficult, but very remarkable piece of literature."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Rarely do authors venture to handle tasks as difficult as what Rhys confronts in this book. Taking a great novel, \\"Jane Eyre,\\" Rhys seeks to embellish upon it with personal attributes. It still rings of England, but in the 19th century as opposed to Bronte's 18th century. It still has the infamous madwoman, but in this book she is the protagonist who thinks and speaks. The protagonist, we learn, is named Antoinette.The man of Antoinette's life is anyone's worst nightmare - he exudes wealth for which he lives and marries Antoinette for her money so that he can further feast his insatiable appetite for more wealth. He deems Antoinette's beauty and island's majesty as wicked, and determines that they are something he must destroy. He cannot destroy the island, but he can destroy his wife, whom he refers to as his marionette.Born rich and beautiful, Antoinette experienced some hard times during her childhood, but always gaily persevered. In her womanhood, her husband proves to be the straw that breaks the proverbial back of her gaiety. His character becomes vile and spiteful. Adultery with the Creole teenage maid or mind games with his loving wife were not enough -- instead he must tease her in a manner which strains her and saps her of energy. He proves to be totally worthless to her as his ambition is to exile her from her West Indies island and thrust her into the small confines of an English manor's attic along with a gin-sipping, distrusting maid. To remove her to the attic's purgatory, he falsely accuses her of insanity; a serious statement which no loving husband would ever wrongly declare about his spouse; a statement which would never be questioned by the other men who adjudicate her insanity. His lies detain her in the attic while he can freely use her money for his whim.I guess Rhys best exemplified the horror of his character by refusing to don a name for the husband. The Norton Critical Edition mentions that Rhys wrote, \\"I carefully have not named the man at all.\\"This book describes how a wealthy woman can be psychologically and emotionally abused by her closest male companion - her husband. This is a feminist critique which touches a subject rarely (or just beginning to be) discussed at the time of the book's first publication [1966] and well after it s first draft.This is a classic story with modern undertones. It is a great read."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"A thought-provoking book that is as elusive and haunting as the characters it portrays. The prose is beautiful and the descriptions of Jamaica both enchanting and frightening.Through Antoinette we see how easily the slippery slope to madness can be embarked upon and through Rochester, we see how quickly this can alter someone's feelings... The whole book has a sense of mystery, unspoken secrets and feelings. Not advisable for those that like a conclusive story with straightforward characters."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I have enjoyed reading the wide spectrum of reviews on this novel; its obviously a love it or hate it type of proposition.Say what you will about whether it stands alone, needs Jane Eyre as background or insults Bronte, it is a beautiful work of prose. Jean Rhys describes locations and places and moods with skill that I'm sure all the Bronte's would greatly admire. And hey, you have to consider that between Bronte and Rhys lies an entire century of change in attitudes and styles.I'd recommend it as a suitable post Jane Eyre reading for those that loved Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea is an excellent novel. The author, Jean Rhys, tells the story of Antoinette \\"Bertha\\" Cosway Mason, the insane wife of Rochester in Jane Eyre. You will learn of Bertha's childhood, honeymoon with Mr. Rochester, and read a short section about her days in Thornfield Hall. The story drags a little in the second part, but overall the story flows very well. If you read and enjoyed Jane Eyre, I believe you will find Wide Sargasso Sea very interesting."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Goodness. I just finished reading Rhys' novel and it blew me away. Charlotte Bronte is my favorite author and \\"Jane Eyre\\" is my favorite novel. I had high expectations reading this book and they were exceeded. \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" had the literary quality that JE deserved.Antoinette's life in the Caribbean, very carefully and vividly constructed, traces in an almost paranormal way the process of A. going mad. Soon I had busted out my pencil and I was jotting away in the margins.The connections to JE are subtle and eerie, such as the continual mention of the looking-glass (and its final reflection in its \\"gilded frame\\" - yikes!) Rochester is treated with complexity in such a way that his character is actually believable as Bronte's Rochester too. A.'s relationship with her mother and Christophine is interesting and nuanced and does interesting things with A's identity and her conceptualization of her self. The final chapter of the novel is worth the crick in my neck I got for reading too long - and then some. The final chapter (back in Bronte's England) had imagery to give Bronte a run for her money.\\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" is beyond brilliant in it's imagery, characters, complexity, and readability. No reading of Jane Eyre can be considered complete without it. You must, however, read JE first. (And then maybe again after reading Rhys.)"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys' masterpiece has become a \\"school assignment book\\" which seems to ensure numerous one and two star reviews by those forced to read it. In addition, almost all reviewers seem to focus, quite heavily even, on its connection with a famous English novel which I will not mention until the end of my review, since that is where the connection is readily apparent in this novel. If for no other reason that it is the \\"path less traveled,\\" I'd propose a strong connection with Caryl PhillipsThe Atlantic Sound. Phillips, like Rhys, was born in the Caribbean. Both would go to England in their youth. And both their works concern the terrible legacy of slavery, in particular, the \\"Middle Passage,\\" the forcible transfer of black slaves from Africa across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, and such American cities as Charleston, SC.The novel commences on the island of Jamaica, shortly after slavery was abolished in the British Empire in 1834. The first part of the novel is narrated by a young white girl, Antoinette Bertha Cosway, daughter of a slave owner and his wife. Their estate is called Coulibri; Rhys never says it means \\"hummingbird\\" in English. The father dies, and therefore his wife struggles to manage, in poverty, with her two children, the narrator, and her brother. The wages of sin, the sin of slavery, are literally death in some cases, but the core theme that Rhys examines is the insanity of both the mother and the daughter. She also explores the inevitable interracial sexual relations, and the children of such relationships. Also there are the terribly distorted economic and social relations, post-slavery, between the races. Can whites ever feel safe in their own beds without barring the bedroom door, given the legacy of injustice? William Faulkner depicted similar scenes of the revolt of slaves in these islands in his classicAbsalom, Absalom! (Modern Library).Rather inexplicably, Antoinette's mother is rescued from the poverty, but not the insanity, by marriage to an apparently wealthy Mr. Mason. Due to her mother's deteriorating mental state Antoinette is sent off to the proverbial nunnery. Her step-father saves her from that, with an arranged marriage to an English \\"fortune seeker,\\" who acquires a sizable dowry in the process. But is it worth it? He narrates much of the second portion of the novel, and that is the central question as he must deal with not only his wife's dysfunctional behavior, but that of society at large, including, in particular, the servants. Christophine, whose origins are in Martinique, and who raised Antoinette, is a deeply threatening presence to Antoinette's husband. And throughout this action, Rhys paints a deeply vivid picture of the natural world of Jamaica, particularly in the isolated, central mountainous region. Due to societal evils, past and present, there is an edgy \\"Gothic\\" tone to novel.The last part of the novel, only 10 pages, is set in England. And that is the connection withJANE EYRE, the \\"madwoman\\" in the attic. As a couple of other reviewers have said, Rhys novel is a sort of \\"prequel\\" to (Jane Eyre). And it is, in its way, truly, in that she provides all the motivation, squared even, necessary to indicate why someone \\"chooses,\\" if that really is what happens, a personal insanity instead of living in a society which itself is \\"insane.\\" This was the first novel of Rhys that I've read. It won't be the last. She packed a tremendous amount in, most skillfully, in 190 pages. 5-stars, plus."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys gives an alternate explanation about the &#34;mad&#34; woman in the attic found in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. In her voice, we realize how racism, isolation and betrayal cause Antoinette Rochester's psychological demise ... not genetics as everyone would have you believe."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is one of the stories that inspired me to become an English teacher. The richness of her style and dense, dark characters enrapture still. Therefore I was excited to discover the \\"prequel\\" about Rochester's poor demented wife kept in the attic. At first I was disappointed. The Wide Sargasso Sea's author, Jean Rhys, does not speak in Bronte's (nor Miss Eyre's) style. That was my expectation. But why? Ms. Rhys lived in a different time and culture than Miss Bronte. Rhys did experience the tropical culture in her childhood. This is also, after all, Antoinette's (or Bertha's) story, not Jane Eyre's. Mr. Rochester was a young aristocrat and a \\"second son.\\" Both victims tell their own story amid a primeval jungle of darkness and deceit. The archetypes of light and dark, wilderness and civilization, Eden and the knowledge of evil are reminiscent of Eudora Welty's The Robber Bridegroom. The change of narrator's was surprising, but eventually it seemed to work. We heard both bride and groom as they descended from sanity to insanity. The introduction by Francis Wyndham was helpful to keep \\"the voices in my head\\" separate. (Don't skip the introductions; they are there for a reason.) My sympathetic feelings for Antoinette or Bertha only intensified after this reading. Mr. Rochester's brooding spirit was completely explained. Antoinette never had the redemptive possibility of love; Jane's love brought light to his spiritual prison."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This story is confusing and keeps shifting from one thing to the other.

The novel is a quick read and well-written."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"If you haven't read Jane Eyre, than do not start with this book. If you have read Jane Eyre, than Wide Sargasso Sea may make some sense to you.The book focuses on Mr. Rochester's former bride who, in Jane Eyre, currently resides in the attic. The novel characterizes her childhood and depicts several reasons why the main character went insane. The structure of this book is not simple to follow because chapters alternate in first person narration between characters. Also, in the latter chapters, the novel's disorganized narration is used to display the onset of the main character's madness.In high school, I wrote a paper that diagnosed the main character's (I can't remember her name) madness as schizophrenia. Thus, if you are interested in psychology, you may find this novel interesting.However, if you did read Jane Eyre, you probably won't find much connection with it in Wide Sargasso Sea, other than the main character and Mr. Roachester. Also, in contrast to Jane Eyre, Wide Sargasso Sea is by no means a lite read, and is very depressing."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"It seemed completely irrelevent. The descriptive nature of the novel, however, made it ever so slightly bearable. How anybody reads the book strictly for entertainment is beyond me."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Oscar Wilde once said that all art is useless, but if he could have read &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; I'm sure he would have agreed that some of it is more useless than others. It's nice that Jean Rhys, like many other readers including myself, admired Charlotte Bronte's monumental &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and apparently was intrigued by Bertha, the infamous madwoman in the attic, but why did she feel compelled to write a novel filling in the blanks of this woman's past? The character of Bertha, who is said by some to symbolize repressed feminine sexuality, was intended by Bronte to be a mystery and to remain a mystery, and Rhys's attempt to invent a solution to this mystery is feeble, unenlightening, and unwelcome.Rhys has all the details in order. Born as Antoinette Cosway to a semi-Creole family of slaveowners, &quot;Bertha&quot; grows up on a dilapidated estate in Jamaica with a widowed mother who later marries a man named Mason. After a fire which destroys the estate (wink, wink) and in which her younger brother perishes, Antoinette is educated at a convent and becomes the bride of a young Englishman named Rochester who receives a large dowry for her from Mason. However, there is unhappiness on both sides of the marriage bed, resulting in Antoinette's gradual descent into insanity and Rochester's exasperation with his new wife's neurotic behavior. In fact, one of the novel's better moments depicts Rochester, regretful of the prospect of being inseparably tied to this batty woman for the rest of his life, contemplatively drawing a stick figure representation of her locked up in the attic of an English house, the effect of which is unintentionally comical but not a little eerie.The novel ends with Antoinette, whom Rochester now calls Bertha, as a pyromaniacal prisoner in Thornfield Hall as her husband envisioned in his crude sketch, and...well, so what? What exactly was Rhys trying to demonstrate with this little exercise in speculative character development? The unique intensity of her passion for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;? Her sense of identity with Bertha because she was a West Indian Creole herself? The mess she could make of her prose by affecting a clumsy stream-of-consciousness narration that reads like third-rate Virginia Woolf? This is a misguided abortion of a prequel that does not merit an association with its source of inspiration."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"If you have not yet read Jean Eyre, then I highly suggest you do not read Wide Sargasso Sea. This novel takes the reader into a confusing road where the characters have no meaning and the situations as well as the scenes change quickly and with little explanation. The novel is divided into three different sections, the first and third narrated by the main character Antionette, and the middle being told by her namless husband. The words are flowery, poetic, and full of imagery and emotion, yet that is the only true quality found in the entire novel. Jean Rhys attempts to give a prequel to the the book by Charlotte Bronte, and in my opinion failed. Then again I should repeat the fact that I never actually read Jane Eyre. Wide Sargasso Sea gives no meaning, no answers, and no purpose. It seems to be words throuwn into the air, a sort of extended poem. Situations jump around, characters are oddly portrayed and explained, and the reader is taken through many loopholes and twists. Even the main character has a name change towards the end of the book with no reason or purpose being defined. In my eyes the novel is a ramble of the authors true emotions for she is known for her suicidal and troublesome life. All the emotions and explanations seem like a constant ramble of hate, confusion, and betrayl with no explantion whatsoever. It is as if the author wished to let her inner demons free soly for her purpose and never took into consideration that not only was she attepting to write a book, but she was taking the storyline from a novel that was not even of her own doing. Yet if you are a fan of Jane Eyre, or are entertained by confusion then I suggest this novel for you. If not, then go on down your list and find a book that is original and well written."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Jean Rhys should never have touched Jane Eyre, a classic, to begin with. First of all, she ruins the character of Rochester. In the original he is a hero, and a wonderful person. In Rhys', he is an evil, evil man. This made the book almost impossible to read. Second, there were all these changes of point of view without any notice! One page Bertha is telling the story, the next Rochester is. Horrible. Thirdly, Rhys uses fragmented sentences, bad grammar, and no punctuation in some parts when Bertha is telling the story. The only thing this accomplishes is it makes an even bigger pain in the butt to read. No one cares about Bertha or Antoinetta as Rhys calls her in her version, and the book is a complete waste of time. So, unless someone is holding a gun up to your head, do not read this book."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I just have to say, I love buying used books. The occasional underlining, the lightly used covers, makes me feel like I've already owned this book...it's been loved!The prices aren't bad either. I am so ready to read this book and see the Jane Eyre story from the POV of Rochester's first crazy wife in the attic. I am thinking it will be an interesting feminist reading of that story."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book was a horrible piece of literature that I was forced to read for my school. It completely wrecks the book of Jane Eyre. Some things are not meant to be known. The mysterious of Bertha (Antoinette), added to the quality of Jane Eyre. Wide Sargasso Sea did nothing to add to Jane Eyre but rather take away from it. Rochester believed to be a great man at the end if Jane Eyre. After reading Wide Sargasso Sea, this is not the case. Maybe Charolette Bronte did not want the reader to believe this, but Jean Rhys comes in and just about recreates one's beliefs about Jane Eyre. I would reccomend that this book should not be read. Rather, it should be burned."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Due to the sadistic nature of the Board Of Education we were forced to read this book for 3 unit English. After studying Jane Eyre we were thankful for the shorter book, after reading it however there must be something said of someone who must stoop to stealing a classics characters and mutilating them reducing them to self centred, psychologically impaired,suicidal beings. If it were possible I would have given negative stars for the time I wasted from my life forced to read this book. Im hoping that in the afterlife Charlotte Bronte is teaching Jean Rhys a lesson about plaguarism by stabbing her repeatedly from the inside out while quoting Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is an ingenious book by Jean Rhys. Of course, re-writing or \\"spoofing\\" an existing book is nothing new and Jean Rhys was not the first person to do it, but Wide Sargasso Sea goes beyond re-writing. It is an original work that integrates seamlessly into the text where it sprouts from -- Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre.The book is very well written. The story is told from several different persons' perspectives -- the young Antoinette, Mr. Rochester (although his name is never mentioned), the grown-up Antoinette, Grace Poole, and finally the imprisoned \\"Bertha Mason\\". The language has a fine textual to it, the social and racial background of the West Indies is depicted vividly.In Jane Eyre, \\"Bertha Mason\\" is but a symbol, a mad woman, a monster in the attic. But here, in Wide Sargasso Sea, we see a beautiful and sad little girl, isolated from society because of the social situations surrounding her. Jean Rhys really wrote life into this woman. Remarkably also that Rochester is totally believable and consistent with the same character in Jane Eyre -- on that note, I never liked Rochester in Jane Eyre anyhow, he was rude, jealous, ruthless and above all selfish. Here in Wide Sargasso Sea, he is all that and also a hypocrite -- he talks about his Christian beliefs all the time but sleeps with his wife's servant, he marries for money but does not give her any freedom. We see how step by step he has driven Antoinette into Bertha Mason.There is richness and life in this book. Now you look back at Jane Eyre you see how pale that is (both the book and the girl). Jane Eyre's happiness hinges on the demise of Bertha Mason, and it is only convenient to reduce her to a symbol, to a monster. Jane Eyre -- both the book and the girl -- sees everything from the white Anglo-Saxon's perspective and does not even realize there are the other side of the story (quote from the book \\"there is always the other side\\"). But Jean Rhys gave \\"Bertha Mason\\" the life and \\"the other side\\" of the story that she deserves."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I'm a big fan of the Brontes', and I'd always heard academics animatedly discussing Wide Sargasso Sea. Here's the skinny: In Jane Eyre, we discover near the end of the novel that Jane's intended (Edward Rochester, her former employer) is actually already a married man. We learn that he'd been duped into marriage to a crazy, wealthy woman from the West Indies (she's called Bertha in Charlotte Bronte's novel) by not only her family, but by his own. (The arrangement was a financial boon for his money-grubbing family, and her family was just glad to get her out of the way). At any rate, this mad woman has been sequestered in the drafty attic of Rochester's mansion for YEARS, and she conveniently dies at the end of Bronte's novel so that Jane and Edward can live happily ever after.Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys, tells \\"Bertha's\\" side of the story. I found this to be a beautiful, wonderfully atmospheric novella. Bertha is re-christened Antoinette in the slim volume, and though her family does have its share of mental illness, Rhys also explains the history and relationships that have led to such outcomes. The language describing the landscape of the West Indies is rich and thick with scent, color and flavor. Racial tensions are starkly drawn, and the sinister nature of all the tropical unknowns (jungle, ruins, black magic) are lurking on every page.This one I can recommend, particularly if you are a fan of Jane Eyre. It will make you think of that classic in a new way, and it will also have you digging out your bikini and wondering if you can keep on orchid alive in your kitchen window."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Who is the mad woman in the attic of the house where Jane Eyre has gone to work; how does she come to live there; what drove her to madness? Anyone who has read \\"Jane Eyre\\" has, I'm sure, wondered these things as Bronte's story unfolded.Jean Rhys has wondered also, but has tried to answer these questions. The back story which is contained in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" fills in answers. Rhys explains the childhood of this woman and her strange home life as a child. The story is told of how she got to England and ended up captive in a dark cagelike attic.It would have been better if Bronte had answered these questions herself. However, Rhys stands in for her and has written a marvelous mystery which keeps the reader as spellbound as the original story did.Good reading - have a go at it."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I became a fan of Jean Rhys after reading her earlier work \\"Good Morning, Midnight.\\" That other book was written by Rhys when she was 30 years younger than when she wrote the present book. That earlier book is based on her wild party days in Paris.So it was with anticipation that I looked forward to the present book. The story is about a Creole heiress, Antoinette, and is set in 1830s Jamaica. The start of the book is about an attack on a house, and that is a great opening. But as the story proceeds, there are a few things which I did not like, and those points were very disappointing. One point is that there are shifts in the narrator; it is not just the protgonist, Antoinette, speaking. The narrator changes. We wonder who is talking, and frankly it becomes very confusing. I found myself consulting the notes at the end to make certain who was narrating the story at any page.The book is broken into sections - representing different phases of the Antoinette's life. The last chapter is not good. It seems to be very forced, and we can assume that it was written to make the plot converge with the plot details found in Jane Eyre.If Rhys had tried to keep it original, I think the whole novel would have been a lot more interesting. If she had just taken section one, a very dramatic and original section and continued on that theme it would have been a great novel. That first section was outstanding and it is a good start; but as the novel has been written, we have a series of loosely connected tales with the end forced to fit the Eyre story. The whole story loses momentum as we proceed through the book.Also, the female protagonist loses her mind about halfway through the novel over a relatively trivial incident and that lacks realism. This follows a riveting opening section where there is much more mental anguish, so it makes the central story seem artificial.As a side note, readers should avoid the introduction for this book until after the read. It gives away major parts of the plot, along with the basic plot of Jane Eyre. Fortunately, I had read Jane Eyre.This book has good spots but it fails in the end: read some of her earlier books. It merits 4 stars only because of the first half of the book."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"As a fan of Jane Eyre, this book offered a whole new of realm of perception and distortion to Bertha/Antoinette, Rochester's mad wife. I would recommend this book for anyone who has read Jane Eyre, and would like to view the novel from an entirely different angle."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"i can only say that i finished this book in 2 days (4 sittings) and for about a week, it travelled with me wherever i went like a perfume of a loved one who has left the country for an indefinite amount of time.i found myself reading some parts outloud.a real &quot;story-book&quot;."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Whilst it's a difficult novel to read and takes time to understand, it is worth it. Spend time reading Jane Austin, spend time reading WSS. Spend time on each page understanding the significance of each word, because each word has been crafted to mean something. Jean Rhys spent a decade writing it, so a few weeks reading it should be a minimum. Each sentence echoes, creates, expands, clouds, uncovers. Rereading uncovers more. It is a novel about racism, sexism, colonialism, but at its heart there are no &quot;isms&quot;, just human nature. It doesn't postulate right or wrongs, that is left up to the reader - it creates questions. Who can we relate to? Rochester? We'd like to think not. Where is our place in the world? Where is home? Within us, or without."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I had been told of this book and was eager to read it, but was disappointed by it. It gives the tale of Antoinette Mason (Rochester's wife) in *Jane Eyre*, and in describing the background and life of &quot;the madwoman in the attic,&quot; argues against the values implicit and explicit in the Bronte novel. But these characters are not compelling. The book is an argument, not a vivid novel that pulls the reader into its vortex. If I want an argument, I can read literary theory or criticism."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I came upon this book raw: I didn't know anything about it, didn't know of its fame, did not know that it has become canonical. To me, it was only a dusty book on the library shelf. But when I began reading the book, it was clear that I had stumbled upon something of great value.The \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" by Jean Rhys is well-deserving of its newfound stature. The book is beautiful and haunting from start to finish. It is dreamlike in its tone. The tale becomes nightmarish, though, as Rhys masterfully overlays the confused rationalism of Rochester, the jungle of Jamaica, the troubled youth of Antoinette, and the maddening backdrop of newly outlawed slavery.Rochester is a man of reason and masculinity: things are to be known, owned, measured, and governed. He can scarcely fathom a world which resists his ideas about rationality, and poses its own rejoinders. And what of this mad world he despises? It is the seething confusion of enslavement and empire: the black magic and savagery Rochester fears are products of his own elite brand of Englishness.The narrative, which changes between the minds of Rochester and Antoinette, is deeply fair to both. Contrary the remarks of other reviewers, Rochester is not a \\"pig\\" until he falls into his own kind of madness: Rhys is straightforward and even sympathetic with the Englishman's ethics and perspective. Each voice in fact humanizes: this is a book about paradigmatic collisions and the legacy of violence. Rhys has not taken a cheap shot at Eurocentric masculinist culture. This is no mere political commentary of cardboard dramatists: this is a work of literature, all the more haunting because the characters are so believable.Although originally unaware of the novel's recent accolades, I was bowled over by this remarkable work. \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" is a great work of art, not only for its beautiful language and compelling story, but for its penetration of repression and rationality. I agree with those who have placed this work on this lists of great novels. May it be discovered for generations to come."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is a work of 'literary fan fiction'. I've read and enjoyed Jane Eyre, so I went into reading this supposed response and continuation optimistically. I was even excited about it, but the novel falls short, I think, of any and all of its established purposes. It is entirely didactic (though perhaps not as blatant as an Ayn Rand novel, for example), and so seems to be almost completely disassociated from the source material it claims to pay homage to.Jane Eyre was, I think we can agree, a very successful and effective feminist novel, it approached the subject with bravery and intent, but also with caution. Wide Sargasso Sea takes that theme and flat out runs with it, making itself out to be a post-modernist novel that is entirely too self aware of its post-modernism. It takes itself far too seriously, which is surprising because all Rhys really did was take provided, popular characters, and figure out a back-story for them. I'm not impressed."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I enjoyed this book for the most part. It was a little difficult to get into, but the plot took off quickly after that. There were many symbolic parts of the novel for example the parrot burning in the beginning. Part two begins with a new narrator which is confusing for a few pages. By that point in the book, it had my undivided attention. The rest of the story was hard to imagine but very interesting to read. Poor Antoinette led a rough life but her insanity was inevitable. Her fate of being locked up like her mother was foreshadowed several times in the novel. This story led right into Jane Eyre, which I read first. This book, however, was much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jane Eyre or not it was one hell of a crazy good story.

The whites can not fully accept her because of her color and the natives hate her for being the offspring of a slave owner. Antionette's mother loses her sanity after the natives set fire to the family own and kill Antionette's little brother. These events leave Antionette emotionally sacrred and isolated.

Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and at first I was upset at this book. However, it's joined Jane Eyre as one of my favorite books. It is extremely well written, not to mention all the literary devices the author uses very effectively. I like her premise, that she felt it was unfair of Bronte not to give Antoinette Mason a story. In Jane Eyre she is simply depicted as an evil madwoman, whereas in Wide Sargasso Sea the author forces the reader to see her as a complete human being who has lived a complete life. By the end of it I had the greatest sympathy for her, though as a fan of Mr. Rochester I did feel she was a little hard on him, considering what he had to go through.

Her images were so strong that i didnt have to try to imagine the characters or settings, i could already see them."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This brilliant novel primarily deals with contradictions and ambiguity. Written as a prelude to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, Jean Rhys creates an identity for the otherwise shadowy figure of Bertha Mason, (Rochester's mad creole wife), through Antoinette a beautiful lonely Creole woman. Wide Sargasso Sea deals with contradictions and not just with feminist &quot;rag issues&quot; as other reviewers suggest, rather tending to deal with gender reversal. Christophine the freed black slave from another Caribbean Island, is a strong female character who displays masculine traits standing up to the bullying unnamed Englishman, (Rochester) who tries to use oppressive colonialist tactics to control the inhabitants of an exotic Island which cannot be controlled. Both are wild and unruly compared to his staid English persona, something which he cannot relate to. Antoinette is the weak female figure who is finally destroyed by the Enlgishman, driven to madness, through a combination of his desire for her and his distate and hate for everything that she represents. An intriguing tale full of ambiguity Wide Sargasso Sea is a sad tale of disposession and dislocation."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This novel was a challenge, but I suppose it was worth the effort.

Rhys' style challenges the reader to \\"fill in the blanks\\" many times throughout, making necessary intuitive connections to amplify her sometimes sparse prose.

The imagery is startling and fresh, the atmosphere almost chaotically alive, and the voices are clear, not at all ponderous reading. Though many who have read Jane Eyre worry that they will not like Rhys's portrayal of Rochester, they should not skip this gem! Rochester is another person in Bronte's novel and says himself that he regrets his earlier actions. &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; is the best book I've read in a long time; treat yourself!"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys could write fantastic prose, this book is simply extraordinary. The more I think about all the places where it could have gone wrong and didn't, the more I admire Rhys' skill. DON'T read this book in a class right after Jane Eyre. You will be in completely the wrong place (Antoinette and Jane barely seem to come from the same planet... If anything, try to read it for it's study of colonial fallout). Come to it on it's own sometime, with no pre-conceived ideas, and you will discover I startling and moving book."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I read this book because it's on the reading list for an English class I was thinking of taking -- I don't think I'll take the class after all!The main male character in the story is supposed to be Mr. Rochester from \\"Jane Eyre,\\" and the story centers around his relationship with his first wife, Bertha Mason (in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" also named Antoinette Cosway). In \\"Jane Eyre,\\" Bertha doesn't really figure much and was supposed to have been a madwoman from a long line of hereditary schizophrenics and idiots. But in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" Bertha/Antoinette is really a nice, healthy, poor little rich girl, and it is Rochester's unkind, unsympathetic, hot-and-cold English ways that make her go crazy. An important idea in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" in fact the premise that Jean Rhys sets out to prove, is that the portrayal of Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre\\" was a whitewash, and that he was really not a nice guy at all.I really wanted to take this class so I worked hard at keeping my mind open, but I've gotten to page 160 and can't go on anymore. If this is Mr. Rochester, I'm Tom Wolfe.In \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" for instance, Rochester is fully aware that he is marrying for money and he deliberately lies to Bertha/Antoinette, telling her he loves her. This Rochester is also a miser. He is sexually predacious and sleeps with one of the servants where Bertha/Antoinette can hear them in an (unforeshadowed and unexplained) attempt to use sex to mess with Bertha's/Antoinette's mind.All right, that's not at all the Rochester in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" but let's make allowances because he is 20 years younger at the time of \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" -- let's suppose that in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" with age, he has become more honest, more sober, more generous. But he is prudent and refrains from telling Jane this version of earlier events. (Highly unlikely since he told her other unflattering things about himself, but vaguely possible -- let's close one eye and keep reading.)But as we read on we stumble upon lots of other collateral evidence that Rhys' Rochester is really not Rochester, in fact is no man at all. For example: Mr. Rochester talks not as he does in \\"Jane Eyre,\\" expressively and refinedly, in long, complex sentences with a poet's range of vocabulary, but almost exactly the same way that the other characters in Wide Sargasso Sea talk -- in often lyrical, but choppy and incomplete sentences. And sometimes he's downright awkward: for instance, on P. 69, Mr. Rochester looks at the countryside around him in wonder. \\" 'What an extreme green,' was all I could say,\\" he tells us. Ouch.Okay, in \\"Jane Eyre\\" it wasn't really Mr. Rochester who was talking, it was Jane telling us what Mr. Rochester said, so maybe it was Jane's eloquence, not his. But as the story progesses, he gets more and more un-Rochesterlike and the world of the book less and less early 19th century. Rochester and Antoinette hang out at her house all day for weeks on end: no local English gentry, travellers, or missionaries visit them; Rochester never goes out for long, brisk, English walks or, better yet, horseback rides; he doesn't think of work or any sort of industry at all. Even if he is supposedly getting over a fever, this is simply not English behavior.Towards the end, in fact, Rochester's voice and character is completely indistinguishable from Bertha/Antoinette's. On page 149, the housekeeper is scolding him and he says, \\"I couldn't bear any more and again I went out of the room...\\" And in the next paragraph: \\"...it seemed to me that everything round me was hostile. The telescope drew away and said don't touch me.\\" (Ooh, that hurts, all right.)On p. 154 we learn why Rhys needed to rename Bertha \\"Antoinette\\" (besides the fact that Bertha didn't sound pretty to her 20th century ears) when Rochester admits that he, in a Freudian slip, started calling her Marionette -- this as proof of his wily \\"Gaslight\\"-type intention to psychologically destroy her. (Wow! Proof that, even in those days, men were just like they are now! Primo deconstruction, Rhys!) Rochester admits this, by the way, in the middle of a long tete-a-tete with Bertha/Antoinette's black servant, whom for some (again unforeshadowed and unexplained) reason he suddenly starts treating as an equal, even an intimate, where before he had logically held himself aloof from the servants. He even, on page 158, asks her opinion on how much money he should have to settle on Bertha if he left her! (That's when I had to leave!)I've given the book two stars because Rhys writes well and often prettily. But she's simply not versatile enough, in voice or in psychology, to take on such a task as she has here."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"The book is split into three parts. The first one is the childhood of future Mad Wife in the Attic from her perspective, the second is from the perspective of a newly-wed Edward Rochester and, in a short and confusing part, by Bertha, and the third one is by Bertha at Thornfield. Why is part two confusing? Because it's all told by Rochester, and then it jumps and you don't immediately realise that the perspective has shifted, and once you're used to it, it switches back to Rochester.The first time I read this book, I hated it, and was left with a feeling of being annoyed that the author had completely failed to understand Rochester. I even said (aloud!) \\"Well, I disagree\\" after I closed it. On a second read, I still can't agree with Jean Rhys, but I enjoyed the book more. Having read a bunch of books about writing now, I can appreciate the book in a sort of aesthetical way. It's well-written, the characters have very distinct voices and the use of senses drags you in and gives such a rich colour and flavour that you partially forget that you're reading a book. Jean Rhys was born in Dominica in 1894 and was half-Welsh and half-Creole, so she knows what she's talking about with regards to the Caribbean, and you can tell. It can only have been written by someone who knows what it's like there. Now, if only the characters weren't supposed to be Charlotte Bront's ...That's the biggest problem. She's referred to as Antoinette, not Bertha; even though she's \\"Bertha Antoinetta Mason\\" in Charlotte Bront's original. In the UK, your first name, your given name, is the one that goes first. Hence why \\"Bertha Antoinetta Mason\\" logically should be \\"Bertha Mason\\", not \\"Antoinetta Mason\\". In the book, she's Antoinetta but calls herself Antoinette, because that's what her mother was called. Bertha is a name she doesn't like and that Rochester insists on calling her because umm, IT'S HER NAME?Richard Mason is only her stepbrother. Her mother was married to a guy called Cosway, who apparently went crazy and died. The mother then remarried Mr. Mason, father of Richard, and she started losing her mind after her son (the \\"complete dumb idiot\\" Rochester refers to in the original) died. I think part two even mentions old Mr. Mason having died before the marriage or at least close to it - there is some way that he seems to be removed from the whole set-up. And who did the original say arranged the wedding? Mr. Mason and Richard with old Mr. Rochester and Rowland. The Masons were as in on it as the Rochesters, eager to be rid of her before the Rochesters would realise the mistake they had made.Then there's a point where young Antoinette is at school, and she is going to embroider \\"1839\\" on something. I thought \\"Jane Eyre\\" was set around 1838? I'm also left with the impression that she's taken out of school at the age of 17 in order to get married off. Rochester is around 21 or 22 at the time, and Bertha is a good five years his senior (her age being something the Masons had lied to him about before the wedding). Rhys claims Antoinette's mother died the year before the marriage - the original says Rochester first thought the woman was dead but he came to find out that she wasn't, \\"she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum.\\"Also, Bront is clear to point out that he wasn't allowed to be alone with her before the marriage and they hardly spoke two words to each other. That way, Edward never had a chance to get to know her beforehand, because if he had, he would never have married her. They had nothing in common and he found her a woman with infantile intellect and he couldn't keep a conversation with her even if he tried.If you're going to write a spin-off of something, at least have the decency to stick to the facts as they've been laid out in the original. Make up things that aren't in the original as much as you want, but the bits that are in the original, please get them right. From what I've gathered, Jean Rhys had a fixation on Mrs. Rochester so trying to apologise for her behaviour by giving her a backstory that doesn't quite add up to Bront's original is understandable. If the characters hadn't been from \\"Jane Eyre\\", the book would've been excellent. As for now, I think it's okay. It's a good book, but she's got the events and main characters wrong.It's my firm belief that Bertha Mason wasn't half as interesting a person as Jean Rhys makes her out to be. Yes, Bertha is a victim of sorts - being married off to someone who doesn't know the true you just so that your family can breathe a sigh of relief and hope it'll be too late to do anything about it by the time the groom notices something's wrong - but she's not a victim in the way that Rhys wants her to be. Bertha was mentally ill, not just some spirited girl who didn't like the husband she'd been married off to. I don't think she was ever really fully aware of what happened, and while that is sad in itself, I think Rhys just tried a bit too hard to make her sympathetic when she quite clearly never meant to be anything other than a woman whose mental illness was bad to begin with but quickly got worse."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I picked up this story because I'm working my way through Time's 100 All Time Best Novels, not realizing that it was intended to be a prequel to Bronte's Jane Eyre, and was pleasantly surprised.Rhys took issue with Bronte's character Mrs. Rochester, who was of Carribbean descent like Rhys herself (Creole), and set out to create a story that explains how that tragic figure came to be. In Rhys' tale, the original Mrs. Rochester (the young Antoinette Cosway) had a relatively happy, whimsical beginning in the West Indies, but was eventually driven to madness by a combination of racism, sexism, and colonial oppression. Derided by black and white residents alike for her Creole heritage, and stripped of material belongings by her English husband, she ends up the \\"mad woman in the attic\\" that Bronte describes.It's a short novel, told from both Antoinette's and her husbands point of view, but rich with social commentary."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"My assignment was ot find a book from a rather long list and read it for AP English. Seeing as how this was the only one I could find I went ahead with it. If I wasn't insane before I read it, I am now. This book sucked me in and made me feel as if I was Bertha (Antoinette Cosway, trying to figure a way out of a horrible marrige. Even though at times it was confusing and a little dull, I still like it. This is because it showed the true nature of Rochester. I dislike him even more now than I did before. However, if you like him in Jane Eyre then you may not want to read this. Overall I really like the novel and the use of imagery and character developement."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"It's been over a decade since I read Jane Eyre, and I found WSS to be a powerful, heart-wrenching book. The strength of WSS is in Rhys' ability to vividly portray places and events, and in her ability to emotionally involve the reader in Antoinette's plight. Its strength is NOT in the storyline, nor in its relation to the plot of Jane Eyre (although the connections are fun -- much like seeing Laverne &amp; Shirley show up on a Happy Days episode). My guess is that the reviewers here who hated WSS were looking for a &quot;good story&quot; that would &quot;enrich&quot; Bronte's plot; WSS doesn't really do that. To enjoy WSS, you have to care about Antoinette rather than Jane &amp; Mr. Rochester. But if you read it as a separate work, it's great."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"In Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea, the main characters depict two young women struggling for identity in a male-dominated world and time. Although Bronte's Jane Eyre and Rhys's Antoinette Cosway lead exceedingly different lives, they experience common hardships and become involved with the same man. Each women develops a completely different impression of him, yet both are strongly influenced by him in their own ways. Antoinette's character is established by Rhys to give Bronte's \\"women in the attic\\" an explanation of or behind her madness. Her years growing up in Coulibri's mixed paradise institute the conditions that lead to her unavoidable bizarre behavior which she takes on later in life. Her mind progresses into a \\"mad\\" state not only from her surroundings, but from the fact it runs in her family. The basic denial of her mother and only friend Tia crumbles her wall of security and drives Antoinette to trust only her creole maid, Christophine. Antoinette's world consists of constantly searching for the love and companionship she never received as a child. Like Antoinette, Jane endures a childhood of betrayal as a result of her aunt's constant abuse and rejection of love. Lowood School becomes a haven for Jane because she learns to deal with the difficulty she is faced with, while Antoinette is never afforded that opportunity. Jane expresses herself by concentraring on her education and career, as she deals with her own personal problems. Antoinette is never fully educated and allowed an outlet to direct her own frustrations. Although Jane creates a barrier for herself, she is still in search of the love and compassion she craves as a result of being denied as a child. Both characters in some way or another isolate themselves in a way that reflects their persona and results in the choices they make. Antoinette's various places of isolation include Coulibri and its paradise surrounded by the people who mock her, her honeymoon home spoiled by her husband who cheated on her, the infamous confinement of the attic, and most importantly, her mind. Antoinette never gave herself the chance to open up and be the individual she was striving to be. She was only familiar with the island she had always lived on, forced into her marriage, denied decision-making power and manipulated by a selfish half brother. Although there is evidence that madness occurred in Antoinette because of her family, the inability to deal with her mother's denial, the loss of friendship with Tia and the incapicity to resolve the problems with her husband collaborated together and ultimatly drove her insane. Jane, on the other hand, experienced isolation in many other places. These included the haunted red room, Lowood School and finally in Rochester's manor. Like Antoinette, Jane also displays isolation and conflict in her mind, but she learns to deal with it. During her years at school Jane develops a sense of individualism and education that helps her character become a stronger person. Between Jane and Antoinette the extremely different outcomes of their characterizations are cause by two factors. The fact that Jane was educated allowed her to succeed and the fact that Antoinette inherited \\"madness\\" prompted her failure. Even though Antoinette was conditioned to be crazy, it still ran in her family and in one way or another she developed into it. If Jane Eyre wasn't educated, her character would not have overcome what she did and succeed in so many ways."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys, the troubled author who was far ahead of her time in the 1920's, felt a strange kinship with Antoinette or Bertha Mason, the madwoman locked in the attic in Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre.\\" From the first time Rhys read \\"Jane Eyre\\" she knew she would someday write her story because she felt she'd lived it.Like Antoinette, Rhys grew up in the Caribbean, a troubled and hermetic world of Creoles, colonists and former slaves. Antoinette is truly a loner--the reversal of family fortunes causes her to be rejected by her own people, and despised by those who previously were on a lower rung of society. Throughout the novel, Antoinette is used, buffeted and never in charge of her own life. She feels that, as a woman, she is an object, not a person. As a woman, she is not in charge of her ultimate destiny, and this provides the conflict for the novel. Her madness is only an extension of this isolation and rejection.What makes Rhys a masterful novelist is her use of conversation and immediate events to describe the world in which Antoinette lives. There are no long passages of exposition; we see the world only through the eyes of the characters, mostly at the same time that they experience it. However, the immediate events and conversation or narration are so cleverly constructed that the reader sees through the narrator's eyes and can really see and feel the surroundings. This intimate point of view puts the reader in the skin of the character, but can be a bit confusing because we cannot always rely on the veracity of the narration. The point of view itself switches in the novel from first person to third person, in the second part, and back to first in the third and final portion, where Antoinette is locked in the attic.The novel is in no way a re-write or version of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" In \\"Jane Eyre\\", the madwoman is not really a character--she's a symbol for evil, for carnal and worldly desires yielded to without regard for the soul. \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" develops the madwoman into a character. Rhys slyly copies the beautiful symmetry of \\"Jane Eyre\\", where events occur in a sort of repetition; in \\"Jane Eyre\\", the heroine must leave a hostile home and find a haven, which then becomes hostile because it fails to nourish her soul with love (Gateshead, Lowood, Thornfield and then Marsh House. Only when Jane can marry her Mr. Rochester on HER terms, does she find a true home.) In \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\", Antoinette's home burns twice, a similar use of symbolism, here representing rejection by the world.\\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" is often listed as a \\"must-read\\" book --it certainly is a unique book and was far ahead of its time when Rhys wrote it. It's really worth reading."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys may be one of the greatest underrated writers of the century. Wide Sargasso Sea is her masterpiece. In a short 140 pages, Rhys creates a multi-layered story that deserves a few re-readings in order to fully appreciate it's scope.It's not &quot;anti&quot;-Jane Eyre, it is an exploration of that theme Bronte created but never examined- the madwoman in the attic. Rochester is not &quot;evil&quot;- he is a confused, weak man who blindly follows the values of his society (money, emotional repression), and is in fact portrayed to be a victim of them. That is what makes this story a tragedy; the oppressors are not hellions, they are simply ignorant and arrogant.There are so many themes in this book it is impossible to touch upon them all; men &amp; women, slaves &amp; slave-owners, rich &amp; poor, industrial &amp; rural, the known &amp; the unknown, the conqueror &amp; the colony.The first part is narrated by Antoinette Cosway, her memories of growing up in post-Emancipation Jamaica. It is written as though we have direct access to her thoughts, or she telling us her memories verbaly. The prose is rythmic, not static. The second section is mostly narrated by Rochester, his voice is a little more restrained, he is prissy and frustrated and confused as he describes their marriage and life in the Islands. Sometimes Anointette (whom Rochester has re-named Bertha) breaks his narrative and we are shown her own growing frustration and desperation. The last section brings the story to England- a few paragraphs are given to Grace Poole, then it is Antointette's now &quot;mad&quot; voice as she is locked in the attic.Reading Jane Eyre is obviously good preparation for this book, but if one knows the basic plot (say, have seen a movie version) that is good enough to appreciated WSS. Afterall, it is really the plot points and characters, as well as some imagery, that this &quot;prequeal&quot; picks up; it's themes stand on their own, as does Rhys's magnificant prose."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This beautifully written novel is as haunting as they come. It takes time to understand the rhythms of Rhys's prose, but it's worth the effort. Although I firmly believe that the book should be read separately from Jane Eyre (which I equally love), I also think that it adds another layer of depth and richness that Bronte would have appreciated. The idea that Mr. Rochester had a vindictive side in his youth is balanced by the fact that he loses his eyesight in the end of Jane Eyre. Jane's own decision to leave him seems even more justified, and his humbleness upon her return more genuine.But apart from the Jane Eyre factor, this is a mysterious and exotic novel of passion, fear, and betrayal. I have always wondered why Rochester hated Antoinette so much after he married her, and I have heard that it was because Rhys believed that everyone fears the depth of his/her own passion, and Rochester could not face the passion that Antoinette aroused in him. I think that Rhys explores this controversial theme with amazing finesse. The completeness of Rochester's revenge, as well as Antoinette's powerlessness to protect herself, is both heartbreaking and riveting to the end."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"'Jane Eyre' was one of my favorite books when I was a teenager and if I had read 'Wide Sargasso Sea' right after reading 'Jane Eyre', I would have hated it for deconstructing the heroic image of Mr. Rochester. I'm glad I discovered WSS much later. It's an intriguing, fascinating study of Mr. Rochester and his first wife, Antoinette Mason, the prototype of the 'mad wife in the attic' who played a minor but vital part in 'Jane Eyre'.Antoinette's mother descends into madness following the loss of the family estate to a slave rebellion. To shore up the family fortune and save her from becoming an old maid, and thus a burden, she is married off to Mr. Rochester, newly arrived from England, who knows nothing about her mother's insanity. WSS shows us the other side of Mr. Rochester that Jane Eyre couldn't or wouldn't see: his coldness, his selfishness, and his opportunism. We can understand how, as he did in 'Jane Eyre', such a man would lie to an innocent young woman about his marital status and nearly trap her into unwittingly participating in a sham marriage. Rochester is attracted to Antoinette at first; he is dazzled by her beauty as well as her money and eager to marry her. Once the honeymoon phase is over, he is unable to adjust to his surroundings. Jamaica is antipathetic to everything he grew up with, it's wild, untamed, a study in extremes, anathema to a tidy, organized, narrow-minded European, and Rochester is the typical insular-minded Englishman who despises what he is unable to understand.Antoinette is totally a product of her surroundings and completely at home where she is, and as Rochester feels alienated from Jamaica, so he feels alientated from his wife, and the discovery of her mother's insanity is justification enough for his deepening antipathy for her. He can't accept who or what she is; he can't even accept her name, he insists on calling her 'Bertha', never mind that it's a name she hates, it's what he wants, so it's who she will be. In 'Jane Eyre', Rochester blames his wife's alcoholism for the failure of the marriage; in WSS, it's his brutally cold and insensitive treatment of her that finally drives her to drink. When he takes her away from Jamaica and everything she knows and loves, she retreats into a madness even deeper than her mother's; she can't live in his world, any more than he can live in hers.In 'Jane Eyre' Rochester is the romantic hero and in WSS he is a monster of selfishness; when both are put together, the real complexity of the character finally emerges.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea is a dreamlike feverish novel awash in passion and trauma. Forget for a moment that it's a prequel to \\"Jane Eyre\\" or that it is a seminal text in Feminism and Colonialist studies. Simply as a story of trauma and madness executed in a modern stream of consciousness style it is brilliant. Disorienting, agonizing, nightmarish yet stunningly beautiful; I was forced to read it in dribs and drabs - as the knife edge of Rhys' vision would compel me to come up, panting for air. This book is powerful and unforgivingly dark. But, of course, it is much more - it's a modernist masterpiece which brilliantly critiques the human costs of crimes of patriarchy, colonialism, slavery and subjugation. It is a searing indictment at the same time it is a haunting work of art.Antoinette grows up poor and isolated at her family's plantation. Her companions are the black laborers and their children who simmer with resentment at the legacy of slavery. Slavery may have been abolished but has been replaced with economic and social subjugation and the resentment is palpable. Mr. Mason, her father, disregards his wife's warnings with sexist and colonialist (i.e. racist) arrogance - an act which destroys their lives (no spoilers - thus I'm being vague). Her mother's anger at Mr. Mason leads to her imprisonment as a mad woman. Women are not permitted to express rage against their husbands - it is seen as irrational. Patriarchy is a central theme here because Antoinette/Bertha, too, is chattel. Her marriage to Rochester is effected because she owns land - it's an economic arrangement to gain property for Rochester. Once married, Antoinette/Bertha is stripped of all her claim to property (and even her name) and is completely under her husband's authority. Their marriage is marked by passion but it becomes apparent how culturally Caribbean (black) she is, tainted with scandal. Their relationship flames out spectacularly with infidelity and rage. When he decides he can't deal with her and chooses to abandon her to be locked as \\"the madwoman in the attic\\" she is reduced to, essentially, a prisoner. A woman, in that society, can literally be the prisoner of her husband. Both Antoinette and her mother, Bertha are confined as mad - but their pathologies are the simple act of blaming their spouses and acting out their anger. Rebellion is seen as madness - both in the context of rebellion against slavery and rebellion against patriarchy.As for the literary context - \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" as prequel to \\"Jane Eyre\\". By situating WSS's story within the classic Victorian novel \\"Jane Eyre\\", Rhys sets up a host of powerful resonances. Jane Eyre is a tale of redemption; of love's power to redeem. England's brutal social and economic inequities are hurdles to be overcome - but ultimately love overcomes them all in a healing and redemptive way. The fly in the ointment is Bertha, the mad woman in the attic. Rochester is still married - thus his attempt to marry Jane is revealed as bigamy Bertha's presence complicates the otherwise straightforward romantic narrative and gives it tension and fire. In \\"Jane Eyre\\" Rochester is redeemed from bigamy because Bertha is insane - rendering Rochester the victim. By inverting this tale to tell the story of Antoinette/Bertha as a victim of Rochester's racism and notions of patriarchy, Rhys deepens the misery by shattering \\"Jane Eyre\\"s redemptive message. In \\"Wide Sargosso Sea\\" love is a tragic by-product of the economic abuses of a patriarchal empire. Love has no redemptive power for Antoinette. It's just more salt in the wound. A lot of the negative reviews here center around resentment at Rhys for besmirching their beloved innocent \\"world of 'Jane Eyre'\\". They've missed the point. Inverting and besmirching the innocent world of 'Jane Eyre' is exactly the point. Colonialist England's apparent grace is built on the blood and toil of subjugated peoples. The subjugation extends to women as wives as well. You are meant to see that and the experience is not meant to be pleasant.I can't say enough about this book's importance or the brilliant, polished skill with which it is written. Published in 1966 - at the height of the civil rights movement and free speech movement - WSS's issues were dead on the zeitgeist of the moment. You can imagine how the lush, dark, evil imagery of the jungle and colonialism must have resonated in with an America embroiled in Vietnam and a rising anti-war moment. It's not a pleasant read, however. The messages are hard, dark ones. There are no happy endings here and as the story unfolds the brutal details big and small are as oppressive as the tropical humidity. This is fine literature, indeed - but also a journey into pain, deprivation, madness and tragedy. It's not a journey to be taken lightly."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea is the prequel to Jane Eyre, following Antoinette Cosway from childhood to her marriage to Rochester. They don't care for each other, but must accept the match, Rochester because he has no other prospects, and Antoinette because her family has a history of madness and Rochester doesn't know the stories.The book itself is very different from Jane Eyre. It begins from Antoinette's point of view, focusing heavily on Antoinette's mother, a troubled--eventually insane--widow. Then perspective shifts to Rochester and his preoccupied young wife, Antoinette.Anyone who has read Jane Eyre (and probably many others besides) will know what's coming, and this contributes to the spooky tone of the book. Antoinette from her own perspective feels so justified and normal, but from Rochester's she is oddly detached and her behavior grows to mirror her mother's eerily. The book keeps you thinking long after the ending...it's one of the most amazing things I've ever read. Please, please read it."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Whether or not we as readers realize the implications of &quot;the novel,&quot; the fact of the matter is that as a cultural artifact, all stories have behind their facade, the hidden barbarism of history. In &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; Jean Rhys confronts possibility of another side to &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;The story of Bertha, the first Mrs. Rochester, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; is a not only a brilliant deconstruction of Charlotte Bront's legacy, but is also a damning history of colonialism in the West Indies. Told from different points of view, the text is a tapestry weaving Bertha's story with Edward Rochester's early life. Like the seaweed the book is named for, the structure floats in and out of artistic consciousness as though on a sea of many unwritten stories.Although some might argue that &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea,&quot; detracts from &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; I feel that Jean Rhys gives us a fuller understanding about the cultural historiography that produces &quot;great literature.&quot; As a champion for the silenced voices, Charlotte Bront herself was all too aware of societies' injustices. While today, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; is generally accepted as a tract on social class, feminism, and conscious production of art, 150 years ago, Bront was lambasted by contemporary critics as unchristian, seditious and a poor writer. I can not help but think Bront, as social critic, would have cheered the publication of &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea.&quot;"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"The book is undoubtedly not for everyman. It may leave you confused and dazed by the disjointed narrative structure, incomplete dialogues and overpowering images and emotions that seemingly arise out of nowhere and for no reason.For many readers, a pre-requisite to enjoyment may be an acquaintance with Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. My own view is that this is not entirely necessary but helpful to contextualise the novel. Rhys was fascinated with the mysterious madwoman, the first wife of Rochester, perhaps identifying with her to a degree. However, the fascination in exploring this figure lies not simply in the character's exotic background, misunderstood and exploited as she might be, but the pivotal role she plays in creating a moment of moral ambiguity and crisis within Jane Eyre, the character and the novel.Wide Sargasso Sea itself is a mire of ambiguities and uncertainties, lurching from one crisis to another. It is interesting to note that the title refers to an area in the Caribbean famous for being treacherous. But what makes it rewarding for the reader is the unadulterated subjectivity of the narration, which is finely structured and layered to both highlight the complexities of issues involved such as (post)colonialism, gender politics and subject identification, as well as to immerse the reader in the disparate/desperate and irreconcilable angles of perception that works itself into a seamlessly hallucinatory reality.If all of the above sounds like a dream, this is the book for you. Otherwise, it is one to stay well clear of. It may also help to dip into her other books which run along similar themes but are not so 'lush'."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book was recommended to me in 1970, and I finally read it in 2000. Perhaps it was best to wait, since I'm not sure an eighteen-year-old could fully appreciate the novel's piercing beauty and emotional resonance. It's certainly one of the great historical novels, given its lush, unsettling evocation of the early 19th century in the West Indies, constrasting the physical splendor with the human squalor, but it's also one of the best &quot;studies&quot; of repressed sexuality I've ever read. It's a brief, but stunning tale (much more than just a pre-quel to &quot;Jane Eyre) that manages to touch on everything from the consequences of slavery, to the crushing force of social conventions and even the effects of climate upon character. But all this begins to sound far too clinical--at bottom, this is a gorgeous read about a fatefully troubled young woman and the human constellation that destroyed her. Vastly better than the over-charged, over-hyped, emotionally-shallow novels that have been foisted upon us lately as works of genius, this novel is truly luminous and captivating. The only note of caution I must add is that this is a book for those who love good writing, not for those who require the emotions on the page to be as simple as those on a TV talk show."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I remember reading Jane Eyre when I was 17 for my AP English class. I had to bite my lip when Rochester kissed Jane for the first time. Charlotte Bronte did an excellent job of creating a flawed, passionate romantic anti-hero that has yet to be rivaled by anyone (although her sister's Heathcliff comes pretty close).Jean Rhys' portrait doesn't rival Bronte's. Instead, she rips Rochester down so thoroughly that everything that made the &quot;original&quot; appealing is now nauseating. Her younger Rochester is selfish, spiteful and malicious. While he cannot be blamed for Antoinette's ultimate descent into madness, he is the one in the book who gives her the last push she needs.This is an extremely depressing book from start to finish. Rhys makes you attach quickly to the hopeless, friendless girl, and you find yourself hoping along with her that Rochester will be the savior that she imagines him to be, even though you know he can't possibly. Despite knowing how it's going to end, Rhys' final chapter surprises and (even further) saddens you; though you can't be sure if it's a fantasy or a memory, it's a glimpse into a happier world that was within her reach but for everything else around her."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is a wonderful classic that captures a time and place better than almost any other short novel written during the period.

This novel examines race issues in the Carribean while it depicts the romance-gone-sour that lead to Rochester's brooding, tormented personality from Jane Eyre. Recommended."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Saragasso Sea has tended to receive more attention and praise than Rhys' other books, perhaps because it is a tour de force, and/or because it was this novel that finally brought her recognition at the age of 76 (though she claimed to be only 72!). But for immediacy, power, a worm's-eye view of the ugliness and power politics that underly so many so-called human interactions, and above all prose that reads as though the main character is literally turned inside out -- as though the skin has been burned off and all we get is pure feeling -- I think Rhys' other novels, particularly Good Morning Midnight and Voyage in the Dark and After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie, are actually better."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"In this story every single word hits its goal, I mean, this is like the Other Room...

However, WSS has its own history. As we read WSS we should pay attention to the colonial steryotypes of the epoch. We can see how the colonizer signifies the colonized and viceversa, and how the creole's identity gets trapped in those two worlds. Also, it raises gender issues. In this way, we should interpret Antoinnet's experience as an individual and authentic experience, independent from Bronte's novel."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"When Rhys created Antoinette Cosway, it was if she had opened the curtains to a window looking upon the human soul.

The book had the feeling of a mystery. It didn't spoon feed you. I kept going back to reread previous chapters. It was a look at a woman who was damaged in youth and never had a chance at fulfillment. Good look at what it was like to be white in a black majority culture in the early 1800s. Interesting, but not upbeat."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys captures the feeling of what living in the West Indies is like, the heat, the lushness of colors, the earthiness of the people, both black and white, the social strata surrounding the master/servant relationship as it occurs in the West Indies at the time the book is written, the mid 1800's, and contrasts this with England, portraying England as a cold, hard, cynical place, a place where Antoinette, the West Indian girl is as out of place as Edward, the English gentlemen who marries her for her money, is out of place is the West Indies. Antoinette is looking desperately to Edward to provide her all the love and acceptance she missed out on in her childhood, and although denied this love, Antoinettes understanding of it is in the West Indian way, emotionally, colorful, passionate, even vulgar, but always full of life. Edward is from England his understanding of life and love is English, cold, analytical, proper and reserved. Even without Antoinettes history of emotional/mental illness, the two cultures and two people are so different it is only a short time before they collide, initially to Antoinettes misfortune, but ultimately in a final irony, to Edwards. Very interesting book, contrasting the way the atmosphere of the West Indies, and later on of England influence and explain the inner workings of the characters minds. Antoinette and Edward are not really ever portrayed as either simply mad/crazy in the former case or cold/evil in the later, but as two people with no understanding of the other and no potential for any communication whatsoever, each locked in his or her own world. Ultimately this leads to the destruction of Antoinette, and the revenge this leads her to. Very insightful book, using the characters own words to describe the actions."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book was &quot;almost&quot; a very good book, but something was off. What Rhys did well was portray the sensual atmosphere of Jamaica and the paranoia/confusion/disjointedness of mental illness. Attempting to understand and identify with the characters can almost make the reader feel as if she herself is mentally disturbed. While this is an original attempt in writing, I felt unconnected to this book. I didn't feel I truly understood either Antoinette or Rochester's motivations or personalities, and as such I did not really care what happened in the book. I liked the &quot;idea&quot; of the book -- i.e. examining a character made famous in literature through another perspective. If you also like that &quot;idea,&quot; then I recommend the book &quot;Wicked&quot; by Gregory Maguire which tells the story of the Wicked Witch of the West through another perspective."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Will somebody please tell me what the appeal is? Yes, I know it's a classic. But it's a really, really boring classic. The prequel to Charlotte Bronte's, Jane Eyre, is the story of Bertha Mason's childhood whose literary conceit is to tell us why Bertha went nuts. It's also a didactic dinosaur relic of the 1960s that traces the source of her madness to the fact that they didn't like little French girls in Jamaica. Racism, sexism, and classism drove Bertha \`round the bend. There. I've saved you the trouble of reading it.

Just because he's the \\"hero\\" doesn't make him, well, a hero we should look up to.Supposedly, Rhys spent YEARS writing and rewriting this curiously weak, empty, underwhelming novel. I'll stop short of suggesting that she wrote it simply to capitalize on the popularity of JANE EYRE.One of the book's saving graces is Rhys' vivid decriptions of the Caribbean setting: the colors and textures and culture. But it isn't enough to justify this novel's label as a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I am disappointed to say that this is not a well-written book. I loved the idea of this \\"prequel\\", but the execution lacks merit.Certainly, one could look through the tatters of the Union Jack in 19th century England and find racism and fear in everything, including Jane Eyre. I am surprised that these are not more pervasive, considering that Charlotte Bronte was cloistered most of her life and obtained her view of the world mostly through contemporary English literature.Yes, it's a sad story that Mr. Rochester was a product of his time, and I would have liked to see his character develop more... or should I say disintegrate a little more over the course of Wide Sargasso Sea? I wish I had seen him in greater depth.I wanted to learn more of the first Mrs. Rochester, Antoinette Mason, who later became the mad woman in Mr. Rochester's garret. Somehow, I just never got to know her well enough from the pages of Ms Rhys's novel. Pity.When someone writes a novel based upon the story and characters of another novel, especially one of such wide acclaim as Jane Eyre, that someone should be as adept as the original author at handling and developing those characters. Jean Rhys was not up to the task."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I bought this book to read for my book club. It was great. It was a student edition so I could even refer to line numbers. Loved the story."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"you should read this book before you read Jane Eyre because then you will get the full extent of the story behind the story. I really did not have a favorite part about this book because the whole story was horrible when you really look at it, I mean you have racism and hatred in families and neighborhoods it acually how I look at the world today."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Okay, so Bertha Mason was treated awfully in Charlotte Bront?'s Jane Eyre. Point taken. But Jean Rhys does an exceptionally poor job at defending Mr Rochester's first wife, who she christens Antoinette Cosway. In Wide Sargasso Sea, Antoinette/Bertha can hardly be called a heroine. Instead she comes off as a spineless young woman who is only too eager to become a victim of her English husband. He in turn is convinced that he is actually the victim of their unfortunate marriage. With this, Rhys creates two exceptionally unsympathetic characters, who you wish would just get up and do something about their situations, instead of wallowing in self-pity and rum. I'm sure there was actually a strong woman behind the raving lunatic that Bertha Mason became, but Jean Rhys hasn't shown her."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"That's right! I haven't read Jane Eyre. Wuthering Heights was on our high school reading list, but I've not revisited that (not gaining any attraction from Kate Bush's hysterical song of that name). Whatever, Wide Sargosso Sea is a slim and harrowing read, written with what might be hazarded as a lucidly paranoid mind. It barks at the night, retreats from the turquoise pools and jewelled humidity of the Caribbean islands where it's mostly set. The stench of fragmenting Colonuial life, informed by Creole spirituality permeates. The patoise of the locals is precise and memorable. Antoinette finally surrenders, retreating into insanity in the caverous candlelit hcorridors of Thornfield Hall, England. Hitchcock's use of Judith Anderson in his brilliant 1940 drama, Rebecca, terrified me as a kid. And this book's final chapter does the same trick.ie; was projecting Anderson onto Antoinette, here. What an achievement! Expressing both the male and female points of view of this reality makes for momentous insight."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I bought this book upon recommendation of a friend, but I didn't have enough background knowledge of Barbados to understand the bias and bigotry that the characters were involved in. Interesting style of writing, though, and a clever premise."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Years ago I read \\"Jane Eyre\\" and enjoyed it quite a bit, more than most Victorian-era fiction I've read. I came to \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" at a recommendation from a college professor who praised the book highly. I am also very fond of fiction based on established literary, historic, and Biblical characters (such as Anita Diamont's \\"The Red Tent\\"), so I was looking forward to gaining some insight into Mr. Rochester's wife. When I finally read it, though, I ended up hating it. I got no insight whatsoever into the character. It just skimmed the surface. I like adapted fiction where I can start to understand who someone is, but this book left me no more the wiser. Plus, the introduction to the version I had (printed 2002) is very misleading. It said parts one and three are narrated by Mrs. Rochester, and part two by Mr., but the second part switches POV several times, and I wasn't able to follow along. I do NOT recommend this book."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is a fine novel indeed!Jean Rhys's prose is compelling, darkly powerful, and touched by the magical light of the Caribbean. The story unravels through the words of its increasingly disturbed heroine, and offers a new, fascinating side to the tragical wife of Jane Eyre's beloved, while keeping completely apart from that book."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea points out the need for better communication in relationships and the importance of similar backgrounds or cultures in relationships. The book touches on the themes of love vs. lust and wealth vs. happiness. It is a story of love, lies, confusion, culture, and the aftermath of a badly broken relationship. It was a quick read with a lot of hidden messages. I must say that as I was reading it I wasn't sure that I liked it, but now that I have finished it I have to say I did. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in spirituality, love and gossip when reading a book."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book was a little hard to follow at first with several narrating changes but after a little while the book became quick to read and easier to understand. The book added a new twist to the classic Jane Eyre but did not give too much as to ruin the story of Jane Eyre. Not only does Rhys write a wonderful addition to Jane Eyre but she also teaches the reader a lot about the times and cultures in the early 1800's in Jamaica."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"The book is amazing, although a little confusing. A difficult read if not enough secondary sources to refer to. Many wonderful and contridicting themes involved. The movie was also not very badly done and is quite close to the book. Helps us to see a different prepetive to Jane Eyre. We are totally blind to the &quot;mad-woman in the attaic&quot; in Jane Eyre. Helps to look at a different prespective of Edward R. Overall good book but requires quite a few re-readings! Join a newsgroup or email me if u have any interesting ideas or any presisting questions about the book!"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Jean Rhys gave life to her characters and other than any other novel,it gave people a dose of reality."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book is supposed to be told in three distinct voices: young Antoinetta, Rochester, and Crazy Antoinetta stuck in the attic. But the narration jumps about and it isn't told in three distinct voices: Antoinetta is in Rochester's section, and the voices are so similar that it is impossible to tell who is speaking. And it is very contrived because you know (or at least those of us who read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;) how it is going to end. It's much ado about something we already know about. I gave it two stars because Rhys can really capture a setting, and the scene that foreshadows the fire at the end of Jane Eyre was wonderfully written. It's an easy read, so if you loved Jane Eyre and want some more of it, go ahead and read it. Just don't expect to be as moved as you were by Bronte."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I've been reading the book reviews, many of which are glowing beyond measure...and I can respect the author's past and why she felt so strongly about writing this novel. In and of itself, the Wide Sargasso Sea story, while incredibly depressing, and not altogether perfect, is interesting on several levels (historically, women's issues, Creole women's issues, etc.). Indeed, the latest film version is well acted especially by the heroine, and you do like her, feel sorry for her and wonder why she's thought mad, since she doesn't seem at all insane.But I have to ask: Have any of these people actually READ the Jane Eyre novel? Because if they had, they'd see that this author, who's chosen to write her book based on the classic, doesn't even keep to the specific details in the book, about Rochester, about Bertha Mason, about her family--mother, brother, etc. Antoinette is certainly not the crude, loose, bad-tempered, whorish, insane, mean and nasty character she's described in Jane Eyre. In Sargasso Sea, Rochester is portrayed as a thoroughly nasty, mean, selfish brute, while in the original, Jane Eyre, despite all his faults, he's actually likeable and lovable and has a heart. I realize there are some diehards out there who love Sargasso Sea, but it is such a different tale, and doesn't bother even to conform to the details described in Jane Eyre, that it seems morally wrong to attach itself to the Jane Eyre novel, which is one of hope, love, redemption, and yes, even humor at times. I felt insulted that this novel could claim to be the prequel to Jane Eyre. It's a story, alright, but I don't think it's the one that would have preceded Jane Eyre. Don't believe me? Re-read (or even read) Jane Eyre."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I didn't realize when I started this book that it was about Jane Eyre's Rochester's mad first wife - I probably wouldn't have read it as I have never cared for Jane Eyre (too passive for me) and thought Rochester a bloody clot. At the end when I realized who everyone was, I 1) immediately realized WHY I had never liked Rochester (I was right all those years, he is an ass) and 2) read it again. It's as different from Bronte's writing as Jane is from Antoinette; really lush and sensual. By the end of the second reading I disliked Rochester doubly one for pushing poor Antoinette over the edge and two for playing with poor ol' Jane's emotions. He really was a jerk. ;)"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Well, I just finished reading Wide Sargasso Sea, as an assignment for my I.B. English class. I must say that upon my reading of the story, I came out quite confused as to what I had just read. My greatest difficulties in reading the book was trying to keep up with the everchanging plot, as well as trying to determine what character was speaking at each line. Although the book was confusing to me, this was mainly because I knew nothing about it. However, after doing some outside research and realizing that this book was based on Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, it began to make sense. My first tip to prospective readers is to make sure you know the context of this book before you try and read, otherwise it may become quite unwieldy. The book definitely ended up being a very good read. I immensely enjoyed the use of the vivid imagery that allowed me to smell and taste the Carribean atmosphere. Throughout the story, we see many themes that emerge as the plot unfolds. One of these is that of slavery, and the black/white relationship. We see this in the most dominent front, that being the main characters, the Cosways, are slave owners. The book shows the aversion between blacks and whites created through slavery. However, the book gives a view of both sides to demonstrate that slavery and the hatred involved with this is a double-edged sword. We see the discrimination of the blacks by their white owners. Then we are also shown the contempt that the blacks had for their owners. I found this to be a quite satirical portrayal of slavery, especially when we see the black slaves villifying the Cosways with the expression &quot;white cockaroach&quot;. Another theme that is quite prominent in the story is that of the inferiority of women to men. We see how Antoinette is married off to an Englishman as soon as she &quot;comes of age&quot;. It is a marriage that lacks happiness, friendship, and love. It is based soley on sex and duty. We see how Antoinette's life is destroyed by Mr. Rochester, who has married for the money, and does not care for Antoinette or her problems. As their lives unfold, Antoinette becomes worse and worse, until Mr. Rochester sleeps with a maid, sending Antoinette of the deep end. After this incident the move to England, and although Antoinette is physically alive, she is truly dead. I found this book to be quite intriguing. It was not overly difficult to read, as long as you are aware of its background and context. Rhys' use excellent literary devices to create a realistic, vivid portrayal of the life of the Creole woman Antoinetted Cosway. I would reccomend this book to anyone you has the time to both read and analyze it."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Rhys wrote this as a response to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre (Penguin Classics) (note: while there are cheaper paperback editions of Jane Eyre, I highly recommend you purchase the Penguin Classics edition because of the brilliant, unmatched introduction by the novelist and academic, Stevie Davies, as it provides much insight, wisdom and appreciation about that novel), in order to re-position the character of Mrs Rochester, the \\"mad woman in the attic\\", into a primary position, rather than being voiceless and without any expressed identity of her own, as in Charlotte Bronte's story. Rhys does this by setting her story prior to the events in Jane Eyre; effectively the novella is a prequel to the latter. Most importantly, she prioritises the white Creole, Antoinette - her original name: in Jane Eyre we know her only as the mysterious madwoman in the attic, until later, she is explained as being Bertha, the first Mrs Rochester. As a result, her character in 'Sargasso', being placed front and centre, creates an entirely different set of interpretations and emphases, not least that Antoinette achieves her own identity and humanity here, rather than being relegated into a prison space of madness and silence, one in which Mr Rochester himself was responsible for.This is a powerful, deeply haunting and hallucinatory, deeply poeticised novella (the style, in this regard, is reminiscent of Toni Morrison's Beloved (Vintage Classics); it is an original and heartbreaking of love unrequited, leading to madness. The story is split into three parts, the first set in Jamaica, from the viewpoint of Antoinette as a child and in her youth, living on her plantation; the second section in Dominica, regarding the marriage and written both from Mr Rochester's imperialist viewpoint and sense (he only marries her as an arrangement established by his father to gain Antoinette's sizeable dowry and land), and Antoinette's increasingly troubled self (she knows that Rochester has had a sexual relationship with one of the female servants, while being with her); all the while you experience Rochester's own confusion and increasing disgust with the local people and the way of living, the heat and the tropical intensity of the place, so alien to him from his English, cold viewpoint. And, the third and most dramatic part, in which we once again return to \\"Antoinette\\", now Bertha, not only abandoned, but left imprisoned - the original \\"madwoman in the attic\\" - in Rochester's house in England; a world she neither understands nor values, and in which there is no love for her, no interest; she is effectively made persona non grata for all the years she is locked up there.Throughout the story, you experience the intensity of all those involved, the stifling physical environment, you feel the insecurity and uncertainty of the prescribed gender roles between Antoinette and Mr Rochester, and the locals, including servants. There is no ultimate exit or freedom for the female; for the male, there is simply the repetition of the male-dominated power structure, such that it deprives the male of any real identity, beyond that of his family's expectations and a prescribed role for his own masculinity and authority. 'Sargasso' is a powerful read, troubling and passionate, and a unique and profound creative take on issues of identity (especially including Colonial, slave, and the power dynamic between England and the Caribbean), sexuality and madness. It is a fascinating, moving and clever re-interpretation of the story told in Jane Eyre, and is highly recommended.PS - NOTE FOR STUDENTS who may be obliged to study this novella: The Penguin Students Edition is a genuinely worthwhile and helpful edition for students. Hilary Jenkins, who has written the editorial material, has done a good job. She provides not only a clear introduction, highlighting the distinctive qualities and structure of the story, but also a brief chronology of the author's life, very helpful notes on Creole language and phrasing, as well as historical points, exam- and essay-related questions you'd expect to have to answer as a student, as well as a separate section on the story's geographical and cultural, historical setting/context. Importantly, Jenkins concludes with Critical Responses to the novella, as well as suggested further critical/academic reading."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Well, it feels funny to give a modern classic a starred review, as academics have surely debated its merits more thoroughly than I can possibly do.I came away from this novel thinking that she was already insane when he married her. Some seem to think it's somehow Rochester's fault, but she was well along the path before he got there. He could have treated her a lot better and maybe mitigated the insanity better by not rejecting her so thoroughly. Maybe if he hadn't been a proud, stubborn, hot-headed fool, he would have treated her with kid gloves.But he's Rochester - totally the wrong person in the wrong place and **the wrong era** to get her the help she needed. For his time, he did a pretty good job of it, keeping her locked in the attic instead of in an asylum.It does give a lot more depth to his character - I'm going to have to re-read Jane Eyre!"},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"I was very happy with my purchase. They delivered quickly, and the item was in very good condition. I would buy from them again, for sure."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"Rhys' novel, the Wide Sargasso Sea is an interesting work, and listed at number 94 on the top 100 fictional works of the last century. In style, this novel is similar to some of Faulkner's work in that much of the text is extremely first-person. That is, Rhys gets so dialed-in to the character that the perception of events and interactions blurs and at times is hard to follow. Also, the first-person perspective shifts subtley from one character to the other. Much like Faulkner, the reader has to glean that the narration is from another character's perspective. As such, this is not a novel to breeze through, but rather one that you have to absorb. The words and the characters seem to sink in over time. It has an ephemeral quality that may have something to do with the Caribbean setting. The literatti love that Rhys took the character from Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, the \\"mad woman in the attic\\" and brought her to life. I, however, found that the strongest aspect of this work was the Faulkner-esque writing style, which transposed nicely with the Jamaican tropics. Rhys gives you a sense of life in the Caribbean, of its politics, its rhythyms, and its joys and despairs. The disjointed and transposed first-person perspective created an intense sense of the insanity of the woman against a backdrop of politics and socio-economic tension. The descent into madness of the main character, Annette Cosway, was confusing at times, but emblematic of Rhys' effort here. This is especially true at the end of the novel when the setting shifts to England and the once beautiful heiress has been transformed into the mad woman in the attic."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This book really gives you a different perspective on Jane Eyre, especially on Mr. Rochester and his mad wife.

Who has not wondered about the lunatic wife in &quot;Jane Eyre?!&quot; This book does a fair job at explaining the causes: an other worldly environment, an elusive husband -- both which contribute to Antoinette Cosway's/Berthe's (Mr. Rochester's wife) unraveling.If you have ever wondered why Mr. Rochester's wife ended up locked away in the attic, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Wide Sargasso Sea","review":"This is a fine novel indeed!Jean Rhys's prose is compelling, darkly powerful, and touched by the magical light of the Caribbean.

This is where he first introduces his world of wizards and magic (which you will recognize in Children of Rhatlan). Tamshi is a sorceress who has lost her memory and her imp familiar Blue. She soon realizes she has been worshipping an evil god. Tamshi can not trust anyone or anything. She feels she is being possessed and is fighting to find the truth.This book left me paralyzed up to the last pages. There's so many twists and turns, I am compelled to read it again and again. This is going to be one of my hardest reviews. Tamshi's Imp is so intense with one thing happening after another, I do not know how to start or how to explain without destroying the ending of this amazing story. Fate!!! That is the only way to explain it. I'm a high believer in everything happens for a reason. Tamshi is basically led through a twisted path to find out her past. Every turn she takes she is finding out something new, meeting someone who knows the \\"truth\\" or atleast can help guide her in the right direction. There is a lot of betrayal and evil, which makes it very confusing and hard for Tamshi to succeed in restoring her life. When reading this book pay close attention to it.

It is a deeply touching evocation of a long ago world as remote as Middle Earth or Narnia. The meaning of the title is not clear to me, whether it is Prue's deformity or the passionate devotion to materialism of her brother, but I rather lean to the latter, since his life is so utterly poisoned by his addiction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"Like a previous reviewer, Stella Gibbon's pastiche of the English rustic romance, 'Cold Comfort Farm' sprang to mind in the early stages of Mary Webb's 'Precious Bane'. But it must be borne in mind that Gibbon's book can be as easily read as a lampoon of the un-romantic no-nonsense 'bright young thing' of the twenties,as it can a pastiche of the English rustic romance. Furthermore,as I read on, this cynical thought was quickly replaced by a different one: that the book bears closer resemblence to Thomas Hardy than it does to Gibbons, or , for that matter, the works of the Brontes (the rustic romance as bestseller!)which may be hallmarks of style, but can hardly be read as sensitive examinations of the human condition. Webb writes from the heart. While the story is as romantic as a fairy tale, there is a subtltey in her writing, and a fatalistic view of the natural world that suggests a deep spirituality combined with mental resolve. The character of Gideon is comparable to Hardy's tragic figures such as Boldwood in 'Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; or the mayor of 'The Mayor of Casterbridge'. The fact that this book was written some eighty or ninety years ago by a woman, that its central character is a woman, and that the Webb chose to write using words and phrases of indigenous dialect has probably meant that it has been treated as a quaint piece of naive rural handicraft, rather than the deceptively careful literary construction that it is. If one of Hardy's characters had written a book, this is the book they would have written."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"I am a senior in high school. I read this book under reccomendation from both my father and sister. Precious Bane truly was a breathtaking story. It's a shame it's out of regular print; I think if more people knew about this book, it would be much more widely read. I reccomended it to all my friends in school, and we together convinced our English teacher to use it as material for the course. Unfortunatly we all might have to pay the hefty $14 price if the school won't pay for it! I was hoping to find some used or paperback editions but alas my search has been to no avail!"},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"This is an amazing book which should be read by all those who enjoy British literature. It is a touching, romantic story. The writing is sensual in that there are sounds, smells, sights, tastes and textures to be experienced in its textual descriptions. The natural setting almost becomes a \\"character\\" in and of itself because you could not take the story out of the beautiful, natural, country setting Webb creates.Look at other reviews to understand the plot. However, it truly doesn't make sense to try to recount it. Be patient when waiting for the \\"hook\\", when you won't be able to put the book down, it will come. Also, allow yourself a bit of time to learn to read and hear in your mind the syntax and sound of the words. Mary Webb takes you to a different place and time and you come to understand what it would be like for a young woman with intelligence, family devotion, character and longings who happened to be born with an external defect.May this book become one of your favorites as it has become one of mine. (If anyone knows how I might obtain a video/DVD of the Masterpiece Theatre version with Janet McTeer and Clive Owen, please let me know.)"},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"I first learned of Precious Bane when I saw the movie adaptation on Masterpiece Theater in 1989. It immediately became my all-time favorite story. After reading the book, which is even more satisfying than the wonderful movie, Mary Webb became my favorite author as well.Mary Webb was more than the consumate wordsmith, her character development makes one feel that Prue Sarn is a cherished friend. This story works on so many different levels that it is hard to catagorize. Yes, it is a romance, but it also is a fairytale. It contains beautifully detailed imagery of nature that is nearly scientific in its observation - yet is transcendingly lovely, poetical, prose. It is both tragedy and comedy. Webb employs allegory, theology, philosophy...her work is multifaceted, literary artistry.I give this book my highest recommendation for it is of inestimable value to the lover of literature!"},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"Once in awhile, you run across a book that's like coming home, that places you in a persona and setting that is hazily familiar. Mary Webb's Precious Bane does that for me. Set in rural England in the early 19th century, it tells the story of Prudence Sarn, a young woman whose mother encountered a hare while she was pregnant with Prue. The baby was born with a harelip.For those who knew her, it meant that Prue would never marry--what man, after all, would want to kiss her? For those who did not know her, it was an excuse to make up tales that she \\"roamed the country at night in the body of a hare\\" and that she could curse with a look. For Prue, it was reason to hide from the man she loved, the weaver Kester Woodseaves.Prue worked like a slave for her brother Gideon's dream of wealth and power in exchange for his promise of money to have her affliction cured when they were rich. But Prue took moments to appreciate the lilies on the lake's edge, the molting of the dragonflies, and the heady scent of apples in the attic where she retreated to write in her diary.Mary Webb (1881-1927) lived most of her life in Shropshire County, England, where she and her father wandered the hills and lanes, a pastime she continued after he died. Later, Webb--who was also a poet--enhanced her stories with the naturalism and mysticism she learned from her father and the land.Shropshire English is heavily influenced by the Welsh language, creating a lively and colorful dialect that Webb has distilled in her novels. It takes some getting used to, but once you catch the rhythm, it's hard to let go. Webb's prose will sing in your mind days after the book is closed.She also used local traditions such as telling the bees when someone has died, and the employment of a Sin Eater, who, for a fee, consumes the sins of the dead person in a glass of wine and a crust of bread. When Gideon's and Prue's father died, Gideon agreed to eat the sins of his father if his mother, who was upset because her husband \\"had died in his wrath, with all his sins upon him,\\" turned the farm over to him.But it was the people she met on her wanderings and trips to the market where she sold flowers and produce from her garden that proved Mary Webb's greatest resource. Her novels are enriched by minor characters like Isaiah in Seven for a Secret, who said little but \\"Ha!\\" That one syllable was enough to make him a wealthy farmer because people felt they had been found out and out of guilt gave him their best prices. Sarah, the housekeeper in The House in Dormer Forest, broke the favorite china and vases belonging to whomever she was angry with.Mary Webb's protagonists make her novels shine. Hazel Woodus in Gone to Earth seems more animal than human; she is as wild as her beloved Foxy. Deborah Arden, in The Golden Arrow, loves deeply and totally with all her soul. Robert Rideout, in Seven for a Secret, composes music and poetry while he herds sheep. Prudence Sarn is Webb's greatest achievement as she brings the reader to care passionately about Prue .The novelist was able to draw from within herself to create Prue Sarn because she suffered most of her life from the facial disfigurement brought on by Grave's Disease.Precious Bane is a masterpiece. Mary Webb's other novels do not reach that pinnacle--they are too didactic and sometimes simplistic, but they are well worth reading as they poetically explore love, passion, and social norms."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"I've just read Precious Bane and it was very moving.

Prue Sarn is not at all your typical wet 19th c heroine, she is intelligent, sensitive, and assertive (which is why she gets into trouble with the society of her day). The Precious Bane of the title is usually interpreted as being her hare lip, which is certainly a very prominent theme in the book, but it could also be interpreted as the money after her which her brother Gideon constantly strives, which causes so much misfortune. And the hero is really good too, an animal rights campaigner before his time."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"The story is this: A young woman, Prudence Sarn, is born with a harelip, which makes her subject to superstition and ridicule from the small-minded country folk who surround her in early 20th-centry Shropshire, England. Because of her deformity, Prue is told again and again that she will never marry; her brother, Gideon, more or less conscripts Prue into serving him on the family farm, telling her that if she follows his plan that she will at least have money and respectability someday. Prue follows along with this plan, envisioning the day that she will have enough money to make herself \\"beautiful as a fairy\\" - a dream that takes on concentrated exigency in Prue's mind when she falls in love with the handsome weaver Kester Woodseaves. Prue thinks that no man could ever love her as she is, \\"cursed and hare-shotten,\\" and when one tragedy after another strikes the Sarns, she wonders if true happiness will ever touch her life.It's rare that a book moves me to tears, but in the course of reading this novel I grew so attached to Prue that I felt as if she were speaking to me as a sister. The delicate, simple distinctions of this story ring true in every word; it was as though the secrets, disappointments, and beauties of the English country were visible in the spaces between words on the page. At first the language, written in vernacular of the time, was hard to read, but once I grew accustomed to it I was transported to a remote and seemingly miraculous place where Prue discovered and treasured profound beauty in unlikely places. The same can be said of discovering Prue herself, whose compassion, wit, love, and faithfulness shine in everything she does. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone - it is undoubtedly a story about love, but not in the conventional rom-com or Harlequin-paperback way that's so prevalent nowadays. This is a story about strength of spirit, about unconditional goodness in the face of cruelty, mockery, and calamity. If that's not a real \\"love story,\\" I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"I inherited a 1920's hardcover copy of this book when my Grandmother died- it had always been one of her favorite books. When I read it, I begin to see why. My Grandmother was a person whose spirituality was unconventional, and this is a theme that strongly runs through this book. Traditional Christianity is there, but so is ecstatic spirituality inspired and manifested by nature. She sees God in nature. There are many many beautiful passages where the heroine is literally transported spiritually by the slight of flowers, or the songs of birds. Traditional beliefs and local magic are explored in detail and with an amazing lack of Judgement ( folklorists take note), and the Wizard, though he is not expected to go to Heaven, is a friend to a poor disabled girl and teaches her many good things. Her struggle for a &quot;normal&quot; life with her disability, a hare-lip, is very touching and inspiring. The author also deals with bigotry, persecution and rejection of those who are different, and the difficult question of what truly manefests Goodness- is Goodness something people truly strive for, or do most people simply go through life follow social pressures? Is the Wizard, who reached out to Prue and helped her with and open heart, a &quot;better&quot; person then the hard hearted comformity driven Churchgoes who would not even allow the Wizard's ( staunchly Christian) wife to enter their homes, condeming her to a lonely life?There is Magic here, and unearthly beauty seen though the eyes of a sensative young girl, and what must have been a very different exploration of true human nature in those rigid times. A thoughtful, highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"This book tells the story of Prue Sarn, a wonderful woman who is born with a harelip. But as the saying goes, you can't judge a book by it's cover."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"A little forgotten treasure I added to my small collection. There is something uplifting in this strange version of romance. The descriptive paragraphs I usually skip over in other books seem to be the whole point in understanding Prue Sarn. I love the strange long gone culture and the too real darkness defeated. The outcome may seem simple but to me the characters and the writing are not.Additional note: If you are not a spiritual person this book may not touch you, I can't say for sure. It seems to have a quiet song."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"Precious Bane is one of those books that stays with you. I've reread it numerous times and thought of it frequently between. I don't know why it is not better known and used in literature studies.Being written in the dialect of its time and setting may make it less easily accessible than other novels but it takes only a little effort to sink into the world of Precious Bane. Somewhat like reading Jane Austin and as rewarding. The ending makes me cry with joy every time."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"This is one of those rare stories that seeps into your soul and leaves a lasting impression. The language itself, while a bit difficult at first becomes a song you want to sing and long to hear it spoken. The story, sometimes achingly sad and violent is ultimately triumphantly romantic - with a sequence of events that leaves the reader breathless and yearning for more. Shortly after reading Precious Bane, I was lucky enough to discover a small theatre group in Chicago performing the stage version. My husband and I were in a packed theatre of about 30 people, where I sat front and center with the actors not more than two feet in front of me. Knowing the story line as I did, I made a spectacle of myself sobbing through the second half of the play. I'm sure the actors were gratified that they had such a strong effect on their audience. Suffice it to say, no one who picks up this book will be disappointed, nor will they ever forget it."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"The Bluestocking Book Club recently read and reviewed this one. Having almost disappeared from the shelves, it was restored by a university prof. If you know anything about the iconoclastic images of flowers and nature, this book is a treasure.The book starts out hard to understand due to its use of idiom and dialect, but as in taking a trip to any foreign country, it gets easier to understand as one becomes familiar with the territory. We loved it"},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"Mary Webb transcends sentimentality in this charming novel of Shropshire life. The reader's spirit is elevated by the moving journey of Prue and Weaver, as they strive for survival admidst the suffocatingly superstitious &amp; weirdly fascinating world of their time. The book uses dialect and folklore to create a vividly poetic, and at times horrifying portrait of a society we can scarcely imagine at the end of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"Like a previous reviewer, Stella Gibbon's pastiche of the English rustic romance, 'Cold Comfort Farm' sprang to mind in the early stages of Mary Webb's 'Precious Bane'. But it must be borne in mind that Gibbon's book can be as easily read as a lampoon of the un-romantic no-nonsense 'bright young thing' of the twenties,as it can a pastiche of the English rustic romance. Furthermore,as I read on, this cynical thought was quickly replaced by a different one: that the book bears closer resemblence to Thomas Hardy than it does to Gibbons, or , for that matter, the works of the Brontes (the rustic romance as bestseller!)which may be hallmarks of style, but can hardly be read as sensitive examinations of the human condition. Webb writes from the heart. While the story is as romantic as a fairy tale, there is a subtltey in her writing, and a fatalistic view of the natural world that suggests a deep spirituality combined with mental resolve. The character of Gideon is comparable to Hardy's tragic figures such as Boldwood in 'Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; or the mayor of 'The Mayor of Casterbridge'. The fact that this book was written some eighty or ninety years ago by a woman, that its central character is a woman, and that the Webb chose to write using words and phrases of indigenous dialect has probably meant that it has been treated as a quaint piece of naive rural handicraft, rather than the deceptively careful literary construction that it is. If one of Hardy's characters had written a book, this is the book they would have written."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"My father, a literature loving book seller, offered his copy to me when I was about 13. In it I found my father's love for me, for I identified with Prue Sarn, not for her lip, but for other outward imperfections that I struggled with at that age. He told me, in Mary Webb's words, that I had beauty and value.I have re-read Precious Bane at least every 5 years for the forty+ I've lived since then. I agree with the first 3 reviews posted here. The others I have not yet read. The literary value of this rural classic is remarkable. But if you know a young girl who is struggling with her self image, reading Precious Bane should give her hope. It will tell her you care. Be sure to read it yourself first.I keep hoping PBS will release the 1989 production on DVD. I think it suffered from the book's small pool of readers and left it unappreciated."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"When I was a much younger person, a teenaged girl, my own mother told me about \\"Precious Bane\\" and that she had really enjoyed reading it.

The descriptive narrative takes on the visual artistry of a painting, while the rhythmic poetic style provides a dream like world of escapism. It has been years since I have read a book so beautifully intruging in its use of language. Yet the author's carefully constructed word imagery never interferes with her storytelling, it only enhances it. This is a book I did not want to put down, and when the book was done I found myself wanting to pick it up again. The read is so interesting because the setting of the novel is used to mirror that of its characters,decetpitively simple on the surface, intriguingly compelling upon examination.This is a novel that will lead you to look inward...if you are so inclined. This novel is beauty."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"My friend Mary Sue sent me Precious Bane when I was very ill, hoping it would get me reading again. She was right.The time of the tale is not clear. It was written in 1926 but has a Hardy-like tone which would place it in the mid-to-late 19th century. The location is Shropshire, England. You can reference a Shropshire word list on the Internet, but after a while I preferred to let the dialect flow over me and learn some of the meanngs the way we first learn a language.The premise is that it is customary in Shropshire to hire a sin-eater, usually someone poor, when someone dies, who will take over the sins of the dead person. The Sarn family is too poor even to do this when the father dies, so the son, Gideon, offers to be the sin-eater in return for taking ownership of the family farm. He works the farm with his sister Prue.The second plot is a love story. Prue is a woman with a hare lip, a beautiful body and character above reproach, who is struck by lightning with love when she first sees Kester, an itinerant weaver.Other scenes of interest take place during market which introduce various characters, reveal through gossip the attitudes about them and explain customs.I read that Precious Bane is tobacco, but it seemed rather to refer to foxglove, which takes an important turn in the plot.The writing is excellent. The characters are true. Some readers compared this book to Cold Comfort Farm. I have read Cold Comfort Farm, and although I enjoyed it didn't find it to be similar, as the heroine is a flapper in the 20's.The only thing that might have perfected the book would be to liken Gideon's sins specifically(he had many) to the sins of his father, which she didn't do. The lack of detail didn't seem to detract much, as the point was explained at the beginning.Thank you, Mary Sue."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"After finishing \\"Precious Bane\\" by Mary Webb, enjoying it thoroughly, and reflecting upon the story, I came to the obvious question many people ask after finishing a good book, \\"What was this all about?\\"Superficially, \\"Precious Bane\\" tells the story of Prudence Sarn, a poor young woman living during the late 18th century in England with her mother and brother on their farm. Prue was born with a cleft pallet and throughout the book struggles with her personal issues about her appearance and how other people outside of her countryside view her due to her \\"hare-shotten lip.\\" Prue enjoys the solitude and hard work on the farm, the interactions with her neighbors, The Beguildy's, and the rare trips to the market with her brother Gideon. Though Prue rarely deals with people outside of her family, she does find the opportunity to come into contact with the Beguildy family: Jancis, who is in love with Gideon, Missis Beguildy who befriends Prue when Jancis is sent away, and the Wizard Beguildy, who teaches Prue how to read and write. Additionally, Prudence occasionally has the opportunity to spend time with women from around town on Christmas and during the cakings. As well, for a great deal of the book, Prue talks about her love affair with the weaver Kester Woodseaves who she first met when he was called to weave the wedding linens for Jancis and Gideon, and who she eventually ends up marrying by the end of the book.The story is told through Prudence Sarn's eyes, as in the fashion of a diary or journal looking back on the events of about 10 years past. Over time, we see how Prue develops into a woman, doing manual labor on the farm, spinning, and spending time with other characters. She grows from one unaware of her appearance, to one suddenly embarrassed, and finally to one trusting of those who love her. The timelessness of this plot line, coupled with Mary Webb's writing style and dramatic emphasis on nature make \\"Precious Bane\\" a book worth reading."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"When I was a teenager, this was a book my mother recommended as one of the favorites from her youth.

It remains powerful, and beautiful, and romantic and, well, a treat that should be better known. Please, amazon--make this available as a freebie for kindle!"},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"For those who lament mankind's post-industrial lost link with nature and animal-kind, this book offers an extraordinarily lyrical and beautiful recreation of a bygone way of life in 19th century England.This book is a flawless masterpiece with not a false note in it. Mary Webb was a channel of genius here.As perfect love matches are said to be made in Heaven, this book must surely have had its artistic origins in Heaven as a perfect love story. It is what I would elevate to the category of poetry in prose, and is an enchanting first person narrative in the dialect of south Shropshire.For readers who can appreciate old-fashioned romantic attitudes about couples who finally find their \\"one true love,\\" this is the right book. Any woman waiting for her \\"lord\\" may find a gratifying experience in this tale at both mingled earthly and spiritual levels of perception. Not only will this book warm your heart, it will warm your deep soul.When Prue learns that she's loved by the man she's loved from afar but from whom she's hidden herself because of the ugly curse she bears (a hare-shotten lip), she tells how \\"....a glow began in my heart, warm and pleasant as a gledy fire. For what is there in this earth, or in Heaven if it comes to that, like the knowledge that you've found favor in the eyes of him that is your dear acquaintance, and the Maister?\\"How lovely for long-suffering Prue Sarn that she's able to write in the secret book of her tender but passionate heart, \\"The Maister be come.\\""},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"I was reccommended this book by a friend who also liked the British TV production of Precious Bane. The characters feel real, and you are hoping and praying that Prue will be rewarded for loving her family so well. She is nearly the only person in the story with no alterior motives for what she does. Though she WOULD like some money to fix her mouth when she works hard for her brother, she is basically working for him because she loves him and wants to see him succeed in what he wants most. Even as she labors so hard for that end, she appreciates the beauty around her, always thankful and thoughtful. Maybe that is what attracts the weaver...?Though this book is written in dialect, I think the story is well worth the extra thought it may take to understand it."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"In a time plaqued by superstitions of witches and evil, welearn that there is hope for all of us not-so-pretty girls."},{"Title":"Precious Bane","review":"Mary Webb was a prolific yet unsung novelist of the late 19th and early 20th century.

To tired urban readers of the late 1990s it will seem cliched - almost itself a pastiche of the genre. To me it is required reading, if only as a pre-cursor to the best pastiche of the rural romance ever written - Stella Gibbon's Cold Comfort Farm. (Aside - Why don't publishers think creatively sometimes and bind the pastiche along with the books being mocked? Northanger Abbey with Anne Radcliffe for example).

From other reviews I have come to understand that the hardcover or other versions of this novel comes with illustrations that are missing from this version.

Just like all of the other Agatha Christie novels I have read.\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" was Christie's first novel that introduced the character of Hercule Poirot. The novel is told in first person by Lieutenant Hastings which many fans of Christie will recognize as assisting Poirot in later novels.The novel is set in England during World War I at the home of a very wealthy widow, Emily Cavendish. Mrs. Cavendish an older woman marries a fairly younger man named Alfred Inglethorp. Emily's stepsons from her previous marriage, John and Lawrence Cavendish, all believe that Alfred is up to no good and taking advantage of Emily. Hastings is a friend of John's and goes to visit the family at Styles while recovering from being wounded. While there one of the servants quits due to her mistrust of Alfred. Shortly afterwards Emily is found dying in the middle of the night.Finding out what killed Emily Cavendish and who was behind it causes Hastings and others to come upon Poirot. Poirot a former Belgian police officer now residing in England as a refugee decides to help catch Emily's killer in order to thank her for her hospitality to all of the Belgians she has hosted during the war.Having Hastings narrate makes you feel all of the confusion and annoyance that he feels at Poirot. I was surprised to find that this case would lead to them both having a life long partnership with each other since Hastings shows dislike to Poirot in several instances.Several times I thought Hastings had solved the murder or at least knew who had done it but was found to not be the case when Poirot would point out several problems with his evidence.Eventually you will come to find out who murdered Emily Cavendish but after a long and merry chase.All in all a great read that will leave you wanting to read more about Hercule Poirot!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Story moves along with the usual \\"family\\" of suspects and local villagers to help solve the mystery.

Literally, images of clues (scribbles on paper, bits of burned documents, maps of the house) that should appear in the reading are absent. Some do not affect the storyline but others make it impossible to follow the conclusions of the characters because the reader is missing vital information. Aside from that, the pages look like simple bare internet printouts. If one cares little for aesthetics in his/her reading experience, this should not pose a problem. For others (myself included) it is a deterent to a truly enjoyable read. I suggest anyone seeking an inexpensive version of this book to choose the Barnes and Noble publication.

He is so dismissive of that 'funny little' Poirot, sure that the man is either crazy or absurd and equally sure that he himself will solve the crime.The mystery takes place at a country manor home that is complete with servants and where no one seems to have to work for a living--so very British! The murder suspect seems to be ironclad guilty but leave it to Poirot to find that sliver of doubt. There were so many red herrings in the book that I totally gave up on trying to solve the mystery. Poirot certainly does nothing to help, agreeing with every ridiculous notion that the narrator has and leaving the readers to wonder what solution is untangling in his genius brain or if he is indeed the nitwit the narrator makes him out to be.Still, I was shocked by the ending.

Since many summaries and evaluations of the written book have appeared, I will make no comment on the story save to echo the view that this is good Christie but only the beginning of the character she ultimately delineated more appealingly. Souchet's reading is excellent, of course, with adequate voice characterizations of the variety of different speaking roles in the text. Hastings, the narrator for the book, naturally, is the most defined. Souchet creates an appropriately young (he is supposed to be in his early twenties at this time) voice, naive, overconfident, assertive, bewildered, easily bruised, angry, humiliated, awed, puzzled, as he deals with the Old Man who often seems to him to be more of an early senile dementia case than the brilliant detective he had been. He manages this central voice quite well, as he does the men and women who make up the suspects and walk-ons customary in the Christie cast. Surprisingly, perhaps only because I was not reading the book, is what I see as a somewhat too flighty Poirot, not as weighty as in the TV productions (where he retains the Belgian excitability). At any rate, I found the voice less appealing than in the filmed versions.That is a minor point. Overall, there is a vivid portrait of the murder scene and the interactions comprising the plot to its denouement with the surprise solution offered to all the suspects gathered for that purpose in the murder house (but not Inspector Japp, who has strictly an \\"also with\\" role in the book.At the price being charged as of this date, the audio book is a bargain for those addicted to them as am I."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles: A Hercule Poirot by Agatha ChristieGreat eBook for Kindle!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"She didn't really have it together yet but after all it was her first novel! And as such it's pretty amazing how much Hercule Poirot is him glorious self already. pompous, witty, abrasive, yet kind and chivalrous especially to a \\"woman's secret heart,\\" for he goes to crazy lengths to ake things come out all right for two separate couples by the time STYLES is over.I just finished Gilbert Adair's abstruse takeoff on Agatha Christie, MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR OF STYLE, so I decided to go back to the real, original thing, see what I hadn't seen in years. I was surprised to find that, in the twenty years since I had read the book, very little of it had remained in my memory--outside of the central trick. In a way, the book is spoiled by an ugly racial remark thatv just seems to slip out of the lips of the one character in the book everyone loves, the faithful white servant \\"Dorcas.\\" It's not that Christie wants to characterize Dorcas as a prejudiced sort, but just take a look at page 137 and you'll get the shivers. It's rather odd in Christie, for often enough she lets her characters' racialized remarks tell against them, but here it's just the opposite and you can tell that Dorcas is supposed to be more cute after making it.What's hard to figure out is why, in CURTAIN, Christie decided to return to the scene of her first novel, for it doesn't really have as much weight as some of the country houses she describes elsewhere. Oh well, it must have been a sentimental mise en scene for her, the site of the meeting of Hastings and Poirot; the place where her first novel located itself, etc. CURTAIN is a book very few of us have ever been able to plumb to its depths--and I thought a reread of STYLES might help. No, but it's great fun all on its own, and the plot is so crazily complicated that it takes the final fifty pages to work out all the kinks and false solutions of the story, before Poirot finally shows what his \\"last link\\" has led him to.One more thing that was strange, how there are only 12 chapters in the book, of very uneven lengths--some a few pages only, some upwards of 30. I don't remember Christie ever returning to this noticeably choppy way of telling a story?"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was the first novel to introduce the great Hercule Poirot to the world. It also introduced Arthur Hastings, who appears in a number of other Poirot novels. The story begins with Hastings arriving at Styles Court to visit an old friend and his family. While he is at the estate, the Mistress of the house is killed. By a lucky coincidence, Poirot is in the nearby village and free to investigate the matter. The cast of suspects is largely drawn from the woman's family. Poirot interviews them all in his unique style and his little grey cells are put to the test as he attempts to untangle the mystery as many twists and turns ensue.Because this is the first Poirot novel, you might expect that it would be lacking compared to the later efforts. It is often the case that characters become better developed in later stories, for example. In this case, you will find a very typical Poirot novel, with no real evidence that Christie hadn't yet found his voice. His little witticisms and eccentricities are present, the upper class suspects, the relatively remote \\"bottle\\" location for the murder... all of these are typical elements in a Hercule Poirot novel and all are well executed. Once the story gets going, it moves along very well and the mystery certainly held my attention to the very end. The suspects were all pretty interesting and Poirot himself is pure gold. The only sour note for me was Hastings who is a bit too dense for my taste as well as being too pure of a Dr. Watson clone.Overall, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well worth reading. If it isn't the best Poirot story, it is still far from the worst. While I might recommend a first time Christie reader to look elsewhere (Death on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries), orEvil Under the Sun: A Hercule Poirot Mystery), this is definitely worth trying for those who have read several Poirot novels and are looking for their latest fix of the little Belgian."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"A woman goes into a seizure induced by strychnine in her coffee in the middle of the night. The only problem? Strychnine is extremly fast acting, and the woman drank her coffee more than three hours earlier. So thus, Hercule Poirot, the eccentric Belgian detective with little grey cells is on the case. Christie's first novel is good, although definitly not her best. It still has some serious flair, and the late Dame knew how to pull the wool over her reader's eyes. The dialouge has a few flaws, as does locations and enviroment, but the plot is air tight.

She is definitely the best mystery writer of all time."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"In 1920 Agatha Christie introduced a quirky little Belgian detective to the world in this book she wrote on a dare from her sister. The time is World War I and Poirot is one of a small group of Belgian refugees who has come to live in a rural English village. With his egg-shaped head and his well-groomed moustache, Poirot enters and soon becomes one of fiction's best-loved detectives. Also in this novel, the reader is introduced to his cohort, Captain Arthur Hastings, recovering from a war injury at the upper-class household known as Styles Court. The mistress of the manor is Emily Inglethorpe, an elderly woman who has just married a much younger man. The family members occupying the house all become suspects when Mrs. Inglethorpe is murdered and it is up to Poirot's little grey cells to sift through all the red herrings and, in the final chapter, reveal all in true detective fashion. High on Poirot's list of suspects are: John Cavendish, the elder stepson; Mary Cavendish, his wife; Lawrence Cavendish, the younger stepson; Evelyn Howard, Mrs. Inglethorpe's companion; Cynthia Murdoch, her protegee; and Dr. Bauerstein, a mysterious stranger who lives in Essex. All have motive and opportunity but only Poirot can discover the truth.This first novel sets the tone for many Christies to follow. The wealthy family inhabiting a country house, the non-violent method of murder (poisoning) so favored by Mrs. Christie, and the light-hearted but often serious romance all became hallmarks of many of her later works.Have a cup of hot chocolate with Poirot and enjoy the adventure."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"\\"Poirot was an extraordinary looking little man. He was hardly more than five feet, four inches, but carried himself with great dignity. His head was exactly the shape of an egg, and he always perched it a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.\\" I love the description of Poirot. This is the start of one of the best sets of mysteries ever made - the first appearance of the celebrated Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot.Poirot is interesting for many reasons, one of the first that he was a famous detective as a member of the Belgian police force. Due to WW I, Poirot has to move to England as a refugee, and remains. It's also the first appearance of Capt. Hastings, the sometimes narrator of the stories.Wonderful characters, great story. Easy 5 stars.This is the free Kindle version. A must get if you like mysteries."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This review applies only to the Kindle edition.There are illustrations which are essential to the plot and referenced in the text. They are missing from this edition. I had to find another copy in order to finish the book. Very disappointed in the lack of quality in this release."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is Poirot's first case and Christie's debut as a mystery writer. It is an auspicious start to a brilliant career for both the author and her creation. It's a bit over-ambitious; the young Christie was heavy-handed with the clues in this one, and while the ending is a surprise, the last section of the book is just a bit too long for the ending to have quite the impact that Christie would achieve in later works. This is perhaps the only Christie book about which one can say there are &quot;too many clues;&quot; it is nonetheless an astounding achievement for a first-time author. And, of course, any fan of Poirot will want to read the case that &quot;started it all.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I have always loved Christie's books for quick and fun entertainment. Although I used to own her entire published works in English, I lost my whole collection years ago to severe water damage. Recently, I was talked into buying a Kindle (reluctantly--I still like the heft, smell and feel of a paper book) and I was pleased to see this book was available at the best price ever: free.However, I was extremely annoyed when I discovered that there is no attempt to reproduce the many diagrams and pieces of evidence discussed in the book; in fact, there isn't even an acknowledgement that they are completely missing. The story will say something like, \\"Below is a diagram representing the layout of the house\\", and below there is absolutely nothing.It turns out that these diagrams are essential to understanding (or solving on your own) the pivotal murder in the story. For shame! This destroys what Christie has always been known for--being completely fair with clues so that the perceptive reader can often solve much of the mystery right along with Poirot."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Many have read Murder on the Orient Express and other classic Agatha Christie books. I probably read my first Christie book 25 years ago.But I had never heard of her first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, before spotting it in a library. This book is certainly not her best. But it is certainly worth reading. Interestingly, despite introducing her famous detective Hercule Poirot to the reader, she treats him as a person who people should know if they know anything about detectives, as someone with whom we are all acquainted already.The plot has all the hallmarks of Agatha's later works. A person dies. There are small assorted clues, but nothing like a smoking gun. There are people who hate the victim, and people who love them, but Christie manages to draw suspicion upon both sets of characters alike without making the plot seem forced. The intricate plan for the murder that eventually comes out is similarly within the realm of possibility.The only real problem I had was that when Poirot revealed the final clue, it was something none of us could have guessed beforehand. Still, this was a good first effort in a marvelous career for Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Readers everywhere are grateful to the sister of Agatha Christie for placing a bet with her, claiming that the woman that nowadays is known as the Queen of Mystery would not be able to write a good detective story. That is actually how this novel and the character of Hercule Poirot came into existence. In this first effort we can see the basic traits that later established Christie as one of the best mystery writers ever, though some of her technique is not yet completely polished. For example we get only a brief description of each of the characters, except for Poirot, so it is hard to picture some of them clearly. Nevertheless, the story deserves high praise, and I am pretty sure Agatha won the bet!The story is narrated by Hasting, who gets an invitation to spend some time in the country place of John Cavendish at Styles Court. Upon his arrival, Hasting notices that there is a certain level of tension in the family, since John's mother, Emily, has recently married a younger man, who the family considers to be a fortune hunter. Meanwhile, John and his brother Lawrance are having financial trouble, and a set of interesting characters surround Emily and have all kinds of suggesting exchanges with her. When the lady of the house is murdered it comes as no surprise. There is a main suspect, but also a myriad of possible candidates for the role of the killer.Luckily, Hasting runs into Poirot at the time of these events, and the small man with the peculiar moustache, who has retired from the Belgian police, is more than happy to help solve the baffling case. Those that have read other novels by Christie know that the author has an outstanding ability to mislead us into believing we have discovered the culprit, only to turn the tables on us and leave us dumbstruck. This case is no different...Ahhh, those little grey cells!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The novel itself is a classic and a masterpiece. That said, you should pony up for a better edition. Simply put, the novel includes several diagrams and reproductions of handwritten notes -which are not included in this Kindle edition. So, you pretty much have to get a copy of the physical book, or do without important clues to the solution of the mystery. I have read other Kindle books which include diagrams, drawings, etc., so it can easily be done. This particular publisher/editor didn't bother, and the result is a less-than-satisfactory reading experience. Five stars for the novel; 1 star for the Kindle edition."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Agatha Christie began her series of Hercule Poirot mysteries in 1920 with THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES. As the novel opens, it is 1917; the Great War is on, and Lieutenant Arthur Hastings, the novel's genial narrator, has been wounded. To recuperate he goes to the country estate of a friend, John Cavendish, who lives with his wife, Mary, his younger brother, Lawrence, and a girl, Cynthia, who is the ward of his stepmother, Emily Agnes Inglethorp, who owns the estate. Mrs. Inglethorp has recently married a man twenty years her junior, whom no one else in the household likes - least of all her paid companion, Evelyn Howard. Hastings' restful sojourn at Styles is interrupted when Mrs. Inglethorp is poisoned, in a classic locked-room scenario. Hastings then joins forces with Hercule Poirot, a Belgian refugee and former police inspector living in the village, to hunt down the murderer...and a partnership is born.The story's quaint country-house setting and its depiction of the beginnings of Poirot's English career are its most memorable features. The intricate murder-plot is great fun, and in developing it the author uses a technique for misleading the reader which she would repeat in later stories. I can't explain what the technique is without revealing the novel's ending, so I'll just say that THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES is a detective story that should prove just as enjoyable for longtime fans of the charming Poirot as for those new to the character and his creator, Agatha Christie. Also highly recommended, for those who have finished the novel: the superb made-for-TV version of THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES, starring David Suchet as Poirot and Hugh Fraser as Hastings, and available on DVD from Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I love Agatha Christie and this book is no exception. So if you are a fan of Christie defintely get this, because it's free! As far as formatting it is fine - except, as someone has mentioned, it is missing images. A few times the story will reference an attatched image that is missing. A bit annoying but didn't really affect the story for me."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This book written by Agatha Christie in 1920 is in the public domain and can be found for free on the web. At the moment I write this Amazon only offers paid versions of this book.This book is set in World War One in the UK. A Belgian police-officer, who found refuge in the UK, gets involved in trying to solve a murder. The Belgian is Hercule Poirot, and this book introduces him.This is a very fine murder-mystery and I do recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Christie does have a few diagrams in this book and they do not appear here. On the other hand, this Kindle book is free and a great pleasure to find at 12 midnight yesterday! It would be nice if someone did some diagrams of Christie's mysteries. The American editors added the character lists with descriptions, which was not done in the British versions, and they were a great help. Just a few thoughts. I gave this a 5 because it surely deserves it and Agatha is so underrated in the professional critical world as many best selling authors are. As one apt reviewer said, have a cup of coffee (and I would add, or an adult beverage) and enjoy. A tip of the hat to Amazon for providing this free Kindle. Thank you from all of us."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES by Agatha Christie.Christie's first novel written in 1916 during the First World War is also the novel that introduces the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. Because it is extremely easy to give the plot away in a Christie novel, all one will say is that when a mysterious affair takes place at a lonely mansion called Styles an army officer named Hastings calls in his friend Poirot, who is in a Belgian refugee home in Britain due to the German conquest of his country, to investigate.Christie's construction of the mystery is expert and shows right out of the gate, she had a flair for this type of thing. Her use of red herrings and misdirection is especially skillful and especially treacherous. Her handling of character--and not just the wonderful Poirot--is equally fine and insightful. This novel is not just a clever game but a genuine achievement that should fascinate on multiple levels.With the obsession with TEN LITTLE INDIANS, one is surprised that this novel has not received the same deserved attention. It is a great success. It is great fun. And it is greatly recommended."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This was the first book I read on the kindle by Agatha Christie. I really enjoyed it but it seems to be missing information that would help you to solve the mystery on your own. Poirot is a great character!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was not only the first Hercule Poirot book, but also the first book of Agatha Christie's career. Poirot arrives as a a refugee fleeing from the overthrow of his country during World War I. Doing so he arrives at Styles manor where he meets up with a few people he has met and would become a great part of his career in books, Arthur Hastings and Inspector Japp. While the story relies as much on method as motive and psychology (later psychology would play a larger part in solving a murder than clues...the Sherlock Holmes approach), it is still an excellent read. For any Poirot fans or those that think they may like mysteries, the Mysterious Affair at Styles is one for the bookshelf. As far as the book itself goes, the print is larger than some paperback editions and the pages are larger, making it easier to hold with one hand or set down on a table. It doesn't take as much effort to keep it completely open for reading near the spine."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I'm embarrassed to admit that, prior to reading this book, I had never read anything by Agatha Christie. Last week, PBS featured one of her books on their Masterpiece Mystery show, and I thought it was very well done. My interest was piqued as to whether the books were as good as the show. I decided to start with her very first book published, rather than start with a later book and run the risk of encountering spoilers. So, I requested The Mysterious Affair at Styles from my library, and hoped for the best.I was not disappointed! One big plus to The Mysterious Affair at Styles is that the culprit is not obvious. At the end of the book, I was just as surprised as the characters to learn who the murderer was, and what had happened. It was refreshing not to have it be predictable. I also like that the reader is given lots of clues along the way, to try and piece things together. The book moves quick enough that you don't get bored, yet provides plenty of details and complex characters. I definitely plan on reading more by Christie, if this book is any indication to what the rest of her mysteries are like."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"POIROT &amp; HASTINGS introduced to the world. Ms. Christies first novel reads wonderfully. I challange you to start it and try to get anything accomplished until you receive HERCULE POIROT's explantion on how his &quot;little gray cells&quot; deduced the &quot;Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot;. Absolutely charming period piece on top of a first-rate stumper."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"What can I say? Agatha Christie's first book is also one of her best (although she has done better). She has no holds barred when she twists the plot unmercifully so much that the truth behind the murder isn't apparent until the end. And all her twists are nicely put together and explained.A word of advice: take the first few chapters in slowly - Christie crams all her characters into these few chapters and if you don't pay attention you'll be totally lost."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"For anyone just starting to read mystery novels and particularly anyone who is new to Agatha Christie, I would highly recommend starting with this, the first Poirot mystery. Poirot has recently come to England as a WW1 war refugee. Shortly after his arrival, he encounters an old friend Captain Hastings, who serves as the perfect Watson to Poirot's Holmes. An old lady who had been of great help to Poirot is murdered and he feels an obligation to find her killer. A simple premise but Christie builds a wonderfully complex mystery upon it, with multiple suspects, several red herrings and a lot of atmosphere. The ending is a genuine shocker and the mystery is nicely interposed with comedic moments due to Captain Hastings' various observations about life and love, most of which show his intelligence to be decidedly inferior to that of his little Belgian friend! Definitely do not miss - you will thoroughly enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This book, the first of Christie's Poirot collection is truly an asset. The ending was so surprising that I'm sure it would have stumped everyone who read it..and it's not the &quot;most unlikely one&quot;, either, as tends to be Christie's usual. A well developed plot supports the vital characters in the novel. Perhaps this lacks the sophistication of Christie's later novels, but still a thoroughly enjoyable and thrilling read from start to finish."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Important illustrations that are central to the plot is missing from this edition making it very frustrating to read :-("},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I have not read this book. It contains drawings of floor plans, will fragments, etc that are relevant to the story. This version does NOT include these. So I'm sort of lost a few chapters into the book. You would be better off getting the paperback rather than the electronic version. I have asked for my money back or an exchange for a version that does have the drawings. I'm not optimistic about either happening. I really kind of surprised that Amazon would overlook this sort of thing. Very disappointed with my purchase at the moment."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is both the first novel for Agatha Christie and Hercule Poirot. As such, it is an excellent place to start for Christie's fiction. She was only 26 when she wrote it, but it certainly does not read like the work of an amateur.One of the pleasures of reading Christie's fiction is that it is like a time machine for traveling back to the upper class of England between the World Wars. Not that society was ever REALLY like this, but it is how that society saw itself. In the usual Christie fashion, a rich person is murdered in a small town. Hastings, the narrator, involves the retired Belgian detective, Hercules Poirot to help solve the case. As usual, everyone involved thinks that Poirot is an idiot, until he brings the noose around the murderer's neck.While this book may not qualify as \\"literary fiction,\\" it is an involving read. Mysteries are all about plots - not characters. In fact, if one knows too much about the characters, it may spoil the mystery. In this book, we witness the birth of a master plotter."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The famous first Hercule Poirot novel is in good Kindle format,BUT there are substantial spaces (linrs) between paragraphs. No typos."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"My word! It seems there are plenty of pseudo-intellectuals and masculinists hanging around waiting to insult Agatha Christie's books as \\"sentimental,\\" and \\"derivative,\\" and prescribe a Rex Stout novel as an antidote. I understand that to the millennial reader this, and much of Christie's other work will feel pat and formulaic. Before we debate how much of the work out there follows in her footsteps, leaving her the original, let's ask ourselves what's so terrible about a book that is familiar and warm.There is a special way Agatha Christie captures the past. One of the things I love about her books is the view of another era. In The Mysterious Affair at Styles, we are still in the midst of the Great War. Poirot asks Cynthia about her coffee, \\"No sugar? You abandon it in the war-time, eh?\\" All I've lived to see are the Gulf War and Iraq, and voluntary war conservation still seems terribly romantic to me.Over her fifty years of novel writing, we will see many things come to pass in the lives of the characters we love. Here, a young Hastings, whom we call Mr., not Captain yet, is only thirty, and has yet to meet his wife. He is simple, loyal, and a fool for a pretty girl (and, to him, nearly all girls are pretty); all things he will never quite shed, but that will develop nuance over time.People are very prone to criticizing British authors for their obsession with race and class, and Christie hasn't escaped those criticisms. Hercule Poirot is a comic foreigner, strange, fussy and effeminate. Um, and also smarter than everyone else. Although the modern interpretation of racism is strengthened by Christie's own admissions of not being so fond of his character, I remain uncertain, feeling this is in many ways a very anti-racist world Christie creates. Hastings, as a rough-and-ready man's man seems as much a joke.And here we are at Styles, where someday, ever so long from now, Poirot will solve his real last case in Curtain. In a world where everything is stuffed into two hour movies, and we've no sense of history, I find the relationship between these two men over fifty years very moving.In Styles, we have what has now become a classic mystery. Who poisoned the lady of the house, when each one wants her money more than the last - husband, stepsons, servants? Why doesn't anyone have any tears for a woman who supported them their entire lives? Evelyn, the assistant says \\"You know, Emily was a selfish old woman in her way. She was very generous, but she always wanted a return. She never let people forget what she had done for them - and, that way, she missed love.\\"It's not a bad debut."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I've been reading Agatha Christie books now for a few years, and oddly enough, I hadn't read the first in the Hercule Poirot series until a couple of months ago. Even though the Poirot books are my favorites, and I have already read Curtain (the last one in the series), I still hadn't read the first one!This first one gives you a taste of what Agatha Christie always delivers to her readers in terms of emotion and suspense. I've already read it twice, and I think I could read it forever (which is often not the case with mystery novels).A wonderful lazy summer day read!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is Agatha Christie's first book it is very interesting from the start.Just incase you have not read the book I will not tell you all about but, I will say this it is a very,very good book and I recomend it to any Agatha Christie fan and even if you have never read any of her books at least read this one."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is Christie's first book, and certainly one of her best! However, there are a LOT of characters to remember (Poiret, Alfred, etc.), so I would recommend the book to a friend who's alert, knows how to pay attention, and is open minded (you'll see what I mean). An excellent Christie, nonetheless."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I love mysteries! I'd read all types of Nancy Drew books and wanted more. So, I picked up The Mysterious Affair at Styles at the library, expecting a writing style similar to Carolyn Keene's. How wrong I was!

Even though it was Christie's first, it must be one of her best. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The first novel ever by the queen of mysteries is elegently done and contains a colorful and sort of exotic plot and characters, introducing her famous detective Poirot.

Her style and originality always catch my attention!I undoubtedly love her books and wish to read them all very soon!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This was a fun, page-turning little mystery, tightly plotted and filled with more jaw-dropping twists than many whodunits twice its length. Agatha Christie's first novel introduces her famous detective Hercule Poirot, he of the little black mustache and meticulous habits, who misses no clue and whose analytical brain races several steps ahead of everyone else (particularly his befuddled friend Hastings, who fancies himself a clever person, but is flummoxed by Poirot time and time again).Christie's deft handling of the plot left my head pleasantly spinning. Much of the fun of reading Christie comes from trying to spot all the important facts and keep up with Poirot's deductions. I had a couple of good hunches, but I'll admit, I did not guess the murderer's identity or anticipate the final twist.Dame Agatha must have had to sketch timelines of her novels in order to insert all the little clues in the right places and not to miss any during the d&eacute;nouement. In this first outing, I caught a few clues that were left unexplained and thought Christie's ambition might have outpaced her storytelling skills. However, my imagination filled in the gaps, and the omissions did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel.All in all, an enjoyable romp to spend the weekend with."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is Agatha Christie's first book and through the characters of Hercule Poirot and Hastings one can see how clever she is at weaving a story of suspense. I cannot give her more than three stars because I didn't think the other characters in this mystery were well developed. I would have liked more back story on the life and especially the love between the three main people. If you're looking for a light suspenseful story, Christie will fill that bill."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I have been reading Agatha Christie novels since I was a kid. This is the first of her many Hercule Poirot mystery stories. I wish I knew more about Poirot before she wrote her novels. But she takes the cake on character developments with the narrator writing in the first person after the \\"mysterious affair\\". She uses simple logic and hands on detective work to solve the crime, while keeping the reader hanging on to each word. Old English idioms are a kicker...it's interesting to know some phrases are coming back to me. Check out the book!! You won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I am always amazed at the characterizations in the writing of the early part of the 20th century. The character of Mr. Poirot and the use of first person in the novel pulls one into the story."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"First published in 1920 (though written a few years earlier), \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" isn't just Agatha Christie's first detective novel, but the book that introduced the world to Hercule Poirot. The result of a bet in which Christie vowed to write a mystery in which the reader would be presented with the same clues as the detective, \\"Styles\\" was to be the first in a long line of detective novels (about eighty) that spanned several decades, and kick-started Christie's reputation as the Queen of Crime. Though not Christie's best, and not necessarily the novel for a newcomer to start with, \\"Styles\\" is classic Christie. Narrated in first-person by Hastings (acting as a reader-proxy), the story includes what would become the staple ingredients of mystery: a country manor, an upper-class family, an exchange of wills, an array of suspects, red herrings, and the final twist in the tale.Captain Arthur Hasting is staying with his old school-friend John Cavendish and his extended family during the war. Mrs Inglethorp is the family matriarch, a somewhat domineering figure who controls the family fortune and the lives of those who live in the house. However, tragedy strikes when she dies in suspicious circumstances, and Hasting suggests bringing in a retired Belgian detective that he knows is lodging nearby in a refugee house. Hercule Poirot enters the scene, and at once takes control.Poirot is facetious, methodical and secretive, driving Hastings to despair many a time (it's the beginning of a beautiful friendship) as he carefully investigates the household and the strange circumstances that surround Mrs Inglethorp's death. Christie's love/hate relationship with her most famous detective is captured clearly in Hasting's voice: at the same time he's admiring of the little man, he can't help but be frustrated at his infuriating mannerisms and arrogance.Christie's prose is not as sophisticated as it would become in later books, being instead quite blunt and straightforward, but her gift at foreshadowing and hidden agendas is as strong here as it is in later years. Having read many of her later books, I was expecting to be able to figure out the culprit in what I assumed would be a \\"less polished\\" story. I didn't. \\"Styles\\" is just as ingenious as those that follow it."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Hercule Poirot is one of the most recognizable detectives around, and The Mysterious Affair at Styles is an excellent introduction to him. (Styles Court is revisited in Curtain, the last Poirot novel) Great beach reading, with a relative handful of characters, a number of them portrayed quite memorably.However, it mystifies me that they would omit the handful of illustrations for this Kindle edition. This is a public domain novel in the United States, thanks to its original publish date. It can be legally had for free, and there are other editions out there that do include these illustrations. Still, this edition gets you convenient delivery of an excellent book, and the illustrations omitted (so far I've noticed the lack of the floor plan and a scrap of handwriting, both referred to in the text) are not really that necessary to enjoying the plot - I just feel that it is wrong of them not to be up-front about the absence of these small things, though I note that they do not claim that this edition is unabridged."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"It's exciting to read the first published novel of the world's best selling author of all time. After readingThe Murder of Roger Ackroyd, I decided to read all of the Hercule Poirot mysteries, and this is a natural beginning. We meet the detective Poirot, a Belgian refugee in England, and his future traveling companion, Arthur Hastings.The powerful matron of a wealthy family is poisoned in her sleep! Whodunnit?I felt the book started a wee bit slow (as always with the first in a series, no?), but once the poisoning happened, it was difficult to put down. Perfect reading for a long flight to Brazil.Highly recommended as travel reading (or whenever else you may need a diversion). For the rest of my trip, I've broughtMurder on the Orient ExpressandHallowe'en Party. Poirot to the rescue![Note on content: No objectionable content, unless you count poisoning an elderly woman or the general idea of murder as entertainment.]"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Dame Agatha Christie introduces Hercule Poirot to the mystery novel loving public in this thriller set in WWI. Poirot and a group of fellow Belgians have resettled in an English village, after displacement from their homeland. Poirot has already retired from Belgian police work, speaking fondly of turn-of-the-century cases with friendly Scotland Yard detectives.This is a standard issue murder case with the ancient mansion dweller as the victim. She is recently remarried and has also recently broken with a long-time friend and companion. Filling out the list of suspects are two step-sons who would benefit financially from her demise and several house guests, including a young pharmacist and a German spy. Poirot is called in the day of the murder and follows his standard practice. He sends cryptic messages to suspects to gauge their response, tracks suspects across the county, and even does primitive forensic studies. The book is written by a resident wounded veteran who was a long-time friend of both Poirot and the family at Styles.There are two features here to recommend this book. The first is the mystery within the mystery structure in which the obvious suspect ultimately turns out to be the guilty one, albeit with an unexpected accomplice. The second is the deliberately researched poisoning mechanism employed. Dame Christie received a positive review in the 1920's from a leading British pharmacology journal for her efforts. For those who enjoy the complex, this book is wracked with it. It is nearly impossible to keep track of all the characters and their myriad interactions with Poirot and each other. Reading it the second time brought out a lot of foreshadowing and important facts, dropped into the text as minor details."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I have always enjoyed mystery books and surprisingly I liked this one as well. In the begining a man named Captain Hastings comes home from war. He meets an old friend named John Cavendish. John offers for Hastings to stay with him and Hastings delightedly accepts. Shortly after his arrival, John's mother, Emily Inglethorpe, is murdered by poison. Hastings hires a detective named Hercule Poirot. Throughout the book you wonder who the murderer is. There are a number of different suspects who all seem to have a pretty good motivation for killing her. There is John Cavendish, Mary Cavendish, Lawrence Cavendish, Alfred Inglethorpe, Evelyn Howard, Dorcas, and Cynthia Murdoch. I was in suspense through the entire book. The only thing that seemed to frustrate me about the mystery was the way Agatha Cristie would give you many clues leading you in the complete opposite direction everytime. Although, that is exactly what makes it a great mystery novel. I would highly recomend this novel. It will surely keep you on your toes!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Styles, the first Christie novel, introducing Hercule Poirot (and Captain Hastings and Inspector Japp), is one of the greatest debut novels of the mystery field. It heralded the start of the Golden Age of detective fiction. The book does not yet have the great, easy to read prose that would be a hallmark of the author in the years to come, but is near it. The very ingenious plot, the use of one of the great ploys of classical detective fiction, the various subplots, and the many sympathetic characters are all elements of Dame Agatha's later justly famous novels and are handled here very skilfully. It possibly deserves 4 stars for its &quot;standalone&quot; merits but the moment it arrived and its historical significance in the genre raise it to a 5. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"When Hastings goes to his friend's mother's home, he finds out that she has just married.

Hastings asks Poirot to take the case, and the rest as they say in America; is history!!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"A strangled cry from the bed startled me. A fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady. The convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold. Everything was confusion. We thronged around her, powerless to help or alleviate. A final convulsion lifted her from the bed, until she appeared to rest upon her head and heels, with her body in an extraordinary manner. In vain Mary and John tried to administer some brandy. The moments flew. Again the body arched itself in a peculiar fashion. At that moment, Dr. Bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the room. For one instant he stopped dead, staring at the figure in the bed, and, at the same instant, Mrs. Inglethorp cried out in a strangled voice, her eyes fixed on the doctor:\\"Alfred, Alfred-\\" Then she fell back motionless on the pillows.\\"Where was Mr. Inglethorp?\\" I thought.In the book \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles,\\" Hercule Poirot is examining a murder of an elderly woman at Styles Court. The woman, Mrs. Emily Inglethorp, has been poisoned with strychnine, a very deadly poison. The only question is, who did it? Throughout the book, Poirot is trying to figure that out. He examines Emily Inglethorp's bedroom, taking everything into notice... something even as small as a tiny scrap of cloth. Poirot also questions everyone in the house about the murder, matches handwriting samples, digs through old chests, and tries to put everybody's stories together so he can paint a picture of what happened that day. He also does a LOT of thinking. In the end, after many twists on who you think is the culprit, Poirot determines that Mrs. Inglthorp's husband and his cousin killed her. This is truly a good book. It is filled with a whodunit mystery, unique characters, and, above all, a storyline that kept you wanting to read.This book was a whodunit mystery, because the author keeps changing your mind on who you think the culprit is. First, it is thought that Mr. Inglethorp commits the crime, but then, the suspicions change to Doctor Bauerstein. It changes to John Cavendish and then to Mrs. Cavendish, but in the end, it is really Mr. Inglethorp and an accomplice.This book had unique characters all over it. Hercule Poirot was unique because he takes note of anything suspicious, doesn't immediately give away the culprit, and can make people talk and talk, sometimes making them change their story (which proves that they are lying). Mr. Inglethorp is very unique, because he is good at faking his feelings. He pretended to be so sad about his wife dying and he also pretended not to care about anything else. But that was all false... The last unique character is Lawrence Cavendish. He is sort of all over the place, in a sense, because he believes that the poison stuff is fake and he just has an odd personality. He is in love with Cynthia, but won't admit it, which is sort of strange, and he had touched a bottle of strychnine, which led him to be thought of the murderer (although his name was cleared).This storyline just kept you wanting to read and read. This was because the book is suspenseful, such as the part where everyone awoke the night Mrs. Inglethorp was dying and they couldn't get into her room. The book also kept the reader wondering about what would happen, which keeps your head all up inside of the book. Finally, the big thing that kept the reader hooked to the book, was because of the characters. We already know that they are unique, but also their arguments, personalities, and actions influence how much a reader would like to read.The reasons are clear why anyone would like to read \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles.\\" It was an engaging storyline, unique characters, and it is a whodunit mystery.-From the Desk of E.

The items available were not complete sets however. It appears the listing has been modified (which sellers can do after they list an item) and now only advertises one edition. I have bumped it up to 4 stars as a result.There are multiple listings for these books. I recommend buyers search on \\"Christie Mystery Collection Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" to examine them all.Original Review:(when this was for \\"whole collection\\"... left here in case it reverts to that again)The Agatha Christie Mystery Collection as published by Bantam roughly between 1983 - 1988 provided a fine collectible set from the best selling author. This series made an attractive addition to any fine library, with over 70 volumes. I am not sure how many were in the total set, I have 65 and have seen others reference 75 or 80. There were a couple short \\"bonus runs\\" several years later that added a few extra titles so it is hard to say what a total set really is.These are not currently available in (new) book stores and can only be found via used book stores, online, or private party sales as far as I know.The books were typically bound well, hardcover in a navy blue (almost black) faux leather padded cover with gilt imprint on the cover and title on the spine. The end pages (inside of the covers) had an attractive pattern, although some later editions had the pattern marred slightly by mass printing errors.This specific item listing is not anything like an official one (i.e. listing is NOT made by Amazon). Buyers should be aware that the sellers likely do not know what a \\"complete set\\" looks like (as little information on the whole collection seems to be available). I would advise contacting a seller and asking how many books, and which titles, are in the set they are advertising before buying. Especially if there are no details for their item under Comments. The image shown was likely only the FIRST item listed here and would not match anything currently listed.The books are fine, I am not reviewing the works of Agatha Christie either. The vagueness of this listing and the potential for the buyer not getting a \\"complete set\\" as advertised is what generates the low review.However, it is possible a seller could have a large collection of the books here for sale and that could be of interest to someone wanting a great looking set of matching Agatha Christie books for a display shelf or as the starting point for a collection.The books are available on Amazon individually also, usually listed as \\"Mystery Collection\\", \\"Bantam blue\\", or \\"leatherette\\" in the title.Be aware that many copies were purchased by libraries so conditions can vary greatly and buyers who are building a nice collection should exercise due diligence.

All of her trademarks are right here from the beginning in the character of Poirot and his brilliant gray matter and the delightful Hastings (before he become completely stuffy, as in the later books). There are red herrings aplenty and everyone seems to be up to something suspicious, much like one would want from an English country house. I have taken a summer vow to re-read all of the Poirot books that I read over the past four decades but this time to read them in the order they were written. The sole advantage of memory loss may be the ability to read these books again without a clue as to who did it. Maybe growing older will not be so bad. This book makes a perfect start to the series and to my summer. A bon-bon of Belgian chocolate."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Thirty-year old Mrs Agatha Christie turned a nice little profit with this, her first book, in 1920. It introduced Hercule Poirot. Wisely, she gave him many flamboyant, eccentric characteristics to leaven the depiction of detection work, but unwisely she created a character of advanced age that she subsequently needed to preserve for a further fifty years.What became the regular Christie recipe for a whodunit is found here. Perhaps there is a tad more reliance on the dispensing of medicines, reflecting the author's occupation during World War One. A formula that she later discarded was the use of a narrator - Hastings - who presents one of the \\"cases\\" of his friend Poirot. 1920 and the publication of this book marked the opening of the \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\". Expect that there are plenty of servants, plenty of drinks at bedtime, much making and re-making of wills, and characters - including Poirot - who walk everywhere.This rates highly in the Christie collection for classic charm, readability and ingenuity. Few of her books from the 1920s excel it."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Agatha Christie's sister once boasted to her that she had never read a mystery in which she didn't know right away who the killer was. Agatha answered her by writing her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles. It was quite a start to a brilliant literary career. The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well plotted and the characters are great to read about. Hercule Poirot and Hastings are really hilarious together. Poirot has to be the greatest crime-solver in literature. The entire cast of characters in this novel is interesting. This probably isn't Christie's best work (my favorite is The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) because her characteristic clean prose hadn't quite developed yet, but this is an extremely important work and is, like all of her books, entertaining. The literary critic Edmund Crispin summed Christie's work up best when he wrote: &quot;You know, relaxing with a Christie, that for an hour or two you can forget the authentic nastiness of life and submerge yourself in a world where, no matter how many murders take place, you are essentially in nevver-never land.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"due to ebook formatting issues, some pictures and passages are missing. specifically at the end of chapter 4, poirot finds a note that says \\"I am possessed, he is possessed.\\" it's confusing not to have the information, but if you don't want to search online to find the missing pieces, you can infer most of what is happening by how the characters react"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This version of the book is center-justified, making it very hard to see which lines of dialogue are spoken by which character.

When Hastings is offered to stay for the duration of his leave with the Cavendish family, he immediately takes up the offer. Arriving at Styles Court, instead of having a relaxing and pleasant stay, he gets involved in a murder! The victim is Emily Inglethorpe, mother of John Cavendish, murder by poison. It is then that Hastings brings in the famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, a refugee from his homeland. Will the detective be able to sort through the clues, use method and order, and exercise his 'little grey cells' to bring the killer to justice?This is truly one of Agatha Christie's best Poirot novel! My father, my sister, and I are the proud owners of almost all of Agatha Christie's mysteries. All of her books are just so enjoyable to read that the best atmosphere I recommend you read them in is when you're either curled up on the couch or relaxing on your bed. Very hard to put down, I can almost guarantee you won't take as long as a week to finish one book!The story and plot of \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is ingenious, with lots of clues, happenings, twists and turns which never seem to come together or make sense! Agatha Christie has that writing style where she seems to be giving you everything, all of the hints and clues, but at the same keeping you in the dark, guessing and suspecting but never actually knowing. Then she gives you a finale which just leaves thinking, \\"Of course! Absolutely brilliant! That's how it happened!\\"The character of Hercule Poirot has a personality all of his own. Yes, we have our Sherlock Holmes and other well known and well liked characters, but Hercule Poirot himself is a remarkable character. With his system of method and order, gathering all of the clues even the most significant ones, then putting them all together with the help of a little imagination, he is quite brilliant. Then there's Captain Hastings, so incredibly gullible that though at times you'd like to ask him whether he's keeping up with everything, you can't help but like him.Then there's the array of other characters for this mystery who all seem to have a motive for murder: John Cavendish, Mary Cavendish, Alfred Inglethorpe, Evelyn Howard, Lawrence Cavendish, Cynthia Murdoch, Dorcas, and more. Everyone is under suspicion, who do you think is the murderer?I recommend all of Hercule Poirot's mysteries. And besides Poirot, Agatha Christie has written stories on numerous other heroes and heroines, Miss Marple, Tommy and Tuppence, Parker Pine, and others. Other mystery writers whose work I enjoy reading are Lillian Jackson Braun and Dick Francis.Also, don't miss out on any of the TV series and movies of Hercule Poirot. Starring as Poirot is David Suchet, perfect in his role! Plus, the movie, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is on DVD!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is the first published book of Agatha Christie's and the first book where she introduces her well-known private detective Hercule Poirot.The fact that the book is Christie's first effort is apparent. It definitely lacks the finesse of her later works. The main thing that drags down this otherwise standard Christie story is the trial proceedings. It would have been wiser to edit out that part of the book altogether as it added very little to the investigation.However, the signature marks of Christie's books (that I personally enjoy so much) - the murder in a rich upper-class English home, family secrets, minute clues and a murderer you can never guess - are already present. Plus, the narrator of the book - Hastings - is a lovely storyteller - very straight-forward, albeit not too smart, funny, and always in search for the next girl to fall in love with. Reminded me of P.G. Wodehouse's Berty Wooster, actually.A nice book, not Christie's best, but enjoyable enough."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was the first novel to introduce the great Hercule Poirot to the world. It also introduced Arthur Hastings, who appears in a number of other Poirot novels. The story begins with Hastings arriving at Styles Court to visit an old friend and his family. While he is at the estate, the Mistress of the house is killed. By a lucky coincidence, Poirot is in the nearby village and free to investigate the matter. The cast of suspects is largely drawn from the woman's family. Poirot interviews them all in his unique style and his little grey cells are put to the test as he attempts to untangle the mystery as many twists and turns ensue.Because this is the first Poirot novel, you might expect that it would be lacking compared to the later efforts. It is often the case that characters become better developed in later stories, for example. In this case, you will find a very typical Poirot novel, with no real evidence that Christie hadn't yet found his voice. His little witticisms and eccentricities are present, the upper class suspects, the relatively remote \\"bottle\\" location for the murder... all of these are typical elements in a Hercule Poirot novel and all are well executed. Once the story gets going, it moves along very well and the mystery certainly held my attention to the very end. The suspects were all pretty interesting and Poirot himself is pure gold. The only sour note for me was Hastings who is a bit too dense for my taste as well as being too pure of a Dr. Watson clone.Overall, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is well worth reading. If it isn't the best Poirot story, it is still far from the worst. While I might recommend a first time Christie reader to look elsewhereDeath on the Nile: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Hercule Poirot Mysteries), orEvil Under the Sun: A Hercule Poirot Mystery, this is definitely worth trying for those who have read several Poirot novels and are looking for their latest fix of the little Belgian."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"In The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Poirot is at his most delightful, Hastings at his most cocky-turned-bumbling self, and the cast of characters the epitome of classic mystery.The Mysterious Affair at Styles also proves that Christie knew from the start what made a mystery shocking and complex. The plot structure is one of the more ingenious takes on mystery writing. It is only second to that which was used in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Endless Night.I can find nothing wrong with this book. This is certainly a very good example of Golden Age mystery, it virtually defines the term. A perfect example for those searching for Golden Age and all Christie/mystery lovers."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"For lovers of 'cozies', this first adventure of the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, is mother's milk. It is such an entertaining, such a comfy novel; that even though Agatha Christie has created others much bettter, one can still appreciate her masterful techniques from the very begginning.The place is Styles Court, a great English country house in the village of Styles-St.-Mary, in Essex. The victim, Emily A. Inglethorp, the matriarch of the Cavendish family who has recently re-married. The suspects? Well, there are many, but her infamous new husband, Alfred Inglethorp, heads the list. The story starts with a re-telling acccount given by Captain Arthur Hastings, an old friend of Poirot, who ultimately brings him into the case to elucidate the murderer. As soon as Hastings arrives at Styles, he clearly senses that not all is well. His old friend John Cavendish tells him he is in financial trouble. John's wife, who conveys to Hastings \\"the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilized body\\"; is entirely enigmatical. Emily's assistant, Evie, is a practical and matter-of-fact woman who \\"had a large sensible square body\\". Although we never really learn what such bodys look like, we can immediately picture them. Here, I find, lies one of the secrets of truly masterful character description. Even very early in the book, we come across the famous description of Poirot: \\"...hardly more than five feet, four inches...\\", with \\"the head exactly the shape of an egg\\", which \\"he always perched a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.\\" He was so incredibly neat that \\"a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.\\" The description of the characters is unique, and so is the great amount of interactivity among them. They are not a huge lot, but there's enough of them to give us a supply of good complications and 'red herrings': the sinister Mr. Inglethorp, the unimaginative John Cavendish and his perhaps too imaginative brother Lawrence, the servants, even the townsfolk. All the characters play their roles in due course, with none overshawing the others.This is a very complete novel and, as such, is also very graphic. There are at least five illustrations created by the author, among plans of the house and handwritten letters. The reader has - apparently - all the clues at hand. This was very common at the time, as well as the titling of each chapter. It all works to provide us with the whole picture. Poirot displays his wits to no end (with quite a bit of activity I must say that we don't find in later novels), and the story - typical of the rules of a good mystery for the 1920's - ends happily for everyone involved except, maybe for Hastings; who seems to be looking for a wife but has no luck in finding the right one. Ah! No problem, mon ami, perhaps in the next adventure?"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is the first appearance of Christie's brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, and his friend Captain Arthur Hastings. Like a good deal of Dame Agatha's work, it is as much a novel of manners as it is a mystery. The interaction of the egocentric Poirot and the highborn British residents at Styles is delightful, and the puzzle of the book is characteristically well done, and scrupulously fair. The only flaw in it lies in a purely ideosyncratic desire to have more exposition of the character of Poirot and less of the mechanics of the puzzle itself. All in all, a fine place to begin meeting Poirot and his grey cells."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles\\" was Agatha Christie's first mystery novel, in which she introduced her enigmatic and eccentric Belgium detective, Hercule Poirot. She often later lamented that she should have made Poirot younger to begin with as he was to be the star detective in many of her mysteries afterward. But her retired police officer began his magnificent orbit with this intriguing mystery full of the twists and turns that would soon become Christie's trademark.Wounded at the Western front, Captain Hastings is invalided home and has a chance encounter with his old friend John Cavendish. John invites him to his family's estate for a visit, which Hastings gladly accepts. But Styles, the family's home, is hardly full of happy characters. Both sons are disturbed by their stepmother's behavior - for she has married Alfred Inglethorp, a man twenty years younger than she. Almost everyone is convinced that he is solely after her money and when Mrs. Inglethorp dies suddenly one night of strychnine poisoning, her husband is the immediate suspect. But there are others within the household who would have benefitted from the old lady's death, especially when a fragment of a freshly written will is found burned in her bedchamber. Could someone within her own family have cleverly carried out her murder? Only Hercule Poirot can find all the missing pieces to solve this puzzler of a crime.Agatha Christie's name is forever cemented in the echelons of mystery writers, and with good reason. Her varied background helped to make her a near expert in matters of poisons, which have played an important role in many of her novels, and her travels to exotic locales have created heightened settings for some of her best mysteries. Her first novel must certainly have been a tough act to follow with its quick pace and plot twists; it fails only at times through its slightly weak narration by Captain Hastings. \\"The Mysterious Affair At Styles\\" introduced the world to Agatha Christie, and readers have never looked for better, returning time and again to each mystery she ingeniously crafted."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"\\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" can only be categorized as a classic among classics. In 1920, on the strength of a dare, Agatha Christie penned a cozy mystery that introduced a grateful reading world to Hercule Poirot and Arthur Hastings, the detective and sidekick duo who hold their place in literary fame alongside such luminaries as Holmes and Watson or Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe.Captain Arthur Hastings, a guest at Styles Court, the family manor of long-time friend John Cavendish, finds himself hip-deep in a locked room murder mystery when Cavendish's mother, Emily Inglethorpe, is found poisoned by strychnine inside her locked bedroom! Hastings, who fancies himself a competent amateur sleuth, suggests the Cavendish family engage his friend, Hercule Poirot, a recently retired Belgian detective of no small skill and reputation, to find the culprit. There is certainly no shortage of possible motives, clues and suspects - John and Lawrence Cavendish, the victim's sons who are suffering from pecuniary difficulty and constant financial embarrassment; Alfred Ingelthorpe, the blackguard, money-grubbing husband who stands to inherit the entire estate at the expense of the rest of the family; Evie Howard, Mrs Inglethorpe's companion and long-time family friend recently dismissed from the estate after a bitter argument with the matriarch over the intentions of her new husband; Cynthia Murdoch, the chemist with access to strychnine; or perhaps Dr Bauerstein, a renowned expert on poisons entangled in an affair with Mary Cavendish!A thoroughly enjoyable novel, easily read in a couple of sittings, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" introduced us to all the hallmarks of typical Poirot mysteries - the quirky, vain fastidiousness of the little Belgian detective and his love of method, order and the use of \\"the little gray cells\\"; the loyalty, charm, unfailing gentlemanly behaviour and decidedly humorous upper class character of the ex-military man, Hastings; the liberal sprinkling of clues and possible suspects; and, of course, the much-loved and often imitated stereotypical congregation of the entire cast in the single room climax in which Poirot outlines his deductions and reveals the culprit for the edification of all!If you've never read an Agatha Christie mystery, this would perhaps be THE place to start! If you've read her work before, then pick this one up again, re-read it and discover why you fell in love with Agatha Christie and Poirot in the first place.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is the first Christie and the first Hercule Poirot novel. The action opens with Hastings describing his first adventure with Poirot. They become involved in solving a death in a locked room with the most obvious suspect being the husband. Many twists and turns later Poirot prevails and justice is served.Hastings circumstances (invalid army officer alone in the world) are very like Dr. Watson. The relationship between Hastings and Poirot is similiar to Watson and Holmes in that Hastings is the bumbler, always leaping to the wrong conclusion while Poirot, like Holmes, drops little hints but by in large keeps his companion in the dark until the last minute.Christie began her pattern here of going against established mystery conventions (most obvious suspect being innocent) while playing fair, (all clues are fairly laid out for the reader). The trademark Christie twists and turns are here as well.This novel was originally published in 1920 and many of the details show its age. There are references to things that the modern reader will not be familiar and some comments are absolutely not politically correct but these do not detract from the story and in fact enforce the WWI English country house setting.This is a 'must read' for any Christie fan, and highly recommended for any fan of 'cozy' mysteries."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I hate to say anything disrespectful about the greatest mystery writer of all time, but to be quite honest, I found this book as somewhat of a let down. The first two I read, Murder on the Orient Express and And Then There Were None or Ten Little Indians, absolutely blew me a way. The mysterious affair at styles was nothing less than frustrating to read. All of the characters seem tainted and by the end of the novel, I didn't care who killed her as long as he/she suffered greatly. The plot was heavy and slow and the case was not only unsolvable from a reader's stand point, but a bit lagging and dull. I hate to be so cruel, but that's my honest opinion! I am glad that so many others have such nice things to say about the book!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Dear Barry R. L. Went \\"Spooky Epileptic\\":Why would you write a review of a mystery where you give away who-done-it? Who will be reading your review?

Why should I buy it now?I know my review is inappropriate (not being about the book, which I haven't read) and will be removed. But I really hope Amazon.com removes your review or at least the part where you describe who the killer is. What were you thinking?"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair At Styles is my first reading of an Agatha Christi book. I chose this one only because it was her first book and the initial introduction of Hercule Poirot. If I had to choose again, I would probably not choose this book as my first introduction to her, because her later works presented a much more refined and talented form of writing.This work, despite its presentation flaws, did establish Poirot as a detective to be admired and respected for his talents. It was for this reason that I never figured out why he would be associated with a character like Arthur Hastings, who appeared, in this book at least, to be little more than a stupid, ridiculous person, a dummy, and an idiot with an IQ that would barely match the low end of normal. I ended the book with the distinct hope that Ms. Christi would kill that character off.One of the other things I found difficult with this work was that it presented too many clues and overwhelmed the reader with so much information that it was difficult to follow some of it. Even so, I found that I was pretty close to the correct solution in the end, though not completely dead on and not for the right reason. Maybe my intuition was working.Since I am reviewing the Kindle edition of this book, I should take the time to point out that the conversion to digital format was very well done. There were no misspelled words or words that were run together. The one thing that was missing, however, were the sketches or pictures that were referenced in the story. While an annoyance, this was not a big problem as they were not really necessary to understanding what was happening.All of that said, I feel no particular need to review the story line itself, because I don't want to take away the pleasure of reading the book for yourself. Suffice it to say that the murder is done, the clues are presented, the possible suspects are many, and poirot gets his killer. It is for you now to see if you can solve the case along with him. While you are doing that, I will see if I can find another of Ms. Christi's works to enjoy."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The first \\"grownup\\" novels I recall reading were those of Agatha Christie and P.G. Wodehouse, and while I periodically return to Wodehouse with great enjoyment, I haven't revisited the Christie books until now. I figured this, her first published work (written in 1916, published in 1920), would be a good starting place. As well as being her first work, it introduces my favorite of her recurring characters, the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot.To my surprise, the story takes place during WWI (not after, as many suppose), a detail that plays a minor role in the story. The story is told by Poirot's occasional sidekick (he only appear in eight of the Poirot novels) Captain Hastings, who has been invalided home for the duration of the war. The specifics of his injury aren't explained, but he has gone to the Essex countryside to spend some time at a friend's family mansion (the Styles of the title). Things there prove to be rather tense, as the elderly matriarch has married a much younger man, whom everyone suspects of being a golddigger. Meanwhile, Hastings' friend and his brother are in tenuous financial circumstances due to the provisions of their dead father's will. Of course, the old lady ends up dead, and there are plenty of suspects to go around.Fortuitously, Hastings runs into Poirot in the local village, where Poirot and some fellow Belgians are living as refugees from the war. The two had apparently met years before, and soon Hastings has enlisted him to investigate the old woman's death. Found dead in her locked room, she appears to have been poisoned, but by whom and how is a mystery. Clues abound (as do plenty of red herrings) in the somewhat complicated story, which finds Poirot already in full form. Alas, he is the only fully developed and lively character to be found, with Hastings already his usual naive sappy self, and none of the rest of cast particularly memorable. As a story, it's somewhat clunky, although all the elements that made Poirot such a popular character are there in abundance (except his mustache mania). Not a great read, but not a bad one either."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I went back to this book, re-read it and enjoyed it again. The writing, the characters, and the solution are what make this mystery a classic. I have not read all of Christie's work, and I don't know if I ever will, but being reintroduced to Poirot was a pleasure. His busy mind, his decisive judgments and his meticulous nature make this diminutive Belgium interesting to know. Solid armchair mysteries are difficult to find especially since this book is THE standard."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I've always preferred Agatha Christie's early mysteries to those published late in her life. Somehow the most recent works feel cranked out rather than thought out.&quot;Styles&quot; reeks with atmosphere, and the characters, stock though they may be, are quite good. The English country house, locked room murder tale has been overdone a bit (I eschew hyperbole), but it seems fresh-born here. Perhaps it is because this is the author's first-born mystery novel and she cared about what she was doing.Other reviewers have described the actual plot, so I will not repeat that. Suffice it to say that the plot works, and the surprises are indeed unexpected. The logic and denouement are fair to the reader. The plot doesn't have to be perfect. It just has to...&quot;work,&quot; for lack of a better verb. Mystery readers, often without knowing it, read this genre not for the ingenious plot but for the feel of place and for the characters. If feel and characters are your thing, you can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"As all ways Agatha Christie comes up with a crime that all ways has you guessing for a free book its a great read."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is a classic mystery with clues throughout that we're just not smart enough to put together, but Hercule Poirot certainly can! As a huge fan of David Suchet's portrayal of Poirot, I can hear his voice as I read Agatha Christie's first Poirot mystery.It's such an easy and entertaining read. You'd better keep up with the characters and their comings and goings if you hope to have a chance of solving the mystery.Loved reading this on my Kindle!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"You can't go wrong with Agatha. Yes the situations and locations are a little dated, perhaps, those little things are overcome with a well-written story, a chance to let your brain actually process tidbits of information (clues) and see if you are smart as the indomitable little Mr. Hercule Poirot."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Not that Agatha Christie was a great writer, but she was typically readable, and even if the plots weren't totally predictable, the shtik was.

Unable to determine who the culprit is until the end of the book."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"It is always odd to look back at beginnings. No one, surely not Agatha Christie herslf, could have guessed what a long run Hercules Poirot would have. He was already of a certain age when he took the stage in The Mysterious Affair at Styles.When she wrote this book Christie was still acquiring her voice and her main characters, Hastings and Poirot had not yet developed into the full formed personages they were to become.Nonetheless, The Mysterious affairs at Styles would be a perfect introduction to someone about to embark upon The cannon of A. Christie and it is a treat to go back and read it again now that I have read all that I can find of her work. Christie was my light reading while completing my M.A. and remains a fond favourite. Not all of Christie's books are great tales. This one is. See also my comments on The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.N.B. I want to make it clear that I am commenting on the story, not the binding or production values of this edition."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I am not sure if I downloaded this or another Kindle edition, but my version was missing a few maps/plans and reproductions of letters. However, I am not sure if it had any bearing on my ability to identify the murder - I got the right answer, but it was more an instinctive guess than a logical deduction. My little grey cells are obviously not up to the standard of Poirot (although they are arguably no worse than those of the narrator Hastings). This book is quite literally vintage Agatha Christie - her first published novel ever - so if you have read any of her other books, but somehow missed this one, then you will know exactly what you can expect - a limited number of possible suspects, each of whom could be the villain until you assemble the clues and dismiss a few red herrings. Christie defined the genre, and this book defined Christie. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I read this specific work because I am one those people who, when approaching a new series, likes to start at the first work and continue chronologically. This old-fashioned mystery is a good one for those looking for an alternative to the Sherlock Holmes stories: goes just as well with a blanket and tea on a rainy day, but not quite as stuffy. Avid mystery readers may find the pace to be glacial compared to the more complex works that are standard now, but I really avoided focusing too much on the plot and getting more absorbed in the language and descriptions of the surroundings of the time. The book is fairly short and straight-forward -save the heavy-duty analyzing for loftier books. I look forward to Christie's other works!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This was a very enjoyable read.

Both are grown up now, but are still living with her.Lawrence is the younger son, is somewhat taciturn, remains single, and once was a student of medicine ...John seems unimaginative, is unhappy about the size of his allowance, and is married to Mary. Unfortunately, their marriage is showing signs of fracture - Mary has been spending a lot of time with that mysterious doctor Bauerstein who specializes in poisons ...Emily is quiet fond of Cynthia: her protegee. Cynthia was a poor orphan, but now she is all grown up and works as a nurse in a dispensary which is well stocked with poisons ...And then there is Evelyn - Emily took her on to do odd jobs. Much to Emily's annoyance, Evelyn begins filling her ear with poisonous talk about her husband's trysts ...And lastly, there is Mr. Hastings. He is taking advantage of his convalesce from the war to visit his old friend John. Luckily, he had arrived just in time for Emily's big charity event for the war. For the affair, Emily had invited a group of Belgian refugees to attend. As it often happens in life, one of Hastings' dear old friends - whom he hadn't seen in years - M.

The detective works with his friend Hastings, who is staying at Styles, and he methodically interviews each person in the house to ascertain the identity of the killer. Poirot pays fastidious attention to every detail and painstakingly pieces together a solution, much to the consternation of Hastings, who is more impulsive and emotional when trying to solve a crime.

There are about 80 titles in the entire collection."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles is not nearly as mysterious as many of Christie's later works. Indeed it is a rather ponderous start. That it was written nearly a century ago is pretty clear. The language is clunky and dated--annoyingly so. People don't fall, they come a cropper. Headaches are \\"beastly\\" and people wonder \\"wither he goes.\\" Her matter-of-fact, casual racism and anti-semitism, commonplace for the time, are still rather appalling.Add to the arcane language some equally clunky characterizations and scenes. Hastings, Poirot's later friend and associate starts off as a bit of a dolt--a ten year old could have come to more sophisticated conclusions. If Christie thought he would provide comic relief, she miscalculated--he's annoying.And whole sections could be excised. I always thought Christie's habit of gathering everyone in the drawing room to expose the killer was hackneyed, however it is absolutely riveting compared to her courtroom \\"drama\\" scenes. Talk about a snoozer. You could cut 50 pages and condense them to five.Part of the good news is there are glimmers of what's to come. One can't help but smile when Monsieur Poirot's \\"little grey cells\\" get going. Or when Hastings inadvertently says something that turns the lightbulb on for Poirot. The rest of the good news is that having written more than 100 books, it will be a long long time before any fan has to read this one. By all means, save it for last."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"i m a 15 year old girl .i own 22 books of agatha christie including mysterious affair at styles and murder on the links which were her first and second books of hercule poirot.in this book agatha christie has taken every reader by the nose and leaded right to the wrong track.everypage is fascinating once u start reading it u cant put the book down."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This book set the standard for all classics to come by A.C. and even her successors of the genre.In TMAAS, to say that the plot was a brilliant concoction of A.C. would be a severe understatement. I'm obviously a fan of A.C., but I'm even a bigger fan of the classic style evident in this book:The confined setting, the uncomlicated, yet tightly woven plot, the intimacies amongst the suspects, and an almost invisible veil of pressure for the crime solver to expose the culprit. A.C. served up heaping helpings of this and then some. I'd be redundant if I replicated the description of the plot, but I will say that the formula would not be unfamiliar to the common reader: The weatlhy heiress is murdered, the would be benefactors of her inheritance become the obvious suspects, and the sleuth steals the show to tell whodunit.The only reservation I had was that A.C.'s prose could have been a bit less heavy-handed. The dated English vernacular was a bit much at times. Also,there were a few severely politically incorrect references made that could possibly dissuade a sensitive reader (keep in mind that the book was written in 1910 and pub'd in 1920),however, the die-hards of mystery/A.C. will take them w/ a grain of salt.I highly recommend this book to readers who've never read A.C. before. In doing so, the reader will kill two birds w/ one stone:They will read the 1st book ever written by A.C.(introducing the extraordinary Hercule Poirot),and experience the phenomenal and undisputed A.C. style that has become one of America's favorite age old pleasures."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"For lovers of 'cozies', this first adventure of the famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, is mother's milk. It is such an entertaining, such a comfy novel; that even though Agatha Christie has created others much bettter, one can still appreciate her masterful techniques from the very begginning.The place is Styles Court, a great English country house in the village of Styles-St.-Mary, in Essex. The victim, Emily A. Inglethorp, the matriarch of the Cavendish family who has recently re-married. The suspects? Well, there are many, but her infamous new husband, Alfred Inglethorp, heads the list. The story starts with a re-telling acccount given by Captain Arthur Hastings, an old friend of Poirot, who ultimately brings him into the case to elucidate the murderer. As soon as Hastings arrives at Styles, he clearly senses that not all is well. His old friend John Cavendish tells him he is in financial trouble. John's wife, who conveys to Hastings \\"the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilized body\\"; is entirely enigmatical. Emily's assistant, Evie, is a practical and matter-of-fact woman who \\"had a large sensible square body\\". Although we never really learn what such bodys look like, we can immediately picture them. Here, I find, lies one of the secrets of truly masterful character description. Even very early in the book, we come across the famous description of Poirot: \\"...hardly more than five feet, four inches...\\", with \\"the head exactly the shape of an egg\\", which \\"he always perched a little on one side. His moustache was very stiff and military.\\" He was so incredibly neat that \\"a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound.\\" The description of the characters is unique, and so is the great amount of interactivity among them. They are not a huge lot, but there's enough of them to give us a supply of good complications and 'red herrings': the sinister Mr. Inglethorp, the unimaginative John Cavendish and his perhaps too imaginative brother Lawrence, the servants, even the townsfolk. All the characters play their roles in due course, with none overshawing the others.This is a very complete novel and, as such, is also very graphic. There are at least five illustrations created by the author, among plans of the house and handwritten letters. The reader has - apparently - all the clues at hand. This was very common at the time, as well as the titling of each chapter. It all works to provide us with the whole picture. Poirot displays his wits to no end (with quite a bit of activity I must say that we don't find in later novels), and the story - typical of the rules of a good mystery for the 1920's - ends happily for everyone involved except, maybe for Hastings; who seems to be looking for a wife but has no luck in finding the right one. Ah! No problem, mon ami, perhaps in the next adventure?"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This was the first Agatha Christie book I ever read! I have read most of her books, but this remains my favorite one of all time! Excellent! You must read it!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"For those of you like me, a person who has read almost all of Christie's work and just now turning to the book that started it all, you will feel a sort of nostalgia. Poirot is at his most delightful in this book, Hastings at his most cocky-turned-bumbling self, and the cast of characters the epitome of classic mystery.The Mysterious Affair also proves that Christie knew from the start what made a mystery shocking and complex. The plot structure, one that has been used in at least one other book, is one of the more ingenious takes on mystery writing. It is only second to that which was used in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Endless Night.I can find nothing wrong with this book. While not the best out of her work, this is certainly a very good example of Golden Age mystery--it virtually defines the term. A perfect example for those searching for Golden Age and all Christie/mystery lovers."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The novel Mysterious Affair at Styles: A Hercule Poirot Mystery by Agatha Christie is the perfect staring point for any fan of the mystery/thriller genre.

Within a night of his arrival, the matriarch of the family is dead, locked in her room. Arsenic poisoning is determined to be the cause. But, was she murdered? And if so, which of the many people who inhabit the estate is the guilty party? Her thoroughly hated second husband? Her spendthrift step-son? Her niece, a nurse with access to all manner of poisons? While Hastings considers himself an amateur sleuth, he soon learns that one Hercule Poirot, formerly a detective in Belgium, has taken refuge down the road. Poirot, one of the most gifted minds in the amateur detective business, takes on \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles.\\"So begins Agatha Christie's first novel. This is the second of her novels I have read, the first being \\"And Then There Were None.\\" Since I've read only two, it's hard not to compare them, even if it's unfair to do so. \\"And Then There Were None\\" was written many years and many books after \\"Mysterious Affair,\\" so it is naturally a more polished and confident book.This isn't to say \\"Mysterious Affair\\" is a bad book. It's not. It is actually quite enjoyable. The mystery is compelling, as there are so many suspects, all of whom have any number of motives. As suspects are eliminated for their alibis or lack of evidence, Poirot and Hastings find themselves faced with choices that make very little sense, or are flat-out impossible. However, Christie never writes the proceedings in a way that makes the reader feel the sense of urgency the characters feel. The mystery is intriguing, but there isn't any sense of danger to the well-being of Poirot or Hastings.Poirot and Hastings as characters happily make a huge difference. In a way, it's their rather flawed natures that make them enjoyable. Hastings, quite vain about his abilities, is actually rather obtuse when it comes to actual sleuthing. In contrast, Poirot is extremely capable, and never lets the readers or the characters in the book forget how gifted his \\"little grey cells\\" truly are. Granted, Poirot if legitimately gifted. He just isn't always easily suffered.While not a \\"gripping\\" or \\"suspenseful\\" read, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is an entertaining one.

This is not the best edition; however, the book itself is rightly considered a classic, as the retired Belgian police detective appears for the first time. The book was written because Agatha Christie read a detective novel she considered inferior, and said, \\"I can write a better one myself.\\" A relative challenged her to do so, and she did. The rest is literary history.The most important plot elements involve a hospital dispensing area, in which Christie worked as a volunteer during World War I. The inside glimpse would be unforgettable, even if it weren't part of an unforgettable novel. Fittingly, for the final Poirot novel both Poirot and Hastings return to Styles, which is now a guest house. Christie wrote both the last Poirot novel and the last Miss Marple novel long before her death, and stashed them in a safe deposit box to appear posthumously. She then proceeded to write many more novels in both series, so when the final novels appear they seem somewhat dated in terms of their publishing dates. But it was thoughtful of her to do it that way, as she provided closure to both series."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"I have read many Agatha Christie novels since I was a teenager, there is something charming and intelligent and witty about them, with this novel I finally got to read the one that started it all. Book one was actually quite good, I was entranced the whole time I was reading it, the story appears to be quite simple and the obvious is suddenly questioned, the suspect count rises and the real murderer slithers unnoticed, that is until the little Belgian super hero, Hercule Poirot gets involved. Invited by his friend Hastings, he's joined at the great mansion at the Styles Court where Emily Inglethorp runs the house, along with her new husband and her friends and relatives she lives of the riches her deceased husband has left her. On what seems a random evening she suffers horribly and ends up dead, with her current will in question and some strange things happening between the quests and the family members, there is sudden distrust of some of the members, but those who seem guilty and those are actually guilty are two different things, it's up to Poirot to stretch his little legs and big brain and get to the bottom of things. There is greed and jealousy and hidden feelings that surface only to explode in everyone's face, the fun has began!The book was a lot of fun, not only is it a fast and captivating read, it makes the reader think quite a bit. I took my time reading it and loosely going over the clues in my head. Upon reading the ending I was off in my decision of the guilty suspect but never the less I loved the ending and the final explanation, some clues might not be as crystal clear as others but there are many of them; reading is fun when the field is wide, not when it's thin and obstructed by lack of ideas and this novel certainly had me guessing all over the place. Agatha Christie is one of my favorite authors because every time I read her books I feel a jolt of joy, I get so much out of them and nothing written in these days will ever compare, so to me they are relics from the past that shine even brighter than many brand new books written these days. The mystery is fun but the whole feel of this book is even better, the old fashioned ideas and culture adds something whimsical to all of her works. Every time I pick up a Hercule Poirot novel I know I will have a nice time, so far I haven't been disappointed as I have read them half my life and will continue to do so. Currently I had to start book number two in the series, I am on such a happy high from the first one that my thirst for mystery hasn't been quenched yet, so I'm off to read \\"Murder on the links\\" and see where the adventure takes me, from what I head it's Paris and the crime is quite good..- Kasia S."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Agatha Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles (Hercule Poirot Mysteries) by Agatha ChristieThe Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's first mystery novel, introduced Belgian detective Hercules Poirot to what has grown to be legions of readers in the intervening years since its publication in 1920. Poirot springs onto the pages fully formed. The retired Belgian police detective is quirky, not to say eccentric, but brilliant. He is that \\"odd little man\\" who uses \\"the little gray cells\\" to solve cunningly hidden crimes.Christie's typically complicated plot keeps the reader guessing along with Poirot's friend and narrator Lieutenant Hastings. Clue after clue leads us down one blind alley after another. Reading tip: If Hastings thinks he has figured something out, you can be sure he has it backwards. Christie adheres to this rule without exception - almost.By the way, I highly recommend the TV series in which David Suchet captures Hercules Poirot perfectly For example: (Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection). Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov have also given entertaining portrayals. Christie's Miss Marple, on the other hand, has been tackled by numerous actresses, but none has succeeded like Suchet has with Poirot. My favorite Marple is Margaret Rutherford who played the role in four movies made in the 1960s (The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop / Murder Ahoy / Murder Most Foul / Murder She Said)).The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a delightfully entertaining mystery and a \`must read' for any fan of the mystery genre. Christie's books, while they give a peak at sordid doings, are reliably comfortable and satisfying reads and as far from unsettling or noirish as one can imagine."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"A complete set of the Agatha Christie Mystery Collection is 88 books. However, 14 alternate titles to some of the books in the collection were also published, making a \\"complete\\" set 102 books. And some books were republished late in the series by other publishers. If you collected every single variation of the books, there are about 125 books in the set, although most people probably consider 88 or 102 to be a complete collection."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Hastings calls upon his old friend Hercule Poirot to help solve the murder of another friend's mother. As other reviewers have noted, this is Dame Agatha's first book, and her style isn't as it is in her later books, but it is utterly delightful and full of surprising turns. Hastings and Poirot together are an entertaining duo, and quite the reason for reading this mystery, aside from the fascinating mystery itself."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The narrator, a military man recently wounded in battle and invalided home, runs into an old friend. This chance meeting leads to an unlikely collaboration with an eccentric detective. The crime is murder by poisoning, and in the end, the poisoner is brought to justice. No, this is not &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; by Arthur Conan Doyle, and the narrator and detective are not Watson and Holmes.I had enjoyed several of Christie's later Poirot novels before reading &quot;Styles&quot;, and I had never suspected that Agatha Christie patterned Hercule Poirot so much after Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. I've already noted the similarities in the plotting of Poirot's and Holmes' debut novels, but there is more. Holmes was tall, thin, bohemian, and utterly British. Poirot was short, fat, fastidious, and decidedly un-British. Holmes' examination of the crimescene in &quot;Scarlet&quot; was very similar to Poirot's in &quot;Styles&quot;, but Holmes would never have flinched at examining the contents of the dispatch box. Holmes solved his mysteries by logical deduction, Poirot by the exercise of the &quot;little grey cells&quot;. Both could get so involved in the work of detection that they cut quite comical figures. Both labored mightily to keep the detectives from Scotland Yard on the right track. Both men's confidence in their abilities bordered on arrogance, and both held their cards close to their vests before dramatically divulging the villian.Holmes was always one for a pithy aphorism on detection. Poirot also: &quot;Imagination is a good servant and a bad master. The simplest explanation is always the most likely.&quot; &quot;Everything must be taken into account. If the fact will not fit the theory; let the theory go.&quot; &quot;It is always wiser to suspect everybody until you can prove logically, and to your own satisfaction, that they are innocent.&quot;There are similarities, but we cannot press them too far. Differences abound. Christie writes a much more Byzantine plot that Conan Doyle ever did, and in this case she arrives at the simplest explanation in the most complex, convoluted, contrived, and circuitous route imaginable. She also likes to play tricks on the reader, so beware! I occasionally wanted to cry foul during the course of the book, but her storytelling was so delightful, and the ending so satisfactory, that I had to applaud even as I felt somewhat betrayed."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This is Agatha Chritie's firt novel and Hercule Poirot's first case. It's also a great read. I was first introduced to Agatha Chritie in sixth grade by my gifted teacher, and have been a Poirot fan ever since--I did a book report on a Ms. Marple book, but decided later that that funny little Belgian gent was more my type. Christie creates a wondeful and entertaining character in Hercule Poirot. He's conceited in a funny way, immaculately groomed, and brilliant in solving crimes; he also has a way of dropping subtle and interesting crumbs along the way and not revealing all he know until the end. Christie never fails to surprise, either, as to who the perpatrator is. This ending is truly the last you'd expect. The Queen of the mystery genre (says who? me, that's who) is at her most wonderful prime in this delightful first novel. It's inriguingly written, the characters are great, and it is short. A must read."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"This first story of Hercule Poirot is excellent. You really get a feel for the character of Hercule Poirot that is going to carry through the rest of his mysteries. Agatha Christie will always be my favorite mystery writer and this book shows why. Unfortunately, this Kindle edition is missing the illustrations which are somewhat necessary to understanding the book. Since I have read print versions many times, this didn't matter so much to me but it will to those who have never read it. That is the only reason I didn't give this version 5 stars.

I've never been able to decide which of her detectives I liked the best- the sweet old Miss Marple or the sometimes insufferable Mr Poirot. Several of her later works have made the transition from books to movies and stage plays one of which, The Mousetrap, has run on a London stage continuously since 1952, so her work definitely has staying power! It is worth your while to give her a try- or try several."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Agatha Christie was living with her Mother and sister Madge in 1916 in her home town of Torquay, when Madge bet her sister that she could not wirite a detective story, a new art form at the time.. Agatha got half way through and was stuck, when her Mother said \\"go away to the moors on a hiking holiday, clear your head and finish this \\"it's good so far!\\".Out of this holiday came Hercule Peroit, Captain Hastings and Inspector Japp who were to be in Christie novels for the next fifty years. It took four years to find a publisher for \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" and the novel was evenutally published and copyrighted in 1920. During world war II Christie wrote Poirot's last adventure \\"Curtain\\". He's now a feeble old man living in Styles St Mary once again for this his final case. \\"Curtain\\" was kept in a bank vault and published after Dame Agath'a death in 1976. What is fascinating to me is this is early example of English detective fiction, coming as it did right after Sherlock Holmes. The art form was developing - this is a grand audio production with a large cast - \\"Styles\\" is timeless and historically important."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Tommy and Tuppence series seem to me to be among the best of Agatha Christie's works, at least partly because of their freshness.

Thought I knew the murderer early on and was surprised. Some of the English usage/slang is a little outdated and hard for me to understand, but it adds to the fun of the book.

There is always so much more in the reading than in watching the PBS Hercule Poirot series."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Agatha Christie doesn't disappoint if you want to read a clean story that keeps you guessing.

Too bad she is no longer around to tell us more."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at Styles was Agatha Christie's first published mystery, the one in which she introduced detective Hercule Poirot and created the template for nearly all of the hundreds (?) of subsequent mysteries she published in her career. From this very first book Christie established herself as the queen of the whodunit, writing mysteries with solutions that always fool the reader. Although her books aren't deep into characterization or atmosphere -- that isn't the type of book she wrote, after all -- nevertheless she always managed to effectively transport the reader to another time and place. I love her books for that entertaining, escapist quality they have.In The Mysterious Affair at Styles we are transported to the WWI era -- a large estate in the British countryside, where a wealthy elderly woman is murdered and nearly everyone in the household seems to have a motive. Hercule Poirot, a Belgian refugee and retired police officer, just happens to be in the area and in a matter of days his little gray cells unravel the puzzle.The narrator is a British actor who does a fine job with the mens' voice, particularly Poirot's, but doesn't do so well with the female voices. Nevertheless, this is a delightfully entertaining book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Great classic mystery literature from one of the best authors ever.

The story is a little too stilted, with some irrelevant elements thrown in just to \\"cloud the situation\\". Not as tightly woven as her later works. Of course, this being one of her early books, one must read with a level of tolerance and understanding; and it being the first one that introduces Poirot, it still is a must-read for the true Agatha/Poirot fans. Her later books, Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile, Death in the Clouds, etc. are more well-constructed and a lot more fun to read."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"It was fascinating to read Agatha Christies first book which was rejected by a few publishing houses. I had delighted in it so looked to your site to find a large print edition for my mother as I knew she would also love to read it."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The Mysterious Affair at StylesBy: Agatha ChristieA. GuittardBook ReviewThe story, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, is based in World War I. The story introduces Hercule Poirot, a famous Belgian detective. In the beginning of the book, the main character, Mr. Arthur Hastings, goes to visit an old friend and his family. Whiles he stays there, the housemistress, Mrs. Cavendish, dies. It is a fortunate coincidence that Poirot is in a nearby village. The assemblage of suspects are mostly from Mrs. Cavendish's family. Poirot is given many clues and racks his brains to find out who is the murderer.Since this is the first Poirot novel, I expected it to be inferior to other novels Agatha Christie has written. I found myself perplexed at some points in the story because of Poirot, his witty comments and how he finds clues. It seemed that some clues were not really relative at the time, but then turn out to get more related to the story. I loved how Poirot was meticulous about everything, and also how he was so immaculate. So, in conclusion, this is a book I would recommend. Although it is not one of Christie's best, it is still a very humorous, motivating and intriguing book!"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"English country house murder, limited pool of suspects (mostly, the Cavendish family), lots of zigzagging and backtracking, red herrings and buried clues. In other words, classic Agatha Christie, though I believe this was her first (Poirot) novel, related through Hastings, who is the perfect stolid British foil to the eccentric and excitable little Belgian. Gets a little complicated in the plot, but the style is smooth and engaging. For a modern Agatha Christie (English country house, limited pool of suspects), I recommend the slightly spoofy \\"Christmas is Murder\\" by C. S. Challinor.Christmas is Murder (A Rex Graves Mystery)"},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"Actually, this isn't Agatha Christy's best, but I give it a five star rating for its importance as her first mystery and the first Hercule Poirot story. All others came from this one and it is a first rate puzzler. Those already familiar with Agatha Christy will have it partially figured out if mot completely long before the end, but this shows the influence she had on the development of the mystery genre. She plays a game with the reader and she plays it fair and square. While doing so, she creates one of fiction's most memorably eccentric characters, Hercule Poirot. He is such an enjoyable character that the book is captivating observing him although the suspects in this one aren't particularly likeable. This is a pure puzzle and doesn't have the sense of tragedy that some of her later books have. It's a fast read and definitely an enjoyable one."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"...I got a hunch about 1/2 way through that one of the characters was the murderer - but could not even begin to see how they did it or were connected. My first read of a Christie book - and I'll be digging in to others since I enjoyed this one so much."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"The plucky little Belgian is in fine form in this old-fashioned whodunit, gleaning clues where there seem to be none. Unlike other Agatha Christie mysteries, I'm not sure the reader is really given all of the information to be able to deduce the solution themselves. You could guess, true, (though I did not) but there weren't the concrete clues left lying about for the reader to grasp and assemble into a coherent scenario. Still, it was an enjoyable old-fashioned mystery, and I would recommend the Poirot stories to all mystery fans (Miss Marple, on the other hand, grates on my nerves)."},{"Title":"Mysterious Affair at Styles","review":"\\"87 years ago the grande dame created Hercule Poirot to solve with logic and deduction the murder and he has been with us ever since.

I can remember well my own frustrations with the manner in which IR theorists seemed to simply ignore the facts of the real world.

This is why Cynthia Weber's book is so important. Thru her analysis of a series of films she demonstrates how each main IR theory is beholden to a certain metaphysics about the actors of world politics, and relations the define them. Its a very novel idea, and she writes in a very accessible manner. I will definitely be using this book in my IR classes from here on in."},{"Title":"International Relations Theory: A Critical Introduction","review":"It is Fast and in good condition!

I read the 2003 edition, which has only about 200 pages. It is beautifully produced on thick, glossy paper and lavishly illustrated. There are no episodes in which Dickens meets his characters or dead authors.I read the Edgar Johnson bio years ago and loved it. Ackroyd's book, at least this edition, doesn't seem to go into as much detail.

Ackroyd writes in an irritating punchy style with many 1-word sentences to show emphasis. This aggressive style was offensive, and at time condescending. It also was distracting. The story is supposed to be about Dickens, after all. The author is prolix, self-indulgent and more interested in establishing his own originality than that of Dickens.

Silly, trite, overworked! At best, they should be in the juvenile offerings.....but I'm sure any child other than a youngster would be bored. Save your money for some better written, more interesting stories...go buy a comic book instead, and get a quicker, more intelligent read. For the cat lovers (myself included), this proved to be no more likable-their input is truly stupid and minimal. My cats would be insulted to be included in a story like this, or put in a class with these feline &quot;sleuths.&quot;......I also listened to the audio book, and couldn't wait for it to end...I don't like Van Patten either."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"As a long-time mystery fan and a cat lover, I thought that a popular book combining the two was a good bet. However, I found the story uninteresting and the cat's contribution to solving the mystery more supernatural then feline. The only redeeming aspect of the book was the setting (Breakfast Island is clearly based on Mackinac Island, MI, which I had visited a few years before reading the book). This was my first book from &quot;The Cat Who ...&quot; series, and my last."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"Another audio book listener has pointed out how distasteful the reading by Dick Van Patten was. I agree. However, he read only the abridged edition; for the unabridged edition, George Guidall was once again called upon to give one of his patented performances of our Hero, Qwill. He fits the part like those treasured Old Shoes with which no expensive new model can compete.For regular readers of the long-running series, one need only say that this is neither the best nor the worst of the lot. With George doing the talking you will enjoy it. For others, it can be characterized as ultra-light entertainment, interesting only to those who can accommodate to a middle-aged man who lives alone with two cats with whom he carries on conversations and plays games. He also is pretty well convinced that one of the cats has some sort of sixth sense which allows him to divine events before they occur and understand what has occurred with only that sixth sense to help him. As in the other books, there is a mystery here, although not a great deal of effort goes into solving it, though solved it is. As usual it is the characters and situations which are the reason for listening to it, when it is read with as much characterization as Guidall brings to the text. I can commend it to someone not looking for the depth of P.D. James or the surprise ending of Agatha Christie."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"This is another in the light and amusing series of stories of \\"The Cat Who\\"...

Your books are amazing!Thank you, Ann Jackson"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"I have been reading the the cat who series for quite awhile and I must say that this book is quite good. If you really thought about the atmosphere of the island and the fudge fumes, you could actually picture yourself there. I thought this was a great book, if you haven't read it yet, do it soon!"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"There's a little something extra in TCWCB for my taste, and I've read over twenty of her whimsical tales. Mixed in with the fluidly vivid descriptions of her main characters, Ms. Braun makes some pithy comments about ecology and responsible community development - a theme she has been building toward in previous volumes of this best-selling series and feels strongly about... Here she expresses her concern about the future of this planet, and goes into all the things that can possibly go wrong when feasibility studies on ecology are non-existent or ignored, or when corporate greed and over-commercialization create underground community resistance on \`Pear Island'... Bravo! I have a feeling she's wanted to write on this topic for a long time.Now, on the authorship of her later books which some readers have conjectured about, I'd like to make a point I've never seen brought up, because I'd love to see this controversy over the possibility of dubious authorship relegated to the litter box.I feel strongly that she has written every word in this amusing series and there have been no ghostwriters whatsoever. She's having too much of a good time for there to be any reason to turn over the authorship to someone of lesser ability or inferior talent, whether it's because of pressure from her publisher, or whomever, or because she's \\"too old\\" to have written them... and supposedly for what... greed?? After having had so many of these books on the New York Times' bestseller list, she's probably a millionaire two or three times over and still counting.I may be wrong, but my sense of her character is that she'd rather end the series cold turkey than farm out KoKo and Yum Yum to a lesser talent. So for her or her publisher to artificially keep the series going for financial reasons only, just does not compute, at least for me... I'm not convinced that her writing could be duplicated by anyone else for the sake of financial gain or to please fans, since she's the consummate word master \\"who could write 1000 words on anything,\\" and particularly when her main character Qwill is so indifferent to his inherited millions... Ms. Braun strikes me as a writer's writer - she's in love with words - and I can't imagine her putting up with less vivid or striking prose and lowering her standards.There's no break that I can see in the continuity line of Qwill's personal development even though there was a twenty year gap in the publishing history of these books. So far, he has remained 50ish throughout the entire series, and the continuity of one book to the next, in terms of a time-line and recurring characters, has been consistent. This means that while there may have been a twenty year gap in publishing these works, there has been no twenty year gap in her story line - and I think that means something in the way these books were created.As far as my own tastes are concerned, the later volumes show no diminution in her amazing descriptive powers, wit and charm, but these books may seem different or \`lesser' because they are driven more by character development than plot, and some people prefer the plot driven stories. There may have been a change of focus but not of ability, and her books have changed because she has changed in an evolutionary way. Nevertheless, even her later books have kept me guessing and I feel that TCWCB is one of the best in her series because she takes on a hot topic with amusing and biting satire.I see \\"Q\\" as her. Through him she gets to express all the facets of her own views on love, art, money and wealth... you name it... and she breathes sparkling life into these books and makes them wonderful literary companions for anyone who is lonely or seeks something uplifting to the mind and spirit. She's very healthy of mind and so is George Guidall, who's done such a wonderful job on the unabridged audio books. It's a great combination of talent that makes one fall in love with the power of the spoken word and perhaps wish to become a writer oneself.As of today's date, I believe she's still very much alive and wishes to stay mentally active with much more to say about the human condition. She's a deceptively simple writer with a virtuoso command of language, and for my liking, she has something to say about life above and beyond the mystery genre itself and is never heavy-handed about it. That's why I value her witty and unassuming books though the later ones may vary in the tightness of their plots and in the tidiness of their conclusions. In any event, for anyone who has enjoyed this wonderful series for years to turn on her viciously because of their \\"disappointment\\" makes me wonder if they were ever genuine fans to begin with. I like to remember with gratitude the many hours of enjoyment she's brought into the lives of her readers."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"An avid fan of the Cat Who series I found this installation boring! The cats, Koko and Yum Yum, and their human, Qwilleran, are always entertaining but this time the storyline was lacking. Maybe the absence of Moose County residents is the reason. We've come to know these folks and they were missing from this adventure. The story takes place on Breakfast Island, the newest 'in' spot. There, Qwill meets and makes new friends but the story just doesn't click. I was much happier to discover our trio of detectives stays home for their next adventure. Meow"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"I agree that this, number 16 in the series, may not be the best. It was strange in places and Koko's abilities went a little too far.

Start with the first, The Cat Who Could Read Backwards."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"The Cat...Came To Breakfast was the first book of Braun's series I have ever read. Afterwards, it made me go crazy for The Cat Who series. Her characters, Jim Quilleran and his cats, Koko &amp; Yum Yum, help the story create its interesting qualities.

Great job, Ms. Braun!!"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"Before purchasing this book, I read the other reviews, some of which were less than flattering. I almost didn't buy it based on those reviews. Contrary to other written comments, I felt this edition is one of the best in the series.

You need to read it too!"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"Hardcore mystery fans may find it a bit of a stretch, but if your taste runs to expertly written and very light fiction, you can't do better than Lillian Jackson Braun's \\"The Cat Who...\\" series. Her detective, reporter James Qwilleran, investigates crimes with the aid of his Siamese cats--and the solutions to the crime inevitably rest more upon intution than actual deduction. While the premise sounds farfetched, Braun's work is actually less fanciful than you might expect, and she presents her eccentric characters and stories with great charm.Braun's writings frequently address ecological issues, and THE CAT WHO CAME TO BREAKFAST takes on over-development--in this case the rape of Breakfast Island, now renamed Pear Island and outfitted with a large scale resort, tacky tourist attractions, and at least two fudge shops. Qwill disapproves... but even fudge fumes can't mask the scent of a good story, and he sets off with his cats to investigate a series of unfortunate island accidents... and stumbles into murder. THE CAT WHO CAME TO BREAKFAST is a particularly memorable title in the series, for it provides Braun ample excuse to write with the faintly satirical edge that she handles so well. Recommended to old fans and newcomers alike."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"I'm sorry if my english is terrible; I'm dutch. I just want to tell all of you how stunned I am by the gift Lilian Jackson Brown has. She can really keep me reading, although I need as much sleep as I can get :-) This time she takes the reader outside Pickax City, to Breakfast Island. It's very refreshing to read a 'The cat...' novel somewhere outside Moose County.. Well, at least not at Brrr, Mooseville or any city like that. It's a fun story. If you liked other books by her, you'll certainly like this one!"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"Qwill, AKA James Qwilleran, wealthy semi-retired journalist and companion person to two Siamese cats, has just expressed his total disdain for the newest Moose County (400 miles north of everywhere) enterprise - Pear Island AKA Breakfast Island AKA Grand Island AKA Providence Island when he discovers that his long-time lady friend, Polly will be vacationing in Oregon and without him. He reconsiders his options and decides to visit this island but on his own terms. In a short time he becomes entangled in the local politics and begins to suspect that all is not as it seems on the island, no matter what name is being used. Of course there is a death and Qwill's suspicions prove correct. By the end of the book Qwill and the cats have had yet another vacation that did not go according to plan but instead solved some mysteries.This was a good entery into the series but I did miss some of the Moose County regulars. The one that were present,the ever-growing Derek and the delightful Bamba family make up for the absence of so many others however. The newest addition to the County, Elizabeth Cage is intriguing, another poor-little-rich-girl like Mary Duckworth of earlier books, but with a charm of her own.This is a must for fans of the series but would also be enjoyable for any fan of the 'cozy' mystery genre."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"Sorry to say, this book is deftinitely not one of Braun's best. If you were to skip one, this would be it. The plot is disconnected and never fully resolves. The cats learn a few too many tricks too fast, and Quill doesn't like pears, which I take as a personal insult as they're my favorite fruit. But there's good news too: after this minor episode, Lilian Jackson Braun makes an amazing recovery and her next book, THE CAT WHO BLEW THE WHISTLE, is one of her best."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"Of all of the books of the series this one is my favorite. I love the setting, and all the characters that are introduced. The natives to Pear Island (Breakfast Island) are charming and add a lot to the ambiance of the story. The Bambas have always been some of my favorite characters and I enjoyed seeing so much of them in this book. When I want a light hearted read I always grab this one first. I'd suggest it to any one who likes to read mysteries."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"I enjoyed this book, and I especially like reading the details of how Qwill dotes on Koko and Yum Yum. Tales of traveling with the cats, and their turkey roaster(!) were so amusing. The mystery didn't grip me, though. In fact, at times, I completely lost track of why Qwill went to visit Breakfast/Pear/Providence Island. Still, the book is low on violence and the pace is leisurely. If you are looking for something witty and pleasant, but not necessarily a page turner, pick this one up."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"Mrs. Braun's books have often contained a pro-environmentalist message but this is the greenest book so far. For in this episode the developers have defaced Breakfast Island with a resort, worse yet, they have changed the name of the island to Pear Island and Qwilleran is fit to be tied. He is even more upset than normal since money from his K foundation has helped fund the Pear Island Resort. Even the thought of visiting the remodeled island makes him furious until two events conspire to change his mind.The first event is an announcement from his lady friend Polly Duncan that she is going to Oregon for two weeks to visit a friend. Knowing that he is going to be alone for two whole weeks puts Qwilleran in just the proper mood for event number two. He gets a call from his old friend Nick Bamba who asks if he can come by for a chat. It turns out that Nick and his wife have opened a B&B; on the island and have themselves become the victims of some weird occurrences at the resort. Knowing about Qwilleran's mystery solving ability Nick invites the former reporter and his two cats to spend the time that Polly is gone at the Bamba B&B.; Not being able to resist a good mystery, Qwilleran agrees to come to the island and the fun begins.Qwilleran suspects all along that the accidents aren't really accidents and he sets out to prove his theory. Koko takes up dominoes to try and point Qwilleran in the right direction but it takes forever for Koko's human to figure out what the cat is trying to tell him. Of course, Qwilleran finally figures it all out but he never would have found the answer if Koko hadn't arranged for him to meet and save the life of a local heiress. Along the way Qwilleran and the cats put up with the constant smell of fudge, an annoying neighbor, a hurricane and meat loaf with rabbit in it. Qwilleran also gets invited to high tea with the Queen Mother of island society but is disappointed to find no peacocks at the Queen's estate.This is another fine mystery by Mrs. Braun. The mystery itself isn't all that deep and really just plays a supporting role to the ongoing saga of Qwilleran, Koko and Yum Yum. This is after all a warm fuzzy mystery and this author proves once again with this book that she is one of the best authors in this genre. The characters are delightful and although there are several new characters introduced in this book it is not set so far away from Pickax City that the regulars are shut out. This series is extremely readable and fun, and this entry is no exception. I do wish however that Qwilleran would avoid the trap of becoming an anti-smoking fanatic like so many other former smokers. This type of judgmental behavior just doesn't suit him at all."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"This may not be the best of Lilian Jackson Braun... but it is still a great mystery book. Her books are light reading and not at all gross or scary and this is refreshing. The cats are adorable and I love to see what they are going to do next!!! The cats, Qwill and the books are very entertaining and I absolutely love them. When I am not reading one of these books I am missing Qwill, Koko and Yum Yum. I highly recommend reading all of The Cat Who books... start at the beginning... it is not necessary, but it IS better."},{"Title":"The Cat Who Came To Breakfast","review":"This was the first book I read in The Cat Who series and I was hooked. I love the easy going style of Braun and the way I feel like I'm observing everything going on in Moose County. I've since read the rest in the series, but this book is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"The Unexpected Sister (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I jsut finished reading this book in one evening, and it is a &quot;keeper&quot; for me. It is an nice combination of mystery and romance. The heroine, Caroline, is a warm and loyal person, and the hero, Thomas, is a brave and honorable one. They make you want to root for them and for their happiness. Their behavior is very believable, and the romance moves along nicely, although the mystery does command a lot of the attention. It is hard to say much about this book without giving away too much of the mystery, but I can say that the mystery involves the relationship between Thomas, Lord Dashly, and Caroline's deceased brother, Peter, and their adventures in wartime Spain. The author has researched things very thoroughly, and skillfully weaves the war-time events into the fabric of the present story.I can't say that I &quot;liked&quot; Caroline's sister, Melisande, to whom Thomas feels obligated to offer marriage, but she was a complex, interesting character. There are some other, very likable characters in the book, including a former Sergeant-Major and his wife, and Caroline's friends. They added a lot to the book.I think some readers might feel that the romance took second place to the mystery, and maybe it does, in parts, but there is enough simmering attraction between the hero and heroine to drive the story along. They both are attracted to each other, but out of loyaltly to Melisande, and for other reasons, try to deny the attraction. This is a good regency, that seems to have been well-researched. For example, I have read much about &quot;Lord Elgin's Marbles&quot; in other regencies--this book explains how and why they were acquired and came to be in England. The dialogues and the descriptive narratives are well-written, and make it a satisfying, &quot;filling&quot; read in the way that only a good regency can accomplish, in my mind. I find that when I read some modern romances, I find myself feeling like I am snacking, rather than eating a good meal--asking, where is the good dialogue, where is the descriptive prose? This book has both of my requirements for a good read, plus it was a touching romance. Hope to see more from this author!"},{"Title":"The Unexpected Sister (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Lord Thomas Dashley had been a major when he was captured by the French. To bide time for himself to heal and escape, Thomas gave false information. However, the information ended up meaning the death of his closest friend and fellow officer, Peter Wendham.When Thomas returned to England he went to Peter's home to explain what had happened to Peter's sister, Miss Melisande Wendham. Melisande was most all Peter ever spoke of when referring to his home. Thomas had heard so much of her that he had formed a mental image of Melisande and was half way in love with her. Lord Thomas was determined to make amends to Melisande for his part in Peter's death and then to wed her.Peter had never mentioned another sister, Miss Caroline Norcrest. Yet while Melisande condemned Thomas, Caroline did not. Caroline instinctively knew Thomas was innocent in Peter's death and she became determined to solve the mystery surrounding it.***** Most Regency Romances get four stars from me. However, this one was exceptional in the subtle nuances that the author gave throughout the story, as well as, the wonderful plot and sub-plots the book contained. Rarely have I read such a wondrous piece of work. (Sandra Heath is another such author that springs to mind.) Glenda Garland spins a tapestry of greed and romance that will keep her readers enthralled until the last page has been turned. HIGHLY recommended reading! *****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"The Unexpected Sister (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"When Lord Thomas Dashley was in the war with his friend Peter Wendham, Peter would often read aloud his sister's letters. And through those letters, Lord Thomas became intrigued. In fact, he decided he wanted to marry Melisande Wendham.When he goes to meet her, however, Lord Thomas must tell her something else. He is also indirectly responsible for her brother's death. Needless to say, Melisande gives him a rather icy reception.In meeting Melisande, Lord Thomas is met with another surprise--Peter Wendham had another sister, a half-sister, who is ten times sweeter and just as beautiful as her elder sister. Caroline Norcrest is her name, and she can't help but feel sympathy for Lord Thomas... and his cause. Caroline becomes an &quot;ally&quot; in his quest for Melisande's heart.I really enjoyed this book, especially the beginning. It had one of the most promising beginnings (the first 80 pages) that I have ever read. I really enjoyed the characters. Caroline is as kind as any romance heroine, and Lord Thomas is a gentleman through and through.However, there were a few things that put a damper on the book. I felt like I was mucking through all of the war stories... and the romance was almost overshadowed by the &quot;mystery&quot; of the artwork. In fact, it almost seems like &quot;The Mystery of the Artwork&quot; could've been an alternate title for this book--that subplot almost became the central plot.Still, I enjoyed the characters and their foibles. I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. I even found myself feeling pity for characters I don't think I was supposed to like. Poor Bowes..."},{"Title":"The Unexpected Sister (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Right off let me say reading your reviews are all misleading. When I read the book I didn&quot;t get the same reaction to the charters. The Hero was the most unlife like hero you&quot;d ever want to meet. Please tell me where was the romance in this misarable excuse for a love story? The herione pined through the whole facade and our hero kept fighting his feelings for her {of course he never tells her of his feelings} then when the sister he came to save , who ignores and hates him, smiles at him finally what does this jock do? Why he&quot;s so thrilled he is quite pleased with himself. We get around to him declaring himself about the last what maybe seven pages.

That is no insult: academic literature is rife with works that either don't prove what they set out to prove and thus provoke indipensable rebuttals, or which set out to prove the obvious, and prove it to nobody's startlement or particular satisfaction, but, although their conclusions are unexciting, contrive to retain their currency by virtue of their usefulness as info-mines. Had Casaubon's _Key To All Mythologies_ been published, it might have been of the second type. (_Evil Sisters_ belongs to both categories.) Inspired academic failures are often nifty and in my opinion they are even necessary, since academic life depends on discourse and, in order to maintain discourse, someone always has to take the losing position. Henry Petroski writes books on the importance of failure in design; well, failure is no more expendable in discourse than in design; Dijkstra in _Evil Sisters_ proves as much, intentionally or not.Dijkstra's main contention, that racist and sexist books, pictures, and films led to the Nazification of Europe, is hooey. Sure, the books, films, and pictures existed, and sure the conquest of Europe by Nazi Germany took place, but that doesn't prove that the one LED TO the other. Events may demonstrably correlate statistically without correlating causally--as I learned in High School Social Studies. If racist pictures and literature abound, and if the Nazification of a continent occurs, isn't it at least as likely that both phenomena are due to some antecedent cause as that one phenomenon impels the other? Sure it is, as high school kids flunk Social Studies tests for failing to realize.Dijkstra's minor contention, that specific strains of antifeminism, anti-Semitism, and race-baiting were ubiquitous throughout the Western world around the turn of the century and up till World War II, is correct, but it's so indisputably correct that Dijkstra, never a fellow to let a blind alley go unexplored, experiences difficulty choosing among his sources. So much so that one is left wondering why Dijkstra should choose to pick on only certain people: why should he scold Fitzgerald and Hemingway for their unacceptable racial and sexual assumptions when London and Cather beckon as temptingly? Could it be because Fitzgerald and Hemingway are bigger literary game and consequently more fun to bag?Pretty much anything pop-cultural published around 1909 would be castigated as racist/sexist by today's standards; and, as per usual, the stereotypes perpetuated in the pulps found themselves echoed (&quot;archetypally&quot;) in the pages of reputable writers. Dijkstra is spot-on in his observation that the basic difference between a stereotype and an archetype inheres in the reputability of the artist who invokes it. Hence, Al Jolson in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; has come to be an embarrassment while Willa Cather's blind, instinctually musical, perpetually nodding &quot;small-brained&quot; mulatto pianist in _My Antonia_ is still Art. Unfortunately Dijkstra is not content to make this thouroughly accurate observation only once: he makes it again and again and really, it's too self-evident to need that much repetition.Again, Dijkstra errs, as I see it, when he attributes to the ubiquitous race-baiting of the early Twentieth century a nasty triumphalism which I don't believe it possessed. The lessons of High School and of the playground are always at hand: secure people do not taunt their neighbors. Still less do they taunt neighbors in relation to whom they believe they are one-up. The people who really run this country, still more this world, &quot;have better things to do than be anti-Semitic&quot; or racist, however devastating their policies may be to given out-groups. The &quot;rasping protofascist tone&quot; of early Twentieth-century literature was always most raucous and most inescapable in the pop-cult pulps, and it trickled UP to the comparatively rarified realms of &quot;high culture&quot; from there. Don't get me wrong, I realize that racism was respectable at the turn of the century even in America, and that it kept right on being respectable until the abhorrent sight of Nazi Germany caused the nations of this world to take stock of themselves. What I DON'T believe is that the currency racial/sexual Theories of Everything gained in the Western world at that time was due to Caucasian self-confidence. Quite the opposite. I believe it was contingent upon a great loss of faith. Nietzsche proclaimed that God was dead and and forthwith, though with his tongue in his cheek, proposed Das Volk as a substitute for the Divinity, part-Slavic as he was. What could be more inevitable that that he be followed by disciples who were just as insecure as he was but not as smart, who were dead to irony, and whose toungues were most emphatically NOT in their cheeks? Dijkstra holds Darwin reponsible for a great many things, and of some of these things, in my view, Darwin is innocent. But in one respect Dijkstra is right--Darwin had a profound decentering effect on Western philosophers and pulp writers alike. He was the sensei roshi who taught them that they could no longer believe themselves to be the particualar favorites of God. (As such, he was really only the carrier for Spinoza's bad news, but then nobody ever reads philosophers; natural historians get a lot more airplay.) What could be more natural than that people, deprived of a consoling vision of themselves as favorites of God, should bend every sinew to prove themselves favorites of Nature instead?This self-proof was a burden that devolved heavily upon the shoulders of Twentieth-century people, which their Nineteenth-century forbears did not wholly share. Nineteenth-century Westerners could most of them still depend upon the love of God, a love which might conceivably be lavished more unstintingly upon some groups than others but which was theoretically illimitable and free to all. Christianity had not yet become--let's not follow Nietzsche and say &quot;dead&quot; but UNFASHIONABLE. Consequently strains of racism and sexism existed in Nineteenth-century popular culture but Nineteenth-century popular culture did not CONSIST of them. Early Twentieth-century popular culture almost did. Dijkstra's previous and far superior book, _Idols of Perversity_, was dedicated to mapping the change. _Idols of Perversity_ is much more interesting than _Evil Sisters_ because it chronicles a FIGHT between ideas, and explores the consequences of the resulting strain in the Nineteenth-century mind. _Evil Sisters_ is comparatively uninteresting because it all takes place after the fact, after the bad guys won.Still, I'm willing to give Dijkstra an A for Agitation and for Attitude. I like Attitude. Too many academic works are unavailable to the public because they are written in a dull untranslatable jargon seemingly designed to keep readers at bay. Sure, Dijlstra employs jargon, but at least it's his OWN jargon. And why shouldn't one SOUND passionate about those issues concerning which one IS passionate? As for Dijkstra's digressivity: I, too, believe in leaving no stone unturned. I wish merely to suggest that, in the interests of those readers who are interested in getting to the POINT, already, this book could have been cut down by about a third. And some of Dijkstra's verbal formulations are genuinely bizarre. While discussing the Louise Brooks vehicle &quot;Pandora's Box&quot;, he writes as follows: &quot;As Lola's blood seeps into the dried boards of civilization...&quot; The dried boards of civilization? Give me a break."},{"Title":"Evil sisters: The threat of female sexuality and the cult of manhood","review":"Because of his previous study/essays in Idols of Perversity, I grabbed this book almost immediately after it was published. Just like the other book, this one was very insightful about the sort of deep-seated cliches applied to women in the arts - the virgin/whore/child-bride/vamp, etc. After reading it, I sat down and had another look at my own writings and tried to eradicate all those crippling, limiting roles from my female characters.

His reliance on examples nobody remembers is interesting, given his insistence on their powerful cultural influence to this day. Though it is useful in tracing the roots of misogynistic icons, the book strains at the bit to find a conspiracy of male poets, writers, artists, and scientists who were all out for one thing: to put women in their &quot;proper&quot; inferior place in the game of natural selection and pave the way for Nazism. He puts words in his sources' mouths repeatedly and engages in sometimes ludicrous speculation, making one wonder where the good professors own deepest beliefs lie.

Dijkstra's judgmentalism adds spice to the obscure, but to familiar masterpieces it seems like vandalism.It is not new or insightful to point out, say, that Hemingway was mighty interested in Real Manliness; or that Faulkner had peculiar notions about hereditary degeneration. Mr. Dijkstra does a good job at connecting these features of these works to half-forgotten ideas like Lombroso's physiognomy; but the overall effect is far less striking. Those who want to read Hemingway or Faulkner will not find their interest whetted by the diatribe against their sins against political correctness.

There was a time when poetry was so popular in the USA that many daily newspapers had daily poems and the average worker with a grade school education could recite several great American poems by heart. That was also the time when poets wrote about things that people experienced and could relate to. I love Whitman. I have a Masters degree. I can read Spinoza and the Greek dramatists and poets with pleasure. I started this book because Stevens was said to be a great poet. After forcing myself through twenty of these poems I still had no idea what any of them were about. I might as well have been reading Icelandic for all I got out of them. Here's an example of how Stevens unnecessarily obscures his poetry: in one poem, he refers to \\"the halo-John.\\" This phrase never occurred before Stevens used it. Its appearance stops the reader as abruptly as if he had driven into a brick wall. Who or what is \\"the halo-John\\"? The reader searches through the rest of the poem for clues. Ok, it is a religious poem so maybe he means St. John the Evangelist because saints have halos. But why not just say \\"St. John\\"? \\"The halo-John\\" doesn't add anything to the poem. In fact, it detracts as the reader has to stop reading the poem in order to do the equivalent of a crossword puzzle exercise in order to proceed further. If the reader isn't christian, he may be completely out of luck. Stevens doesn't just do this sort of thing once or twice; his poems are full of this sort of nonsense. If a poem needs a commentary in order to appreciate it, the poem is a failure because this sort of poet is incapable of speaking to the reader without an intermediary, a literary priest to offer sacrifices for the poor, ignorant layman who has insufficient piety and intelligence to approach the divine mysteries of poetry on his own. The reader has his revenge, though. Poetry is unread. Poetry becomes irrelevant. Poets must either scrap with each other for literary prizes that mean the difference between starvation and three steady meals a day or slog away at teaching jobs since no one will buy their work. My copy of this book of poetry will meet its end in the dumpster."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"I was totally ignorant of Wallace Stevens until I came to Yale and took Professor Harold Bloom's course \\"How to Read a Poem.\\" American poetry, as I, a Chinese student of a non-English major, understood it, is Walt Whitman, T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. In contrast, Wallace Stevens's name was strange to most Chinese intellectuals till recently. Even in his native country his rise to a canonical status was not immediate. Eliot's The Waste Land and Stevens' Harmonium debuted around the same time, but the former took all the spotlight. A mysterious \\"X\\" recurs in some of Stevens's letters and poems. This \\"X\\" refers to no other than Eliot, which may reflect a degree of frustration on the part of Stevens. Not until his late years did Stevens slowly but surely receive the recognition he deserved. A lagging effect in cross-lingual translation and interpretation may explain Stevens's relative invisibility to the Chinese audience. In addition, Stevens, especially in his later years, was highly meditative and philosophical, at times difficult and obscure, which also affected his accessibility to foreign readers.Professor Bloom's class first initiated me into the force and beauty of Stevens's poetry. What intrigues me is that Stevens lived a double life. He was an insurance lawyer in profession and a poet in private, and seemed to have no difficulty alternating between the two seemingly incompatible roles. Just like his work is so original that they defy any easy label, Stevens's life is so eccentric that he contradicts the stereotype of what a poet is supposed to be like. This is particularly astonishing in the eyes of the Chinese, for in our tradition commerce and poetry have very little in common. Chinese poets are easily associated with scholars, officials, hermits, monks, artists, but it is hard to think of any example of successful poet-businessmen.I especially love \\"The Poems of Our Climate,\\" a short piece written in 1938, when the poet was 59 years old. It was a number of years on from \\"The Idea of Order in the Key West.\\" For Stevens, it was a central poem. Stevens's poetic odyssey spanning over half a century was punctuated by two puzzling breaks: in 1898-1900, Stevens, a Harvard student poet, contributed regularly to Harvard Advocate. After he left Cambridge for New York, his poetry writing stopped short. After a complete silence of seven years when Stevens was struggling with his business career, in 1907 he began to present love songs to his muse Elsie Moll, and his creative faculty seemed to return. In 1923, Stevens, at the age of 44, finally published his first volume of poems, Harmonium. The book's poor reception and its author's growing domestic and corporate responsibilities almost led him to abandon poetry again. For four years Stevens published little. Not until 1929 did Stevens resume poetry writing. Like the Irish poet W.B.Yeats and the Chinese poet Du Fu, the bulk of Stevens's best work was not done until his late years. Interestingly, these three literary lions unanimously fall in love with the fall season: Yeats admires the trees in their autumn beauty in \\"The Wild Swans at Coole\\"; Du Fu composed a cycle of regulated poems under the general title of \\"Autumn Meditations\\"; Stevens' last major poetic endeavor is no other than \\"The Auroras of Autumn.\\" These pieces actually reflect the poets' \\"autumnal personality.\\" As they are approaching that season of their life, their works become increasingly sophisticated, retrospective and sublime. The following lines from John Keats' \\"Ode to Autumn\\" might be particularly pertinent to their situations:Where are the songs of Spring? Ay, where are they?Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,\\"The Poems of Our Climate\\" was written in this \\"autumnal period\\" of the poet's life, thus belonging to the poetry of maturity. It is in three numbered sections. There is a break between each of the sections.IClear water in a brilliant bowl,Pink and white carnations. The lightIn the room more like a snowy air,Reflecting snow. A newly-fallen snowAt the end of winter when afternoons return.Pink and white carnations - one desiresSo much more than that. The day itselfIs simplified: a bowl of white,Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round,With nothing more than the carnations there.Stevens's difficulty often lies in referentiality. The first section seems to have nothing to do with the title. There is no direct reference whatsoever to either \\"poems\\" or \\"our climate.\\" Ostensibly the poet-persona is watching a Japanese flower arrangement. Stevens had a passion for oriental arts and philosophies. He was a close reader of Okakura Kakuzo (1862-1913), and his library was full of all kinds of books about Japanese flower arrangement. He was not only deeply read in this subject, but also had a habit of ordering fresh flowers from shops. The opening sentence introduces the image of flower arrangement by creating a pleasing word picture of balance, harmony and form. \\"Clear water\\" seems to be redundant, yet this rhetorical excess emphasizes the crystalline transparency of water. \\"Brilliant\\" etymologically means \\"to emit light, to reflect light,\\" thus accentuating the shiny surface of the container. The combination of \\"pink and white carnations\\" brings a festival of inviting colors and textures that are traditionally associated with feminine innocence, charm and gentility. The origin of the word \\"carnation\\" in Latin confirms the connection between the flower and human flesh. Behind this image of sexual provocation is a male observer's voyeuristic and fetishistic desire. The first sentence sketches the key components of a flower arrangement (through three nouns: water, bowl and carnations), with an emphasis on their optical and chromatic effects in the eyes of a spectator (through four adjectives: clear, brilliant, pink and white), and thus anticipates the \\"light\\" in the following sentence. \\"[...]. The light / in the room more like a snowy air, / Reflecting snow\\" embraces and extends the aura around the flower arrangement: the interior light is not like snow falling, but rather like air reflecting fallen snow. The observer is so subtle that he cannot help but elaborating the snow image: during the winter the afternoons have been very brief; but now, with afternoons elongating, winter is near the end and somehow meets early spring, and a fresh snow lies immaculate on the ground, like a breathtaking artwork of Nature, which gives a pure, refreshing and ethereal tone to the air reflecting snow. This late-winter scene suggests that the observer, like \\"the snowman,\\" wants \\"a mind of winter,\\" but not a mind of deep winter. The light that gives luster to the flower arrangement, like the rainwater that glazes a red wheelbarrow (William Carlos Williams, \\"A Red Wheelbarrow\\"), works beautifully on both formal and metaphorical levels. It represents a natural light, but as part of an art world it also becomes an aesthetic light.So far the language is very pictorial, in the manner of a still life. When Stevens portrays an object, he often builds a simple yet powerful image, omitting all insignificant details. Therefore, his image is at once concrete and abstract, familiar and unfamiliar, and appropriately distances itself from reality. In the first stanza of \\"The Poems of Our Climate,\\" the image is very concrete and real: this is about a Japanese flower arrangement. Meanwhile, there is no extravagant description of the object, but a word picture almost in the style of a Chinese xieyi (\\"to convey the spirit\\") painting. It highlights the principal components of the flower arrangement (water, bowl and carnations), and throws away lesser details (such as the spatial disposition of flowers, the effect of foliage). The aesthetic atmosphere is not only created by the description of the object itself; it is also a product of the language. To use minimalism to achieve maximal effect - this is also the case for the language. The diction is basic English words, mostly monosyllabic and disyllabic. Stevens only suggests and expects the reader to complete the picture by himself.\\"Pink and white carnations\\" recurs verbatim in line 6, implying that the observer moves his meditative eyes back to the core image. Then the poem abruptly takes another direction: \\"One desires / so much more than that.\\" This jump from imagistic to argumentative language is visually strengthened with the use of a hyphen to connect a noun phrase and a full sentence. Meanwhile, \\"desire\\" corresponds to the etymological hint of carnation, and the whole question about desire will continue to inform the rest of the poem. \\"The day\\" is in opposition to whatever \\"in the room,\\" designating the world external to the flower arrangement. Thus \\"[...] The day itself / is simplified\\" suggests that art reduces the outside world. \\"[...] a bowl of white, / Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round, / With nothing more than the carnations there.\\" Once again, Stevens returns to visual imagery, but this is not a wanton repetition of the earlier lines, but rather a repetition with nuanced variations or a deliberate revision, as if the observer observes through a closer perspective. \\"Cold, a cold porcelain, low and round\\" introduces new details about the container and unmistakably echoes the \\"cold pastoral\\" in Keats's \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn.\\" While \\"a bowl of white\\" seems a neutral description of what is seen, the \\"cold porcelain,\\" just like Keats's cold urn, implies that this is a lifeless, artificial work. Although Stevens appreciates the aesthetic effect of the flower arrangement, subliminally he is not satisfied with its lifelessness and otherness to human world. He desires more: in the closure of the next stanza, he will repeat the word \\"more\\" thrice, where \\"more\\" becomes almost obsessive.Now, get back to the title. How to justify \\"The Poems of Our Climate\\"? There are poets whose titles are throwaways, but not Stevens. Stevens cares a great deal about titles. His titles are always precise and integral to his poems. The first stanza seems to totally leave out the title, yet on a deeper level flower arrangement is a metaphor for poem writing. Metaphor is not an ordinary association of one object with another, but a figuration or trope which suggests the essence of one object by identifying it with certain qualities of another. Like Whitman, Stevens has an amazing command of figuration. For him, metaphor is a powerful means through which imagination imposes order on reality. \\"The Poems of Our Climate\\" opens with an objective description of clear water, brilliant bowl, pink and white carnations, and snowy light. As the poet is projecting his imaginary magic on those things, they will go through a metamorphosis and become metaphorical references to poetry writing, for both are the objects of formal arrangement, and both use delicate minimalism to achieve elaborate effect. Because this transfiguring act of mind is rooted in an objective world, the aura of duality shines through the images: they are at once flower arrangement and poetry writing. Indeed, what makes this poem \\"poetic\\" is the dynamic shifting back and forth between the real object and the metaphorical meanings it prompts.IISay even that this complete simplicityStripped one of all one's torments, concealedThe evilly compounded, vital IAnd made it fresh in a world of white,A world of clear water, brilliant-edged,Still one would want more, one would need more,More than a world of white and snowy scents.Stevens desires \\"complete simplicity,\\" but such \\"simplicity\\" is a trope for reduction and deprives him of the necessary pain and suffering in writing a poem. The capitalistic \\"I\\" is arresting, since Stevens always uses the impersonal \\"one\\" (\\"one\\" occurs four times in this stanza and six times in the whole poem), yet here he says \\"The evilly compounded, vital I.\\" In \\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,\\" \\"I\\" stands out again: \\"What am I to believe? ...\\" There is rhetorical power in the Stevensian \\"I,\\" which is almost electrifying. It recalls Whitman's \\"real me\\" or \\"me myself\\" in \\"Song of Myself,\\" for all these terms suggest a self that is one's consciousness but is a deeper and unknown part of one's consciousness. Stevens was very evasive about Whitman, one of his prime precursors. He never had anything good to say about Whitman in prose. Actually he blamed Whitman for Whitman's tramp persona. Yet, as Harold Bloom observes, \\"Whitman is a deeper and darker presence/absence in Stevens's work.\\" Good poetry in any language always depends on allusiveness. This stanza echoes a couplet in \\"Song of Myself\\":Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me ...As self-contradictory as the Whitmanian \\"real me\\" or \\"me myself,\\" the Stevensian \\"I\\" is both \\"evilly-compounded\\" and \\"vital\\" (this word is never negative). Bloom unravels the paradox by arguing that \\"The \`Vital I' is compounded evilly only because it is compounded at all.\\" In other words, Stevens is talking about a radical duality of self or even a plurality of selves, on which he will not give a stable judgment. \\"Vital\\" is also to find its compelling resonance in \\"the never-resting mind\\" in the succeeding stanza. A critic believes that Stevens's inward peering \\"I\\" also implies its externally seeing homophone \\"eye.\\" I agree with this insightful reading, for the whole poem is built upon the act of looking and seeing. \\"Still one would want more, one would need more, / More than a world of white and snowy scents\\" builds a crescendo of \\"mores\\" and reinforces the theme of desire. Stevens was from New Jersey and in his native language \\"scents\\" allegedly sounds like \\"senses,\\" so here he might be making another homonymic pun.In this stanza, \\"a world of white\\" recurs once more. This time, it is the word \\"brilliant-edged\\" that unfolds new information. The edge is between what two sides? Japanese flower arrangement draws materials from nature; meanwhile, it is cut and placed by people. Thus, it is a product of setting art against nature, so is poetry. The edge makes clear the dichotomy of art vs. nature. Fundamentally, high literature, especially poetry, is a continuous tradition. This poem explores a single motif that emerges again and again in a succession of strong poets - the relation between art and nature. Stevens is concerned with creating some shape of order in the wilderness and chaos of reality. On the other hand, he refuses to transform and harmonize reality at the cost of making violent imposition upon it. Shelley, in \\"A Defense of Poetry,\\" realizes that \\"even the greatest poetry will, through time, become nothing more than signs for classes of thought, loosing its poetic edge as a result.\\" To find the finer edge of words, Stevens urges us to get rid of the illusion of things and get to the truth. In Stevens's own words, \\"the hum of thoughts evaded in the mind.\\" (\\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction\\")This stanza is syntactically distinguished from the other stanzas for a single sentence runs through all seven lines, creating an extended \\"suspension system.\\" The effect is to have the completion of meaning constantly delayed, and to make the delay a means of defamiliarizing the process of conferring meanings. \\"Say even that,\\" like \\"more like\\" in line 3, is an American idiom, meaning \\"granted that.\\" It introduces a concessive clause and distantly echoes the adverb \\"still\\" five lines later. This pair of connectives frames the whole sentence or stanza. While in the first stanza, imagery is the dominant device and noun structures prevail, this stanza is characterized by strong statements and powerful verbs. \\"Stripped,\\" \\"concealed,\\" \\"made it fresh\\" are positioned either at the beginning or the end of lines, and in sequence they make a set of structural parallels. This compels us to recognize their weight in the meaning-making process.IIIThere would still remain the never-resting mind,So that one would want to escape, come backTo what had been so long composed.The imperfect is our paradise.Note that, in this bitterness, delight,Since the imperfect is so hot in us,Lies in flawed words and stubborn sounds.If the last stanza closes with a litotes or an understatement in which one's desire is expressed by negating its opposite (\\"a world of white and snowy scents\\"), this stanza will directly address that keen desire of \\"the never-resting mind\\": \\"one would want to escape, come back / To what had been so long composed.\\" Again and again in this poem, Stevens plays upon opposition and apposition. We have encountered \\"Stripped\\" and \\"concealed,\\" \\"evilly-compounded\\" and \\"vital\\" before, and now the oxymoronic \\"escape\\" and \\"come back to\\" again force us to pause and think hard. \\"What had been so long composed\\" sounds like a Nietzschean cosmos, whose nut is hollow and lacking any purpose or unity. It also reminds us of the Shakespearean motto: \\"This is an art, which does mend nature, change it rather, but the art itself is nature\\" (Winter's Tale).\\"The imperfect is our paradise\\" invites multiple readings as well. The first thing comes to mind is the famous biblical allusion. Since the fall, Adam and Eve had been expelled from the perfect Eden and living in the far-from-perfect earth. So, from the start human beings are destined to accept imperfection as our living paradise. This sentence also echoes the Robert Browning quote \\"A man's reach should exceed his grasp,\\" suggesting that poetry writing is a tantalizing project. To achieve artistic perfection, one should attempt even those seemingly impossible things, despite all necessary pains and suffering. Moreover, \\"imperfect\\" in Latin means \\"unfinished.\\" By brings back the etymological meaning of \\"imperfect,\\" Stevens revisits the Whitmanian theme: \\"Nothing is final, he chants. No man shall see the end.\\"This imperfect world demands an imperfect language, that is to say \\"flawed words and stubborn sounds.\\" The closing sentence starts with an imperative expression \\"Note that\\" and takes on the tone of an academic lecture. The shift of pronouns from \\"one\\" or \\"I\\" to \\"our\\" or \\"us\\" strengthens this sense of reaching out to others. As the poem moves towards closure, it is getting more and more disturbing, and the reader can feel a profound malaise on the part of the poet. Again, \\"bitterness\\" and \\"delight\\" are set in opposition, suggesting a puzzling psychic construction. \\"The imperfect is so hot in us\\" means the desire for imperfection is so fierce in us. \\"Hot\\" is used to contrast the earlier \\"cold\\" (\\"Cold, a cold porcelain\\"), and both words can apply respectively to their core meaning and extended meaning. \\"Lies\\" is an even more intriguing polyseme: delight tells us untruth in flawed words and stubborn sounds, and also consists in such words and sounds. In \\"Notes Toward a Supreme Fiction,\\" Stevens brings forward three fundamental functions of poetry: It Must Be Abstract; It Must Change; It Must Give Pleasure. So, he shares Shelley's view that joy is what poetry emanates from (\\"A Defense of Poetry\\"). Yet such a joy is achieved by flawed words and stubborn sounds, in other words, the stylistic eccentricity and strangeness in Stevens's word choice and his experiment with the musical quality of poetry.Finally, in what sense do we know Stevens? Stevens is a poet of profound subjectivity. He is always working on wordplays, suggestions and subtlety. He is endless. We go down and down and down, and cannot reach the bottom, and would still want more and need more. He carries us so deep into nature and art and their intricate interplay."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"Wallace Stevens is one of those rare writers who had a golden touch with words -- musical words, spellbinding imagery, and no boundaries to keep anyone from enjoying it. \\"The Palm at the End of the Mind : Selected Poems and a Play\\" brings together many of his best works, starting early in his writing career and stretching through the years.Over his lifetime, Stevens wrote several books of poetry, but his exquisite poems are best taken by themselves: the languid splendour of \\"Sunday Morning,\\" the spare eloquence of \\"Man With A Blue Guitar,\\" and the hymnlike grandeur of \\"Le Monocle De Mon Oncle.\\" (\\"I know no magic trees, no balmy boughs,/No silver-ruddy, gold-vermilion fruits./But, after all, I know a tree that bears/A semblance to the thing I have in mind.\\")This volume also contains his little-known one-act play, \\"Bowl, Cat and Broomstick.\\" Like many of his non-poetic works, this play deals with the nature of poetry, and is in the form of a dialogue between three seventeenth-century characters. It's part parody, part analysis. And while it's a bit weird, it's certainly worth reading.Wallace Stevens began publishing poetry at an importance time in writing history, when the older styles were falling away. But instead of ignoring one type of poetry in favor of another, he took the best of all kinds -- his verse combines Victorian opulance with the more modern free-form verse.Though he isn't as well known as Yeats or Williams, Stevens' poetry is one of the few kinds that is both technically good and emotionally rich. His poetry can be whimsical (\\"Every time the bucks went clattering/Over Oklahoma/A firecat bristled in the way\\"), but it is also meditative and philosophical, even tackling the nature of reality.If nothing else, Stevens' writing can be read just because it is exquisitely beautiful. He lavished details all over almost every poem he wrote; his style tends to be a bit on the ornate side -- Stevens freely uses the more exotic terms -- such as \\"opalescence,\\" \\"pendentives\\" and \\"muleteers\\" -- wrapped up in complex verse, sometimes with a rhyme scheme and sometimes free-form.\\"The Palm at the End of the Mind\\" is a wonderful collection of Wallace Stevens' most significant long poems, his underrated play, and his equally important smaller ones. A must-have."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"This is a review of this particular collection, not of Stevens' poetry; others have done that. I'll just say that T.S. Eliot and W.B. Yeats were once my favorite 20th century poets, but I have come to rate Stevens ahead of both. You could spend the rest of your life on Stevens and die knowing that you did not exhaust what was to be found there.This compilation of Stevens' poems was selected by his daughter, Holly Stevens. The poems are a selection, not the author's complete works, and they are presented in the order in which they were written. I like the book for the way the poems are presented on the page, with lots of white space around them available for penciling in your own notes; that's something you are likely to do a lot of with Stevens' poetry. (Then changing your mind, erasing, and writing new notes...)But otherwise the Library of America volume is to be preferred, because it is complete, not a selection, and because the poems are organized by the successive books of poems Stevens published. That edition also contains letters and other ancillary material of interest. But the LOA volume also has very thin pages and little margin space for notations. So, I've got the LOA volume for reference and this \\"Palm\\" volume for notations. Works out pretty well, and between the the two you have just about everything."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"Stevens is an uncommon writer in that much of his greatest work he produced late in his lifetime. Perhaps its depth, maturity, and beautiful language result in some part from this fact. His poetry is delightful to read and hear, wrought with powerful imagery and provocative questions about art, the world, and reality. I find myself reading certain poems regularly, over and over again.The Palm at the End of the Mind is a great collection, though it includes little more than Stevens' selected works - nothing in the way of comments, direction, or information about particular poems nor about Stevens and his views."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"The Palm at the End of the Mind is the book referenced by Harold Bloom in his great study: Wallace Stevens, The Poems of Our Climate. Bloom's book attempts a full commentary upon nearly all of Stevens' poetic canon, and might prove to be helpful to understanding this difficult poetry. Palm does contain works not found in his Collected Poems, and it seems to be much cheaper in used condition than when I bought it years ago. If you want to undertake this journey: get Palms and Bloom and good luck -- the journey is worthwhile."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"I feel it's always hard for a new reader to approach a writer like Stevens--erudite, difficult, and brilliant in the extreme. One of Stevens' prime concerns, or so it strikes me, is the interplay between reality and poetry, and what must happen for a poem to come into existence--and what is left of reality once a poem has been completed. The poems that come to mind as I write this are, of course \\"The Idea of Order at Key West,\\" easily one of his best short poems; \\"The Man with the Blue Guitar\\"; and some of the \\"Metaphor\\" poems. But really, epistemological concerns drove all of Stevens' work, and we end up with thoughtful analyses that in retrospect strike the reader as disguised philosophical inquiries, such as \\"The Snowman.\\" One of my personal favorites is \\"Domination of Black,\\" concerning a narrator who senses an ominousness revolving around the images of hemlock trees in the darkness, and the sounds of peacocks crying, and feels terrified.Some cantankerous reviewers have labeled Stevens an obscurantist, or even a writer of absolute nonsense. Please do not believe this kind of bad hype. Stevens never received the praise or prestige awarded to Eliot, Pound, or Frost, and as such he is not as widely known, but can easily be grouped in with them as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"This collection of writings by one of America's most important 20th century poets is giving me tremendous personal pleasure and is invaluable to anyone who cares about poetry. I can do no better than quote Harold Bloom, one of America's most important critics: \\"[It] will be the definitive text for students and readers of Wallace Stevens for several decades. ... Here is the indispensable presentation of a central American poet, the best and most representative of our time.\\" An editor and colleague of mine years ago reported visiting Hartford Fire Insurance company, where Stevens was a vice president for years, and seeing a collection of his correspondence. One letter responded to an agent who had written to the company complaining of some policy or other. At the end of a gracefully typed response (\\"My dear sir, you must understand . . .\\" and more to that effect), Stevens had appended a note in his own handwriting:\\"In other words, up yours.\\" The same combination of grace, directness and humor abounds in these wonderful poems."},{"Title":"The palm at the end of the mind: Selected poems and a play","review":"I have had a love affair with Wallace Stevens' work and &quot;The Palm at the End of the Mind&quot; for almost three decades.

In fact I skimmed over the majority of the book without really reading it.That being said I know for a fact that greatness is around the corner. I used to read &quot;Spirit&quot; stories when they were published by Kitchen Sink Press in the early 80's. At the time the stories that they reprinted were after Will Eisner had perfected his Spirit creation. Not his early material.I have no regrets for buying this book. I kind of expected the begining to be a little rough and ragged. I bought the book because I wanted to see the true beginings of the Spirit - warts and all. In the next few volumes I expect to see what I remember reading years ago. Wonderful, entertaining stories where a master has found his stride and produces fabulous comic material."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"Eisner was a genius. The Spirit Archives are a great collectors series. If anyone wants to see where comic books came from, this is certainly a place they want to stop and see. But to comprehend the Spirit you will have to read a TON of volumes.

However, I found it to be so incredibly racist that I was literally embarrassed to be reading it. I realize that there were different standards in the 40's, but this is completely over the top. In addition, I later researched the series more thoroughly and found that Eisner never really came to terms with his own racism later in life. I will admit that the art is great and groundbreaking--but the level of bigotry and sexism in the book canceled out any artistic merit for me."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"This volume should be required reading for anyone who isinterested in the art of innovative graphic storytelling. Although'The Spirit' newspaper strip didn't hit its peak until around 1948, these 31 stories from 1940 still contain the seeds of greatness scattered on every page. At first glance, the art is in a 'classic' style similar to that of other 'Golden Age' illustrators such as Bill Everett, Bob Kane or Alex Toth. But although Eisner is using a fairly rigid 9-panel page layout, each panel is brimming with new ideas, techniques and perspectives. Even at this early stage, Eisner is already a consummate storyteller, and although these stories are not as 'dark' as some of the post-war Spirits, he is already displaying his mastery of light and shade, both in terms of story and artwork. It's ironic that at a time when Marvel are happy to reprint the greatest works of their founding creators(Lee, Kirby, Ditko) as cut-price black &amp; white paperbacks, DC have committed themseleves to publish this series of 15 hardback volumes over the next 5 years, to showcase the work of a man who (as far as I know) has never even worked for them. Hopefully their efforts will bring the adventures of the Spirit to a new generation of readers, following in the footsteps of people like Jim Warren &amp; Dennis Kitchen. Oh, and don't let the fact that this is called an 'archive' edition put you off - these stories are as vibrant today as when they were first published. Happy 60th birthday, Denny Colt."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"Others have talked about Eisner's remarkable talent, even in this early volume. The paper is nice, the three articles in the beginning (one by Eisner, one by Alan Moore, one by someone else whose name I don't remember) are nice. But there's a problem: Since the strips are seven pages long, every other story starts on the left page. But they originally were on the right! Eisner had a great eye for layouts, and this includes facing pages. This effect is killed in every other story. I hope this oversight is corrected future editions, especially the later, more visually impressive strips."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"I feel about the first volume of the &quot;Spirit Archives&quot; the way I feel about Takahashi's &quot;Lum: The Perfect Collection&quot;... both books are worth having for fans because they give fans a glimpse into the evolution of the creator's style and story-telling abilities. However, there is no question that later works produced after the creator found his or her voice are far better from a pure entertainment viewpoint.Volume One of DC's &quot;The Spirit Archives&quot; is primarily interesting for the glimpse into the evolution of master storyteller Will Eisner's grasp of his style and craft. There are some glimmers of the greatness that the Spirit strip will eventually display, but from the jaded eye of 60 years past, the stories in this volume are merely remarkable because they... well, were 60 years ahead of their time.Even in its earliest stages, Eisner's &quot;The Spirit&quot; shorts were heads and shoulders above the vast majority of its comic contemporaries and even much of what creators are putting out today. Volume Two, which apparently won't be available through Amazon until next month, even more of the gem that is emerging as Eisner and his assistants continue to improve. The most remarkable thing about the tales in that book is that even the ones that are very clearly tied to the politics of the time (Spirit battles a number of facist agents and even tries to convince Hitler of the error of his ways), remain powerful and entertaining tales where many other such comic book adventures fall flat when read today. Further, Silk Satin puts in her first couple of appearances. She was nifty from the very beginning. :)This is not the first time a publisher has brought the masterful Spirit comics to light, but it is the first time an effort has been made to print ALL of them, in order. My hat is off to DC Comics for giving everyone the chance to enjoy this cornerstone of American comic book history in its entirety. I hope this venture becomes the commercial success it deserves to be... because I want to own all 15 volumes of the series."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"I had read the Spirit in the late forties when it origianlly came out. Recently I have had the pleasure of buying from Amazon and reading Volumes 12-16. These are supposed to represent the best work of Will Eisner. However, to talk about the later books and contrast them with those by Eisner before he went into the army is unfair. I have just read the first two volumes and liked them much better than some of the other reviewers. The original Spirt seems more edgy, more dangerous like The Batman. Those after the war are a bit light hearted. I like them all and want to make an observation. I am a James Bond fan, especially of the first two Bond stars. Sean Connery's original Bond is the most edgy, hardest to predict, and despite the one liners he has a mission you would be afraid to cross. Roger Moore's Bond is more like the Spirit after the war years. More light hearted, even a little campy at times. There is enough enjoyment in the character of The Spirit that I will likely try some of the archives during the war years as done by other artists and writers. After all, Superman and Batman have had many different writers and artists, most very very good. So this is something I need to judge for myself."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"I had not read much of the earlier Spirit stuff until I got this book. I'm giving this four stars based on what the Spirit became after a couple of years. The stories in this book run from serviceable to quite good, and Eisner's art grows by leaps and bounds over the six months of comics presented here. By the end of the book you can see that Eisner has figured out the formula for the Spirit quite well. The layouts start to resemble what we think of as an &quot;Eisner splash page&quot; and everything really congeals after a couple of months' worth of stories. My only wish is that they could have reprinted the other stories as well. Maybe once DC gets done reprinting all the essentials from the Golden Age, they'll focus on the things that everyone has forgotten about."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"The Spirit Archives Vol. 1 isn't bad... when compared to other Archive volumes from the era, it actually quite good. It's just that it's not particularly good for The Spirit. The story-telling is certainly competent enough, but the strip really hasn't found its voice. Still, it's good fun watching the various pieces of the strip fall into place: the supporting characters, the splash pages, Eisner's developing technique, etc.If you're looking to sample The Spirit to see what all the fuss is about, you might want to skip this one. The book's charms are much more evident in Vol. 2-4... and Eisner really wouldn't hit his stride until he returned to the book with Vol. 12."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"The Spirit Archives contains reprints of Will Eisner's early Spirit comics. I was pleasantly surprised by the comic. The Spirit is really reporter Denny Colt, who everyone believes to have been killed, but is really alive and now hiding in the local cemmetary and emerging to fight crime. The Spirit is the kind of hero I prefer. He uses judo or whatever kind of fighting technique would work as well as Mac Gyver like on the spot gadgets to fight crime. He doesn't have super powers. So he's kind of like a normal guy, except for he is extremely talented.Things I liked about The Spirit: The crazy villains. There is a new one almost every episode, and they range from an ape with a human brain to a lovesick clown. The Black Queen is also nice. She is kind of like an evil master-mind who also dresses in evil villain costumes and runs around personally doing evil and looking hot. Also the comics are nice because the plots vary a whole lot from episode to episode.Things I didn't like: The editing is really tight. Because The Spirit came out once a week on 7 pages and they tried to fit a whole story into those seven pages, things are really crammed in there.Also included are a couple of brief introductions. One is a general history of the comic. The other is an introduction buy comic book writer Alan Moore, which discussed the impact of The Spirit on the genre of comics and on the young Alan Moore. These extras were interesting for me, because I hadn't heard of the comic before checking this out from the library. The Spirit is in print because it was influential on the whole comics medium. And it is still fun to read. I recommend checking out one of the books in The Spirit Archives series and if you like it then there is certainly plenty more."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"I've always been fascinated by Will Eisner's work in the comic/graphic arts. I'd caught up with some of his work sith the Spirit when some of it was being reprinted in the 70's and 80's, but that was sporadic and hit or miss at best. Although I'm a member of the Merry Marvel Marching Society I have to give DC much credit for bringing all the Sunday supplements and newer works under one colorful, bound roof. This Archive seres is nothing short of a godsend. I'm busily collecting all the volumes and will comment on them as time allows. There's one thing I want to address first about Eisner and his work.Will Eisner and hence his creation are a product of their times. America in the 1940's was a segregated, racist, mysoginist country, period, end of story. Being Black I always have paid particular attention to the portrayals of my people in art and media. While there's much to complain about with \\"Ebony White\\" (starting with his name fer chrissake) he was far more fully developed than other characters of the time. Yes he was \\"comic relief\\" but he was also a hero, a hero who saved the Spirit's bacon on more'n one occasion. He also was often the moral concience of the strip, decrying the death and destruction going on in Europe but all but ignored here in America. Over time (I've heard), Ebony's character grows up, goes to school and eventually is elected to the City Council. If this is true then you see where Eisner was going.The same could be said for his treatment of women in the strip as well. But it's obvious, even by Volume 4 that Ellen Dolan would NOT remain a ditsy blond good only for rescuing, kissing or crying. She's not Satin by any streach but she's on her way to becoming fully realised without a doubt. I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading ALL the Eisner penned stories.Worfster"},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"I've always wished to read Will Eisner's The Spirit because it's widely acknowledged like one of the most important milestones in the comic art.Now that I've almost finished reading this first volume, I totally agree with other people who love that comic. The Spirit is art!"},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 1: June 2 - December 29, 1940","review":"This is my first introduction to The Spirit. The fact that Darwyn Cooke has started up a new run of the series and Frank Miller's movie will be in theaters by next year definitely peaked my interest. I have to say, coming from a Batman fan, I think this blows the early Batman stuff away, in both story and especially artwork.Being as old as this is, I was surprised at how mature a lot of the themes were. Many of the stories deal with crime, corruption, murder, and suicide. The stories were always consistent, and while not everyone of them was brilliant, there were never any that were plain bad. What is great about Eisner's style is he introduces new characters in nearly every strip and when these were first printed it was on a weekly basis.I marveled at how he was able to come up with so many unique stories without just bringing back the same old villains again and again (most of them are killed off). In fact in some cases, The Spirit doesn't even appear until midway through the story so there's always something new to focus on. The comic strips are only 7 pages in length and so I was impressed at how much story Eisner was able to tell in such a short amount of time (granted he typically stuck to the traditional 9 page layout).Worth checking out, whether you are already a fan of The Spirit's updated stuff, or want to check it out for the first time."},{"Title":"Dance of the millions: Military rule and the social revolution in Colombia, 1930-1956","review":"Vernon Lee Fluharty is a brilliant graybeard. To this end, his 1957 publication of, \\"Dance of the Millions: Military Rule and the Social Revolution in Colombia 1930-1956,\\" is by far the best academic study of the brutal era coined \\"La Violencia\\" that I have found to date. It is a pity that contemporary Latin American scholars do not give Fluharty the full recognition that he deserves.The author spends many years in Colombia and makes significant observations. For instance, he carefully argues that the true villain of violence in Colombia is not the poor masses demanding social and land reforms but an oligarchy who conducts a wicked \\"counter-revolution\\" to make sure that the feudalistic system of privilege throughout the nation remains unchanged. Fluharty breaks new ground with his painstakingly documented thesis that the original intellectual authors of terrorism in Colombia were the rich. Ultimately, this book thoroughly documents a period of complete social failure on behalf of Colombia's political leaders from 1946 to 1956.Fluharty's well-written narrative explains that until the blood bath of 1948 Colombia had enjoyed almost forty years of relative peace and progress. Government was under civilians. The constitution was honored, the press was free, and public opinion was unshackled. And then, \\"as though at the wave of some malign wand, frightful violence swept the country. Civil liberties died, opposition parties were silenced, jails bulged with political prisoners...and terror-stricken refugees swarmed to the cities,\\" he writes.The author agrees with other main-stream historians that \\"La Violencia\\" was triggered by the mysterious April 9, 1948 murder of the beloved populist Jorge Eliecer Gaitan. However what makes Fluharty special is his honest conclusion that the bloodshed did not start in earnest until \\"a united front of oligarchs from both the Liberal and Conservative parties...temporarily discarding partisan differences, joined forces across party lines to halt land reform, labor unionism, agitation for higher wages, and other campaigns aimed at raising the general standard of living of the masses.\\" Eventually, after hundreds of thousands were butchered, the Army stepped in on June 13, 1953 to stop the civil war.Fluharty courageously exposes the strong Nazi overtones and Pro-Franco fanaticism of Laureano Gomez and the destructive, selfish motives of the Colombian Conservative Party. This is a rare book that shows how the rich in Colombia collectively turned back the clock on progressive government and replaced it with a mean-spirited and murderous police state. This University of Pittsburgh Press publication is a \\"must read\\" for all serious students of Colombian - American affairs.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"I used the Saxon books through all of my High school math courses, and think they are *the* best way to learn algebra and higher math. The key to the success is really twofold. 1) New types of problems are introduced with every lesson - but these are not drilled into the student by giving them 20 or more &quot;practice problems&quot; to do. Instead, only about 5 of the &quot;new&quot; problems are given for practice - letting the new ideas &quot;sink in&quot; over a period of days. 2) Constant review. Because the student is not burdened with lots of new ideas every lesson, the remaining homework problems are review of everything the student has done to date. This ensures that the student doesn't forget how to do the math, and makes reviewing for a test almost obsolete.I am now in graduate school, soon to get my PhD in theoretical biophysics. Learning math so well in high school put me far ahead in college. I also tutor out of the Saxon books (and others, depending on which schools the kids attend), and the Saxon kids are far ahead of the others in terms of retention and understanding.This book covers beginning calculus without labelling it as such so the students aren't scared off. Ah! Another clever ploy to get students to learn the &quot;hard&quot; stuff!"},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"I have been using Saxon mathematics for 15 years, first as a 5th-12th grade student and more recently as a tutor. This program is excellent and like one of the other reviewers I can agree that even my \\"average\\" Saxon students have significantly better mathematics skills that those students using other programs.I began using Saxon math in 5th grade. Prior to that I used a typical \\"learn and drill\\" method. A new concept was taught and drilled for 20+ problems and then the instruction moved on to another topic. By the time I reached an end of unit exam I had forgotten the early material.Then in 5th grade we changed curriculums. I didn't become a \\"math lover\\" overnight. In fact, although my math skills improved, I adamently hated math all the way through junior high. Then I began algebra. By the end of Saxon's algebra 2 textbook I loved algebra and was making high A's in my homework.A couple of years after highschool I was invited to begin tutoring math at a private school. At this point I reviewed my Saxon Algebra 1 and Algebra 2 eventually going on to study Advanced Mathematics for the fun of it. I would spend 2-3 hours a day studying math and loving every minute of it.This independant study was 2 1/2 years ago. I recently decided to attend college as a math major. Last semester I passed Calculus I near or at the top of all the Cal I classes combined. My Saxon skills gave me the tools I needed to study well and grasp rather abstract concepts.The one area that has concerned me is trigonometry. The Advanced Mathematics covered the topic quite thoroughly, however Calculus requires a lot of trig and it has been so long since I studied Advanced Math I've been afraid my professors will \\"spring\\" something on me I don't remember.Yesterday my fears were alleviated. The math department held an extra credit exam for the Cal 2 students. The exam was a trig placement exam they would like to implement in the future. Because of my other classes I didn't have time to study so I decided to \\"wing\\" it and hope my studies 2 1/2 years ago would award me at least partial credit.I'm quite pleased to say that thanks to Saxon I knew how to work every single problem on the test even though it has been 2 1/2 years since I studied trigonometry and I have not had any trig students since that time. Saxon works... Excellently.If you are considering the Saxon texts let me encourage you to read the introductions to the texts. They are quite inspiring, imparting the vision Saxon had for math.In addition students must work every problem. This is the whole reason Saxon works -- lots and lots of review. What most people fail to realize is that mathematics is like music; practice creates excellence.Finally for those concerned about Saxon's lack of a dedicated geometry text, after having tutored math for 5 years I am convinced that Saxon's integrated approach is far more effective than traditional methods. Saxon teaches geometry concepts throughout the junior high and high school grades allowing for mastery of the ideas long before the formal proofs are introduced in Advanced Mathematics. This is excellent as I believe that older students have a greater capacity to grasp the rather abstract skills required for geometric proofs.I'm very thankful for the curriculum switch in 5th grade. Because of Saxon I have transformed from a math-hating elementary student to a very succesful math major."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"I used this book for my Junior and Senior year in high school. Even though I spread it out over two years (something they recommend you do, depending on your circumstances), I didn't find it slow at all. It teaches many challenging math concepts that are quite advanced (hence the name). I took a pre-calculus course from a community college my senior year, and at least 90% of the material in the college course had already been covered in the Advanced Math book.On a side note, a lot of the word problems in this book are quite amusing."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS MANUALThe 'Solutions manual' can be a useful reference to anyone not fully comfortable with the topic and I didn't think I needed one until we did 'Algebra 1' last year. For 'Algebra 2' and now 'Advanced Math' I felt that I HAD to have it. The manual is needed because the 'normal' kit would only have 'full solutions' for the tests but the problem Answer Key book only has the correct answers for the practice and the problem sets but it does NOT show the step-by-step.The manual shows the steps you take to solve every single problem set question with the cautionary note from the authors what there is often more than one way to get to the right answer. However, the Solutions Manual tries to stay as close as possible to the methods and procedures as presented in the textbook. The early solutions to a particular type of problem show every single step while later solutions omit the simple steps.I am very happy for ordering the Solutions Manual. Even though I don't expect to use it very often, it's reassuring to have it handy, just in case. This book, while not a 'must have' component of an 'Advanced Mathematics kit' gets 5-stars for thoroughness and for 'being there when I need it'.NOTES OF CAUTIONThere are TWO main things you must check and make sure that are right before you order:- Be aware that this is NOT an essential component of an 'Advanced Mathematics Kit' even though it may help.- You will only need ONE copy, no matter how many students you may have. This should be mostly for teacher use.What you MUST have in order to be able to teach Advanced Math is:- The \\"Advanced Mathematics\\" student's textbook that includes the lessons, Glossary, Index and answers to the odd-numbered questions.- The \\"Homeschool Testing Book\\" that include the tests, reproducible test answer sheets and the answers together with the 'step-by-step' on how to get there.- The \\"Answer Key\\" booklet that has the answers to all the practice and problem sets but ONLY the answers, not the ways to get there._____________________________________________NOTES:The Dive Supplement-------------------I found theDive Cd-ROM for Saxon Advanced Math 2nd Editionto be a very useful addition to the kit. In fact I am using it this year after using the 'Algebra 1' and 'Algebra 2' editions in previous a years. Like it's the case with the Solutions Manual, you will only need one DIVE CD even if you have more than one student.It's worth noting that DIVE is NOT a Saxon product. This is a separate product that closely follows the Saxon course and you should make sure that you match the Saxon edition with the correct version of the DIVE CD.A Personal Note---------------I should say that, to us, the effectiveness of Saxon's method is no longer a matter or doubt or debate. My senior kid was awarded the 'Highest Average in Math' at his campus upon completing his 8th grade and I have little doubt that our math home study is/was a contributing factor to his being awarded the \\"President's Education Award\\" and his bing on the Honor Roll on all 4 quarters of his 8th grade. His younger brother received the same when he finished 8th grade last year. He was/is also a 'straight A math student (typical math grade average is 97-99 each term) and a Honor roll/Principal's List most of the time. I mention this because both of them used to be quite 'in the middle' as in 'mediocre' when we started with Saxon (that's what prompted me to 'take action'). Us practicing math after school clearly developed their study skills and, since math is so 'hard', it helped them master most of the other topics taught in school with ease.And, finally, and this might have fit under 'practical advice' as well, I'd like to note that doing this is NOT easy. Covering 130 lessons ad giving 32 tests calls for a VERY SIGNIFICANT investment of time and effort from both parent and children. I estimate we spent anything from 90 minutes to 2 hours per lesson and we usually 'do math' 5 to 6 days per week with a typical math study year beginning at the end of August and ending sometime early or mid-May._________________________>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;"},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"I am currently using Saxons book, and it has greatly increased my understanding about Pre Calculus. I have been using Saxon for three years (since i was in 6th grade) and have failed to find a flaw in their work. The one-star review written doesn't understand their teaching method. By having a wide variety of problems in each problem set, Saxon really gets the lesson in your head. I currently teach myself the material and have a 98 average.

This is a useful companion to an excellent math book."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"Saxon math is the best math program I have seen! The way they explain concepts is very clear and understandable. Sometimes it is tough to do all the review questions, especially if a particular type of problem is difficult. But if you don't practice it, you won't remember it! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quality math program. It is especially good for homeschool students who want to major in a math-related degree in college. If anyone is looking for more resources on homeschooling and math I would suggest visiting...for some good information. I also recommend finding a good math tutor who can help you with difficult problems."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"The book is a great guide, especially if you aren't entirely sure what you did wrong or what the next step is in a particular problem.

We are just finishing up Advanced Math and just ordered Saxon Calculus today for next school year. We also use Dr. David Shormann's DIVE CDs along with the textbook. This is a great help for teaching the new concepts in each lesson. As with all Saxon Math texts, repetition is the key, and although thirty problems a day can be daunting, we have found that our son (almost 12 years old) is able to better retain the concepts that way. Our method is to work side-by-side with him keeping an eye on the solutions manual while he is working.If at all possible, start your student off with Saxon as early as possible. This will give you much needed continuity through the levels, something very valuable for any student who may proceed at a faster pace than Public School."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"Dawg so if your ever failing \\"Euclidian\\" Geomotry just order this and you can get your homework done in about 5 minutes. hahahaha I had a 54 in Geomotry and after buying this i got my grade up to a 76. What u know about that?"},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"All I can say about this solution manual is that it is ESSENTIAL if you plan on using Saxon Advanced Math. The problems are so difficult that it's very important to have more than just the teacher's edition with only the answers but also this Solutions Manual that actually shows you how to work out the problems.We homeschooled our kids over a period of years, and Saxon Math, including Algebra 1, was always our choice for math texts. I also teach in a classical Christian school where we use Saxon Math as well. Currently, I'm teaching using Saxon Algebra 2 (2 of my own kids are in the class), as well as Advanced Math. I find that for most students, if they will take the time to read the lesson well, do all of the problems, and then rework any problems they miss then they will achieve a high degree of mastery of the material at hand.The greatest advantage of Saxon Math is that each lesson provides practice not only for the new problems but also built-in review for every kind of problem the student has previously encountered. Advanced Math is no exception to the rule that Saxon Math texts help students learn math well.However, there are difficulties with the Advanced Math that don't exist with the previous ones. Personally, I think the book tries to do too much. In the introduction the authors state that it is meant to be a two-year course, and so I have my students do of a lesson per day. This has worked out well so far, but we're still early in the book.The main problem is that in many of the lessons the book presents 2 or even 3 difficult concepts all in the same lesson. This makes the student's takes much more difficult, even if you only do a lesson per day.In spite of these deficiencies, if you've used Saxon Algebra 2, then Saxon Advanced Math is probably the next logical step."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"difficult to fillow. scattered, not enough guidance throughout the book. why are you asking for more thn 16 words.hope this provides you the 16 words."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"We received the book in a timely manner.

I would reccomend it to people who can't understand their common college textbooks"},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"There are some things that can only be mastered by rote and there are other things for which rote learning is simply hazardous. In this case, mathematics.First, students who successfully complete the Saxon math cirriculum don't need to worry about not scoring well on standardized tests. If this is your sole or primary concern, this or any other \\"cookbook\\" text will do. If, however, you are interested in REALLY learning mathematics, and MASTERING it, you need to abandon this cirriculum before it is too late.Saxon does not teach you math. What Saxon does is outline a recipe for any given problem, and then has the student plug-and-chug ad infinitum. This is not math. Math is more than rote computation.Math is not an instrument, like Saxon contends. Mathematics is really more of an art. Does a successful artist/painter master his delicate and difficult art by drawing the same image over and over again?Students that successfully complete this program will be left with the false impression that they have mastered mathematics when in fact they have not. They will be in a for a rude awakening when encountering higher mathematics, especially mathematics in which theory, if not necessarily trumpeting application, is equally balanced with application. You can guess as much when Saxon writes in his Algebra 2 text: \\"It is important to understand why we do things in algebra, but it is also important not to let the emphasis on understanding interfere with our ability to do.\\" NONENSE! If you know why, then you know how. And the why should always come first.Unfortunately, there aren't any alternative texts, so far as I know, that I can heartily recommend. So all I can suggest is that the serious student of mathematics look around. I did this for Calculus, and came across three excellent texts by three outstanding authors: Michael Spivak, Tom Apostol, and Richard Courant. Their texts put Saxon's and all the other cookbook texts on the market to shame."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"I personally didn't like the book due to having a poor teacher that went too fast and didn't help slackers (i.e. me).

I have since mastere Advanced Mathematics and have gone on to suceed in math in College thanks to this fine book. However the book alows for no slack on the reader's part, making it unneccesarily hard to average student (i.e. me again) but easy if ou don't mind doing a set each day!"},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"I am currently in high school and am using this book. In the begining of the year I liked it, because most of the material in it was new. By the 30th lesson, there are 125 lessons in the book, most of the material is new and to learn it you need to practice it a lot, but the new problems usually show up less then four times each lesson. You do not get enough practice using this book. I am not failing my class, I have a B, and that isn't bad, but the book needs to review the new material more, because my teacher won't. This book would be great if every student had a good teacher, but very few students these days do, and I go to a private school. I didn't care too much for the old books where I had to do 40 problems a night of new and hard problems, but then at least I learned it. With this book by the time you have had the proper amount of practice with each problem you have already tested on it and are strugeling with new stuff. I just love it when the book tells me to just use my graphing calculator for certain types of problems, but dosn't say how to put them into the calculator. So in conclusion I think that learning advanced mathematics by incremental development is one of the worst ways to learn advanced mathematics."},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematics: An Incremental Development : Home Study (Homeschool Advanced Math)","review":"The Advanced Math book did arrive, but its condition was much more delapidated than expected, cover was quite marred and corners very worn, many pages inside were written on, and an unremoveable sticker was on the front.

I have been through many similar books, so much of the material was familiar, but there was also a great deal that was fresh and new for me. The book touches on some acoustic, auditory and physiological issues, but its main thrust is articulatory phonetics. It includes many excellent line drawings of the vocal tract.The book gets off to something of a slow start, since there is a lot of background material somewhat peripheral to phonetics itself in the first three chapters, comprising part I. The main topics covered are semiotics, the different levels of speech production, and accent and dialect. It is all useful, but it left me anxious to get to the meat of the book.Laver's use of Pike's 'contoid' and 'vocoid' categories sounded a bit sci-fi to me, but it's good to see familiar concepts analyzed in a somewhat different way. Laver will often spend time citing examples of unusual sounds, e.g. linguo-labials, where other books either omit or gloss over them quickly. The index of languages (Appendix II), is very helpful in putting into context some of the more exotic languages the examples come from. I especially appreciated the section on pulmonic ingressives (p. 168-170) since I had observed examples of these myself in northern German. I hadn't heard about their use in the Formosan language Tsou before, though I live in Taiwan.Coarticulatory phenomena receive quite thorough treatment. The book also features a substantial section on prosody, an area that some other works tend to be weak in, and included in-depth examinations and discussions of duration, pitch, loudness, stress, and rate of speech.The content, organization, and writing of this book are impeccable, and always clear. The only one slight drawback I found is the book's rigorous academic style, which is mainly a strength, but it can make for rather dry reading. Chapter 8, 'Stop articulations', and chapter 13, 'Intersegmental co-ordination' were longer than the other chapters, and dragged a bit for me.Overall, I recommend this book highly as part of the canon every aspiring phonetician should cover, though I wouldn't choose this as a first work to read in phonetics - Ladefoged goes down more easily, in my view. _Principles_ is, however, a very rich and definitely worthwhile reference to have in your personal linguistics library."},{"Title":"Sadler's Wells Ballet at Covent Garden;: A book of photographs","review":"The period covered in Merlyn Severn's photographs is appropriately reflected in the sepia intensity and soft edged images of the Sadlers Wells Ballet in various dances from their repertoire. My husband is in a number of them and would not have been in the Company, but for the war which took away a number of the Company's male dancers.This was the time before the Sadlers Wells Company finally took up permanent residence at Covent Garden and became the Royal Ballet. There was an emphasis on dramatic works. During the war and reconstruction period, people sought escapism and beauty. The Ballet was immensely popular and served a useful purpose apart from providing employment for dancers.It is a delight to have a book which records in images this special moment of flux which flourished to a future flowering in British dance history."},{"Title":"The Middle Passage: White Ships/ Black Cargo","review":"The art of this book speaks loudly.

The absence of words intensified the images on the pages by letting them speak for themselves.I particularly thought that the black and white (of the images as well as the intentional black/white of the figures in the images) was extremely powerful.

I would advise against simply handing the book to a child without being prepared to undergo the painful process of explaining the meaning of the narrative relayed by Feelings.

The novel was considered groundbreaking when it first came out because it addressed rape and introduced themes of female homosexual desire in ways that were very subversive of the patriarchal regime of Franco's Spain.I keep mentioning Franco, but this doesn't mean a young woman growing up today would find Julia's coming-of-age story impossible to relate to. Forty years after the novel was written, women who grow up in societies that consider themselves a lot more liberated than Franco's fascist Spain still get initiated into the world of human sexuality through violent invasion of their bodies. They still feel unable to inscribe themselves into a demanding standard of \\"correct\\" femininity and struggle to reconcile their love of learning with living in a world that only accepts them as pretty, silly, and passive. They still often discover that experiencing queer desire marginalizes them.The masterpieces of Spanish literature don't get translated into English as much as they should. As a result, people who don't speak Spanish are deprived of partaking in the joy and the beauty of these great works of literature. It's good to know that Ana Maria Moix's Julia will not join the ranks of books that are inaccessible to an English-speaking reader."},{"Title":"Adventures in Religious Life","review":"This book is based on 15 magazine articles the author wrote in Prabuddha Bharata, Vedanta Kesari and Vedanta for East and West.

Some of the chapter headings are about religious symbols, obstacles to religious life, super consciousness, types of salvation, self effort and divine grace.Other world religions are quoted to support the harmony of religions theme.

They have made use of alot of what they write as well."},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"For some reason the entire line up of Richard Herman's books appeared on my favourite bookseller's shelves a year or so ago, at ridiculously low prices. I was intrigued, and laid out the necessary bucks.Well - it was worthg it. In fact, twice the price would have been fair. Not, of course, that I'm complaining.&quot;Force Of eagles&quot; is the second of Herman's books, and it's a great yarn. Tautly plotted, with excellent airborne and land battle sequences, the action's non-stop. The concentrated action, however, doesn't interfere with the development of a bunch of likeable characters.Yes folks, it's battle time, and the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad. (OK, so they're a little cliched. But hey... get with the picture. They are the bad guys, after all!)The scenario's realistic (Herman must have war-gamed the action a number of times) and is told from a number of perspectives: the pilots, the ground-crew, the medics, the CO and his staff, the odd civilian.Good stuff... as good as Dale Brown, without the political posturing of the letter."},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"This is the first book I picked up by Herman ( I just happened to see the F-15 Eagle on the cover while browsing a bookstore). I have re-read this book so many times the binding is coming loose! I had to go back and read his first novel The Warbirds and have added it and every book since Force of Eagles to my collection. If you like reading about the military and the Air Force in paticular, Herman is the author for you! Lots of action scenes as well as political background information. A general synopsis of the book would be what could have happnened had the U.S. lost the Gulf War."},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"Really enjoyed the realistic radio chatter and des-criptions of what it's like in the cockpit. Charac-tersseemed a little wooden and almost caricatures. But still a fun read.still a fun read.Is this the same Dick Herman whoflew with the Gunfighters @ DaNang Circa '70? Ifso please contact Miami Sammy @aginghipez@aol.com."},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"Force of Eagles is the follow-up to the author's previous book, The Warbirds, and follows the thorough preparation and countdown (the suspense to the rescue gets ratcheted up notch by notch with the chapters entitled &quot;D MINUS 25&quot;, D MINUS 24&quot; and so on) to the actual rescue, and there is plenty of action both in the ground as well as in the air. A good read"},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"Bought this book for Father In Law,.He enjoyed it.It arrived in Az. in good shape.It arrived when it was suppose too."},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"If you enjoy fiction that carries the characters from one book to another you'll enjoy this one. It will also temp you to read the other books about the characters."},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"I made the mistake of taking this book with me on a summer study trip to England. I'm convinced that I missed a lot of good exploring/study time because I couldn't stop reading it. Richard Herman is a master at creating real-to-life characters and making the reader feel a connection to them. Also, his knowledge and descriptions of military tactics and detail really shine through without losing the less-informed reader. I recommend this and other Richard Herman books to both rabid fans and dabblers in the genre."},{"Title":"Force of Eagles","review":"The genral at the pentogon is very mad because he wants his people out of prison. he does not care who does the job.

THIS book is the best i would recomend this book to any one."},{"Title":"Children & books","review":"I have used the past four editions for a children's lit course for several years. The first five chapters provide an overvierw of approaching kid lit and a history of the field and its illustrators. The remainder has summaries of some 2000 books in various genres, areas and age ranges. The greatest aspect, and terrific for teaching or discussion, are the highlighted/boxed commentaries by various authors and experts. The appendices have lists of awards as well as short discussions on other media, getting kids and books together and censorship (boo, hiss.) A great text and invaluable resource."},{"Title":"Smoke Above the Lane","review":"Even if you hate skunks, you will love this book! My motherfirst read it to me when i was in grade school, and even now,in high school i still love it! It is about a little skunk who&quot;adopts&quot; a tramp, and follows him everywhere, even into thedreaded town! It is hillarious and at the same time touching.Worth the read!"},{"Title":"Smoke Above the Lane","review":"Way back in the middle of the last century, my sixth grade teacher, Myrtle Fife, started to read this story to us. She got as far as (SPOILER) the part where the tramp and the baby skunk were locked in a boxcar and had run out of food and water. At that point she looked up and saw that we were all sobbing, so she never finished reading the rest of the book to us. And I've always wondered what happened to the tramp and the skunk, so I bought a copy and discovered that it is not a sad story at all, but a very happy and loving one. So now I know."},{"Title":"Little Black, A Pony","review":"I had read this book as a young child, and always hoped that I would someday be able to find it again. I assumed it was long since out of print. However, one day I decided to look it up on Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised that it was in print and available. A picture of the original version was shown, but a newer version was being sold on Amazon. This newer book is a Native American version. The story seems to be exactly as I remember it, but with a Native American boy instead of the original Caucasian characters, and the story is written both in English and translated into Navajo. I would still love to get my hands on the original book, because that is the one I loved and remembered as a little girl, but I have to say this Navajo version is beautifully illustrated, and the story is the same. I think I love it more. When I first read the book in the sixties and in a small town in Maine, it was a very different time. I'm sure a lot of the material I read involved white main characters. Now I am so pleased that children are learning that we are diverse and that our differences can be celebrated! The theme of the book is the main thing, which is to appreciate that everyone is worthy and capable of doing special things, regardless of their physical differences. The boy in the story learns an important lesson after he casts aside his little black pony for the big red horse that can do so much more. Little Black, despite his size, saves the boy in a situation where Big Red could not because of his size. Children who read this book can learn to appreciate everyone for who they are, despite cultural or physical differences, or as shown in this story, the capabilities of someone based on their size."},{"Title":"Little Black, A Pony","review":"Just add me to the pack of people who loved this book as a child, and who are now reading it to their own children.One of the things I want to add to the accolades is that this makes a good book for children to read.

Ideal for learning compassion, how deeply felt are hurt feelings, and how to fix them. Weighs the importance of ego vs humility, easily discernable and also appeals to a child's sense of ineptitude which arises naturally from his or her vulnerability as a child. Always a \\"first choice\\" if it hasn't been read in a while, and always a great pick for instilling confidence on difficult days, reminding both parents and adults that everyone is special, and that everyone has value, and can be productive and useful. A wonderful story of intimacy and rescue to which children instantly relate and appreciate, setting a foundation for lifelong compassion in the dignity of others, and respect for their emotions."},{"Title":"Little Black, A Pony","review":"I read this book as a small child, and I credit it for my voracious appetite for books today.

PLEASE REPRINT THIS CLASSIC STORY!"},{"Title":"Little Black, A Pony","review":"This sweet little book tells the story of a little boy and his pony, Little Black. The boy loves his pony, but one day he decides to try and ride a horse named Big Red. Big Red can run faster, jump higher and is in general more exciting to ride than Little Black. But each time Big Red is chosen over Little Black, Little Black gets sadder and sadder, until he runs away one winter morning. The boy rides Big Red to try and get his pony, and ends up trying to cross a frozen river. The ice breaks under Big Red and the two fall. Big Red manages to escape to the bank, but cannot save the boy. Little Black finally finds something he can do that Big Red can't, and saves the boy's life. The little boy then pledges to ride only Little Black from now on, and the book ends.The story is told form the little boy's point of view. It flows very well; with only one or two spots I would have phrased something differently. The author also tends to use short sentences; \\"Then I saw something on the bank. Something in the trees! It was Little Black. He saw me in the water.\\"The illustrations in this book are wonderful. Everything -the horses and people- is very expressive. You can see the sadness in Little Black when the boy doesn't ride him. You can see the boy's fear when he is in the river. You can see Little Black's pride in saving him. All these emotions are portrayed beautifully. The pictures are not very detailed, but they are shaded wonderfully. The illustrator must have been very knowledgeable about horses as well, as these horses look alive. It is a great book with a sweet plot, great pictures and flowing words.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"Title":"Little Black, A Pony","review":"I made my family read this book to me so often that I had memorized it by the time I was three years old.

Moray was recruited in Glasgow, Scotland, to be a crewmember on a rum ship that brought 20,000 cases of liquor to New York. On his voyage, he endured terrible storms and witnessed fistfights. Crossing the Atlantic in itself was an ordeal, but selling the cargo while evading the law was an equal challenge. Moray shares the inside tricks of smuggling, such as secret codes and price setting, giving the reader a glimpse of the dangerous, highly-corrupt world of the rum-runner.

First...the involving storyline. While reading this book, I actually felt drawn into the world of Magnamund more so than in the first book. Every plot-twist and crucial desicion pulled me farther in. The book begins with you, Lone Wolf, last of the Kai Lords, about to embark on a quest to recover the legendary Sommerswerd, the Sword of the Sun. Only a handful of your ancestors have wielded this magical blade, and you need it to repel the hordes of Zagarna, Lord of Kaag and the leader of the evil armies assailing Sommerlund, your home country. This adventure takes you across water, wasteland and whatever else you need to go over to get to Durenor and recover the Sword. Aided by few allies against innumerable foes, you must succeed in brining the legendary artefact home, lest your country fall to the might of the Darklords. Only you can suceed...you are Lone Wolf"},{"Title":"Fire on the Water (Lone Wolf, No. 2)","review":"The second book in the Lone Wolf series, Fire on the Water is chronicled in novel format in the two books The Tides of Treachery and The Sword of the Sun (formerly published together as The Sword of the Sun). The armies of the evil Darklord Zagarna, Archlord of the Black City, are encroaching upon your home country, Sommerlund, aided by the magical help of the Doomstones and the evil sorcerers called the Nadziranim. But your most dangerous foe is not of an inhuman empire: he was one of your countrymen, and he has revealed the deepest secrets of Sommerlund. Orchestrating the destruction of the Kai and much of Sommerlund, Vonotar the Traitor is possibly the most powerful magician in the world of Magnamund, for he has bound both good and evil magic together.Only one thing can save your assaulted country: the Sword of the Sun. Given to Sommerlund's ally Durenor, you must travel to Durenor to retrieve the age old symbol of friendship and return-to destroy Darklord Zagarna.But more than one thing stands in your way: Vonotar, distracted in another dimension by the forces of good, has learned that he did not destroy all of the Kai on the first day of Spring: you managed to escape due to divine interventions. Bent on destroying you, and therefore the only hope of Sommerlund, Vonotar has put enemies everywhere, some unkillable by your own sword. Your enemies will appear in all forms: from a mysterious cloaked person to your friends.Can you survive the agents of the Darklords, the Tunnel of Tarnalin, and the wild city of Ragadorn, claim the Sommerswerd, meet Magnamund's most powerful sorcerer face to face, and return home alive?

I found the adventure in this book to be not very exciting. However, there were some great aspects of this book that only start to unveil the potential for the entire series. For example, there is a part where you have to choose attack someone at a table in a tavern. You must choose who to attack by a picture in the book. I thought this was incredibly neat because not only are you choosing the direction of your adventure based on descriptions and visuals.Basically, the quest is to find the Sommerswerd and bring back an army to Holmgard. You meet many interesting characters along the way and fight some evil beings. Although there were times when I was bored in this adventure, it does have a nice conclusion to the introductory phase of the Lone Wolf adventures. I'm sure this book was much more exciting prior to reading all of the others many years ago.Lastly, this adventure series can be fun for youngsters and adults as well. I am looking forward to the time when I have young children and we can explore the world of Magnamund together. This book does a great job creating situations that promote imagination and stimulation of the mind.It only gets more epic from this point on. You are the last of the Kai warriors. Good luck!Finally, Joe Dever has authorized the free distribution and licensing of his Lone Wolf series which are available online. This resource has the unabridged editions which makes it great. I will not give out the URL as part of the reviewers agreement but with a little searching you should be able to find it. I still enjoy using the paper versions but it is still a fantastic resource."},{"Title":"Fire on the Water (Lone Wolf, No. 2)","review":"The LoneWolf series created by Joe Dever are probably the best fighting fantasy books ever written. The book #2 that is Fire on water is far better than the first one Flight from the Dark. Book #1 was too easy and short ,it took me about 40 minutes to finish it but it took me more time to finish book #2 that's just because it's much better than the first one. You'll become immediately addicted when you start reading the book, there are so many possibilities in different kinds of environment. I read it over and over again without gettting bored it's so brilliantly written. Dever takes you to a world that you are eager to explore and you won't stop until you've examined every single square feet with a magnified glass therefore I rate this book 10 it's simply the best."},{"Title":"Fire on the Water (Lone Wolf, No. 2)","review":"Este libro se podr&iacute;a decir que marca la pauta de la historia de toda la serie.

To me, Kuteva's \\"auxiliation\\" is a case of differentiation of the lexicon that takes place in the community of the differing personalities of speakers and hearers.In Kuteva's vocabulary \\"auxiliation\\" is one case of the grammaticalization of new meanings in old lexical items. Languages differentiate meanings of space and direction into meanings of intention. English \\"going to\\" is an example.She is going to the park soon (space, direction)She is going to marry soon (space, purpose)She is going to wake up (future)Differentiation occurs in a \\"chain,\\" Kuteva says, in which the \\"discourse world\\" of speaker and hearer convert bodily posture to spatial position, then to continuative, durative, progressive auxiliation.Four \\"chains\\" are verb to tense, aspect, and mood (shorthand: TAM).1) Desemanticization of the chain2) Decategorization of the chain3) Cliticization of the chain4) Erosion of the chainDifferentiation occurs in \\"context absorption.\\" This means that speakers and hearers may reinterpret an implication of an utterance as the meaning of the utterance.Kuteva writes that a \\"conceptual-semantic scenario underlying\\" auxiliation may involve:1) Metaphor: \\"I am going to work\\" (location, linearity, moving away)2) Metonymy: Russian \\"Ja stanu robatat\\" [literally, \\"I become to work\\") means \\"I'll get to working.\\" (The verb \\"stat\\" uses state to express an initial phase.)3) Locative construction continuous-->durative-->progressive(a) Ich bin am Bahnhof(b) Ich bin am Arbeiten.Differentiation has direction, but not just one direction, in Kuteva's view. Received wisdom posits a uni-directional hypothesis, in which items that have concrete, specific meaning develop abstract, general meanings. But \\"concrete/abstract\\" and \\"specifi/general\\" are different dimensions [pattern variables].For example, in Alicante Spanish the hodiernal past is losing the specific feature of relevance to the present day (generalizing) but gaining the specific feature of remoteness from the present day.Differentiation proceeds by mismatch and repetition among speakers and hearers. Differences in knowledge among speakers and hearers provide \\"context absorptions\\" for new forms. This reviews Haiman's Talk is Cheap (1998) on the unintended consequences of ambiguous speech.Kuteva does not mean mere ignorance and error by \\"mismatch.\\" Rather \\"mismatch\\" means that various intentions are contained in the speaker's and hearer's \\"discourse world knowledge.\\"Readable and logically argued."},{"Title":"Hurry monster","review":"One of the elements that I think are downplayed by some critics of Masterton are his skill to evoke feelings in the story narrative, and how this happens with the strong character building he does so well.Since this is a short story, and the copyright indicates 1988, the quality of the purchase is very high. It has 15 pages, is basically a paperback ( although high quality) and is signed by both Graham Masterton and the artist who illustrates the short story. At this time I don't know if the story has been published in later short story collections, but I hope it has been. It reminds me of the town I come from, small and using much the same vernacular, also the feel of the town is very reminiscent of my home town, so I related to it very well. But, as Masterton does so well, he doesUniversal towns in some senses, but they always have a specific place. This edition has a Christmas card by the Publisher, so I can't tell if the edition is a sort of gift for good customers, since it has photos of some young kids, and although I will scan some images from other parts to show the book, I will not scan the photo of the boys ( they are just at the beach, but it looks like a personal photo). I am intrigued that the writer and the artist signed the book, and the publisher signed the christmas card. In all respects it is a very good story, and it is a great addition to my Masterton collection. I read the Masterton UK site, and for all Masterton Collectors, if you want some references to rare items, I would suggest you check his UK site out. The prices are unfortunately toohigh for me, but I can always hope, I guess."},{"Title":"Spreadsheet Modeling and Decision Analysis W/Excel","review":"I liked the strong focus on spreadsheet design issues since I think this is the only book available concentrating on modelling network flow problems.

This volume demonstrates effective methods for defending your servers and networks from a variety of devious and subtle attacks. Within this book are examples of how to detect the presence and track every keystroke of network intruders, methods for protecting your network and data using strong encryption, and even techniques for laying traps for would-be hackers. Many important security tools are presented, as well as interesting ways for using them to reveal useful information about your network's activity. There is mention in the beginning of the book about \\"code\\", but I haven't run across any yet. The closest thing I found to code were forms of command lines for various network tools and expected typical responses. So if you are not a programmer, don't be scared away. The following is the table of contents:Chapter 1, Unix Host Security, demonstrates advanced techniques for hardening your Linux, FreeBSD, or OpenBSD server.Chapter 2, Windows Host Security, covers many important steps that Windows administrators often overlook, including tightening down permissions, auditing all system activity, and eliminating security holes that are present in the default Windows installation.Chapter 3, Privacy and Anonymity, discusses several ways to protect oneself online by offering solutions for encrypting email, remaining anonymous, and managing passwords for web sites.Chapter 4, Firewalling, shows how to set up firewalls under various operating systems, such as Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and Windows. Different filtering and firewall testing techniques are also covered in this chapter.Chapter 5, Encrypting and Securing Services, shows how provide secure services for SMTP, IMAP, POP3, Apache, and MySQL.Chapter 6, Network Security, demonstrates some tools and techniques used to attack servers using the network itself, as well as methods for preventing these attacks.Chapter 7, Wireless Security, includes only a handful of very useful hacks. Whether you want to share your network with others and still maintain a semblance of security, or lock down your wireless network with fine-grained authentication, this chapter has something for you.Chapter 8, Logging, shows you how to balance the need for information with the need for brevity by automatically collecting, processing, and protecting your system logs.Chapter 9, Monitoring and Trending, presents a number of tools and methods for watching your network and services over time, allowing you to recognize trends that will aid in future planning and enable you to tell at a glance when something just isn't right.Chapter 10, Secure Tunnels, shows you how to implement powerful VPN technologies, including IPSec, PPTP, and OpenVPN. You will also find techniques for protecting services using SSL, SSH, and other strong encryption tools.Chapter 11, Network Intrusion Detection, centers on the tremendously popular NIDS tool Snort and presents many techniques and add-ons that unleash this powerful tool's full potential. Also presented are methods for setting up your own \\"honeypot\\" network to attract and confuse would-be system crackers.Chapter 12, Recovery and Response, contains suggestions on how to verify your system's integrity, preserve evidence for later analysis, and track down the human being at the other end of undesirable network traffic.I would recommend this book to any network security professional. However, I think it is too advanced for someone who is just interested in the profession or someone who is tinkering with a home network on an amateur basis. There is no \\"beginner's material\\" to be found in this book, and it will likely be over your head if you are not already working in the field."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"First, let me make clear right off the bat, I'm leaving this review as someone who purchased this book expecting information on Windows Networks and was disappointed. A large part of why this book was a bad experience for me is that, when a book bills itself as covering both Unix and Windows, I assume it gives equal coverage to both.If you are a Unix admin this book might very well be just what you need.That said, of its 300 pages, roughly 35 of them are devoted to Windows. In those 35 pages the author pretty clearly conveys his distaste for Windows even going so far as to misrepresent certain areas of the Windows World (someone should tell the author that Windows does have a fairly powerful scripting engine). Of the Windows tips that are provided, many of them are dedicated to making Windows work with Unix in a mixed environment.Even without the coverage, it wouldn't take much to figure out the author's bias. The book is full of quotes such as \\"I know we're used to a robust, powerful scripting function in Unix but Windows doesn't have this so we have to...\\"I honestly could have forgiven most of the above if the hacks had been well marked so that I could tell which were Windows related and which were Unix related. That way I would have, at very least, had a visual way to skim the book and realize how lopsided the coverage was so that I could have been saved from purchasing it.If you're interested in Windows Security advice, I'd suggest picking up Hardening Windows by Roberta Bragg. It's a much better fit."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"I like it. It helps me to understand how it works and how I can protect my privacy from hacks"},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"This is a real go-to book for network security. The problems I usually need to solve for network security issues are not unusual. They are the kinds of things that someone has addressed before.

While I do not recommend it for those that are just getting into the System Administration and Networking field, I do believe this book should not only sit on the shelves of System Administrators, but should be used frequently for reference. The book promises 100 industrial strength tips and tools, and it delivers that and more. The book is basically a learn-by-example book, which works best for me when studying this field. The examples are very well-written, and provide many example text outputs and screenshots. The book is divided into UNIX, Windows, and network security.The first chapter covers UNIX security, which I already had a good background in, and taught me some lower-level kernel and file system security. The second chapter covers Windows security: The basics of encrypting folders, restricting users and checking for patches, and monitoring log files. In my opinion, this chapter was the weakest in the entire book. If you are looking for more in-depth Windows security, I suggest looking elsewhere. The rest of the book covers network security and its related components. This section is where the book really shines, covering everything from intrusion detection to logging and monitoring.My favorite feature of this book is that it will present you with a potential security problem and then a possible solution, but then the book will ask: what if a hacker did this or that? Asking questions in this manner gives you the proper mindset you need to start securing your systems."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"This is a nice, useful collection of 125 hacks to help secure your network and systems. If you've read a couple dozen or more other security books and spend a lot of time reading security-related websites, there isn't much in this book that you haven't already seen elsewhere. It is nice to have it all in one book though. This is well written and has proven to be a worthwhile reference on my book shelf on several occasions.I don't feel this book is suitable for absolute beginners to information security. For those without much infosec background, seek an introductory security book prior to diving into this one.The Windows coverage is very light. If you run a Windows-only network, this book doesn't offer a lot for you, but still may be a worthwhile purchase. For those running a mixed network or primarily BSD and Linux systems, it offers much more value."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"\\"Network Security Hacks\\" Second Editionby: Andrew LockhartO'Reilly Media, Inc. 2007ISBN: 10: 0-596-52763-2Network Security Hacks is more advanced than some of the other \\"Hacks series\\" books.Explains the why and how of securing your Unix, Linux, or Windows servers.

Lockhart and friends bring together a set of tips and tricks in the classic O'Reilly form, and cover a scattershot of topics that people like to know.There's over 100 hacks here, and I can't possibly cover them all. I'll pick and choose topics to illustrate why I think this book is a success. As other reviewers have noted, this book focuses on Linux and BSD security, but it does cover Windows in a decent amount. This probably reflects the community's choice of OSes (but does under represent some OS X specifics), and the availability of tools and techniques.Chapter 1, covering 20-some hacks, covers UNIX host-level security. A lot of it is stuff you've seen before, but some of it is stuff that's hard to find (ie Systrace setups, sandboxing services), or so disparate that it's nice to have it all in one place. Chapter 2 covers over a dozen hacks for Windows that are similar, securing your Windows host.The chapters on privacy (3), encrypting services (5), and tunneling (Chapter 10) are pretty good. They're tight, well written, and clear enough that an intermediate network or system administrator could do well. I liked that chapter 4 covered firewalling for PF on BSD, Linux's Netfilter, and the Windows firewall all similarly. The hacks on VPNs using various tools are great, they're clear in an amazingly short space.Network and wireless security get a fair shake, and you can even learn how to scan the network for viruses, detect ARP attacks, deploy a captive portal, and assess your systems for vulnerabilities. Again, a nice spread of topics, most of them well covered in a short space.NIDS topics get their own chapter, and things like Snort setup, maintenance, and even the basics of rule writing get covered. You'll even get an intro to Honeyd for your time.I would have liked to have seen Chapter 12 on recovery and response get a lot more time and effort, I think it's sorely needed. Perhaps if everyone writes a hack for this chapter they'll add them to the third edition.All in all a good book for a skilled, intermediate level system and network administrator. This book carries on the hacks series with style and skill, and delivers almost everything in a small package."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"Security has been high on my list of things to understand and master these past two years. Our company's firewall has been breached numerous times. This has scared the living daylights out of our stakeholders. I have therefore been forced to become an expert. This is one of the books that has helped me attain this level of understanding. It offers insights not available in regular how to guides on security."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"&quot;Network Security Hacks&quot; (NSH) has something for nearly everyone, although it focuses squarely on Linux, BSD, and Windows, in that order of preference. Administrators for commercial UNIX variants (Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, etc.) should be able to apply much of the book's advice to their environments, but they are not the target audience. NSH is written for admins needing quick-start guides for common security tools, and in this respect it delivers.I found NSH to be most rewarding when it avoided discussing the same topics everyone else has covered. Lesser known tools like authpf, ftester, sniffdet, SFS, rpcapd, and Sguil caught my interest (especially as I write Sguil installation docs). Even some ways to use familiar tools were helpful, like the -f (fork) and -N (no command) switches for SSH forwarding. In some cases it made sense to mention well-worn topics like BIND or MySQL, with an eye towards quickly augmenting the security of those servers.Elsewhere I questioned the need to cover certain tools. With the number of Snort titles approaching double digits, and O'Reilly's own Snort books in the wings, was it really necessary to devote several hacks to Snort? In the same respect, I felt mention of Nmap, Nessus, swatch, and ACID was not needed, nor was advice on implementing certain Windows security features.In some cases the descriptions were too brief to really explain the technologies at hand. For example, the &quot;Secure Tunnels&quot; chapter discusses a very specific IPSec scenario (wireless client to gateway) without informing the reader of the other sorts of tunnels that are possible. I also questioned some of the content, like p. 47's statement that Windows lacks &quot;robust built-in scripting.&quot; Brian Knittel's &quot;Windows XP Under the Hood&quot; would quickly change the author's mind. Also, the anomaly detection preprocessor SPADE is described, even though the last version (Spade-030125.1.tgz, released Jan 03) is only available on a Polish student's Web server and no longer cleanly integrates with Snort past version 2.0.5, released in Nov 03.Despite these comments, I still found NSH a great addition to my security bookshelf. I found the coverage of Windows more than adequate, given that true security innovation in the public sphere is being done in the open source world and not in Redmond's labs. The writing tends to be clear and the descriptions concise. I guarantee you will find a handful of hacks which pique your curiosity and ultimately help secure your enterprise."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"It's important to understand who this book is for. It's not for the amateur looking to configure their firewall. The book starts with locking up UNIX filesystems and doesn't turn back the complexity clock as it winds through all the way to advanced topics like Honeypots and various SSH tunneling schemes. I highly recommend this book for network administrators and security professionals looking to make sure they have all of their bases covered. However, for the personal computer user looking to make sure their DSL doesn't get hacked I cannot recommend this book."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"This book took me a long time to read, but for a good reason, I kept implementingthe various hacks in the book on a server I had started setting up.The book is mostly Unix related, but there is some Windows related \`hacks' as well.I think the Windows coverage was lacking a bit though. For Unix, it talks aboutLinux, the BSD's and a bit on Mac OS X and Solaris. Most of the topics aregeneral enough to apply to any Unix based Operating System, but some are specificto an operating system.One of the great things about the Hacks series of books by O'Reilly is that theinformation is presented in nice small chunks that you can read in a few minutesif you have some spare time.The hacks are all \`hyperlinked' to each other, if a hack mentions something thatrelates to another hack, it is highlighted in blue and the hack that itreferences is listed. I did find a few places where this wasn't done(#84 Real-Time Monitoring, first mentions Barnyard but doesn't provide anyinformation on it or mention that it is one of the later hacks).Lots of the hacks in the book could be found by doing some reading on theinternet, but finding such a variety of topics all in one place, with enoughinformation to get you started is really nice. Even though I consider myself tobe fairly security conscious, I still found quite a few things in this book thatI hadn't thought of, or plain didn't realize were possible or even existed. Iwould recommend this book to anyone that is interested in security or anyoneresponsible for maintaining a server (whether or not it is on the internet)."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"Overall, I find this book to be an enjoyable read. I thumb through it time and time again, and come up with some useful hints and tips (not really necessarily hacks though). It's more oriented toward BSD Unix and Linux, but I did find some useful hints for Windows (the current topic of my studies). I really like the plug for ntsyslod (hack 56), which can take binary event logs and route them to syslogd service. Nice. Finally, logs in Windows are now open for business.I found some material to be trivial, making problems from non-problems, or rather not practical to implement. For example, one hint advises Windows users to encrypt their temp directory (hack 28). However, there are easy workarounds to bypass EFS, and the temp directory is within a user's profile, and thus secured from other users anyhow. So encrypting it is unecessary, and not useful given users can drag a file to a floppy or non-NTFS filesystem to and bypass the encryption.One hack recommended flush the page file as some important application data might be in there (hack 29). However, this requires delving into the registry, and to implement across all workstations is too taxing. However, there could be ways to automate this through group policy objects and scripts. There's no coverage on how to automate some of these chores, which is not always straightforward in Windows.One a final note, I wish there was more coverage of Windows. There's could be equivelent coverage of things like time sychronization (hack 44) for Windows as well.Overall though, I think there are enough useful tips to make this book valuable. I've already wrote my name on this one..."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"When I first got this little book, I was unimpressed by its idea: a seemingly random collection of network security tips, combined under the same cover. However, when I started reading, more and more often I exclaimed \\"ah, that is how it is done\\", etc. The book is one cool collection of tips, ranging from mundane (\`how to configure iptables on Linux') to fairly esoteric (\`how to use MySQL as an authenticating backend for an FTP server'). Always wanted to use \`grsecurity' or \`systrace', but thought it is too complicated - grab the book and give it a shot. Want to set up a fancy encrypted tunnel between two networks - it covers that too. Admittedly, a lot of advice given in the book can be found on Google, but it is nice to find it in one place. The book covers selected topics in host security, SSH and VPNs, IDS, monitoring and even touches upon forensics. I also liked its multi-platform coverage, with a slight, but unmistakable UNIX/Linux bias.Overall, it is a great simple book, provided you don't try to find in it something it isn't: a neat collection of simple network security tips.

Network Security Hacks by Andrew Lockhart (O'Reilly). As with all the Hacks titles, this book contains 100 various tips and ideas on how to improve your network security through the use of various software packages or procedures you can implement. The Hacks are grouped into the following chapters:Unix Host Security; Windows Host Security; Network Security; Logging; Monitoring and Trending; Secure Tunnels; Network Intrusion Detection; Recovery And Response.This isn't a primer on all you need to know about system security, nor is it meant to be. Network Security Hacks is most helpful for the system or network administrator who understands security but is always looking for various ways to enhance their level of security or ease the administration processes. For instance, in the Monitoring and Trending chapter, you are introduced to a number of free tools you can download that will verify your services, graph your bandwidth trends, monitor real-time network stats, and audit the traffic on your network. While not every hack will appeal or apply to you, you will find plenty of gems that will give you a real and quick payback.The only &quot;gripe&quot; I have about the book is that it is heavily weighted towards the Unix environment. The Windows chapter is pretty small, and even some of the Windows hacks involve allowing you to work with the data like you can with Unix. So, if you're looking strictly for Windows security tips, you will probably find less satisfaction than you might if you were a hard-core Unix admin. Even so, there is material there that will interest you, such as how to use Snort to set up an intrusion detection system or how to use built-in features of Windows to create your own firewall.Very good book, and worthy to hold a spot on your bookshelf..."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"The book is very well written in a professional form.

He covers linux/unix systems and also Microsoft machines. An entire chapter, containing 10 hacks, is devoted to the latter. Most of the other 90 hacks can be applied to both systems, though the example implementations are usually given under linux/unix.Perusing the list of hacks may cause different readers to be attracted to different hacks. Here, I briefly summarise a few that caught my eye. Consider &quot;Block OS fingerprinting&quot;. In an earlier, more innocent age, someone connecting to a telnet, sendmail or ftp daemon would cause it to reply with the machine's operating system label and the version of that daemon. Yes, really! In fact, this is still largely true, by default, on most unixes. Well, nowadays, a sysadmin can stop those daemons doing this. But a cracker can then do other probes. If you are running OpenBSD, you can use pf to block those.Logically continuing this train of thought, what if you wanted to actively mislead the cracker by mimicking another operating system? This is the honeypot hack. The honeyd daemon lets you masquerade as several types of systems. Pretty crafty, eh? The next hack would then be to record all the cracker's activity on your honeypot via the open source Sebek, which is freely available for linux and Solaris.Granted, you might be interested in other hacks. But hopefully the above gives you some idea of the book's utility. And a lot of hacks refer to other closely related hacks, in the manner shown above."},{"Title":"Network Security Hacks","review":"As with the other &quot;Hacks&quot; books, there are 100 hacks listed, and these are focused on network security. As another reviewer points out these hacks seem to be heavily slanted toward Unix. Whether this is due to the Windows OS &quot;keeping the administrator out of the loop about the inner workings of her environment,&quot; as the book points out or the numerous &quot;helpful features&quot; of Windows that aren't that helpful to Windows admins is unclear. There does appear to be some limits to how secure you can make a Windows network, as opposed to Unix which seems to have many more options. And while we constantly hear about new Windows viruses, we rarely hear about Unix viruses. But I digress.There definitely are some good ones here, like the &quot;honeypot hack,&quot; protecting logs from tampering (thereby making it more difficult for a network intruder to cover their tracks), preventing stack-smashing attacks (thereby preventing an attacker from overwriting the information on a stack), detecting spoofing, testing your firewall, monitoring your logs for any sign of tampering, even defending yourself against web application intrusions. In short, these hacks are the ones deemed most likely by the book's author to be useful in defending your network against any kind of hostile attack or intrusion.And while you may agree or disagree with the list presented in this book, this book is a valuable tool and reference for any network admin to have on hand."},{"Title":"Mediating the Power of Buddhas: Ritual in the Manjusrimulakalpa (Suny Series in Buddhist Studies)","review":"He is responsible for RUIN.

Hiestad, an American author, has lived in England and thus has kept the British English very authentic.Twelfth Night is a holiday celebrated by this British family after Christmas. The entire story takes place on the family estate, where generations of the Salt family have lived and worked in the family business--making very high-quality harpsichords.They are about to have an important meeting to vote on a growth idea for the business, and at the Twelfth Night party, Mercedes, the oldest son's wife, announces she wants a divorce. Well, this caused an uproar for the entire family because she said she'd vote no on expansion.Mercedes goes for a walk the next morning and is found drowned in an iced-over pond between the Salt's estate and her brother's home nearby. To complicate things, Mark, the middle brother, is a police detective in this district--and a suspect.Question is: Was Mercedes death an accident, suicide or murder? And when a second relative is killed, the waters of doubt are muddied even more. Why? Who did it? and Who is next?DCI Geoffrey Graham, the lead detective, says to his partner, D.C. Brenna Taylor, \\"If this isn't murder, they're wasting an awful lot of good motives.\\"Many of the family secrets come out as the detectives interview each member. Boy, did they have \\"issues\\" with each other. The cops didn't have to point fingers at a certain suspect because the family members each pointed to someone else.Hiestand's attention to detail was worth the read. Her description of English landscape made it easy to feel part of the outdoor crime scenes as well as \\"seeing\\" inside the home and outbuildings.My other favorite line left a pretty clear picture: \\"He had the look of someone whose breakfast was about to see daylight.\\"The young female detective Brenna Taylor has \\"strong feelings\\" for both of her fellow detectives, but because of department policy, does not act on it. I felt her case of extreme unreleased sexual tension might bring her a bad case of acne any day now.

The pond is between the Salt estate and her brother's home. Mark, the Salt's middle son, is a police detective in this district and is soon one of the prime suspects. Some of his time while searching for Mercedes is unaccounted for.The book is set on the Salt estate, and most of it is conducted there, even with the detectives staying at the estate.

Can the police figure out who the real killer is before there are any more deaths?Brenna Taylor, one of the detectives, has feelings for two of her colleagues, but due to policy, she doesn't act on them. I do hope she will have a romantic interest in one of the upcoming books.

He died in a small plane crash near his home of Macomb, Illinois in 1977. He was 46 years old.One of the web site's most frequent requests - from dentists using search engines - is for copies of his book \\"Successful Preventive Dental Practices\\" and for information on him. His book was published in 1972 and has been out of print (because of confusion on who owned the copyright) for at least 30 years. These requests are not only from the US and Canada, but from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, India, and Malaysia.When they read his book, they are amazed that a book written in the early 1970's is so applicable to the 21st century.Why are these dentists still interested in the work of Barkley?I think it is because he addressed timeless problems for dentists and dentistry and showed dentists remarkable and innovative ways of solving these problems. He helped the dentists, who understood and applied his concepts, practice a higher, more enjoyable level of dentistry. In my opinion, dentistry still has not grasped the import of his work.Barkley's book is more important and timely in the 21st century than when it was published in 1972.

Every dentist and person with a history of dental disease should read and digest this book. I was introduced to Bob Barkley in 1967 and he became my personal mentor. When Dr. Barkley was killed, I went to Macomb on a weekly basis to keep his practice alive till it could be sold. He practiced in Macomb, Illinois and I in Dyersville, Iowa, both rural communities. We had a lot in common. He introduced a 'preventive approach' to dentists who are classically trained as physicians to 'fix things' without asking or seeking causes. He changed my life and I have worked diligently for 35 years to instill his ideas in the practices of thousands of dentists who are frustrated with 'just fixing' broken down body parts.Today's insurance, piecework, fill-drill and bill, high volume, disease centered practices and the hucksters of the lecture circuit are ruining the 'profession' of dentistry. Barkley's approach is as practical and useful today as it ever was, and offers both dentists and patients an opportunity to form collaborative, synergistic, creative relationships rather than reactive, quick fix, disease centered relationships.Read it. Re-read it. It will challenge traditional disease-centered thinking and offers HOPE to both DENTISTS and PATIENTS for a better way to practice dentistry and changes the dynamic of the relationship from 'come here, let me fix you' to a patient-centered, health focused approach.Dr. Michael SchusterThe Schuster Center[...]"},{"Title":"Into the Western Winds: Pioneer Boys Traveling the Overland Trails","review":"Heartfelt renderings of life along the Oregon/California Trails through the eyes of boys and adolescent young men.

Now I could care less about the meta-plot. As far as I can tell it is simply an excuse to rewrite their books so you have to go out and by new versions to keep up with the &quot;story.&quot; I would be so much happier if the good people at White-Wolf would keep their grubby little hands out of our stories and stop devoting so much time and content to their silly plot. Isn't it our role as storytellers and players to come up with our own plots? A game developer's role is to give us an excellent and detailed background from which we can pull ideas and come up with our own stories.Having said my peace on that, I must say that most of this book is excellent. Remember the Astrological aspects from the 1st edition Player's Guide? Well, this book reintroduces them but on an entirely new level.It only makes sense that the Garou would look to the heavens to find answers to the universe. They are so tied into the moon and its phases, it stands to reason that they might also look to the stars. And most early human cultures did.This book is about astrology from the Garou point of view. While it clearly relies on ideas from ancient human astrology, it does a good job modifying it to fit the werewolves. It devotes a lot of space to the zodiac as a whole, the separate aspects of the zodiac, and how these effect the Garou. All excellent material whether you are simply looking to add a new dimension to the Garou religion or you are actually going to take your players among the stars themselves (personally, I prefer the former). There is also a decent amount of space devoted to prophecies and using them in your game.I know there are some people out there who like pure information without new rules and some who don't think a book is very fulfilling unless it has new stuff for character creation and/or storyteller use. I would definitely say that in this book there is a good balance as far as pure information and new rules, so everyone should be happy. All in all I thought this book was very good and well worth the money. I might have given it five stars were it not for the space they devoted to advancing their meta-plot."},{"Title":"*OP Rage Across the Heavens (Werewolf: The Apocalypse)","review":"A great book if you're looking for a chance to explore another level of Umbral learning."},{"Title":"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","review":"This book had a number of interesting points to make.

My world has been turned upside down for the better. I have often contemplated the concept of God as something that the human brain has made up over the millions of years of evolution and while this book is not biased in that sense by any means it has helped me to become much more open minded and understanding of why people believe what they believe.I come from a highly conservative family of Mennonite descent. I dissented from them when I got to college as my mind began to wander on the existence of God, myself, and if anything was really real or if we were just playing one gigantic game. One of my favorite parts of the book is in the last chapter of the book in which it talks about all the biases that we encounter when forming beliefs. It's astonishing and I sincerely wish that I could even have my own brain scanned to understand better why I might believe what I believe.'Why We Believe What We Believe' gives you a look at spirituality and religiosity through the inner workings of the brain and specifically though neurotheology, a topic I'm quickly becoming intrigued by. It explains how we form beliefs and morals based off our culture, the way we are raised, the social scene the set for ourselves, and much more. It gives me a much clearer understanding rather than listening to a religious person simple say, \\"We get our morals from God.\\" This is simply not provable. There is an awful lot of talk about our brain system between the frontal loves, thalamus, hippocampus,and other areas where neurotransmitters intertwine to help formulate beliefs and make sense of the outside world we consider reality. \\"The brain believes what makes the most sense.\\"This book is so in depth that I will be reading it again. It touches on so many different areas and uses a lot of research to explain things. I loved the section on Kevin, the ATHEIST, who meditated to an image of God. Ironic, huh? Well this section also talked about nations where atheism was abundant and the majority, that they were happier and lived with less conflict. Now they did have their downsides too, but it just goes to show that a person can be just as happy and fulfilled without being a religious person.This book also reiterated my passion for asking questions and pondering reality, God, myself; and why people do the things they do, say the things they do, and believe what they believe. Dr. Newberg did a great job of relaying this information from as much of a non-biased way as possible. He does no take sides and is incredibly open-minded as is seen by his experiments with religious people from conflicting religious doctrines.The next day I bought 'Why God Won't Go Away' and had already bought another one of his books, 'How God Changes the Brain' last summer while buying this book. Some of the best purchases I've made in the last year. I'm even biased in writing this review, but would highly recommend it to anyone that is open-minded and looking for a deeper explanation as to why we believe what we believe.Also...check out Dr. Newberg's scene in \\"Religulous,\\" a documentary about religion by Bill Maher, which takes places in a train station (I want to say in New York?

His book seems at times a new age spiritual reflection yet ends up a soft science. This disappointing read is a re-hash of other prominent and earlier books in the field. The author seems to have jumped on the band wagon of \\"cognition,\\" yet adds nothing new to the study. The style of writing is chopping, and unfortunately, makes for a disappointing read."},{"Title":"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","review":"This fascinating book examines how human beings construct their beliefs about everything: how we map the realities of the world, build moral and political beliefs, and develop religious and spiritual beliefs about the universe. The authors base their premises on neurobiological research and then they integrate their findings with contemporary psychology and sociology without ever becoming overly technical, a difficult feat when it comes to explaining the neurological processes of the brain.The introductory chapter introduces the basic premises of the book, using the case history of a man who riddled with cancer and is about to die in a research hospital at UCLA. Placebo injections are given, and within a week all tumors disappear, but when newspaper reports describe the ineffectiveness of the medicine the patient thought he was taking, the tumors returned. The doctor convinced the patient that a \\"new and improved\\" medication was available, and again the tumors disappeared. The FDA then pronounced the medical study a failure, and again, the tumors returned. The authors return to this story throughout the book to explain how our beliefs can deeply influence the neurobiological processes in the brain.In Chapter 3, the authors use numerous optical illusions to How the brain incorporates perceptual errors into its maps of the world. In this way, they show how many supernatural beliefs are literally perceived as real within the brain. In the next chapter, they show how different cognitive functions contribute to the foundations of everyday beliefs about reality, and how a child's brain is prone towards seeing monsters, believing in Santa Claus, and relying on magic to explain unusual occurrences in the world. The authors also show what happens in the brain when adults attempt to perceive the unperceivable, i.e. God and other spiritual realms.In Chapter 5, Parents, Peas, and \\"Putty Tats,\\" Newberg opens his chapter on developmental neuropsychology with a story of how his mother got him to eat his plate of peas. He uses this cute tale to show how early childhood beliefs can shape the remainder of one's adult life. The authors show how easy it is to implant false memories in children and adults, why autobiographical memories are faulty, and why false memories remain imprinted in various circuits of the brain well into adulthood. They also offer a brilliant integration of neurological development with the psychological development of morality (unfortunately, our brains begin to deteriorate in our thirties, and the likelihood of us changing our beliefs, especially inaccurate ones, becomes less and less the older we get.As the title of Chapter 6 implies (Ordinary Criminals Like You and Me) we are not as moral as we like to think we are. Using brain scan research, they show how we are easily manipulated by authorities to lie, hurt and even kill. Ultimately, the more complex the moral dilemma, the longer it takes our brain to react. Thus we are likely to stand by and watch when others commit immoral acts.In Chapter 7, Newberg describes his brain scan research with a group of Franciscan nuns engaged in prayer, and the authors suggest how spiritual beliefs become neurologically real in the minds of practitioners.Chapter 8 includes the first brain scan study of Pentecostal practitioners who speak in tongues, and the findings show that this uniquely creative form of prayer is very different from other forms of spiritual practice, and is probably very similar to shamanic trance states, hypnotherapy, and certain altered states of consciousness brought about by drugs. The authors are careful to point out that Pentecostal practices are inherently beneficial and do not represent pathological processes of illness.In Chapter 9, the authors conduct the first brain scan on an atheist who attempts to pray to God. They found that when a person focuses on opposing beliefs, a neurological dissonance takes place that prejudices the individual to reject them. Atheists are physiologically healthy individuals, even though they are one of the most despised groups in America. This chapter sheds light on why political parties tend to despise one another and goes a long way in explaining why there is so much religious discord in the world.Finally, in Chapter 10, the authors discuss ways to become \\"a better believer\\" by developing a more cautious, skeptical, yet openminded approach when evaluating information from the media and from science. An overview of 27 forms of cognitive biases are presented, along with a systematic critique of prayer/religion research. They also summarize contemporary research on the placebo effect.Overall, an astonishing book that was equally fun to read--but then again, that's what I believe."},{"Title":"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","review":"Andrew Newberg, professor of Radiology and Psychiatry, has written (along with Mark Robert Waldman) a sequel to his book, Why God Won't Go Away. The new book has strengths and weaknesses, but, should be of some interest to those who have an interest in spiritual matters and human behavior. The book is primarily written to address the question of how the brain works so that we arrive at what we believe to be true. The authors write from a spiritual perspective, but take numerous jabs at Christians and Christianity throughout the book. In contrast, New Age and Far Eastern religions seem to receive little or no criticism (co-author, Mr. Waldman seems to be into New Age type spirituality), and are actually endorsed. Likewise, atheists may not be entirely comfortable with the content, since it clearly challenges their cherished belief that that have no beliefs.Even with this viewpoint bias, the first two parts of the book (\\"How the brain makes our reality\\" and \\"Childhood development and morality\\") are nothing less than fascinating. The topics are broad, so a lot of details are not included (especially supporting studies), although doing so would have increased the length considerably. Even so, I would have preferred more details and citations and a little of the controversy, which must be present in such a complex field. One gets the distinct impression that the results are not quite as neat and tidy as presented, and one wonders if studies that do not support the authors' premises are omitted as a form of viewpoint bias or just to save space.A particularly interesting chapter entitle, \\"Ordinary Criminals Like You and Me,\\" presents numerous experiments (many of which would be considered unethical today) that demonstrate that the vast majority of individuals will do extremely immoral acts, given the right conditions. For example, if enough people (planted experimental confederates) go along with a lie, test subjects will do likewise. In another study, participants \\"electrocuted\\" a \\"student\\" who was a \\"poor learner.\\" Studies simulating prison conditions showed that the \\"officers\\" (experimental subjects) routinely mistreated the \\"prisoners\\" (also experimental subjects). In other experiments, subjects would usually act in selfish ways, rather than take the moral high ground. Newberg suggests that barring interception by our frontal lobes of our brain, all our actions would be immoral and selfish.The book's third section, spiritual beliefs and the brain, presents Newberg's latest (and earlier) functional brain scan results on religious people. Previously, Newberg had studied the brain activity of Buddhists practicing meditation and Franciscan nuns practicing \\"centering prayer,\\" a Roman Catholic method of meditating deeply on a specific biblical passage or concept. These results had shown similar patterns of brain activity for those meditating on \\"becoming one with the universe\\" or \\"inner peace\\" (Buddhists) and those meditating on God or the Bible. Both groups showed increased activity in the frontal lobes (primarily the prefrontal cortex), which represents the \\"attention area\\" and decreased activity in the parietal lobes (the \\"orientation area\\"). Each group interpreted their experience on the basis of their beliefs (e.g., inner peace for the Buddhists or God's presence for the nuns). In this book, Newberg added a third group - Pentecostal Christians who \\"speak in tongues.\\" When analyzed, the brain scans showed increased activity in the thalamus (as in Buddhists and nuns). Speaking in tongues also resulted in high activity in the temporal lobes (involved in making emotions) and in the midbrain (probably resulting from the activities of speech and dance). Like Buddhists and nuns, Pentecostals represent a small percentage of the American population (probably only about 1% of Americans claim to speak in tongues). Newberg presented one case (not exactly a scientific sampling) of a spiritual atheist. Like the Buddhists, he practiced meditation, and presented with a brain scan similar to the Buddhists and nuns (though the actual scans were not shown in the book).Also noteworthy was the finding of asymmetric thalamic activity in the Buddhists, nuns, Pentecostals, and even the one \\"spiritual\\" atheist, which is not found in the vast majority of people. The question arises whether these people are born with this asymmetry, resulting in the ability to play these mind games or whether the continual practice of the games themselves lead to the asymmetry. None of Newberg's studies were able to address these questions. An even more fundamental question concerns the rest of us, who lack the asymmetry, but still have religious beliefs. Maybe none of these studies really tell us anything about the kind of religious belief that most of us exhibit, since all the groups chosen for study represent extremely small minorities.In conclusion, the book is well-written and compelling, although the obvious biases of the writers will probably annoy most Christian readers. The topic is complex and experimental design is difficult at best. Future studies will likely shed more light on this subject."},{"Title":"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","review":"I'm just about done reading this book and have enjoyed it very much. The author doesn't go on any tangents, go off the subject or include any difficult theories to weed through. The author does mentioned several scientific experiments but they are necessary to back up his findings. He doesn't bash people who believe in spiritual things but he doesn't sway that way himself he just looks at what he discovered with a scientific eye. I prefer books that don't bash other people with an opposing view but prefer someone who is looking for the reason of things with an open mind. I still would recommend that if you are a Christian you will need an open mind to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","review":"Was struggling with faith.

The book explores the powers of placebo, false memories, immorality in \\"moral\\" people, group think, speaking in tongues and 27 forms of biases."},{"Title":"Why We Believe What We Believe: Uncovering Our Biological Need for Meaning, Spirituality, and Truth","review":"The book, published in 2006, attempts to construct a model of the origin, functions and limitation of beliefs at the neuronal level. As such, this is a scientific, not a religious book. It is not written for technical people; rather, it aims at accessibility to the general public. But it is also not a \\"popular\\" book in the popular sense of the usage of this word. It is intriguing, well documented, factual and readable, with few scientific jargon to block the road. Like all scientific books, it presents thoughtful hypothesis that can be tested and argued.The authors start by giving an example of a story of a person suffering from cancer to show how powerful belief could be. This sure has a very strong impact in readers like me. They argue that beliefs are influenced by the interactions of perception, emotion, cognition and social consensus which allow us to identify, explore, evaluate and compare a wide variety of beliefs, from our most mundane evaluation of the world to the most extra ordinary vision that illuminate our purpose of life. Our beliefs, they hypothesize, therefore, are an assemblage of perceptual experiences, emotional evaluations, and cognitive abstractions that are blended with fantasy, imagination and intuitive speculation. The four circles of influence are then looked into in greater details, including which parts of the brain where processes affecting these factors are carried out and their limitations. Optical illusion, which is well known, is widely quoted as examples of perceptual errors which may render our beliefs erroneous.Part II of the book looks at childhood development and morality, covering the temporal windows in which certain moral behaviors are developed. These windows are dictated by neuronal development of the child at different ages; at certain age certain neuronal development has reached a certain stage to enable a child to learn certain moral concepts. Before that, the child can not learn such concept simply because the hardwired circuits are not there yet. In some cases, beyond these windows the learning of some concepts or skills may be difficult or impossible. The relative influences of the four factors in these stages are also identified. The materials presented herein are useful in moral education. We are to learn from the authors that up to the age of 30, there are appropriate times to learn certain moral concepts, not earlier and perhaps, not latter.The authors devote an entire chapter to deal with the gap between behavior and moral beliefs with explanations.Part III of the book writes about the brain activities and spiritual beliefs. The authors use fMRI to scan brain activities of nuns who focus on sacred prayer and Buddhist practitioners who meditate on sacred image. The results? The Buddhist practitioners and nuns show significant similarities and differences in neural processing with major differences occurring in the language centers of the brain. Both show greater activities in their Frontal Lobes, and in particular, the prefrontal cortex and less activity in the parietal lobes. This is consistent with their claims of suspension of self consciousness and loss of sense of space and time. Thalamic asymmetry was also observed among other things. This results definitely point to the common goals achieved by of two different forms of spiritual practices and this is where commonality of different religions can be found: at the neuronal level.One entire chapter is devoted to the study of Speaking in tongues and one on Atheists who pray to God. The results are interesting, particularly when compared to those obtained from the fMRI studies of the nuns and meditators. The results of the studies of the Atheists , to me, is an even more important reflection of the common results of spiritual practice at the neuronal level performed by religious and atheists alike.The authors have listed 27 ways our brain distort reality and processes suggestions as to how to become a better believer. The famous Placebo effect was also dealt with briefly. Knowing how we are biased may teach us to be more humble, less authoritarian and more tolerant.Then, the final chapter talks about the Ultimate beliefs. What is ultimately real? Does anything exist beyond our beliefs? Can we suspend all systems of beliefs? If we can find a person who can really suspend his belief system and scan his brain, what can we find out? Let me quote the authors:\\" Hopefully, I might stumble on the connection between the \\"every day\\" reality created by the brain and the fundamental reality that links us to life, the universe and everything. And the more we push science and spirituality to their limits, the better chance we have to answer the Ultimate question\\". I really want to see what they will find out from accomplished yogi, either of the Himalayan Tradition or the Tibetan monks in the Monasteries.Personally, I did not expect so much from this book. I actually stumbled on it while looking for Newberg's new book \\" How GOD changes our brain\\".
