Stephen is a good friend and sticks with her. I think that Andrew Clements is great."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"This is a story of a report card and a very smart girl. The girls name is Nora.Nora could remember things way back like how she acted in kindergarten.She acted like a cat. But she had to stop because her teacher called her parents and the guidance counselor and the education teacher.They were all involved. so she became a copycat on each of the strugling students. I think the message is learn as much as you can.My opinion is that lots of people showld read this book."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"This is a kid's book, so why not listen to a kid's views? Andrew Clements just seems to me like not a very good writer. What he does is he has all the interesting stuff at the very beginning, and then stays on one subject for the rest of the book. And, the views in the book are just plain stupid."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"This book is great! Would recommend this book ages 10+. This book may relate to some people. Clements is a great author."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"This book is so horrible it doesn't even deserve 1 star. It's about a kid named Nora who is really smart, but she hides it because she wants to have friends because being popular is the most important thing in the world, not going to a good college or getting a good job.Sometimes I think this book was written in a dumber age. I get good grades and so do many of my friends. I can't think of someone I know well who gets grades as bad as Nora when she pretends to get bad grades. You should just be yourself and not pretend something just to be popular. BEING POPULAR IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN THE WORLD!!!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"As a parent I was shocked when I read this book. It is a political book. It is in response to the No Child Left Behind Act. Read it and be appalled.A fourth grade girl lies to her parents for 5 years about the fact that she is a genius. Her parents have no idea. She doesn't want people to know she is smart because she would be pushed academically and if she went into the accelerated classes she would miss her friends. She finds out that there are teachers that feel the same way she does about tests and grades -- they make kids feel stupid. All the kids in her group (except two -- one who wants to go to Harvard like his parents -- he is the bad guy in the book) all get zeros on a quiz on purpose in a strike like fashion. They know that the real estate values are tied up with how good the schools are -- but they don't care.Educators, some writers like Clements, and (yes of course) a lot of kids hate tests and grades. I'm sorry to break this to you -- but the grades are also for the parents and the communities to determine the success of schools. It is feedback. Maybe the tests themselves need work but we need a way to determine wether or not our children are being educated. Fact: schools are failing.My daughter loved this book but she lacks the ability to look at it critically. As a parent I do not want a writer making his political case with my kid. It is politically predatory.Although I take time to read the books that she reads, sadly many parents don't have the time. I found this book shocking in it's intent."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"I am a teacher who adores Andrew Clements' books. I use them for class reading and for literature circles. Clements never talks down to kids-- he writes both kids and adults as people rather than caricatures or puppets to advance a plot-- and his stories are engaging and interesting.I enjoyed reading The Report Card, although it was a bit preachier than his other books, and some characters, especially Nora's parents, are not as well developed or realistic as I expect from Andrew Clements. The debate about standardized tests is highlighted, and as a teacher it was nice to see it pointed out to kids that most teachers are not test fans either. The fact that standardized test numbers can't really tell you much about a child seems to be Clements' main point, and it's one I agree with.My main concern about The Report Card is the mixed message it sends about being smart, especially being a smart girl. Nora, the highly gifted heroine, has been hiding her intelligence for years, in large part so she won't make her best friend, a boy, feel bad. I had expected Nora to come to a realization that her intelligence was a gift to be celebrated and shared. However, the resolution leaves Nora content to be \\"normal,\\" which by Nora's definition means not to pursue any opportunities available to learn about and expand her gifts, and essentially to continue masking her intelligence so that other people won't be made to feel bad.My worry is that girls in the target age group will read &lt;i>The Report Card and conclude that \\"normalcy\\" does not include intelligence. While I don't believe that this was Clements' intention, the message is there. Girls have hidden or downplayed their academic abilities far too long-- we should be teaching them to embrace their talents."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Nora brings home a report card full of D's on purpose to protest grades and how kids label themselves based on grades. This act of rebellion upsets her parents and starts an investigation which uncovers the secret Nora has been keeping since she was a toddler and learned to read. She is actually a profoundly gifted girl masquerading as a \\"normal\\" one.Both editorial reviews mention this secrecy in a neutral/positive way; it being a reasonable method to avoid the \\"pressures\\" associated with high intelligence.What disturbed me greatly about this book is that the author evidently agrees. This report card is not the first one that Nora has manipulated, just the first one that was caught. Nora has been manipulating report cards since she started school, maintaining a nondescript C+ average. Imagine how much pressure that takes, to never ever let it slip to the teacher or classmates that you really understand the material in a significantly deeper way? Every day in class discussions, homework, written assignments, tests... constantly being on guard not to get too many answers right or answer something too thoughtfully and blow your cover. Doesn't that put a lot of pressure on a child? Not for Nora.The author gives Nora a compelling reason for this behavior: hide your talents so you can have friends. Nora has found wonderfully caring, honest and brave friends, especially Stephen, and believes that to keep her friends she must act normal - just like they are. To maintain her special friendship with an honest, trustworthy, wonderful boy, Nora has to maintain a life of deceit. In a world where teen age girls often feel pressured into dumbing themselves down to attract boyfriends, Nora wins the prize by starting in kindergarten.What a role model!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"The Report Card is a good example of showing that kids can actually make a difference. I really liked this book!Nora is a eleven-year-old girl with two smart older siblings. She is a genius but keeps it a secret because she doesn't want to stand out! For her first report card, her parents were expecting average grades because that's what Nora usually got. Instead of average grades, Nora got all D's and one C! Her parents were very upset because she wasn't doing her best and wasn't herself at school or at home. The reason for all the chaos was her best friend Stephan. Stephan wasn't the smartest boy in the class but Nora thought he could be! Nora's big plan was what would happen when every kid in the school got really bad grades on tests and quizzes. Nora thought school was for fun and to learn a little bit, but not to do work! She was totally wrong. When she got to school the next day, she found out that mostly every kid had gotten a zero on every paper that had been assigned to them. Nora knew what she was doing was totally wrong to the worst degree, but she thought it was great that she was actually making a difference! When all the teachers found out about Nora's plan they took it straight down to the principal and told her what was happening and who was a ahead of all the mess. The principal found out Nora was the one, she called her down to her office and made her confess what she did. Nora ended up telling everyone she was very smart and just wanted to make a difference. She told them she did it because having Stephan feel so bad about himself she wanted him to feel better and to think he was actually smart.This book was so powerful, I couldn't put it down! I recommend this book to all kids who are worried about their grades!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Fifth Grader Nora Rowley is a genius. However, she decided in kindergarten that she wished to be best friends with Stephen, a middle of the road kid, and that meant being a normal kid. Now she is in 5th Grade and dislikes what seems like many peoples obsessions over grades, and especially the way tests make Stephen feel, and so she hatches a plan to make people think twice about what they mean. This enjoyable novel carries not only Clements typical theme of the power of what kids can achieve but also a thoughtful discussion of grades and standardized testing. The ending sees Nora's opinions evolve and will leave readers with some things to think about."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"I know I will sound like an echo of the previous reviews, but I must chime in, in complete agreement. While I find the author's position on testing absolutely on target, it disturbs me that Nora ends up deciding that she will continue to hide her abilities in order to have and keep friends.I am *hoping* Mr. Clements wants us to be disturbed in this manner, that he actually is putting this sad finale in place to make teachers, librarians, and especially *parents* consider that this is what our testing community has done to children like Nora.Please, Andrew Clements! Let us know!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Like some of the other reviewers here, I would have to say that this is not Andrew Clements best. The premise of looking at the negative consequences of all the testing and emphasis on grades in our schools is a good one that needs to be examined, but it doesn't quite work here. The main problem is Nora. Now maybe kids will buy into the fact that this 10-year-old girl is a super genius who has been hiding her talents all her life. Any adult - even an observant teenager - would say \\"That doesn't sound right.\\" No child would be able to hide that kind of talent. Clements who have done far better to make her very smart, not super smart. I think more kids might be able to identify with that. As it is, there really isn't any pressure on Nora at all. She could ace all the tests easily - even the ones in the gifted and talented program. While there's also some concern about Nora wanting to be \\"normal\\" and maybe thinking girls aren't supposed to be smart, I didn't get that sense. Nora knows she can be pretty much whatever she wants to be. Despite the drawbacks, there could still be some interesting discussions as a result of reading this book."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"\\"The Report Card\\" is a story about a young girl who has a major issue with report cards. Having hidden the fact that she's a genius all of her life, she feels that grades on report cards aren't a good measure of a student. She decides to do something about it by getting all Ds (and one C, to her disappointment) on her own report card.Things seem to be going the right way at first, but even a genius can't anticipate everything. It's not long before the situation becomes out-of-control, but fortunately there are those willing to help.While it's possible this book might have a negative effect on some children, I don't think it's really suggesting that anyone hide their genius. If anything, it's simply suggesting that child geniuses can do great things, but at the same time, they need some time of their own to simply be like ordinary kids. That, and the action this book can inspire about the matter of grades, means that it gives two (and possibly more) great messages.The character portrayals seem reasonably accurate. Well-rounded characters are important, but it's also important to remember too that there are parents and other adults out there who can be rather close-minded, and don't take the time to actually get to know what's going on in the life of their child as well as they should. (Without being unnecessarily prying and intrusive, of course)"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Didn't think much of this book for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the writing wasn't terribly strong...most of the adult characters were written in a pretty one-dimensional manner. But a bigger issue was the message that kids really have no need to listen to adults, when the kids think they are \\"smart\\" enough to know better. This book was written very much in a fashion that the only \\"smart\\" one of the bunch is Nora, and that when she disobeys and disrespects adults (including her parents) that it is part of a master plan of hers. Even in the end, when the plan goes awry, she still dictates to her parents, the school principal and a psychologist what is \\"right\\" and what isn't. She clearly violated school rules, caused significant trouble because of her perception that she knew better than the adults, and received no real punishment for any of her actions in the end...even at the telling the principal of her school (basically) how to run her school(re: placement and scholastic goals). While empowering kids to think for themselves is wonderful, reinforcing the notion that they have no need to listen to authority figures when they happen to disagree with them does not seem like the kind of message I want my kids to receive."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Nora Rowley is pretty much your average kid. She's well-liked by her classmates and a star soccer player. Her grades aren't stellar, but she gets by. What no one, not even her family, knows is that Nora is a genius. She figured out as a toddler that her intelligence and abilities set her apart in an uncomfortable way, and ever since then she's worked hard to master the art of appearing normal, while quietly pursuing her intellectual interests on her own. Nora's best friend, Stephen, really IS an average kid, and although he's reasonably intelligent he worries that he's stupid because he doesn't perform well on standardized tests. Nora's disgusted with the way students, teachers, and parents all rely on grades as the sole measure of a young person's knowledge and academic ability - and she comes up with a plan to challenge everyone's assumptions about what grades really mean and just how much they actually matter.Andrew Clements has done it again: in \\"Frindle\\" he served up a thoroughly kid-friendly lesson in linguistics, and in \\"The Report Card\\" he does the same for educational theory. Clements is one of the few authors, particularly one of the few writing for children, who truly dare to challenge the status quo: Why CAN'T you just make up a new word? What IS the big deal about grades, anyway? Clements opens our everyday realities to exploration and question, and doesn't settle for platitudes in the end. He believes we as individuals - even kids - have the power to make a difference, if only by challenging assumptions and opening eyes.I can't even begin to list how much there is wonderful about this book. Nora is a gem: astute, caring, witty, intellectual but not the least bit snobbish about it. It is a delight to see the world through her keen and discerning eyes. Her observations about grades and education are thoughtful and wise, but in the way she chooses to handle the situation she demonstrates typical childish naivete as well as intelligence beyond her years. This is a book that will make you laugh, cheer, and think.Some reviewers have criticized this novel for encouraging children of unusual intelligence, especially girls, to \\"dumb themselves down\\" in order to succeed socially. I believe these readers are missing the point. Yes, Nora decides in the end to stay in the fifth grade in a public school, rather than enroll in a private school and skip a few grades along the way, or even participate in her school's gifted program. But she's not planning on hiding her intelligence any longer. She's simply decided that it's up to her how SHE wants to nurture her talents - that she's going to be a genius in her OWN way, not the way her parents or her teachers or anyone else would expect. Perhaps more importantly, it's quite possible that a child like Nora wouldn't benefit all that much from being in the eighth grade at an exclusive academy anyway. She may have concealed her intelligence, but she never stifled it. Nora spent her free time pursuing knowledge for its own sake. On her own, she managed to give herself an amazingly broad education about everything from astronomy to epistemology to history. It's very likely that a challenging academic setting, rather than helping her realize her full potential, would stifle her curiosity and creativity, as well as her sheer joy in learning, by trying to direct into predetermined channels a mind that thrived on exploring freely. By staying in the fifth grade, Nora is choosing to embrace the best of both worlds: she doesn't have to sacrifice a \\"normal\\" childhood to pursue her intellectual interests, because she can do that perfectly well on her own. Rather than sending a message to children that they should strive to fit in at all costs, this is a novel about DEFYING expectations, as Nora decides for herself how she wants to live, rather than conforming to societal expectations about genius. She will go through school at HER own pace, spend her free time studying what SHE wants to study, and spend her future doing whatever SHE finds is her passion, thank you very much.It's been several months since I have enjoyed and appreciated a book this much. After having written nearly forty reviews here on Amazon, I'm pleased to say that my first-ever five-star review goes to \\"The Report Card.\\""},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"I read this book alongside my son and wasn't impressed. Its started off very slow and I found myself quite annoyed with Nora early on. She just wasn't believable and I found it hard to connect with her because everything about her was deceitful for mostly superficial reasons. I think she could have served her \\"best friend\\" alot better by actually helping him as best she could instead of on the sly here and there. Her parents were one dimentional, no insight or plausable parenting qualities. Some of the points of view were worth discussing but the execution was poor. My son (10) thought it was ok. He said it wasn't \\"too bad\\"."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Probably the very coolest thing about Andrew Clements is that he manages to impart lessons even as he entertains his readers. This is never more evident than in some of my favorite Clements books.Frindledemonstrates the adaptability of a word.The Landry Newsdelves into the first amendment and the power of the press.The School Storychronicles the process in which a twelve-year-old girl's novel is published. And then there's THE REPORT CARD.\\"Most kids never talk about it, but a lot of the time bad grades make them feel dumb, and almost all the time it's not true. And good grades can make other kids think that they're better, and that's not true either. And then all the kids start competing and comparing. The smart kids feel smarter and better and get all stuck-up, and the regular kids feel stupid and like there's no way to ever catch up. And the people who are supposed to help kids, the parents and the teachers, they don't. They just add more pressure and keep making up more and more tests.\\"Nora Rose Rowley said that. Nora is a fifth-grader and she is a genius. Except that no one knows it. All her life Nora had kept her smarts a secret from everyone, even from her family. Secretly she takes an online college-level astronomy course from M.I.T., corresponds with a primate expert at the Jane Goodall Institute, and she's taught herself Spanish simply by viewing Spanish television shows. So, yes, Nora is a genius.Nora wants a normal life, just wants to fit in; she doesn't like \\"performing.\\" But that's about to change. To help out her best friend Stephen, who grows ever more anxious with regards to his grades, Nora is about to challenge her middle school and the state's standardized testing curriculum. It begins with her deliberately earning Ds on her report card (and, to her frustration, a C for Spelling). But what Nora doesn't figure on is that her actions would lead to a student uprising.I happen to think that Andrew Clements is genetically encoded to be unable to write horrid books. Add THE REPORT CARD to his pile of terrific stuff. As usual, once you crack open the first few pages and allow Clements to set up the premise, he's got you. I got hooked early on in THE REPORT CARD when I got to the part where baby Nora was able to gaze at the scattered pieces of a jigsaw puzzle and instantly know how they fit together. After that bit of mojo, I just had to find out what happened.This book features Clements' customary excellence in storytelling. He introduces us to a winning protagonist, plonks her in an intriguing premise, and raises thought-provoking issues along the way. Having been a school teacher himself, Clements shows the educators in this book in a good light, especially Mrs. Byrne, the school librarian and the first person to whom Nora opens up. Even the prohibitive villain, the unlikeable school psychologist/guidance counselor Dr. Trindler, isn't really a bad guy. Children (or basically whosoever else reads this book) will get a kick out of the appealing central character. To echo another reviewer, I felt a bit sorry for Nora in the sense that she's so intelligent that it's a struggle for her to fit in with regular kids, and she can't help but feel estranged. There are lessons to pick up on in this book, be it the significance of persistence in one's studies, yet tempering one's anxieties with knowing that tests do not ultimately define the student. And then there's that old maxim about, above all else, being true to yourself. I have no objections with Nora's wanting to be treated like a normal person. Nora is a genius. She's also only a kid. For a time, let her be a kid. But that's just my opinion. Read THE REPORT CARD and see if you agree."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Andrew Clements is my favorite author! In his books he keeps the readers interested throughout the whole story. I am 11 years old and I can't stop reading Andrew Clements' books. All of his books are fantastic!

Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"No one's going to argue that testing (standardized/governmental/state etc) can have detrimental effects (such as labeling children or making kids feel dumb) but I must agree with other reviewers who say this book sends a controversial (not to mention confused) message. As with many other books that contain overt or covert messages against our current school system, this book doesn't really adress the purpose that tests were created to be: a feedback system, not instruments of punishment or torture. Not all children who read this book will be able to pick up the subtle debate in the book and will just walk away with an overall 'tests=bad' message. Also, (as mentioned by other reviewers) where *is* Nora's victory? The ability to ignore her gifts is not even what Nora wants- she just wants to be able to do her own thing (which includes college-level reading/research at the library) without being pressured and labeled. Instead, she's told she can continue performing at a mediocre (for her) level! The parents, too, aren't what I'd usually expect from Clements- they're two dimensional grade-obsessed 'pushers' with no real sustance.That said, I did enjoy the book (and could even relate!).

I know a lot of teachers who have become disenchanted with the teaching profession because of all the emphasis on standardized testing these days.Fifth-grade genius Nora is quite charismatic and her cohort Stephen is equally charming in his own way. Nora takes issue with the importance of grades and test scores in determining students' assessments of themselves and others and she is especially concerned about her friend Stephen who does not do well on standardized tests and has consequently decided that he is not very smart.

Nora( the main character) claims to have put together a puzzle when she was a toddler, which is supposed to prove her higher intelligence. The reason why the book is called The Report Card is because she gets bad grades on purpose just to prove that they don't matter. EXCUSE ME!! Getting good grades is very important, highschools and colleges are constantly looking at people's transcripts. And this little snobby 5th grader is telling readers that report cards are meaningless. So it turns out that the whole reason why she chose to get bad grades is because she felt like it!! It hurt to read this book, it was so lame and boring.

Nora shows it by bringing home a horrible report card. This was supposed to boost her friend's confidence; instead he keeps calling himself an idiot. Nora tries to keep her intelligence a secret, but ends up confessing to Mrs. Byrne, her library teacher.Later, Nora takes an IQ test and she scores high and her secret is revealed. Nora makes a new plan with her friend. She started with being a know-it-all one day, then getting zeros the next. Then a bunch of students in her social studies class get zeros. So the teachers figured out her plan and got really mad at her.I recommend this book because there's a bunch of cool stuff that happens. Huge events happen so there's a lot of excitement. There are a lot of big words in this book so some people will need help. This book will be very enjoyable if the reader knows the big words."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"I think The Report Card is an awesome and an amazing book for me and my friends.

It's about a girl named Nora and she pretends she is not smart and she has alot of meetings with her teachers and the principal. Then at the end of the story, she tells all the teachers that she is a genius. I appreciate this story because I think it will teach every child a certain lesson. It will teach you because in this story Nora pretends she is not smart but at the end of the story,she tells everyone that she is a genius. But I think she should tell the whole school right when she moves into that school and I think there shouldn't be any waiting till she gets to 5th grade, so she can out show them.

It has seriousness and it also tells about how Nora Rowley feels about tests and grades. Nora is a real genius, but in this story she doesn't show anybody her intelligence.

This book also has a lot of good vocabulary words and some real facts. This is a great book!!!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"If you like exciting books this is the one you should read.

The \\"The Report Card\\" is fiction.Nora Rowley is an average 5th grade student. Or so everybody thinks. Nora is really an undercover genius. Nora learned to read, do puzzles, and speak Spanish all before she entered kindergarten. The reason Nora cannot show her full potential is partly because she's afraid everyone will think she's a freak But the main reason Nora is holding back is because of her best friend Steven Curtis. Steven is getting bad grades in school so Nora comes up with a brilliant plan. Nora's plan is that if Steven sees Nora's grades failing maybe he'll think he can improve his grades. \\"The Report Card\\" takes place at Nora's school Phillbrook Elementary and Nora's home. Nora's sister Ann is tall, athletic, smart, blonde, and a puzzle expert meanwhile Nora is short, not athletic (except in soccer), gets bad grades(on purpose), and has reddish brown hair.I would give this book a 6. I would give this book a 6 because I like how the author explained everything. But \\"The Report Card\\" is not as exciting as some other books I have read.My favorite scenes in \\"The Report Card\\" are when Ann was doing a puzzle and was looking for a piece of Mrs. Muppets ear then the piece that Ann was looking for sort of jumped out at Nora. My 2nd favorite scene in \\"The Report Card\\" is when Mrs. Hackney asked Nora why she got all those D's on her report card and Nora said she got those D's because she thought their shape was pretty.I think my friend Cristina Reigal should read \\"The Report Card\\". I think Cristina should read this book because the main part of the story could actually happen I think Cristina likes down to earth stories. I really enjoyed the report card. It was a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"While this book is an enjoyable read for its entertainment value, you can't help but notice that a certain message is being pounded into your head: Grades and test scores should not matter. That message is shared by many people in our country trying to make testing and grades obsolete in our schools, and this is also why children are being passed without being able to read, and before they are ready. Without grades and tests, how can we tell when children need our help? There are people who don't want children to be hurt or feel dumb by their grades or test scores. As a mom, I would never want my child to feel dumb no matter what his/her level of learning is, so I can agree with that. State test scores do not have to be revealed to children and at our school, they are not. So the competition is not there between the children for the state tests. Report cards are also private. However, children cannot be all at the same level the whole time, and it's important that all children are challenged and have fun learning at every stage. In this book, Nora, a genius, hides her intelligence and even says, [paraphrased] \\"Hiding my intelligence is the best thing I've ever done.\\" She also wants to be in with the \\"normal\\" kids. I do not agree with labeling children this way either. She hides her intelligence so that she is not treated any different than other children, and later purposely makes bad grades and poor test scores to try to make a point that all children should be treated equal even to their own detriment, and feel good about themselves, and that grades and scores don't matter. Again, I am in favor of all children feeling good about themselves. But I am not in favor of ingoring the fact that a child is denying herself learning on her own level and making a point that grades don't matter. Grades do matter because not only does it reveal where the child is in his/her learning, but it can also reveal other problems the child may be having that need to be solved so that learning can prevail. Back to being gifted - she even says that she wants to stay out of gifted programs and begs to stay in \\"normal\\" class. She said that when they are teaching something that she already knows that she will \\"think about something else\\" or \\"read a book\\". This is also assuming that a 5th grader can take charge of her own education. Nora deserves to be challenged on her own level because no one knows everything. Her parents seem like bystanders, and it is assumed that they do not know any better than whatever Nora says. And as other reviewers have commented, Nora is not a true-to-life character, as she appears too perfect, and it's probably not possible that she could hide her high IQ for so many years. Even real-life geniuses are challenged on their own level and enjoy it. Whether children are ahead of the teachings or behind, if they aren't benefitting from the regular class teachings, they deserve and need special programs to support them academically. The people who are offended by the fact that children are different from one another are cheating children. This book also implies that someone brainy cannot be friends with someone less brainy. I know from real life that this is not so. My son is gifted, and last year his best friend was a girl in his 3rd grade class who was behind in reading ability. I realize that testing anxiety can form a wrong analysis of a child's learning level, and that's why we have parents, teachers and other specialists that are supposed to realize when a child has been placed inaccurately in either direction by these test scores. I feel that this book is attempting to prime our kids for the opinions of people who are trying to water down our school system. I also agree with the teacher who wrote that females hid their intelligence for enough years in history, it's not a good idea to have our girls going back to that mentality, for any reason."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"The Report Card by Andrew Clements is a phenomenal fiction piece based on some true events.The Report Card is about a kid named Stephen who got a bad grade on his report card in school. He and his friend tried to get a lot of people to get bad grades on their report card because they don't like the way some of the smarter kids brag about their high scores.I thought The Report Card was interesting because it made you want to keep reading. The words Andrew used popped out and you could make a picture in your mind. This story flowed like a running river and was a very organized book.

I thought it connected teacher's worries and frustrations about grades and testing to the way students feel about them as well. I didn't think it showed a negative view towards being smart.

It was easy to follow and kept me wondering \\"what happens next?\\"!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"The Report CardNora had a report card she was proud of. In fact, she worked hard to get all D's, but didn't quite succeed; she got one C. She knew that her friend Stephen tried really hard to get good grades, but when he didn't, he felt dumb. If Nora could get a bad report card, she thought Stephen would feel better.Nora knew before she was old enough to go to school, that she was a genius. At a very young age, she could read better than her older brother, but she didn't want to hurt his feelings.While in kindergarten, Nora began to mimic the other children. If one child was struggling with 2+2, she would struggle with 2+2. When she mimicked a child who couldn't read \`cat', she would pretend that she couldn't read \`cat'. Her favorite person to mimic was Stephen.Nora and Stephen became friends and she never told him that she was a genius. In fact, even her parents didn't know of her extreme reading and learning abilities. That was, until the report card. Nora's parents went straight to the school. They held conferences with the teachers and principal. They were going to find out how Nora could get a bad report card without, anyone notifying them, that there was a problem.What Nora hadn't counted on was the IQ test.I liked Nora for not wanting to be the center of attention. She had extreme abilities, but she was just a kid and enjoyed sports and learning, just on her own terms.Jill Ammon Vanderwood, authorThrough the RugThrough The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Clements' book revolves around the importance schools place on standardized testing, and the pressure the testing puts on students and teachers alike to perform well on the tests. (As an elementary school teacher myself, I abhor standardized mandated testing that attempts to assess each student regardless of their individual differences. The kids in my classes forfeit weeks of learning every year as I attend to the testing my district requires. YUCK!)The Report Card is an engaging book that will capture a lot of readers' imaginations...as long as they like the main character, Nora. Nora isn't like some of the other protagonists in Clements' books because she isn't thrust into a difficult situation with which she then has to deal; instead she makes her own life difficult by doing some very unintelligent things."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"11/15/06The Report CardAndrew ClementsSimon & Schuster Children's Publishing DivisionWhat were your grades on your last report card? Do you ever get butterflies in your stomach when you're first opening the envelope? In The Report Card by Andrew Clements this isn't so for Nora - she knows exactly what grades are in her report card. Nora got all D's and one C, but she got them all on purpose. Nora's parents and teachers are very worried so they have her take an IQ test and they find out she is a genius. But Nora didn't want anyone to know because she didn't want to be different. She decides to get zeros on all her tests. Soon almost every student is getting zeros on their tests to make a statement. But all the teachers know Nora is to blame. Will she get out of this big mess?Nora is the main character in this story. She is extremely smart, she is only eleven years old and she can do college level work. Aside from being very smart Nora is your average fifth grader. Nora can remember almost everything from when she was young. She is also very stubborn and will stick to her opinion \`til the end. Through all this she is very good at keeping friendships and this will help her through the story. Her best friend is Stephen Curtis. Stephen is an average student (intelligence wise). He can be very persistent and it can get on people's nerves sometimes. He can be very clever when it comes to making plans. He changes because in the beginning he was not very brave and he was shy and at the end of the story he is very brave. Mrs. Bryne, the librarian, is actually pretty strange. She is quiet and sneaks up on people, she is very nice though. She can be also be very brave when she wants to.The Report Card is a very interesting and surprising realistic fiction book. There were many twists of the plot that kept me at the edge of my chair. And for once I got to see the kids gang up against the teachers. This story was great because I could relate it to things happening in my own life and it was nice to see Nora and Stephen work things out between the two of them. I also liked how Nora could rely on her brother for assistance. Through reading this book I learned a lot of lessons about friendship, family, and school and I hope you will too."},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"I've absolutely loved reading The Report Card, mainly because it's about school. I like school and I think it's wonderful that Andrew Clements writes about problems that take place there. Then, when people read about the problems in the book, they learn from them; as does the character. This is what I learned while reading The Report Card: Even though I'm still in elementary school and my grades don't count towards college or my future career, my actions do. For instance, if I get into a bad habit like not turning in my work on time it will be very hard to get rid of. While the reader is enjoying this book they are learning so many things. This is a great book. Really, there's only one way to find out if you like it or not and I think you know what that is!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"Growing up, did you think your grades and test scores were an accurate representation of the complexity of who you were as a person? Probably not. Many of us felt misunderstood when our report cards arrived with their simplified picture of our educated selves.Nora -- a genius in hiding -- watches when the fourth grade standardized test changes her school culture for the worse. Suddenly school seems to be less about learning and more about competition, with the gifted kids streaming ahead. And Nora's best friend, Stephen -- a kind, gentle, hard-working young man -- suffers a terrible blow to his self-esteem when he freezes up and his resulting test score is abysmal.Nora's plan and execution give the reader the opportunity to think hard about our educational culture. From parental expectations to real estate prices, The Report Card does a great job of explaining how test scores became all important despite being an incomplete illustration.Clement's ability to sympathize with his characters makes this an ultimately hopeful read with no one minimized to \\"bad guy\\" status. Subversive thought it may be in its questionning of the subject matter, even parents who want their kids to get all A's will value the thoughtful respect with which the story is handled.A great read!!!"},{"Title":"The Report Card","review":"In a family of high achievers, Nora Rowley seems to be the odd one out. While her sister's grades and accomplishments are extraordinary, and her brother's are certainly far from lacking, she brings home a report card full of Ds. For years, Nora has convinced her parents, teachers and friends that she is nothing more than average; her brightest talent is on the soccer field.Nora, in truth, is anything but average. She takes college-level astronomy courses online and taught herself to understand Spanish by watching television. In short, she's a genius, but she hides her abilities from almost everyone because she doesn't want to be singled out.The only person who knows this is the school librarian, who discovers Nora's list of visited websites and sees Nora for what she is. Nora, in turn, confides in Mrs. Byrne. As an experiment, she is purposely scoring low to average on tests in order to show everyone that intelligence is not necessarily equal to your test scores. What she starts, instead, is a revolution.For anyone who has ever received a low test score and said, \\"I thought I did better than that!\\" or \\"I'm smarter than that!\\" this is a book to check out. As he did with FRINDLE and THE SCHOOL STORY, Andrew Clements creates a perfect setting to raise the question of \\"What if?\\" and take it beyond simple answers while keeping the story believable.

I didn't like the book at all. I think Nora (the genius) should not hide her intelligence. She should be proud of being smart and not care about jealous others. I think that a report card is a fine way to show how a student is doing, because what else can you use. If a person is less intelligent, they should not be surprised if they get an \\"F\\" or a \\"D\\". If a person is intelligent, they should be glad when they get an \\"A\\". I think that this book COULD have a negative effect some children and even convince them to hide their intelligence to save jealousy. I don't think jealousy is worth hiding your intelligence.

Just as the the Tao Te Ching is a book of ancient and much-translated verses that speaks profoundly human truths in deceptively simple language, Mr. L's book takes the wisdom of the Tao and applies it to a life lived in recovery. Not every verse speaks to every person, since we all come to the book with different personal experiences. Nevertheless, many of the verses will speak to every person, as is the case with some other translations and interpretations of the Tao Te Ching. This is NOT a step-by-step guide to recovery nor a new translation of the TTC, but rather a connection between an ancient piece of wisdom literature and the tasks and understandings of recovery. Its presentation is poetic, sometimes personal, and frequently very practical. To read the book cover-to-cover is to miss its depth; to read the book without first reading the brief introductory piece may miss the author's intention. To embrace what the author has to share about recovery is to meet a very special teacher who becomes an intimate sponsor and guide.

It was written by Joan Littlewood in 1963, and has endured to this day because of the impact it had upon audience when it opened at the Theatre Royal in Stratford East. The play is notorious for being ruthless in exposing the horror of the trenches and the callous incompetence of the ruling classes that plunged Europe into war in 1914.Back in the Sixties, the play was also described as \\"deliciously scandalous\\" because of its aggressive, anti-war stance. Audiences associated the no-holds-barred assault on all the old clich&eacute;s about king and country because of the dramatic social changes accompanying the youth rebellion of the Sixties. The play was one of the few instances up until this point where its content reflected the tumultuous climate of society.A generation was beginning to feel the threat of the war in Vietnam, and this play had an immediate, personal resonance. Some people felt that the play voiced their own thoughts and feelings about war and conflict, whilst many of the older generation were shocked by the show's attitude toward the generals and civilians who sent a generation of young men off to the slaughterhouse of Ypres and the Somme. These were people who remembered the original songs that were being sung, so to see them performed in a completely different way was a sensuous and violent shock.The play was ground-breaking in a number of ways, because it had no immediate human focus, or any continuing character that the audience could come to care about, or even any story to speak of, or a real resolution. In spite of all this, it was still very powerful and also immensely successful simply because of the overwhelming static charge between its subject and the society around it.In terms of content, what makes the play so successful is the combination of songs and imagery, mixed to create a shock in the minds of the audience watching. War songs are sung to express patriotic ideas about fighting, against a backdrop of imagery that reflects the play's real attitude to war. Large images such as soldiers dying after being wounded in gunfire, or decaying corpses left rotting in the mud are accompanied by captions, such as death tolls and \`updates' on the current war situation. The material Littlewood chose came from popular songs from the start of the century which were very patriotic and idyllic. However, in her hands, they become bitingly subversive rather than sterile pieces of heritage.\\"Goodbyeee,\\" sung through clenched teeth, expresses bitterness at the bloodshed of war rather than a stiff upper lip attitude. \\"Forward Joe Soap's Army\\" sung to the tune of 'Onward Christian Soldiers' captures the gallows humour of the trenches. Even a group of women factory workers singing an innocuous sing along number contrasts with the lifeless formality of a British army dance.A few slapstick sketches show the pressures leading to the outbreak of war. Their absurd humour is the ideal vehicle for conveying the madness of August 1914. From then on, musical and comedy sketches are interspersed with moving scenes of war and its impact. The arrival of the first casualties at Waterloo Station stands out. Transport to hospital is arranged for the officers. The rest have to make do.All this takes place as a screen above the stage flashes out casualty figures as the killing intensifies. \\"Total dead in the Battle of the Somme: 1,332,000\\" whizzes above the stage as you watch the actors play a group of demented British army officers. You watch a troupe of war profiteers on the stage as the message board informs you how \\"21,000 American businessmen become millionaires from the war.\\" \\"Average life of a machine gunner: four minutes.\\"The play is still performed on stage throughout the country to this very day, yet some critics have labelled it stale and boring. This is because the cultural shock of the Sixties is no longer present in the 21st Century: what was deemed scandalous some 40 years ago is no longer exciting in modern times, in an era where a vast majority of people have grown up with the firm belief that war is wrong. This fact makes Joan Littlewood's original version all the more timeless, because it successfully captured a moment in time where society was in the midst of a revolution. The memories of the original performances are almost set in stone amongst the audiences who first watched it."},{"Title":"Oh What A Lovely War (Methuen Modern Play)","review":"It was ever so good to read the story lines from whihc the musical has been taken.

It's worth the wait - a chilling and stunning and beautiful collection of poems, written so straightforwardly, as if Howe were just talking to herself as she walked down the street, or to us over coffee. It takes very hard work to make poetry sound so open and easy, and the style is exactly right for the seriousness of her subject(s): death, child abuse, love. Marie Howe is able to hold the pain in her heart up to the light, and is generous enough to let us stand there for a while with her."},{"Title":"What the Living Do: Poems","review":"People have often told me that hearing the word &quot;poetry&quot; sets off high school nightmares of having to &quot;interpret&quot; or decode literature. Such reactions never cease to disappoint me, considering everyone first experiences language through poetry, the playfulness of words. The innate melodies and rhythms that those first tunes bring to life in our early years are revived in Marie Howe's second book of poetry &quot;What the Living Do&quot;. Striving for relentless clarity of language and image, Howe has written a painful celebration of &quot;what the living do&quot; after the death of a loved one. These verses, however, are by no means juvenile, confronting head-on the life and death of her brother John as well as the death of poet Jane Kenyon. And amid the suffering Howe's poetry insists there is room for love, for making love. Whatever loss that the poet endures because of her brother's death is countered (complemented perhaps) by her ability to be intimate and inexorably human amid the living. The poems are powerfully memorable, pushing for an aesthetic that is personal yet connective, accessible yet multi-layered. Writing in a language that is uniquely hers and yet entirely ours for the taking, Marie Howe's &quot;What the Living Do&quot; instructs us on how she has found that both praise and misery can undoubtedly inhabit the same swirling space."},{"Title":"What the Living Do: Poems","review":"\\"Anything I've ever tried to keep by force I've lost.\\"Marie Howe captures the gut feelings of living in her striking book of poetry. The pain of losing her brother to AIDs resonates through the later poems, while the earlier focus on the manic emotions of childhood. Even people uncomfortable with poetry will enjoy reading the universal memories she's translated so touchingly into the written word. This is not esoteric verse: it is clean, familiar, moving moments of time frozen under the glass of a copyright. Howe expresses just what the living do as a melody that swoops and soars. She also underscores her poetry with a deep harmony indicative of the void in life, a hole in one's heart that was once devoted to a loved one.\\"But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass, say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I'm speechless: I am living, I remember you.\\""},{"Title":"What the Living Do: Poems","review":"This collection of poetry, reads like a novel in which Howe utilizes first person, present tense domestic narratives. What impressed me was the immediacy of these poems. The organic form of one long line followed by a shorter line creates a dramatic effect of a leading breath. These highly accessible poems have an epistemological and cognitive bent: Howe doesn't muddle her readers with loose tangents and inconsequential associations. She portrays amazingly vivid moments without overstating. In a succinct manner, the poet describes volumes in concrete language. The eloquency of her poetry is its simplicity.The poems in the first section examine what we do as children to unveil our new world. We learn from our older siblings (The Boy); we learn to ask, seek, and sometimes demand help (Sixth Grade); we experience and experiment (Practicing); we liken our world to the fantastical (The Mother and In The Movies); we come to understand the value of being a confidant (Beth); we distinguish the difference between the public and the private (The Fruit Cellar); and we learn how to control our environment (The Game). These are seemingly personal anecdotes for the poet but which have universal meaning. Literal and figurative parallelism is applied in The Attic where the brother is, \\"building the imaginary building/on the drawing board....\\" And later, when his sister needs him emotionally, \\"he's building a world...\\" a safe haven for her. These moments are bittersweet, savory, palpable.The second section confronts death and dying. When the speaker thinks her brother has died, the poet uses repetition to create tension and frustration: \\"and we couldn't wake him,/we couldn't wake him....\\" In The Last Time, Howe concisely creates an image of wealth and purity with a discussion about mortality (when the sick brother asks the sister to face her own death). My favorite poem in this section is The Grave - where Howe's a sensory master. The grave is symbolic of what we take, what we leave, and what we do in the middle. Trekking in stiletto heels from the grave after the family has proceeded ahead of her, the speaker notes, \\"ovals and dots, fat exclamation marks,/walking inside the steps of my brothers and sisters.\\"This third section regards the speaker as an adult dealing with loss and love. Contemplative with self-awareness to the highest degree, Howe's poetry is breathless and soft, with minimal exposition. An example f this is in the poem Late Morning: \\"and we sat like that for a few minutes, without saying much of anything,/my cheek pressed lightly/against his cheek....\\" Howe reminds us that so much depends on a moment. At times her poems lead us to certain revelations: in Watching Television, Howe writes, \\"Anything I've ever tried to keep by force I've lost..\\" In Reunion, she uses a fresh analogy for two people struggling to remain afloat in love, \\"the dripping of the oars/and the knock and creak of them moving in the rusty locks.\\"Howe works under a high level of consciousness that she gifts to her readers. She refuses to spoon-feed us; she leads us to water but doesn't force the imbibe. Howe evokes a whole gamut of feelings with her precise diction and her purity of voice. In the last section, her title poem is an honest look at minutiae and being so engrossed with it until you finally force yourself to take a moment, take a breath, and remember.... And that's just what this book begs.By far, a powerfully present and celebratory collection of poems. With resoluteness and clarity, Howe has produced a book of poems that's illuminating and proud. This, from the title poem: \\"...What you finally gave up. We want the spring to come and the winter to pass. We want/ whoever to call or not call, a letter, a kiss - we want more and more and then more of it./ But there are moments, walking, when I catch a glimpse of myself in the window glass,/ say, the window of the corner video store, and I'm gripped by a cherishing so deep/ for my own blowing hair, chapped face, and unbuttoned coat that I'm speechless:/ I am living, I remember you.\\""},{"Title":"What the Living Do: Poems","review":"The value of life haunted by those who have lost it: simple, grounded, and devastatingly beautiful.

This collection also embodies a spiritual core, one that speaks to the complexity of the end of this century. Grace and forgiveness are earned through the unrelenting honesty of these lines. It is the sacred in these poems which will make it the collection and Howe the poet of our time. The discipline of Howe's writing, of her thinking, require a delibrateness of craft. Long lines and short bring the conversation of the everyday to a precision often missed in contemporary American poetry.

Too bad."},{"Title":"What the Living Do: Poems","review":"The second of nine children in an Irish Catholic family, Marie Howe writes in these poems of her childhood, and her perspective as an adult looking back. She intertwines her highly accessible images of her experiences in a uniquely dysfunctional family (all dysfunctional families being unique) with the kind of grasp of life's meaning that can reach even the least penetrable intellect.I met Marie Howe and heard her read at the 2000 Dodge Poetry Festival, where she kindly chatted with me, and signed my copy of her book.All that --- and the simple grace of these poems --- came rushing back to me yesterday when I heard Terri Gross interviewing the poet in an April 13, 2012 rebroadcast of the NPR program, in honor of poetry month.Later, when I spoke to a disabled young man with little previous understanding or appreciation of poetry, I mentioned having heard this interview and when he expressed interest, asked if he'd like to hear a poem from the book. The first I read concerned Marie Howe's brother John, a decade younger than she and deceased more than a decade ago, from HIV related complications.First --- having feared blindness since his childhood --- Ms. Howe's brother John had gone blind in one eye. Despite having endured painful treatments described here in excruciating specificity, John had clung to life with every last breath, and meanwhile cherished each moment, as well as his siblings.My listener did want to hear.Thus, I read several of the poems I'd heard again yesterday to my beloved disabled friend. Starting with \\"What the Living Do,\\" and moving on to \\"Prayer,\\" \\"The Boy,\\" and \\"How Some of it Happened\\" --- all of which she'd read on Terri Gross' program --- I paused after each poem to take a breath and let him respond.\\"Awesome,\\" he said, unsolicited, after hearing \\"What the Living Do.\\"I could tell that the poem had resonated with him, through words, at a deep, non-verbal level that he can seldom access verbally on his own (to put it mildly).It was as if I had plucked a violin string that rang sweetly in his ear.One can understand that the simplicity of Ms. Howe's language --- coupled with the highly personal experiences that she relates in these poems --- might elicit a charge that her poems reek of bathos.But, by sharing the personal in such crystal clear language, Ms. Howe deftly and easily touches the deep, dark places of any soul that has ever suffered --- from any cause.She makes the art of these poems look and sound so easy that one could, through jealousy or whatever other misapprehension, mistakenly think, \\"What is so special about that?\\" But special these poems are.Howe achieves a universality of understanding required of all great poetry. Naturally, that explains why the late poet laureateStanley Kunitz, Howe's mentor and friend, found her work so penetrating, spiritual and healing. These ingredients are the essence of art (in any form).This book is all of the above.--- Alyssa A.

In other words, it's a time-traveling adventure tale and a love story, and fabulously decadent, romp, immersing the reader in the underbelly of Copenhagen's scoundrels whilst also transporting us to the behind-the-scenes present day intrigues of the \\"Tin City\\" of London.Living in Copenhagen and working as a prostitute, Charlotte, the heroine of novel is existing hand to mouth, her livelihood fuelled by the furtive needs of men, so when meets the haughty and stuck-up widow, Fru Krak, she sees a very advantageous door opening for herself. Krak's husband has been missing for quite a few years and she is about to remarry. Desperately needing a maid to clean her dilapidated and neglected mansion, Krak invites Charlotte into her employ.With the \\"decrepit old crone\\" Fru Schleswig - whom she is generous enough to support and who she maintains is \\"not her mother\\" - she begins her life as the servant of the sour-faced & foolishly gullible Fru Krak, a new life shaken only by a disquieting visit she makes to the former housekeeper Gudren Olsen who reportedly once had a terrible scare regarding the Krak household.As Charlotte goes about her domestic duties she begins to unravel what might have transpired those seven years ago, causing the mysterious Professor Frederick Krak to have been wiped so suddenly but incisively from the face of the earth. She also learns there were people, who flocked to the house in a secretive and desperate manner, descending into the Krak basement, never to return.With her mind full of s&eacute;ances, dark services with references to \\"the great Beyond,\\" and sightings of the ghost of Professor Krak, Charlotte develops a rapacious greed to know more about the locked basement room that Professor Krak used as his workshop, called the Oblivion Room & the dangerous mechanical devise that might still lie rusting & abandoned within.Fighting the desire to Give up \\"the wages of strumpery,\\" and the urge for adventure, danger and escape, Charlotte - and Fru Schleswig - descend into the basement and - courtesy of a time machine - find themselves whisked away to modern-day London, where they finally encounter Herr Krak at the Greenwich Observatory.In London, the poor Charlotte feels like an innocent babe fresh-shot from the womb. Such is her predicament when she encounters this strange new world that lies before her, the world of the \\"information age,\\" in which her existence is jinxed with dire danger, far beyond the compass of her courage.Here she meets intrepid archeologist Fergus McCrombie, indubitably a twenty-first century man whom she falls in love with, but Charlotte learns the hard lesson that time is ultimately a commodity that can often be made, stolen, bought, wasted, trodden, marked, or put off & even raced against.Her quest for love and redemption is eventually thrown into confusion by events not of her own making. It may be these new surroundings that challenge Charlotte to remake herself; adjusting to life in the twenty-first century has never been fraught with so much difficulty.Dependent on the \\"time-sucker phenomenon\\" known in modern times as the worm hole, and of course the errant time-machine, Charlotte, Professor Krak, Fergus, and Fru Schleswig are transported backwards and forwards from Victorian Denmark to modern London, constantly caught in circumstances beyond their control, even resorting to the sale of black market sale of Viagra to financially keep afloat.Drifting somewhere between fiction and fairy tale and the totally absurd, My Dirty Little Book of Stolen Secrets makes some fun observations about the modern world as Charlotte's path veers from nineteenth century whore to a respectable, love-sick twenty-first century modern girl.Really just a formulaic adventure novel, masquerading as literary fiction, the tale has all the action, behind-the-scenes time traveling and a wretched-out and put upon heroine plot scenario, to satisfy the delights of most readers.In the end, the loved and the lover are finally reunited and the enigma of time seems to have corrected itself. Although Fru Schleswig might still weigh down the indomitable Charlotte, at least the young girl has become triumphant in love.

I found by the end logic went pretty much out the window, and the suspension of disbelief was stretched thin, but still, it's a fun quick read, and the voice of Jensens heroine makes for an entertaining time trip."},{"Title":"MY DIRTY LITTLE BOOK OF STOLEN TIME","review":"Best to start by quoting a paragraph from the Paul Di Filippo review of Liz Jensen works in the July 2007 issue of \\"Asimov's Science Fiction\\" magazine:\\"Jensen is not marketed as a genre author, nor reviewed in genre venues. And she doesn't exactly rate big coverage from mainstream, establishment publications, either--a result, I believe, of her slipstream nature, and her consequent falling in between two camps. And she's British, which, sadly, often militates against a wider audience in the USA. (I suspect, based on the praise-filled British blurbs for her books, that she's got a much higher profile in her native land.) These factors make it unlikely that Asimov readers will have a deep familiarity with her work. And that's a darn shame, given her superb prose, witty fantastical conceits, narrative drive, and mature sophistication.\\"Based on this suggestion from a knowledgeable source, I tried Dirty Little Secrets -- her latest work -- and liked it enough to hunt up copies of Egg Dancing (1995), Ark Baby (1998), The Paper Eater (2000), War Crimes for the Home (2002), and The Ninth Life of Louis Drax (2004).Is it science fiction? fantasy? something else entirely? Your guess is as good as Filippo's; who cares -- a marzipan storyteller."},{"Title":"Two Stories of Prague: King Bohush and The Siblings","review":"These two stories are lovely, and a bit different from the Rilke works to which we English-speakers are exposed. They are very interesting for those enchanted with Prague, as Rilke mentions many landmarks within the city (buildings, graveyards, and such that still exist), and the translator does a very nice job footnoting all the locations mentioned. Both these stories deal with the relationship between the Germans and the Czechs in Prague when Rilke lived there, which is fascinating, since this is no longer the situation at present. The stories are both romantic, but &lt;&lt;King Bohush&gt;&gt; is the better one, being a more convincing picture of reality and less muddled."},{"Title":"Pipeline Construction","review":"This book is ideal for the new entrant into the pipe line industry and I would recommend it to any engineer looking for a base level knowledge and introduction to the industry. It covers all aspects of land pipeline construction including an interesting insight into the historical origins of pipelines. As an engineer of some ten years experience in oil &amp; gas pipeline design, installation and testing I found it to be a book that I wish I had access to at the beginning of my carreer. It does not, however contain detailed information regarding design and engineering issues, it simply provides a sound, easy to understand, clear narrative on pretty much all aspects of pipeline construction from which the reader can develop an interest in specifics and seek to increase his knowledge in these areas. The book contains numerous excellent, clear, colour photographs that illustrate the narrative on each aspect of pipeline construction covered. It's a pity the more technical books available today do not follow a similar format. A second volume to this book addressing the technical and engineering aspects of each section covered would be tremendously valuable to an engineer of similar background to myself who now seeks to learn more about detailed design considerations, welding, materials and other technological advances in the industry. A career in the pipeline industry will get off to a great start with this book! It should be supplied to all graduate engineers joining a pipeline contracting company."},{"Title":"Pipeline Construction","review":"This books does an awesome job explaining the pipeline construction process and providing an overview of the industry. You can purchase it directly from PENTEX for $42 [...]. The copy I received also had a poster that showed the complete pipeline construction spread.Besides Pipeline Construction (by PENTEX), I also recommend the following books:1) Oil & Gas Pipelines in Nontechnical Language by William L. Leffler (It says it is non-technical, but it contains a lot of pipeline hydraulic equations and theory)2) Pipeline Rules of Thumb Handbook, Seventh Edition: A Manual of Quick, Accurate Solutions to Everyday Pipeline Engineering Problems by E.W. McAllister (it is the pipeliner's bible)3) Subsea Pipeline Engineering, 2nd Edition by Andrew C. Palmer and Roger A. King (Hardcover - Jul 29, 2008) - I attended the Clarion Onshore Pipeline Engineering course taught by Roger A. King and Phil Hopkins and it was tremendously beneficial to me. This book presents the same high quality of information for offshore pipeline engineering at a fraction of the cost of attending a Clarion course. I definitely recommend their courses highly (in fact you get a copy of this book when you attend the Offshore Engineering Course), but if your employer is not willing to pay the price of the course, the book is an inexpensive alternative."},{"Title":"Night flight to Hanoi;: War diary with 11 poems","review":"Daniel Berrigan had a extended career as a leftist college agitator long before the Vietnam war began. He, his brother, and other counter culture advocates have done their level best to take Mathew Arnold's dictum that all cultures should aspire to be the very best that they could and have turned it on its ear. In NIGHT FLIGHT TO HANOI, Berrigan persists in seeing America in the same light as does his leftist colleague, Howard Zinn, both of whom view the United States as having begun in genocide and imperialism with Columbus and continuing in linear fashion right up to the day of his publishing his book. To Berrigan and Zinn, America can do no right and its avowed enemies can do no wrong. What they lack in their wish to ally themselves with anti-humanistic ideologies like communism and socialism is the lack of historical perspective. It is quite true, as Berrigan relentlessly charges that brutality, slavery, and patriarchy were present from Columbus on. What Berrigan ignores is that they were also present in pre-Columbus MesoAmerican societies like the Incas and Mayas, both of whom included blood sacrifice as part of their cultural repetoire. Further, much of the world of the 15th century engaged in much the same atrocities. What Berrigan and Zinn additionally ignore is that it was the reviled United States that led the way to eradicate such atrocities. As Berrigian mentions the paradise that he sees as North Vietnam, I was reminded of the personal narrative of John McCain who might add a different less noble version of North Vietnamese justice. What emerges from a considered reading of NIGHT FLIGHT TO HANOI is that the blinkers and blinders that shackled Berrigan and Zinn back in the 70s continue to do so for today's newest generation who can't wait to rail against a country that shelters and nurtures their very ability to do so."},{"Title":"Night flight to Hanoi;: War diary with 11 poems","review":"The Roman Catholic Priest the very Reverend Father Daniel Berrigan provides a powerful, prophetic lifetime of courageous compulsion to peace without fear, from his most recent exegetical workThe Kings and Their Gods: The Pathology of Powercondemning our present conflicts to this early work from over forty years ago of his plane ride with the late, great historian Howard Zinn into Hanoi to receive US POW airmen as a holiday gift by the Vietnamese government. Because the US military declined after the fact conditions for their release, other airmen, including John McCain, remained captive. Had this gesture of peace been embraced openly, honestly and sincerely, McCain as well would have been soon released.Berrigan and travelling companion Howard Zinn, respected scholar, historian and author of, among other works,People's History of the United States: 1492 to Present (P.S.)andA People's History of American Empire, traveled to Hanoi in early 1968 for this mission of mercy and peace to receive generously released US POW's as a preliminary gesture towards an established, negotiated peace. Instead of this and in the presence (or absence) of an assassinated candidate we received the carpet bombing of Hanoi, the unpopular presidency of Richard Nixon, the regional expansion of our bombing and continuing escalation of our immoral and unjust horrors until the disastrous downfall of that lamentable president.Here let us read as illumination of our present eagerly endless embrace of warmongering and war-profiteering a brief glimmer of truth and of hope and of justice and of morality, of compassion and of peace, eloquently recorded by the very Reverend and brilliant Father Berrigan, brave prophet of peace.Zinn in his welcome introduction wondered when Father Berrigan had time to write such brilliant poetry as recorded here, and such a brief yet comprehensive chronicle of their journey towards peace, a record which the historian Zinn admires both for its objectivity and for its profoundinterpretation of events. We too may read this record with wonder, and with hope, empowering us to work as well for that peace which surpasses all understanding.A worthy book for any library, historical, spiritual, American and universal. A worthy read at any moment, in class or in church or on the brave barricade of peace. Read this Catholic author, completely. Excellent Lenten reading; excellent reminder of the late Howard Zinn."},{"Title":"Zagreb Croatian Spring","review":"If you ever wondered why the Croats wanted independence from a Serbian-dominated country, you probably should pick up Ivo Omrcanin's review of the events in Zagreb in the spring of 1971. Zagreb Croatian Spring documents a very important but brief time in Tito's Yugoslavia. This well written documentary of Croatia's attempt for freedom under Tito even includes the notorious &quot;Declaration of Croatian Language.&quot; This is a must for students of Croatian history and even a good read for those who want to know what Franjo Tudjman did before he became President of one of Europe's new countries"},{"Title":"Black tiger at Indianapolis","review":"I love this book.

If there is a theme, which has yet to emerge three-quarters into the book, it is buried in sentences such as: &quot;In one part of Northern Europe, however, little was only briefly large.&quot;Only if that sentence means something to you would I recommend buying it."},{"Title":"Napoleon: Man of War, Man of Peace","review":"The author has an earlier book which I have entitled \\"Napoleon and his Artists\\" covering most of the same ground.I did not buy this book for the above reason and a quick browse confirmed that suspicion.Thus this book rehashes almost the same topics - Napoleon's life, his achievements especially in the artistic sphere and thru Josephine's patronage, his relations with the savants, during and after the Egyptian campaign, specific anecdotes on Vivant Denon, Jean L Gros,and of course Jacques L David. Nothing new."},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"I've read all three in the trilogy and I must say that this is the one that I enjoyed the most. This is the book that got me HOOKED. I loved how the love between Daniel and Mercy flowed so easily between them. There was none of the hate-love conflict that always goes on in books. I thoroughly enjoyed it. By far the best!"},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"Let me start by saying that this book is not what is described above in the story details. Amazon has crossed this with another book. This is Daniel and Mercy's story and the final book in the Wabash trilogy.Daniel and Mercy have been inseparable for most of their life since being adopted by Liberty and Farr. Actually they were rescued/saved by Liberty/Farr. They have grown up as brother and sister through all of their life. They aren't as close in the past years as they are both starting their adult lives. But when suddenly strangers appear in town and insist that Mercy is actually their sister Hester things change quickly. Percy is back a a villain in this story and he is now in the slave trade, actually he is running a slave \\"breeding factory\\" and is evil as ever. He still hates anyone or anything attached to the Quills.One of the biggest turmoil's in this story is that Mercy's brothers who basically have no manners to speak of want her to go back to Kentucky with the to see her dying mother. This makes her wonder who she really is..... Along the way she and Daniel realize that they both love each other but are afraid to tell the other. On goes the struggle.A good romance story!"},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"Another excellent Garlock book. Ms. Garlock is a master of including people from other stories and interweaving them through the lives she writes about, and this one was definitely no exception. Mercy and Daniel are charming characters, with many of the traits of Liberty and Farr - the couple that raised them, and were featured in a previous book of this trilogy. I was not ready for this story to end, and would also have liked to read about Farr and George, and Amy and Rain coming home. However, Ms. Garlock made it very clear they were in route. Nevertheless, I would have enjoyed the homecoming.Mercy is not quite as strong as Liberty or Amy, from the previous books in this trilogy. She did seem pretty dependent on Daniel, however, she was going through quite a lot, and that seemed only natural. She held herself together very well, with her chin high and the same quick temper of Liberty Quill.Their love story was so sweet and warm, and very enjoyable to read. With the involvement of the family rival, Hammond Perry, still bent on revenge after all these years... the story keeps moving at a fast pace. I found it hard to put down, like the others in this trilogy."},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"Dorothy's Garlock's Wabash trilogy is the best of the best. You'll fall in love with these characters. I feel like they are dear friends. I've read this book and the other two books of the trilogy over 20 times. Daniel and Mercy, Raine and Amy, Libery and Farr, it was wonderful to see what happened to my beloved characters."},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"The only problem I had with this book is that my favorite characters of the Wabash trilogy, Rain and Amy, were only briefly mentioned. I wanted to see them enjoying a wedded bliss and meet their two boys. Otherwise, this book featured a great love story between Mercy and Daniel. At first, I thought that they would be a pale version of Amy and Rain or Libby and Farr, but they and their story was unique. Mercy's character was similar to Libby's and Daniel's to Rain's. Mercy's sharp tongue and short temper were a delight, but her neediness wore me out. Daniel was dependable and decent, a great combination, but he was a bit boring at times. The discovery of Mercy's origins was a good plot twist and I grew to like her family. Mercy's and Daniel's shot-gun wedding is extremely funny and I re-read it several times. Eleanor is more lovable here than in &quot;Dream River&quot; and Gavin is still wonderful. I was a little bit disappointed that Ms. Garlock briefly described Tennessee's and Mike's romance without giving it an end. Although Mike became weaker here than in &quot;Dream River&quot;, I enjoyed what little there was about his and Tenny's romance and hoped that Ms. Garlock would spend as much time on them as she did on Eleanor and Gavin in &quot;Dream River&quot;. This novel lacks a satisfying ending, which would be Farr returning with George and Amy and Rain making it to the family reunion."},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"I love historical fiction and this was full of history. I would encourage you to read the whole series. .A great read"},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"I enjoyed this book so much, as I am a resident of the areas where the story took place.

They are that good.When you read this series, be sure to read them in order. They are all stand alone books, but if you don't read them in order you will miss out on an absolutely wonderful adventure into the world of the old frontier. One thing I love about Garlock's work, is that you run into different characters in different books. Very clever.When a writer writes as Ms Garlock does, she offers us a piece of her heart.Well done, Ms Garlock. Bravo! Bravo!"},{"Title":"River of Tomorrow","review":"This book was great and I got it at a great price on Amazon. This book is part of a trilogy: Dream River and Lonesome River.

Great ending to the trilogy, excellent characters with plenty of charisma between them. Loved reading about some of the other characters in the trilogy, but would have loved to read more about Amy and Rain from the second book. Overall one of the best historical romance trilogies I have read! HIGHLY recommended!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"As she proved with \\"The Shipping News\\", author Annie Proulx has an unmistakably intricate, often elegant writing style. The eleven stories that constitute her latest book are testament to her talent, though the short story format seems to undermine her ability to deepen her characters as much this time. In certain ways, that works just fine since the somewhat interrelated stories almost feel like parables set in her vision of a rural Wyoming caught in a downward economic spiral. She brings a tough yet big-hearted sensibility to her stories, some more than others. But on the whole the approach balances itself out well.My favorite of the bunch is \\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\\", which despite its jokey title is actually a serious-minded distillation of the current red-state mentality. It's a compelling tale about a man who can't make a go of his ranch and what it's like to see your traditional way of life eroding on every front. Rancher Gilbert Wolfscale keeps at it, doggedly and half-hopelessly, fighting against the odds to save his land. The author writes about him with a tenderness worthy of a Horton Foote, and with a deep-seeded sympathy both for Gilbert's determination to stay on his home ground and also for his urge to flee. He receives a final blow when saline wastewater pits, the byproduct of coal-bed methane drilling on land next to his, start poisoning his own land. Ranchers are suddenly thrown together with eco-conservationists, but they get nowhere protesting against the politicians and gas company officials who favor proceeding with the drilling. Wolfscale ends up on the open road, driving for the sake of driving and not caring where he's headed. He's about the only character in ''Bad Dirt'' who receives the full measure of her love.Five of the 11 stories in ''Bad Dirt'' are little more than comic anecdotes about the eccentrics who inhabit Elk Tooth, whose sole distinction is its three popular bars -- Pee Wee's, Muddy's Hole and the Silvertip. In fact, a sixth tale, ''The Old Badger Game,'' is hardly a story at all but an odd animal fable that some drunkard would have told in one of those taverns. The other story worth highlighting is \\"Man Crawling Out of Trees\\", which describes through the eyes of a retiring New York couple, the difficulties of being a newcomer to Wyoming. The wife bears the loneliness as best she can, while her husband delights in long drives through his new surroundings, classical music blasting from his car stereo. Through a series of revelations, a flawed marriage is exposed, and the power of place collides with their reality in unexpected ways, and Proulx is careful not to tip her hand toward where her deepest sympathies lie. As a whole, \\"Bad Dirt\\" hangs together nicely with recurring minor characters tying the stories unobtrusively. With the exception of a couple of stories that simply seem out of kilter with the rest, Proulx's book certainly makes the ranchland atmosphere of an economically downtrodden but physically beautiful Wyoming come to life."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"The other posted reviews here all do some justice to this book. It was not the overwhelming and unforgettable event of Wyoming Stories but I was glad it was published and happy to have read it. For one thing, it underscores the acheivement of the first volume. The stories have their own interest but like the minor works of a great genius composer we gain insight from our time with them into the great accomplishment. we see haow much it took to produce.As one reviewer said, they do not bring on the great poetry and technicolor of the first ones but illuminate a variety of human types we might pass on our tourist visits and never have the imagination or empathy to imagine a life for.Flannery o'Conner would have loed the trailer stories and the people."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Having just finished \\"Close Range,\\" awed by Proulx's unique language of the Wyoming landscape, I was frankly disappointed by the stories in \\"Bad Dirt.\\" These stories reveal a placid Proulx whose stories are so uncharacteristic, that they seem written by another author. Admittedly, the characters are similar, and the country is as barren and unforgiving. But Proulx holds back, and one senses that she has simply run out of steam, like one of her aging, spent ranchers."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"The characters are one dimensional, the plot lines meander and go no where, and the narration is tedious to the point of insanity. Wyoming is a wild and beautiful place, but her descriptions are as evocative as a suburban shopping mall. The only reason this book was published is because some of Proulx's other books have been commercial successes. The only good thing about this book is that I didn't pay for it. If you want great short stories, check out Tobias Wolff, Raymond Carver, Richard Ford, etc. Leave this one on the bargain table where it belongs."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Annie Proulx has the ability to paint images with words that most artists and photographers can only dream of doing in their media. This fact alone makes her book an enjoyable read by anyone who reads a lot. Unfortunately, imagery is about all there is to recommend Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2. The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for. All in all, for this reader at least, a major disappointment. For readers who have enjoyed other works by Proulx, I wouldn't recommend reading this one."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Having been born and raised in Wyoming, I thought this collection of short stories would entertain me. Boy was I wrong. This book is horrific. I'm thankful that I bought it for next to nothing because after I read it, I threw it in the trash at a gas station. I didn't want anybody else to be lulled into a competent authors last ditch attempt to write anything anybody would actually want to read. Her character exaggerations are uselessly wild and outrageous. And what is with the character names? This book was not even slightly entertaining or accurate (okay, maybe the wind bit but that is all!) pure rubbish."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"I am SURE I would love this book if I READ it, but instead got it on audio. It was just awful It was a poor performance, not a narration, and I could hardly bear to listen to Dufris. I was on a long trip and had no other audiobook with me, but I stopped listening anyway. Silence was better than this.Maybe it is just me, but when I read a book, I do not imagine different voices for the various characters in a novel. So it annoys me no end when I listen to a book where the narrator plays different parts. To me, this is kind of creepy, epecially when a female narrator *plays* male roles or vice-versa. And it is really bad when the narrator/performer is not very good.Perhaps it would be helpful if the cover said \\"performed by\\" instead of \\"narrated by\\".I just want someone to read the darn book to me. I am not interested in listening to someone who thinks s/he is up for an acting award!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"but I haven't read it yet. I bought and read the first Wyoming collection, and I've read a few other Proulx stories in The New Yorker. I think I know what I'll find in \\"Bad Dirt.\\"I was born and grew up in Wyoming, in the Goose Creek valley east of the Big Horns, a region that's been compared to the Vale of Kashmir for its complex beauty. (I suspect that's an exaggeration, although it was made by a person who'd been to both places. I hope to go to the Vale someday, and judge for myself.) Many other parts of Wyoming are beautiful, terrible, and strange. I don't recognize find many -- or any! -- of them in Annie Proulx. Neither do I recognize the rather austere and capable people I grew up with among her rural grotesques. (They make me think of Richard Russo's laughably unlikely characters in his Gloversville novels.) I guess city folks like to imagine rural people that way. Annie gives 'em what they want.I should mention that I bought \\"Bad Dirt\\" off a remainders pile for $5.98US."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"I greatly enjoyed Proulx' Close Range collection of short stories,and Bad Dirt (subtitled \\"Wyoming Stories 2\\") is a very worthyencore. The Close Range stories gave a wonderful flavor to therural areas of the state, the people, the land, the warm and therough sides, both past and present. Some of the stories werehumorous, others were harrowing, some were a whimsical mix. You'llfind just the same mix (and a bit more) in Bad Dirt. You start offwith a 12-page story about Game & Fish Warden Creel Zmundzinski (whoturns up again in a couple of more stories) that begins in a nicestraightforward fashion, and then takes off into a kind ofhumorous Proulx-Stephen King joint venture (or perhapsProulx-King-Carl Hiaassen).Several stories center on the residents and the 3 bars in the tinytown of Elk City: I very much like reading another of Proulx'short stories when I feel that I already know the characters well(one of these is a kind of Proulx-Hiaassen mix involving rentalalligators--it sounds bizarre, but the story works in a trulydelightful way).The best of the stories is The Wamsutter Wolf, and runs about 35pages. Buddy Millar lives in a $40/month rental housetrailer5 miles out from the center of a small boomtown (almost alltrailers). You don't get much for your $40 a month. His onlyneighbors live close by in an even grungier trailer--a bully whobeat him up in high school, his wife and passel of grungy youngkids, one of whom is a 4-year-old alcoholic (his father believesthat learning to drink young avoids the problems that come withlearning later). This is a horrifying and harrowing story--stronger than anything I remember in Close Range. It's verytough, utterly realistic, and it left me wanting to see itexpanded to about 300 pages as a novel.Annie Proulx and William Gay (I Hate To See The Evening Sun GoDown) are the two best short-story writers I've read in manyyears--and both write excellent novels as well."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Didn't like it as much as At Close Range. The stories seems less inspired, a little more flippant, a little less likely to grab you, shake you, scratch you, bite you, gouge you than the former collection. Still very well written, and more engaging that most stuff I pick up on a whim or obtain on recommendation from friends or family. Oh - I'm a Wyoming native, I live on the family ranch outside Saratoga (look it up on a map!), and trust me, the other reviews from us 'Pokes are right - these stories (and At Close Range) actually are pretty durn close to Wyoming then and now (especially the geography and landscapes, the climate, the damn WIND, and the very necessary self-reliance of most folks), although I'd have to say your average WY native is maybe just a little bit less colorful and probably a little bit more of a warm, caring, educated person (though we have more than our share of Proulx characters)."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"This volume of stories about Wyoming contains four fully developed, character-driven short stories interspersed with what feels like seven thinly disguised local anecdotes. Yet in both kinds of stories Proulx demonstrates a Faulkner-like skill at portraying agrarian locals coming head-to-head with modernity. The final (anecdotal) story, \\"Florida Rental\\", especially reminded me of Faulkner's \\"Spotted Horses\\" sequence from The Snopes Trilogy. And like Faulkner, Proulx seems to have an underlying affection (or at least respect) for all her characters, even the ones she seems to enjoy skewering.The substantial stories that I enjoyed are: \\"The Indian Wars Refaught\\" about a troubled young Sioux woman who reconnects with her sense of identity while sorting archival material related to the battle of Wounded Knee; \\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?,\\" about one Wyoming rancher's decline in the face of changing times, a failed marriage, and sons who've gone their own ways; \\"Man Crawling Out of Trees\\" about an elderly couple who moved to Wyoming from the East and how each of them responds in radically different ways to the rugged terrain, taciturn populace, and sense of isolation; \\"The Wamsutter Wolf\\" in which the human characters are eerily shown to behave according to wolf pack mores. Of all the stories, these four come closest to matching the standard Proulx set for herself with \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\" Also worth mentioning here is \\"Dump Junk,\\" a story that interestingly moves beyond Proulx's very grounded sense of reality into the realm of fantasy.All in all, this is a pretty satisfying collection of stories."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"I've read Annie Proulx's earlier collection of Wyoming Stories (Close Range -- see my review of it if you'd like) and found this collection equally masterfully written. Even as I get absorbed in each story, I can stand back and just admire the skill of using words to paint pictures of people and places. Amazing!These stories struck me as being more cheeky than the Close Range stories -- not quite as poignant, but more toward the funny side. But the tall-tale, mythical quality is still there, as is the spot-on description of the dusty, harsh, and utterly beautiful star of the book -- Wyoming -- and the dusty, harsh, and utterly beautiful people who dare to call it home. We meet all kinds: crusty ranchers, ex-urbanites, oil and gas workers, mountain men, wildlife agents. Their lives intertwine within and between stories until the whole collection becomes one larger-than-life whole. I got this book from the library, but liked it so much that it might be one that I'll actually add to my collection. I can't recommend it highly enough -- go get it today!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Annie Proulx tickles me. I loved \\"Shipping News\\" for its mix of quirky characters, dark humor, sentiment, sheer scariness, and the impact of an isolated and starkly beautiful landscape. Much of this shows up again in her short stories set in Wyoming, where isolation and economic contingencies tend to get a strangle hold on the people who live there. The tough survive OK, but only by fierce determination and good luck, of which there is scarcely enough to go around.The stories range from brief comic interludes, existing sometimes chiefly for the sake of a punch line (\\"The Old Badger Game\\" and \\"Summer of the Hot Tubs\\"), to humorous yarns about colorful local characters (\\"The Trickle Down Effect\\"), to longer accounts of people up against unwelcome circumstances with every potential of crushing them. The marriage of a retired New York couple in a massive log house on a ranchette starts to crumble under the pressure of a Wyoming winter (\\"Man Crawling Out of Trees\\"). A 4th-generation rancher is squeezed into a desperate corner by rising costs, falling prices, coalbed methane drilling, and a disintegrated family (\\"What Kind of Furniture Would Jesus Pick?\\").A hundred years of Wyoming history are compressed into a story about the fortunes of a wealthy polo-playing family, the empty shell of which is invaded by descendants of the massacred at Wounded Knee (\\"The Indian Wars Refought\\"). And finally, in my favorite story of the bunch, a young man trying to pull his life back together finds himself in a nightmarish situation involving a violent neighbor (\\"The Wamsutter Wolf\\"). This one had me sitting up past my bedtime, wide-eyed in the night and heart pounding.The tone of the stories varies with the publication they were written for, and these range from The New Yorker to the literary quarterlies, to Playboy. Once you get over that, you can settle back and just let Proulx pull out whatever stops she cares to, to create one heck of a read - and one right after another.Readers who enjoy her broadly humorous Elk Tooth stories will enjoy Robert Welsch's comic collection, \\"It's Not the End of the Earth, But You Can See It From Here,\\" set in fictional Centralia, Nebraska."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Miz Proulx musta' gotten into a patch of locoweed while she was a'writing these stories.

The subtle,somber hues of those stories have been replaced in BAD DIRT by a garish, psychedelic pallete.Gaudy colors do not, however, equate to warmth. Proulx's stories are inflated, unfunny jokes and most of her characters are unattractive caricatures bearing improbable names like Fiesta Punch, Reverend Pecker, Suzzy New, Lobett Pulvertoft Thirkill, Mercedes de Silhouette, and Dr. Playfire. The plots go beyond improbable. A game warden discovers a hidden entrance to Hell in a Forest Service parking area and uses it to deal with out-of-state poachers. A red-furred badger tells his cronies that a rancher's wife has fallen in love with him. A bartender imports alligators to defend her vegetable garden from marauding cows. An expatriate makes accidental use of a magic teakettle found when cleaning out her late mother's house.Despite heavy lardings of fictional biography and gratuitous back-story, the stories in BAD DIRT smell anachronistic. They are the sort of tall tales the denizens of bars like the fictional Pee Wee's in Elk Tooth, Wyoming might tell about their parents or grandparents. Yet Proulx's crusty eccentrics are mostly baby-boomers living in the first decade of the 21st century, not the first half of the 20th.Perhaps not coincidentally, the best story in the collection, \\"Man Crawling Out Of Trees\\" concerns transplanted easterners, like Proulx herself, learning to cope with life in Wyoming. In the end, one of them flees back to New York. Perhaps BAD DIRT is meant to be Proulx's exit line."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"This volume of Wyoming stories is just as true, and at times as harsh, as \\"Close Range,\\" but it is infused with more humor. I found it a much easier read than \\"Close Range.\\" However, it did not resonate with me the same. It was overall a lighter take on Wyoming life. I would recommend it, but only after you read \\"Close Range.\\""},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"These stories range from mildly funny to utterly bizarre, and as I savored each tidbit I could barely wait for more. Heck, this was worth reading just to get acquianted with folks with names as Runyonesque as can be. The whole assemblage ends up with the flavor of modern fairy tales; in the end, a lesson is learned, good wins over evil, the prince & princess live happily ever after. Sort of, in a crooked way. I liked the connectivity, the fact that because I'd read about a character in one story I already had the inside scoop on him or her as played out in a subsequent tale. And of course the \\"character\\" of Wyoming plays out across the whole book. This book is a good summer read."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Annie Proulx is one of the finest living American writers. She is gifted at crafting longer works of fiction that explore the complexities of some very unique people, but also equally talented at creating short stories about similar characters that are just as lasting. \\"Bad Dirt\\", a second collection of short stories set in her beloved and tested Wyoming, is a collection that offers pathos and humanity and humor along with a little of the fantastic.One of the standouts in this collection is \\"Men Crawling Out of Trees\\" about a pair of New York transplants whose marriage is crumbling and who will never quite fit in among their adopted neighbors, no matter how hard they try. \\"The Wamsutter Wolf\\" is a harrowing look at the bleakness of life for those who have few options to leave a depressed state, and \\"The Indian Wars Refought\\" is a heartfelt examination of the ranching life and the impact of reservation life for Native Americans. Proulx tempers her longer stories with short gems, like the initial \\"The Hellhole\\" about a Game and Fish Warden who discovers a remarkable (and perhaps miraculous) way to dispose of criminals.In each story, whether serious or downright humor-driven like \\"Florida Rental\\", Proulx creates characters that are real and believable. It would be impossible to surpass some of her previous masterpieces in terms of short stories, like \\"Close Range\\" and \\"Heartsongs\\" but \\"Bad Dirt\\" reaffirms what an incredible writer Proulx is. It would be far praise indeed to say that she just might do for the West what Flannery O'Connor did for the South. She has a way of creating stories and characters that sear into your imagination and will not leave. The bad dirt of Wyoming definitely makes for some excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"These remarkable short stories are equally masterpieces that one does not get bored reading them repeatedly. The depiction of rural life is amazing.The stories are equally compelling with vivid descriptions, beautiful narratives and brilliant plots. Like The Usurper and Other Stories, A twist in the Tale and the Works of Anton Chekhov, this collection is a part of my list of good stories and books. They made me laugh a lot and I learned something from every one of them."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Proulx's \\"Bad Dirt\\" captures the size, dryness and dust-blown reality of the Wyoming setting and throws a range of modern-day characters into the scene, complete with (her signature) odd names and even odder behavior. There are good guys and bad guys, heroes and protagonists. And in case the reader gets bored with things, she throws in a few fables to keep things interesting - something I had not seen in previous work.While this book is not as realistic as the first in the trilogy, it makes up for that fact with more colorful writing and more desperate situations. I was reminded of Proulx's \\"Postcards\\" in many of the stories, the writing has that same isolated, haunting tone. Proulx knows what it's like to live on a wind-blown prairie or a rocky scrub. She also reads human behavior well and is a keen observer. Taking both of these ingredients and carefully paring them down to their most salient elements is what she does best. The writing is spare and the dialogue even more so.One can't help but also sense of Proulx's own personality, dislikes and likes. Careful reading between the lines shows that while she respects many Wyoming residents' livelihood and history, she also knows it may be best to keep them at an arm's length. Her penchant for wacky names, laundry lists and spare dialogue show a peculiar - if not interesting - take on life and it's one that this reviewer finds intriguing enough to come back for more.-------(The following review is for \\"Just Fine the Way It Is\\", the last of the three Wyoming Stories. Amazon will not allow my review to appear on the actual product page, stating I bought them as a set and cannot review them separately, even though this is not the case, I bought each as a separate purchase)-------While still excellent writing, of the three books which make up the series \\"Wyoming Stories\\", this is easily the least cohesive and suffers from a few Twain-esque additions which mark an odd departure from the whole.Most of the stories are standard Proulx fare; evocative, timely and unique. I was particularly drawn to the final novelete, \\"Tits Up in a Ditch\\" because it covered the most ground and encompassed 3 generations of the Listers, a ranch family of lower economics and backward ways, making them both embarrassing and endearing. Another gem is \\"Testimony of the Donkey\\", which reveals the writer's own pith through the character of Catlin, a fiercely independent, modern boheme, who shows us that independent traits can be both rewarding and deadly.When Proulx stumbles, she does so with flair. \\"I've Always Loved This Place\\" and \\"Swamp Mischief\\" are both stories featuring the Devil, and - while interesting and slightly humorous to read - are both polished coal in an otherwise unique collection of fine stones. They're good efforts, but Mark Twain she ain't. As well, \\"Deep-Blood-Greasy-Bowl\\" lopes in to paleo-historic territory and diverges into a writing meter that didn't hold my interest as well as Proulx's familiar, homespun style. When I buy Proulx, I expect Proulx.These low points don't exactly ruin the whole, but they dent a good fender on the vehicle which Proulx drives beautifully around her beloved state of Wyoming."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"The scenic, hardship, and roughness of the Wyoming ranching wilderness is painted in a lasting reading impression done in a short-story gold-nugget format.Never before has the changing and past American West been so quirkily idolized. And done so well.Human behavior is captured in such a colorful, poetic, detailed manner unlike anything I have ever read. Some of the word choices demonstrate excellent wordsmithing that succinctly create a picture. The sexual relationships among characters give each story grist, realism, and lasting impact where no man has gone before.There are bar stories in this volume that trigger giggling that would be worth in $50 of antidepressant medication with no side effects!I thought the first story \\"The Hellhole\\" oddly enough reminded me of Satanic Verses and the schizophrenic, psychedelic nature of the thinking processes of the characters in the book satirized from a humanitarian perspective. Perhaps drinking induces a similar effect in bar tall-tail telling folklore.As some have written, I too think Annie Proulx has a Steinbeckian style when describing the American West, but I don't think this volume's tone is as serious as the first and is more humorous. This and the prior volume reminded me of 10th grade English when I read American short stories and developed some knowledge of American authors and literature. I can imagine some of her stories being selected to be included in such textbooks some day!I have a rough time picking one story from the book as my favorite since each is such a colorful jewel. I tend to think you need to read the entire book as a collage of life experiences to see the big picture of Wyoming culture.I truly loved this book and the prior volume and I think Annie Proulx is one mighty fine writer."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"I gave this book as a gift. It is still one of the best I have ever read. Annie Proulx will make you very disappointed with any other author you read next. If you love the West and especially Wyoming, this book is a must."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"I started with the hugely acclaimed popular fiction,'Shipping News' and have worked myself through most of Proulx's output. 'Bad Dirt' is a second round of shorter pieces on the town folk of her region. I suspect they are based on actual folk and I wonder how she fares with those who can 'spot the influence', as for the most part the characters are resourceful types but subject to the author's merciless mirth. I'm not there, or party to these truths. So I can sit comfortably and howl with laughter at the excruciating, often sad characters who have an exotic appeal even in the ring of their names, so removed from the Australian lexion. Other than for the names,many of these tales could have been sourced beyond the perimeter of our sprawling cities. It's for this humourous side and for a greater eveness of quality that I rate this above its predecessor. And for the sense of community that emerges through the repetition of names and venues, and the remorseless struggle to eek it out there it such formidable an environment. Proulx has really seen something there, and she is in total command of placing you in the seat along side herself. Would Ang Lee revisit Proulx for a set of these Northern Exposures?"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"I enjoyed the CD of this book very much! I don't see the audio version of BAD DIRT for sale here at Amazon, but if you enjoy books on tape and Annie Proulx stories, try to get these CDs. I don't recall the reader's name, but he does a fantastic job telling the stories and voicing the various peculiar characters of Proulx's Wyoming. And the stories themselves are amazing, at times harrowing, at times laugh out loud hilarious."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"Once again, Annie Proulx has \\"painted\\" a masterpiece of individuals, locations and situations. I find myself totally immersed in every one of her stories. Would I personally want to be associated with any of these strange characters and/or plights? Probably not, but I certainly do enjoy becoming a part of their lives through the pages of Ms. Proulx's books! I look forward to her next collection!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"This book has hilarious short stories that totally capture the way of life out here in the REAL West.. Annie must live the life and know the characters personally to have created such rich little stories about people I swear I know. I live in a small town in Idaho and I've long thought about writing about the characters around here, but I didn't think anyone would believe me. She even slips in a tall tale or two which you are suckered into for a few pages before you realize, no.... wait..... that can't be, even though it's a nice thought! I've shared this book with my whole family and they love it too."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"This is the coda to \\"Close Range,\\" E.

I liked this collection quite a bit, found it more approachable than \\"Close Range.\\" Most memorable was \\"The Summer of Hot Tubs,\\" a hilarious story that you can imagine being told after dinner.

Proulx is clearly in touch with Wyoming's geography and culture, and she creates some laugh out loud moments, but the endings to her stories are let-downs."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"This book of stories depicts the life of the sparsely populated lands of Wyoming. The hardscabble, tough fought life for existence is depicted with Proulx' usual excellence. Her language is that of the Wyoming environment. Her characters are the wind toughened, deep winters folks of the life that tests each and every persons ability to cope with a severe environment.Her stories are loosely connected through the bars that the people of Wyoming patronize and some of the characters that reappear from story to story. From her story about the devil's hole that consumes people in flames, to the unique method of keeping cattle off one's land, the stories are true and bare portrayals of an existence of challenge.The book is recommended to all readers who like great prose and excellent depictions of hard lives with which Annie Proulx is so familiar. Her life in both Wyoming and Newfoundland allows her to observe how those that live in such challenging territories manage to keep on going. Once again, Proulx creates a wonderful portrait of life under stress. It is a truly fine read."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"This is a great book. Many of the stories had me laughing out loud. I didn't find BAD DIRT as 'bleak' as CLOSE RANGE and POSTCARDS. I almost didn't read it, because I found the two others listed above as just too much hardship and deprivation. I kept repeating the word 'bleak' about Annie Proulx's writing, until I read BAD DIRT. Give it a try, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"This was the second Annie Proulx book of her Wyoming Stories, that I've read. I'm ready to go for a third!Her characters are drawn well, very human and often quirky. She gives you a real feel for the Wyoming country, the people who live there, and the ones who stay and survive. Some of her stories border on fantasy, and they are some of the most memorable. These are all short stories, three of them are worth reading over and over.My favorites: \\"The Hellhole\\" a very darkly funny story about what happens to people who break the fish & game laws. \\"The Old Badger Game\\" about a badger who's convinced a rancher's wife is crazy about him. \\"Summer Rental\\" is a lot of fun, and a novel way to deal with problem neighbors and their cattle.

You find yourself unable to put the book down, and the biggest disappointment is reaching the end, and wishing there was more. Annie Proulx knows human nature, and is not afraid to delve between the shiny surfaces and pull out the grimy undercurrent which motivates her characters. A must read for real escapism!"},{"Title":"Bad Dirt: Wyoming Stories 2","review":"For critical readers, AP's second, sometimes brilliant volume of short stories about Wyoming, contains covert warnings against living or retiring in the state. \\"Bad Dirt\\"'s 11 stories are good to excellent, with two exceptions, the opening story and the story about badgers. The state of Wyoming is said to have a population \\"large enough to fill a phone booth\\". They may be poorly educated, but are surely used to and prepared for natural disasters of any sort and no stranger to disasters of the private kind. Wyoming's failures leave and rarely return. In this book Buddy Millar does return and sets new standards for failure. Wyoming's escapees who made good only return to manage the spoils of death, such as the descendents of the couple who died aged 102 and 101, to sort out what to do with the land and a house full of hoarded junk. Another story sketches the difficulties of wealthy East Coast retirees to integrate.A running theme in this volume is the Pee Wee bar in Elk Tooth (pop. 80), one of 3 profitable bars there with steady customers from within a radius of 60+ miles. Pee Wee's bartender Amanda and Creel, a regular who combats illegal hunting and fishing, provide material for four other stories.AP never writes stories aiming to score with a final punch line. When it happens, it is a bonus on top of emphatic writing, great dialogue, and foremost, deep research in terms of oral and written history to gain a thorough understanding of the skills needed to survive in Wyoming (and/or Newfoundland, New England, other states and areas she graced with her writing). It is an ode to struggling \\"fly-over America\\", ignorant of the intentions and hostile to any type of government interference in their lives.

Certainly not his best story, as it is too short and the characters are not fully fleshed out, but it started a revolution.\\"Let There be Light\\" deals with two scientists who figure out a way to transform sunlight into electricity at near 100% efficiency and extremely cheaply, but who find they can't sell it due to pressure from the existing power generation companies. The two main characters are near stereotypes, and the attitude of the male towards his female counterpart may strike many as extremely chauvinistic, an attitude that was quite prevalent in Heinlein's writing from this period. But it should be kept in mind that this was the general American attitude towards women at this point in our history. Of more interest is the apparent \`conspiracy' of the power companies to bury this invention. Heinlein's explanation for their actions brings this into focus as a natural reaction of companies attempting to protect their source of income - and in doing so exposes one of the real problems with unfettered capitalism.\\"The Roads Must Roll\\" gives you get a good sense of just why Heinlein came to dominate the science fiction field so rapidly, as the story rings with real world ambience, even though the envisioned technology is one case where Heinlein got it seriously wrong, seeing giant conveyor belts, or rolling roads, as replacing the car and railroads, thus leading to a strong dependence of the economy on them. Those who keep those roads rolling are in an obvious position of power and the story is all about one such case of the \`little guy' attempting to force things to go his way. The story is well told, the characters on both sides of this battle are quite believable, the social organization makes sense. Thematically, the story addresses the sense that many who work in essential industries have that THEY should be the ones who make all the decisions, who cannot see that our civilization is made of many specialties, all of whom are necessary to the continued functioning of the society as a whole. Within the confines of this story there is an encapsulation of many of the larger battles caused by this attitude, from the great owner/union fights of the early portion of twentieth century, to the more generalized battle between the ideas of socialism and capitalism.\\"Blowups Happen\\" deals with the stresses that men come under when trying to monitor and control an atomic power plant, with the knowledge that one small error could make the whole thing blow up and wipe out at least three states, if not the whole planet. Written in 1940, before the exact details of controlled nuclear fission were known, it may seem a little dated today. But as the story is truly about how people react under this kind of extreme pressure, and what, if anything, can be done to help people cope with it, it is still a very relevant story.\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\" is the longest piece here. D. D. Harriman is a man who not only has a dream of traveling to the moon, he has (almost) the financial means to do it. Harriman's schemes to not only raise the necessary money but to ensure that he will retain control of the moon once he gets there are convoluted, devious, devastatingly logical - and almost the complete antithesis of the way NASA has actually gone about it. You might think that this story is hopelessly outdated - after all, we've actually been to the moon! But the story has much to say about the world of today. Government financing of space travel will only go so far. Private financing and people figuring out how to make a profit out of this frontier will be the ultimate driver - and a very large amount of the points this story makes are very applicable to such an approach. But perhaps more important than the actual method Harriman uses to achieve his dream is the very fact that he has such a dream. Heinlein invariably presented the point that without dreamers there would be no progress, no hope for an eventual better world. Perhaps this is a flaw in his writing, but I, for one, would much rather read about heroes, the dreamers, those who are attempting to change things for the better, than yet another story detailing the tribulations of a semi-neurotic Joe everyman.\\"Requiem\\" continues the story of D. D. Harriman, now very old and in frail health, still trying to get to moon, having been prevented by his financial partners from going as too valuable to risk. This story pulls out all the emotional stops, though it is quite understated in terms of direct exposition. I have read it multiple times, and it still causes me to choke up a bit when I reach the end. It's the best story here.There are places where the age of these stories is all too evident, a congenital hazard to writing science fiction, and in places Heinlein's writing technique is not as polished as it could have been, being written very early in his career. But these stories still have power, are still engrossing, still have much to say about people and the world of today.Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"The Man Who Sold the Moon, the first entry in Heinlein's Future History, assembles six of Heinlein's earliest short stories from the late 1930s and 1940s. All but one of these stories deal either directly or indirectly with the moon and the means of getting there. Certainly, most of the scientific ideas Heinlein espouses here are obviously dated and untenable, but that really doesn't matter to me. The excitement over the idea of leaving the confines of earth and traveling to the moon and planets is downright infectious and stimulating. Mankind set foot on the moon a year before I was born, but Heinlein's stories really convey the passion and desire that yesterday's dreamers must have felt about an idea that was patently absurd to many people in 1950. This amazing spirit, willful determination, and lifelong obsession to reach the moon are revealed most powerfully in the person of D.D. Harriman. Harriman is the proverbial man who sold the moon, a man whose presence and influence is felt throughout the entire book. The title story, almost the size of a novella, is an account of Harriman's bold plans and even bolder strategies for getting to the moon. His wheelings and dealings for funds make for an enjoyable read; he has endless ideas for promoting the project and securing funds from any number of sources. Here he is the embodiment of commercialism and steadfastness, but then, in \\"Requiem,\\" we see the human side of his character. This story is a touching tribute of sorts to Harriman-stripped of all business guises, we see Harriman the dreamer, the little boy who looked up at the moon at night and swore that some day he would set foot on its surface. \\"Requiem\\" is a more than appropriate title for this tribute to Harriman and his vision.One thing you are going to need in order to reach the moon is fuel. \\"Let There Be Light\\" describes the development of an unlimited power source. \\"The Roads Must Roll\\" warns of the new kinds of dangers to be expected in a world of rapidly advancing technology; abundant energy does not eliminate the sometimes negative effects of human nature. \\"Blowups Happen\\" is centered around the preeminent nuclear power plant in the world. Any slip up here would lead to incomprehensible disaster, and workers there, especially the engineers who single-handedly keep the atomic reaction red-hot yet under control, are subject to total breakdowns caused by stress. Each worker is supervised by a psychiatrist who has the authority to yank the guy from the job at the slightest hint of a mental hiccough. It is here, though, that the rocket fuel needed for space travel is discovered, tying the story in nicely with the rest of those assembled here. \\"Life-Line\\" is notable for being Heinlein's first published story; published in Astounding in 1939, the author received a rather impressive figure of $70 for it. Its protagonist claims that he can scientifically foretell the time of any person's death, an idea which does not go over well with either academics or insurance agents. The contempt expressed toward professional sciences is rather curious here.With the exception of \\"Life-Line,\\" these stories are all interrelated. D.D. Harriman is one of Heinlein's most memorable characters; I believe there is a lot of Heinlein in Harriman, and that is one reason these stories are as enjoyable now as they must have been upon publication. As I said, the fact that man has already reached the moon by different means than Heinlein suggested here takes nothing away from the joy, wonder, and hopeful optimism that pervade all of these pages. In fact, Heinlein rekindles the love of learning and dreaming that led to the types of scientific advancements we take for granted today and will lead to the astounding advances of tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"The principal story bears the title of this collection of short and not-so-short Heinlein tales, most of them a part of his \\"Future History\\" timeline.Delos Harriman, an aging business mogul with the dream of traveling into space, makes good his childhood hopes by creating the first moon shot through commercial and private ventures rather than with government or military support. His pursuit of this dream against opposition on all sides makes for a wonderful tale of legal chicanery, innovation, and genius. Through commercialization of space, Harriman opens the final frontier to humanity and establishes the basis of many Heinlein stories to come.A later story in the book, \\"Requiem,\\" brings Harriman's tale full-circle as the founder of all space travel finally achieves his personal dream of reaching the moon; legal wrangling and fear of his health had kept him earthbound for decades after the first moon mission.The stories in this book all make up a portion of Heinlein's \\"Future History,\\" but the order they are presented in is not logical. \\"Blowups Happen\\" and \\"The Roads Must Roll\\" should be among the first tales and \\"Requiem\\" one of the last, but as a timeline for the Future History is included, one can see where the tales are supposed to fit in.Some of the technical details are indeed dated as Heinlein penned many of the stories during the Golden Age of science fiction; he decided upon attempting revisions to \\"Blowups Happen\\" that such changes actually detracted from the stories as continually revising them for new developments was counterproductive. Read them for what they are and the ideas they contain, not necessarily for the scientific aspects.Readers wishing to see the Future History unfold in their logical order and entirity should consider the book \\"The Past Through Tomorrow,\\" another Heinlein anthology devoted to the stories of that series--but this book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"You can't stop reading this book once you start. I'm not much of a SF freak, but this book really got me hooked.Heinlein doesn't focus on the inventions and discoveries in the future, he looks into the social impact they have.In &quot;The roads must roll&quot;,Heinlein concentrates on the workers' unions and politics surrounding mechanized roads rather than the technology itself.A must-have for every Heinlein fan.A pity it is out-of-print."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"Robert A. Heinlein was in his thirties when he first took up writing. That relatively advanced age for a beginning science fiction writer may account for the power of his work, its feeling of authenticity. Unlike most of his contemporaries, Heinlein wasn't just interested in science and technology. He also had a knowledge and appreciation of how the worlds of business, law, and politics worked and how they intersected with the world of the lab.The stories in this collection represent the beginnings of Heinlein's Future History series. Events since their publication in the 30s and 40s have dated them, but most still entertain.&quot;Life-Line&quot; and '&quot;Let There Be Light&quot;' have dated the least, and both concern supression of new technologies. The former concerns a scientist who earns the murderous ire of insurance companies because he can predict the date of a person's death. The latter concerns development of a very efficient capture method for solar energy.The extrapolation around the dated, but still enjoyable, &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot; probably seemed quite reasonable at the time of its writing. America's increasing use of cars, resultant urban sprawl and expense, coupled with increased fuel cost and &quot;super-highways&quot;, would lead to giant, high-speed conveyor belts carrying people and products between cities. Some of the engineers who tend the road decide to bring it to a stop unless their demands are met. Their political philosophy of &quot;functionalism&quot; sounds modern and plausible though it's really an old idea found in the Bible and Roman history.&quot;Blowups Happen&quot; is one of those atomic power stories from the forties. Like &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot;, Heinlein is as interested in the men maintaining the machines as the machines themselves. Here the technicians who tend a giant nuclear pile in Arizona frequently crack under the stress of knowing what disaster a mistake could bring.Heinlein the social animal is on full display in &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;. Less concerned with scientific and technical details than with political, legal, and business intrigues, it tells the story of how one Delos Harriman gets man to the moon. He's the first in a new line of robber barons and, perhaps, the founder of a new imperialism that will show up later in the Future History series. Harriman's real goal, though, is denied him. He isn't interested in putting just anyone on the moon. He wants to go there.Heinlein's famous &quot;Requiem&quot; is both prequel and sequel to &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon&quot;. In it, we get the details of Harriman's lunar obsession and the realization of his dream. Unusual for Heinlein, it's a very emotional story full of poignancy Anyone interested in classic science fiction, the beginnings of Heinlein's influential career, or just how the future looked in the forties should enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"This collection of early Heinlein works is worth reading, though the somewhat formulaic stories contrast sharply with Heinlein's later works. It is a great example of early pulp short stories, but the works are largely technology driven and the collection really shows its age.On the upside, this collection's most character driven story is &quot;Requiem&quot;, which chronicles the aging title character's desperate quest to finally fulfill his lifelong dream. This tale seems to foreshadow the style that would eventually land Heinlein amongst the ranks of the great masters of the genre.If you are at all interested in the history of science fiction, or how the genre got to where it is today, read this collection. It is definitely worth it."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"This collection of Future History stories was published originally in 1950. There are six works of short fiction here, which were published between August of 1938 and September of 1940, with the exception of the title story, which was first published in this collection. This book was recognized by fans in the Astounding/Analog All-Time Polls in 1952, 1956, and 1966 where it was ranked 4th, 6th, and 14th respectively. There are some minor differences between this edition and the original edition. The stories in the original edition were in chronological order with respect to Heinlein's Future History, but for some reason they were put in a different order in this edition. The original edition also had an introduction from John W. Campbell, Jr., which is not included here.The stories here are all very good if not great:\\"'Let There Be Light'\\" is about a scientist who creates a cheap and efficient method of converting the Sun's rays into energy. When the establishment tries to take control of his invention, he finds a way to fight back. It was first published in \\"Super Science Stories\\" under the pseudonym Lyle Monroe in May of 1940.In \\"The Roads Must Roll\\", moving roads have been created to efficiently transport people without the need of dangerous automobiles. A conspiracy of unsatisfied workers shut down one of the roads in an attempt to gain power, and lead a social revolution among the road technicians. This was first published in \\"Astounding\\", in June of 1940. It tied for 28th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll of Short Fiction in 1971.\\"The Man Who Sold The Moon\\" is one of Heinlein's D. D. Harriman stories. In this novella, D. D. Harriman is trying to gain ownership of the Moon. He plans and schemes with his business partners in an effort to generate the revenue needed to make travel to the Moon a reality. He wants to make sure the Moon is not controlled by any nation, to fulfill his dream of man moving to the stars, and his boyhood dream of traveling to the Moon. This story tied for 35th on the 1971 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll of Short Fiction. It was 5th on the 1999 Locus All-Time Poll for Novella's, and won the Retro Hugo for Best Novella for the year 1950 that was awarded in 2001.\\"Requiem\\", though written before \\"The Man Who Sold The Moon\\", takes place after it. In this story D. D. Harriman is desperately trying to get to the Moon before he dies. He does not meet the health requirements for space travel, but he does have his money, and a tremendous resolve. This story was first published in \\"Astounding\\" in January of 1940. It tied for 17th on the Locus All-Time Poll for Short Stories in 1999, and won the Prometheus Hall Of Fame award in 2003.\\"Life-Line\\" is the story of a scientist who is scorned by the scientific community for his claims that he can determine when people will die. When his work starts to affect insurance companies, he is sued. For his defense, he forecasts the deaths of the same scientists who rejected him at the start. All that is left is to wait to see if he is correct. This story was first published in \\"Astounding\\" in August of 1939. It tied for 14th on the 1971 Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll for Short Fiction written before 1940.\\"Blowups Happen\\" is a story about the dangers of nuclear power, and the psychological affect it has on those who work in the plant who are depended on to keep it from blowing up and killing millions of people. This story was first published in \\"Astounding\\" in September of 1940."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"Considering this collection was written in the late 30's and early 40's, and was, in fact, the first volume of Heinlein's now-famous Future History, it has actually held up quite well throughout the ensuing years. However, some of the events in the stories have been inevitably dated. It is still well worth reading, though. Heinlein's quick-paced writing style and caustic wit, not to mention lovable characters, always make his stories worth reading, regardless of when they were released. Also, the stories here, for the most part, focus not on the scientific aspects of the technologies in question, but rather the sociological and political sides of them. This is what Heinlein brought to science fiction. He showed us that the key ingredient in good science fiction is story and characters, not the technology being showcased; and by focusing his stories on the characters within and their aspects, his stories are usually just as readable now as the day they were released, even if some of their inherent technology has been dated by subsequent advances in science. Aside from being the first volume in the Future History series, this book is also notable for containing Heinlein's first ever published story, Life-Line. I'm sure you all know the premise-a man invents a machine that shows when people will die-but it is an interesting read if you haven't, and an epoch in the sense of it being the starting point in the career of one of science fiction's greatest writers. Blowups Happen and The Roads Must Roll (does this story remind anyone else of H.G. Well's The Sleeper Awakes?) both focus on technologies that are now fundamentally debunk in the modern day world, but they both focus instead on the people running these technologies (atomic factories and rolling roads respectively), and are an interesting look into sociology and psychology in science fiction. Let There Be Light is a short, decent piece. The Man Who Sold The Moon novella is the title and longest piece in this collection. It is almost totally devoid of actual science, as it has a rather unique, in fact, plotline for science fiction; but has as it's protagonist a seemingly rather crooked, dishonest character who is not particularly of the usually lovable Heinlein kind. It's still an entertaining story, as the writing style is excellent and fast-paced, and the dialogue is exquisite. Requiem features the same main character, and shows a seemingly total different side of him. This story is quite a bit different from most Heinlein, as it is primarily and emotion-based bit, reminding me of something more along the lines of Arthur C. Clarke. Interesting. Although not his best stories, the ones contained in this collection are worth reading, and a must, eventually, for any Heinlein fan."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"The Man Who Sold the Moon (1950) is an SF collection of Future History stories. It contains six stories, published from 1939 to 1949, and a Preface.- Preface (1949) states the follies of predicting the future. The author created the Future History Timeline to track the background of his stories. Some of these prediction came true while he was still writing these stories and others will probably never happen. But the Timeline produced a consistency not found elsewhere in science fiction. Note: This Preface is not found in later editions.- \\"Let There Be Light\\" (Super Science Stories, 1940) concerns two scientists who invent a new power source.- \\"The Roads Must Roll\\" (Astounding, 1940) is about an illegal work stoppage on the mechanical roads.- \\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\" (First publication, 1949) relates the story of D. D Harriman and his efforts to establish a base on the Moon.- \\"Requiem\\" (Astounding, 1940) exposes the fate of D. D Harriman.- \\"Life-Line\\" (Astounding, 1939) tells of the man who could predict the time of death of an individual; this was Heinlein's first sale.- \\"Blowups Happen\\" (Astounding, 1940) depicts the tensions among the workers in an atomic breeder plant.The title story was copyrighted in 1949, but was first published in this collection. Note that the title story is a prequel to \\"Requiem\\". The author added \\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\" as an original story for this collection.Various versions of this collection have been published with different contents. This version contains all the tales associated with this title. But the order varies from other editions.In 1939, Heinlein submitted his first SF work --For Us, the Living-- to various publishers, but it didn't sell. The feedback pointed out that the novel lacked adventure and excitement. So he started writing short stories for the magazines to learn his trade and was a success. But many of the ideas for his stories came from the original novel.This was the first collection of stories in the Future History series by the author. The second collection isThe Green Hills of Earth. Read and enjoy!Highly recommended for Heinlein fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of strange talents, future engineering, and a huckster who led the way to Luna. For those who want more tales by Heinlein, these and many other stories were included inThe Past Through Tomorrow.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon \\" is a collection of six Heinlein \\"Future history\\" stories. I first read these stories in the early 1950's. Talk about putting red meat in front of a carnivore! I loved these stories. While they still are excellent, I know that Heinlein did even better later in his career.\\"Life Line\\" is about a device that can foretell any persons death date. Kafka could not have done better.\\"Let There Be Light\\" describes the development of a unique power source. It appears to be a nuclear power source that is in advance of our current nuclear power sources in 2008. I have read this story many times and the power source appears, to me, to be neither nuclear fission nor nuclear fusion but, rather, a sort of total nuclear destruction with the near 100% release of all the energy in the mass of the nucleus. If this thing ever had come into existence, it would be far more scary than present day nuclear devices.\\"The Roads Must Roll\\" is a story based on solar power and a sliding road technology. The story asks the question, \\"Who will control electrical power and transportation?\\"\\"Blowups Happen\\" deals with job stresses when the stakes are incredibly high. When reading this, please remember that we still do not understand all the possible disaster possibilities of future nuclear fusion plants.\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\" is the longest story. D. D. Harriman wants to travel to the moon. He raises the money to ensure the first trip to the moon and to ensure that he will retain control of the moon. While we have, actually, gotten to the moon, we still do not have commercial travel there. So, will any part of this story come true? Stay tuned. Private financing and people figuring out how to make a profit out of moon travel may yet take this enterprise out of public control.\\"Requiem\\" tells the story of D. D. Harriman, grown old and frail, still trying to get himself to the moon. It is a very human story.Read the book! I still enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"AN INCREDIBLE COLLECTION OF STORIES ESPECIALLY LIFE-LINE, THE MAN WHO SOLD THE MOON, AND REQUIEM. THE REST OF THE STORIES HELP BUILD UPON THE TECHNOLOGY OF RAH FUTURE HISTORY STORYLINE. VERY ENTERTAINING AND IMAGINATIVE. IN THE END YOU WANT TO HAVE THE DRIVE THAT D.D. HARRIMAN HAS FOR THE MOON."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"I love Heinlein. I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction. I find that his plots and ideas are inventive. Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters. However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring. Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters. The &quot;main&quot; characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"The first two short stories seem to have nothing to do with the main story. I couldn't stand Harriman. If an enginneer says it is impossible or the plan needs to be changed, he should agree with them and change it. The story itself is boring because you never learn much about the main characters."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"\\"Let there Be Light\\" This is a story about two scientists who discover a method to use sunlight for energy. (Sound familiar). The scientists run into a snag, however, because the power company doesn't want the world to have cheap, non-polluting power. In this story, Heinlein is, as always, ahead of his time. The story itself has a few loose ends such as, who is really the father of the scientist. The story hints that he may be a politician but never lets us know. Also, and this is a spoiler question, do the two scientists form a romatic relationship? A good, quick read.\\"The Roads Must Roll\\" In this story all transportation is done by moving roads, which sound rather similar to a juiced up, horizontal escalator. The story looks at what happens if a small group of disgruntled employees decide they want to be in charge and take over one of the moving roads. A good look at specialization and unionization.\\"Blowups Happen\\" This is a story about the occupational stress workers experience at a nuclear power plant. This is a great look at occupational hazards and the extremes society will go to ensure they have power when they want it.\\"The Man Who Sold the Moon\\" and \\"Requiem\\" These stories are about D. D. Harriman, a man who dreamed of going to the moon as a boy, and makes sure it happens as an adult. Both are great stories that look at how determination can get you almost anything.\\"Life Line\\" This was my personal favorite story. It is the story about a man who discovers a way to tell exactly when a person will die. This story takes a look at our fear of death and how knowledge is not always a good thing. It also takes a quick jab at insurance companies and their greedy ways.This was a very enjoyable collection from Heinlein, which I have come to expect. He truly is the master."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"Althoug the moon was not first visited as a result of private enterprise, and the bases on the moon did not get built immedeately after the first visit, the story is still fun. Think Mars whereever it says moon, and accept the story for what it is - a story about people with a mission, to which they offer their whole lives, how they make choises that make an impact on their futures, and how easy it is for the idealist with a dream to loose the main target because of the choises made by the &quot;serious investors&quot;. It is (as most of Heinleins books) a tribute to the american way of life, which he always described as the best there is, but even then it is worth reading for those of us &quot;unlucky&quot; enough to live elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"Part of the future history group of books, this is a solid set of stories. I like these books as much because they have an optimistic vision of the future as because they are great stories.

A bit corny really, but all in good fun, and written in a WWII world, you have to take them with a pinch of salt.This being a cog in the wheel of what has come to be called Heinlein's Future History - these are required reading for any old school fan of sci-fi.Just remembering going into these, they are less mind blowing feats of inspiration / imagination - and more well constructed feats of perspiration. Built brick by brick, they are solid, and have held up for generations."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"The Man Who Sold The Moon is my favorite Heinlein's book - it has enough passion and drive to make you want to never stop until you've achieved what you set out to do."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"Another short Heinlein collection, with a longer novella in the middle, the title story.

The basic concept was not so astounding - every work of fiction attempts to be self-consistent - but the sheer scope of Heinlein's vision was captivating in itself, as readers watched human civilization struggle and grow to maturity. Sadly, this first installment of the series is not really the strongest, so it's little wonder if the unconverted find themselves wondering what all the excitement is about. There are a couple of modest shorter works, but the main showpieces of the book are &quot;The Roads Must Roll&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon.&quot; In &quot;Roads&quot; Heinlein presents us with a transportation revolution - state-spanning conveyer belts that move commuters and freight at speeds up to one hundred miles per hour. To maintain this essential service, Heinlein imagines a quasi-military organization of engineers who are trained as cadets to have the same loyalty and self-discipline as graduates of West Point or Annapolis, and this story emphasizes the organization almost as much as the technology. Indeed, the main crisis of the story is as much sociological as technological, so readers can appreciate the story's conclusion without trying to understand the engineering. This story describes social needs, technological solutions, and exciting action each in sufficient amounts to achieve a solid result. Unfortunately, the main story in the collection, &quot;The Man Who Sold the Moon,&quot; is neither as credible nor as entertaining. The protagonist, D. D. Harriman, is a wealthy business tycoon who is obsessed with the idea of going to the moon, a dream for which he winds up risking everything. There's not much science in this long story; it mainly describes the conniving, underhanded shenanigans that Harriman uses to finance his project. Heinlein enjoys telling this kind of story, and it certainly stands out as an unusual plot line for science fiction, but the fact is that watching Harriman cheat his partners, shunt off his wife, manipulate board meetings, finagle commercial endorsements, etc., is a poor substitute for action, adventure, and engaging characters. While this story may in fact describe how things get done in the real world, (I, for one, doubt it), it's about as entertaining as watching C-SPAN. Overall, this book is not Heinlein's best, but serious fans of science fiction may wish to read it as an introduction to the rest of Heinlein's work."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"I consider myself a Heinlein fan, and normally like his books, but this one just wasn't quite as gripping as some of his others. I'm not specifically referring to action, just the ability of his stories to hold on to you. It's still a good read, and I generally agree with the other reviewers when I say that Requiem is my favorite, and the one about the transportation engineers is also very good. There is a good amount of political and social commentary in this book(which, with Heinlein, can vary significantly from book to book), but I've just seen it presented better in some of his other works. Don't get me wrong, I still think this is a good book, just don't let it be your only introduction to Heinlein."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"\\"The Man who Sold the Moon\\" gathers together some of Robert Heinlein's earliest works, including his very first published science fiction story, \\"Lifeline\\". As you might expect, this means that we get material more rough than his great masterpieces. Back in the 1930's, he still hadn't learned to polish his prose and put a real spark into his characters. Nonetheless, the seeds of future greatness were there, and this collection gives us a fascinating look at how on of SF's greats started out.The main story in this volume covers the first moonshot. Given that it was written a full generation before the Apollo program, it was remarkably prescient with regard to many things including the technology. Making it into space and back would require not just the right gadgets but also political support and financial backing. Only a few pages are actually about flying. Most of it is about the industrialist D. D. Harriman, who has to fight to wring money from his fellow multi-millionaires. Characterwise, Harriman is not so convincing. He comes across as an unpleasant monomaniac, as do many of the scientists in this volume. In terms of thought, however, the story shows a great deal of honest analysis.The other stories in this book follow the same pattern. They are readable but don't show much of Heinlein's special zing. Certainly nothing here compares with great tales like \\"Goldfish Bowl\\" inThe Menace From Earth. All of them are well worth reading, however. Besides learning about Heinlein, it's also fascinating to see ourselves in retrospect."},{"Title":"The Man Who Sold the Moon - S1644","review":"The Man Who Sold the Moon is a series of short stories by the great sci-fi master R.A.H. The short stories in this book were written early in Heinlein's career and cover the later half of the 20th century and how he predicted the future based on the occurrences of World War 2. The primary story is based on a character who's goal in life is to first visit the moon (being the first human) and then setting up a colony on the moon. Harriman (the character) uses is past business successes and his business savvy to convince his friends, his company, and complete nations of children to help back his venture, which is of the goal to fulfill a childhood fantasy instead of make money. The rest of the stories tell of the engineers who make that path possible via their inventions and work and it sets up a beautiful backdrop. The painful part of reading this was Heinlein's attention to detail around concerning everything but the inventions and many of his shady business practices and national politics seem to be more far-fetched than the inventions themselves. But in the end, I did enjoy it, but for all I would recommend that one sticks with Stranger in a Strange Land and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress as they are much better stories."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"I really appreciated reading this book, which is the work of a serious religious scholar. I am a very Wicca-friendly, Pagan-wise person (in my opinion), and certainly do not believe the heart or soul of a religion can be judged better by scholars than by practitioners. But I also think critically, love history and respect fact. This book settled a lot of questions that books written by either firm believers or ranting detractors failed to.This is a fair book, well-researched. It lays the groundwork for 3 kinds of &quot;witchery&quot; in human history: &quot;sorcery,&quot; which has belonged to and persists in all cultures, all religions, at all times, in various forms, with various levels of acceptance; &quot;diabolical witchcraft,&quot; which is an &quot;invention of the [European] Middle Ages,&quot; a compendium of folklore + religious bigotry + political expediency + etc....; and &quot;modern witchcraft,&quot; which is a &quot;new religion.&quot; And he, thankfully, makes it clear that Wicca and Paganism are not in any way satanic: &quot;Satanism today is quite different from historical witchcraft, however, and it is totally rejected by all the neopagan witches today. Modern witches observe that since they reject Christianity they can scarecely be supposed to worship a Christian Devil. I describe Satansim here only so that the lack of resemblance between it and witchcraft may be clear.&quot;While Russell's book deals mostly with religious and historical analysis and his critique of the claims of early 20th-century folklorists (such as Margaret Murray, whose &quot;The Witch-cult of Western Europe&quot; and &quot;God of the Witches&quot; have now been -- whether some folks like it or not -- proven largely, though not entirely, ill-grounded in their conclusions), he gives due credit to the living belief systems of modern day Pagans and Wiccans.While he reveals the sometimes sordid esotericism of the Crowley-Gardener heritage of modern Wicca, he does not use old rumors and scandals (even Crowley's well-known dabbling with diabolism) to tarnish contemporary witches or their religion. As he says, &quot;That Gardener (or Crowley) invented the religion does not invalidate it. Every religion has a founder, and much that surrounds the origin of every religion is historically suspect. Lack of historicity does not necessarily deprive a religion of its insight.&quot;As Russell concludes his book, after two chapters that respectfully (sometimes it seemed even 'lovingly') set out the practices of Wicca in 20th-C, &quot;One need not be a witch -- I am not -- to understand witchcraft as a valid expression of the religious experience. The religion of withcraft offers to restore a lost option, paganism, to our religious world view. Both Christianity and scientism have taught us falsely that paganism is nonsense... This is not an informed view... The neopagan witches are attempting to recreate the positive values of pagan religion.&quot;"},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"Jeffery Burton Russell is well known for his works on the history and myth of the Devil. Here Russell provides us with a very well-researched introduction to historical witchcraft that seeks to give an overview of the essential influences and origins of witchcraft and the Christian myths of diabolic magic and demonic pacts that eventually lead to the virulent witch-craze of the Renaissance and early modern period.Russell identifies several essential elements that influenced European thought and lead to the persecution and murder of tens of thousands of suspected \\"witches\\". These are: sorcery, ancient pagan religious beliefs, Christian theology, Inqusitorial and other anti-witch writings. These elements provided the basis for a belief in diabolic witchcraft that, modern historians largely argue, never existed and erupted in the period between 1450-1750 in the largest witch hysteria in history. However, Russell shows that these types of events are not relegated to the past, but can occurr in any society at any time, such as Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia in recent times. Russell analyzes the witch hunts in Europe, England, and the American Colonies and contrasts the various judicial methods and popular beliefs regarding them. For instance, it is interesting to note that unlike on the Continent, England viewed the crime of witchcraft as a civil rather than religious matter. This has alot to do with the connection between witchcraft and chrisitan heresy that was prevalent in Europe in the centuries prior to the beginning of the witch hunts but that was largely absent from English history. Russell continues with an analyses of the decline of the witch-craze and the rise of general skepticism and disbelief in witchery. He shows that by the late 18th century, the accusation and execution of suspected witches had all but ceased. It was only in the late 19th century that a revived nterest in magic and the occult gave rise to a romanticized interst in witchcraft. Russell concludes with an overview of the history of modern-day witchcraft and neo-paganism and the lingering perceptions that the public maintains about it.This is an excellent introduction to the academic history of witchcraft and should lead interested readers to a more in-depth study regarding one of the most horrific periods in human history."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"While there are many books to choose from on this subject, Jeffery Russell manages to both educate and entertain. Taken from a stricty historical viewpoint, this book is both concise and poignant at times. The text reads more like a personal account from a not so casual observer while still managing to sprinkle in all the dry and sometimes lurid details. Having read many of the historical accounts as well as those with a position to defend or deny, I feel this book is the best I have read on the subject. While not a long book, quantatively there is more great information page for page than in any other single book I've read on witchcraft. This is not the be all end all book that &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; tries to be for the believer. Instead it gives an excellent, engaging, account following a timeline which allows the reader to take into account the atmosphere of the time rather than remove the subject and give a disconnected sanitary synopsis of a fear that grew over time."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"I was highly impressed with this book. The author deals not only with the history of Witchcraft, but sheds light on how many of the common ideas and misconceptions concerning Witchcraft came into being. What he gives is a fairly broad overview of European and American Witchcraft's overall developement and proper place in history. He leads up to, and deals briefly with modern Pagan Witchcraft, but focuses primarily on earlier developement prior to the 20th century. Read this for the broad view, and Ronald Hutton's _Triumph of the Moon_ for a more narrowly focused view, and you'll have pretty well all the common misconceptions and misinformation still prevailant within the Witchcraft community today cleared away. Money well spent."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"My first thought on receiving this book was, \\"Wow, what a small book!\\"My second thought was, \\"Half of this book is pictures!\\"My third thought was, \\"How could a book with only 100 pages of text possibly cover the history of witchcraft?\\"As I started reading though, my fears got knocked out, one by one.A quick glance at the Contents pages shows how thorough this book is:1 Sorcery2 The Roots of European Witchcraft3 Witchcraft, Heresy and Inquisition4 The Witch-Craze on the Continent of Europe5 Witchcraft in Britain and America6 Witchcraft and Society7 The Decline of Witchcraft8 Survivals and Revivals9 Neopagan Witchcraft: The Sources10 Neopagan Witchcraft: The Movement11 The Role of WitchcraftPretty self-explanatory, but I was glad to find that this book also mentions sorcery/witchcraft in not just Europe, but countries like Africa, as well.On the coverage of American witchcraft, I was pleased to see that there was a quick but sufficient history on the Salem witch trials and not a repetitive drawn-out version.What I liked most about this book was how it came across as very unbiased --the authors frequently call out authors by name and criticize their \\"unscholarly\\" research.They also viewed witchcraft from different perspectives, to include economic, such as on page 111, where it says:\\"Nor did declining economic conditions necessarily correlate with witchcraft. Macfarlane observed that in Essex prosecutions were at their height in the 1580s and 1590s, a period of relative prosperity.\\"The only bad thing I can say about this book is a small one: Because the pages are so glossy they are often prone to a glare that makes reading indoors a matter of finding the right spot/sitting position.One other small thing I just noticed: The Amazon picture for this book shows the title as \\"A NEW history of witchcraft\\", however, when I received my book the title is merely \\"A history of witchcraft: Second Edition\\". I assume both are the same book, just different covers.A very fascinating book (this coming from a person who does not normally read non-fiction). If only textbooks could be this interesting . . ."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"This is an excellent book for anyone wanting more information on the emergence of Wicca - where did it come from and is it really an ancient religion? Instead of postulating based on romanticism, Russell provides a scholarly, historical view of how the religion came about. The historical details of the witch burnings and how they culturally came about was very intriguing. I would recommend this book to any skeptical modern Wiccan who really wants to know their roots and not nice-sounding propaganda."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"Magick and sorcery have been with mankind since the beginning. Witchcraft being the most popular branch of of has perked the curiousity of many people. This book give a real accurate accounting of it's developement spanning from man's humble beginnings up until the present. This book lays it out in a simple to understand format with the main ideas of the author expressed and then supported by trackable facts. There are a few details that are left out that those who are familiar with the modern craft would know should defintley be included. There are three phases to witchcraft. I shall call them sorcerous, diabolical and neo-pagan.Early sorcerey recognized that there were hidden connections between various objects like words, herbs, stones and other things. The sorcerer knew how to exploit these and get results. Often times sorcerers were accused of blighting crops, sickening cattle and occasionally striking people with magic. If one was convicted of sorcery one could get lashes of a fine. Sorcery and witchcraft seem to have the same associations world over regardless of origins. Witches were knows to fly at night, haunt little babies and suck the blood of their victims. this holds true whether in Europe, Africa or South America. One African tribe has it that there are people who practice good magic, bad magic and then there are witches who seem to have the power within. The core magick practices come from the Graeco-Roman era. This is the basis for many practices associated with witches. Sorcery used folk magic, pagan religion and other local things. The Roman goddess Diana was the goddess of witchcraft. Artemis was a virgin huntress of the moon who Diana was patterned after. Later she got conflated with Holda or Perchta who were Norse fertility deities. This added a lust.fertility aspect to Diana. Diana's darker aspect was Hekate a three faced goddess of the underworld. The early pagans brooked no issue with having female deities or deities that could be both good and bad. Christianity did.Christianity did not over take Europe so quickly. Paganism survived until 1100 in many places. Still Christianity was brital in the way it snuffed out opposition. It is argued that Paganism did not survive but rather there were customs and practices that survived from PAganism into Christianity. Many of these like Saint Hallows Eve, Christmas (Yule and Saturnalia), Walpugis night and others did not die away but survived in Christian form. It was during the Rennaissacne time that sorcery and witch craft got linked up with Satanism. Hersy was considered Satanic, practicing magic was considered Satanic. Witches and hereetics were accused of noght time revels cavorting with the devil and all sort of inaapropriate things. Witches were considered demon worhsipper. For this they were burned at the stake and murdered. There was no benefit of fair trials and the means of execution were horrid.Often times those accused were not actual witches but rather they were defenseless old ladies who served convenient scapegoat. This was know as the burning times.During the 18th-19th century author's like Michelet proposed the theory that witches were good. They were remanants of an ancient Pagan religion that had a god and goddess. In a sense a fertility cult that withsttod the tyranical onlsaught of Christianity. Frazier would pick with the idea of the sarificial king in his Gold Bough. Charles leland wrote about about Italain Withccraft and the continued worship of Diana. Margaret Murry wrote on the Witchcult of Europe. All these were later discredited by the academic community yet these works also helped birth neopagan withccraft.Most people think that gerald Gardner made up Wicca. So do I. yetr is still valid as a religious system because it answeers a need. All religions were made up at one point hence they aare all false and man made. The last part of teh book covers the bracnches of wicca and the people who made changes. It leaves out some keyplayers in the witchcraft world. Robert Cohrane for one who was one of Gardners opponents. He was a practitioner of \\"The Clan of Tubal caine\\" Victor and Cora Andersen who practiced the Feri tradition of Witchcraft were only made small mention of . These two branches though not Wicca are definitre branches of withcraft that should have been discussed. they have a goddess and god tradition as well and they do come beffore Wicca. Also there was no mention of Lamas Night whne witches used magic to repel Hitler's forces. Gardner and Crowley were supposedly part of this. Why no mention of such an important event?"},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"This chronologically covers the evolution of what societies perceive as witchcraft. People may deny it, but it's widespread, often with similar images and practices assumed in very diverse instances. Witches exist nearly everywhere if in equally varied forms, despite religious and political efforts to eradicate sorcery.As with any Thames & Hudson publication, this 2007 work combines an intelligent, accessible, but scholarly introduction with lots of photos and drawings. The last two chapters added to the revision of the 1980 original version feature Brooks Alexander's neopagan coverage. What he and Russell emphasize, as the subtitle \\"sorcerers, heretics, and pagans\\" hints, is a triple definition of a \\"witch\\". (I did wonder as an aside why neither Russell's 1972 medieval witchcraft study or this book explored the common association of the term \\"witch\\" coming from the Old English for \\"bending or shaping.\\") Anthropologists place witchcraft within sorcery as \\"low magic\\" that influences natural phenomena to effect practical results desired. Historically, in Europe especially, devil worship has been supposed to be the domain of a witch. This happened far more often, in terms of persecution and murdering those so supposed to be witches, in the Renaissance and Reformation than in the Middle Ages. Whether or not this alleged diabolical contact was practiced, its functions were assumed by church and state to be \\"proven,\\" and then nearly impossible to disprove. Russell presents many examples of 60,000 marginalized victims hanged or burned for heresy.\\"The process is simple. A number of children die. The midwife is a lonely and unpopular widow. Blame for the deaths is fixed on her and expressed in supernatural terms. She must therefore be a witch. But it is well known that all witches fly out at night, make pacts with the Devil, and practise other forms of demonolatry. Questions about all this are put to her under torture, and in her agony and fear she confesses. The confession again reinforces the accepted image of the witch. Misfortunes are interpreted as evil deeds, evil deeds are seen as sorcery, sorcery is perceived as witchcraft, and another human being is tortured and killed.\\" (84)Russell tends to compress \\"the intellectual erosion of witchcraft\\" in the 17th and 18th centuries but he does explain how people stopped believing in it once rational causes for the death of a cow of the illness of a child started to gain traction and helped undermine folk beliefs that blamed demons or spells for misfortune. For modern times, the resurgence of witchcraft, both authors remind the credulous, cannot be traced to a purported underground Old Religion. Jules Michelet, with his psuedo-Marxian concept of a deep-rooted agrarian resistance to Church and State, or Margaret Murray, with her deluded insistence that a Dianic cult survived from a \\"pre-Christian fertility religion that had once pervaded Europe,\\" both are shown carefully to have based their once-influential theories on poor research and wishful thinking. Pagan practices may have survived into today's West, but not the world-view of ancient or folk paganism. That perspective, however, has been reconstructed and revamped, as Alexander reveals.Contemporary neopaganism asserts its difference against Christian-based domination. It also defies a Western, secular, and rational mindset. Its identity's based in a \\"contagious excitement of cultural insurrection\\" as its \\"functional substitute for missionary zeal.\\" (163) Animism-polytheism-pantheism; feminism; denial of sin; \\"spiritual reciprocity\\": Margot Adler's terms sum up its \\"religious attitude.\\"For Alexander, witch hunts show a flaw in human nature: we project our fears of evil on others, we push them away from us, and we \\"punish them horribly.\\" (193) It is no etymological accident that a witches' \\"sabbat\\" connects with the despised \\"synagogue\\" supposed to be an assembly of idolators. The fact many of those hunted were women today may account for the determination to reclaim, for many women and gays shunted aside from conventional religions and communities, to find in witchcraft a place to assert their subversive pride. The growth of both counterculturally based and pop-culture teen witches-- the latter fueled by a conjunction of the Net with Hollywood-- proves a challenge. In Berkeley, typically or atypically, Alexander notes how a witch brought together the traditional and \\"alternative\\" believers in an interfaith council as their bridge. How will witches manage to stand in opposition to the norm once they are accepted by ecumenical groups and invited into mainstream society as just another faith?He closes by urging Neopaganism to be \\"tempered by critical thought.\\" He finds its role one of elevating syncretic, intuitive approaches to wisdom alongside scientific, atheist, and academically arrogant forms of \\"physicist\\" thought. Its synthesis of a more nature-caring, feminist and queer-positive, and humbly reverential, non-punishing outlook he proposes for our millennial age as particularly encouraging. Russell and Alexander in this brief, well-written, and thoughtful survey of a controversial, often sensationalized, and generally misunderstood subject serve readers well in presenting an open-minded approach to the dangers of past discrimination and the present possibilities for future openness to one of the most ancient, yet one of the newest as reinvented, of all belief systems."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"This unassuming book is actually one of the best studies on the subject. It follows witchcraft from tribal societies up to the present day. It doesn't dwell on the witch trials, but of course they are dealt with in depth. The book is filled with pictures and illustrations that really liven the text. I especially liked the assortment of paintings from Goya's Black Period; they bring a macabre element that is hard to describe.It concludes with a few chapters analyzing the modern comeback in the form of Neopaganism. I found it quite interesting to learn that Wiccans were one of the first communities to take advantage of the internet as a tool to organize and reach isolated practitioners across the globe.Overall, it is a very scholarly work with plenty of notes and comprehensive bibliography. The author presents the facts and evidence without pushing an agenda."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"Those who seek knowledge of history on this topic will not be disappointed. This book is by no means light reading. Every page is packed with historic information that was obviously thoroughly researched. The book begins as far back as written history can reach and reaches as far forward as present day. There is a somewhat heavier emphasis on the witch-craze that began in continental Europe and ended in the N.A. colonies, but the periods before and after the witch-craze are thorough.I was impressed with the balance of lack-of-bias and entertainment the author delivered. They did a rather good job at presenting a lot of information and very little opinion, yet the writing style flowed well and did not have a dull 'textbook' feel, so to speak. Furthermore the history presented is more than historical facts, dates and pronouns. The book is littered with summaries of stories, some of which are rather interesting for better or worse, and also strewn throughout are black-and-white images and photos.There were some surprises for me throughout the book, as well. There are certain aspects of modern witchcraft that have been a little distorted, especially in common presentation of Wicca, and the author set about to present the facts available, while rarely making broad claims. It is clear that the author had no intention of trying to 'disenchant' the religion, as they also include a lot of interesting and almost endearing facts about the development of Wicca that are not commonly mentioned. Ultimately the reader is left to take the available information and draw their own conclusions. I would highly recommend this book not only to those with an interest in history, but also to those with an interest in neopaganism, Wicca or simply the practice of witchcraft in whatever form or path they choose. The history may have been twisted a little here and there, but it is still quite charming and valid in the movement's desires."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"I did have some background growing up in the arts and philosophies of witchcraft, and this certainly filled in the cracks.

I was a little skeptical at first due to the amount of pictures, but wow is it full of great nuggets of information. The author does a terrific job in drawing a picture of the witch-craze and the elements that caused it to happen. The only gripe I can raise is that there is some bias by the author. He readily relates his view on the subject of Wicca, but dismisses other forms of Witchcraft, such as Luciferan. If the author hadn't been so dismissive of non-Wiccan, modern Witchcraft it would have had five stars."},{"Title":"A History of Witchcraft - Sorcerers, Heretics, and Pagans (With 94 Illustrations)","review":"I am now in the process of returning this book...as to whether I receive a refund is of no consequence..it is totally useless to me if I cannot read it.

Henri V or the comte de chambord's story is one that is lost in history, which is shame because it is riviting. The intrigue is so interesting, was he married off to a woman that they knew could not bear children, so as to assure the Orleans branch supremacy, was his death by natural causes?.. his death, of course, ended the line, he produced no heir. He was called the pretender to the throne by French Republicans, but to the Royalists he was Henri V, and should have been sitting on the throne at Versailles. The Comte de Chambord, Chambord being the huge castle in the Loire Valley he owned by right of his pure Bourbon blood, was truly the grandson of Charles X, the last Bourbon king, he was stubborn and arrogant like his grandfather, it was absolute monarchy or nothing, and when the opportunity arose to take the throne after the fall of Napoleon III, he squandered it by stating that he would except nothing but absolute power, like his grandfather and all the subsequent Bourbon kings before him, he felt to accept less would be to sully the Bourbon dynasty. I suppose in a way he was true to his ideals and France did become a true republic because of his refusal of the throne, but could you imagine what an interesting royal family the French would have today if they still had a monarchy, it would make the Windors and the Spanish Bourbons look like the rabile. I highly recommend this book on a forgetten figure, really a fascinating subject, well written and researched indeed."},{"Title":"Simon Says ... Marry Me!

Our professor stated his textbook principle quite clearly: &quot;I only use primary sources, texts written by those that were there. I just don't believe in prefabricated history textbooks.&quot;I didn't read this book during that course, but when I ran across it in a used bookstore, I bought it for the same reason my professor chose his sources: all the essays are written by people close to the subject. In this collection, you can read about Jack Dempsey from his most famous opponent, Gene Tunney. Or who better to tell you about Huey P. Long, America's demagogue and fascist, than one of Louisiana's only newspaper editors who had the fortitude to stand up to him. All of the book's authors have such a close relationship to their subject matter, which makes this collection more reliable than others, and much more readable."},{"Title":"The Aspirin Age 1919-1941","review":"This book is just terrific. If you are interested in reading about the 20s and 30s, then you will certainly enjoy it. If you've never been interested in this period, then after reading this book, you might be! Articles range from what you might expect (albeit with a twist), like &quot;Calvin Coolidge: A Study in Inertia&quot; or &quot;The Timely Death of President Harding.&quot; Others deal with subjects that made the news at the time, but are perhaps less well remembered today, such as the feats of Izzie and Moe (the Prohibition police), the Dionne quintuplets, and the wreck of the &quot;Morro Castle.&quot; Some other topics included: Huey Long, Sacco and Vanzetti, the Crash, the first 100 days of the New Deal, Pearl Harbor Sunday, Wendell Wilkie, Versailles, Aimee Semple McPherson, the Lindberghs, the death of Starr Faithful, the night the Martians landed, the King and the girl from Baltimore. And there's still more...This book is also ideal to introduce the period to either high school of college students, or to use as background material. The teacher could either assign the book in its entirety or simply choose a few articles. It will make history come alive for kids."},{"Title":"The Aspirin Age 1919-1941","review":"&quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; is a delightful walk through twenty-two tumultuous years in American history. This very &quot;readable&quot; book contains a series of essays on a diverse array of topics during the period from 1919 through 1941. The book's chapters are all essays written by the nation's best practicing historians. Isabel Leighton's fine editing provides the continuity for these historical vignettes which enhances the quality of an already excellent work.The topic selected for each year is not necessarily the most burning issue of that year. However, each year's topic captures a unique facet of the American psyche that invariably adds to the reader's understanding of other, perhaps more &quot;important&quot;, issues of that era. For that reason it is a very useful addition to any student reading list in American history courses covering the Twenty-Two years dubbed &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; by editor, Isabel Leighton. Indeed, most people encounter this delightful work as required reading in such courses. I first encountered &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; while an undergraduate at Southwest Texas University. It was on the required reading list for a course I was taking there on the depression era. There were a number of other books that were required reading for that course. In addition to these works, the professor required us to read one or two chapters per week of &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; to supplement our other reading.Although the professor certainly intended our class to read the book more or less &quot;piecemeal&quot; so that we would be able to understand the social and political context of the course materials, it did not work out that way in my case. As usual I failed to follow the professor's instructions relevant to to my reading assignment for the course. I started reading the book in compliance with my reading assignment but soon found that I could not put the book down. Consequently, I finished it a day or two after starting my first assigned readings. &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; was an unexpected pleasure.If I learned nothing else as a history major, I learned that not all historical writing is created equal and that scholarly treatment of a topic does not necessarily equate to entertaining reading. I was very impressed that this book that I &quot;had to read&quot; turned out to be such an enjoyable reading experience.I kept my copy of &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; even after I completed the course. After I graduated from Southwest Texas I began teaching history and graduation and was happy to use &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; with my own students. They enjoyed the book as much as I did as a student. The book quickly engages the student's interest. The interest level is such that the students finish the book before they have time to think about the fact that they are reading a scholarly work. It's fun to watch them devour the book. I heartily recommend the book to anyone who enjoys reading crisp,well crafted history. Most people encounter &quot;The Aspirin Age&quot; like I did; as required reading in one history class or another. The book is a joy to read and a wonderful teaching resource. It is kind of a shame that &quot;The Aspirin Age's&quot; academic pedigree is so impeccable. If a non academic friend gave you a copy of it for your birthday, after reading it you'd probably appreciate that friend a little more."},{"Title":"The Aspirin Age 1919-1941","review":"The impact the aticles in this book have had are really quite remarkable. Included here are the articles that cemented the legend of the first 100 days of the FDR administration, the piece that set the belief that Sacco and Vanzetti were innocent dupes, and that Coolidge and Harding were total incompetents.Other reviews implied the articles here were written in the years they appear under but that's not correct. They cover events that somewhat center on the year they are dedicated to but include fore and after story and opinion. Really they represent prevailing thought of immediate post war years, the collection was originally published 1949.If you want to understand what people assume they know about the period you need to read this.

The first fifty or so pages felt interminable, but once past that point the book becomes a veritable page turner.Eliot crafts a fascinating, first-rate historical fiction plot based in Florence, Italy, from the death of Lorenzo de' Medici (in 1492), through the time of Savonarola's influence, and culminating in an epilogue placed in 1509. In the midst of this tumultuous social situation is placed our heroine, Romola. The daughter of a scholar, Romola herself is very well educated for a woman of her time. This novel follows Romola through six complex post-de'Medici years of Florentine politics, further inflamed by the preachings of Savonarola, a Dominican friar. As the plot swells in complexity, the gentle woman transitions from being her father's daughter, to her husband's wife, to a woman meeting life head on with a dignity of her own merit. Possessed of a fast moving, labyrinthine plot, this novel, despite its length of just over 600 pages, keeps up a taut pace until the very end.As might be expected in a novel named after a character, this one, despite the enticing plot, is very rooted in its performers. Romola is a central figure, but by no means the only one. Eliot pulls some of her players direct from the history books and some from her imagination, but each and every one of them feels so genuine that it is difficult to know which really lived and breathed and which only ever lived within her pages. This is the type of book that has you googling purely imaginative personages-because they are portrayed with such authenticity.Florence of the late fifteenth century is very well depicted: the pageantry of her holidays (including a fantastic description of Savonarola's Bonfire of the Vanities); the dress, habits, and occupations of her various classes; and the architectural details of her stone edifices. As you wander the streets with the novel's inhabitants you are drawn into her neighborhoods, with their chaos, aromas, and idiosyncrasies.So why a relatively low three star rating? Because the prose is so dense that it left me wallowing somewhere between philosophy text and nineteenth century history tome. For some reason, I had to work exceptionally hard to remain focused on reading the words themselves and concentrate with that little bit of extra grey matter to wrap my mind around what exactly was being expressed. Was it worth it? Well, yes, as my clear admiration for the book's merits shows; however, I can not say that I \\"really liked\\" (four stars) or \\"loved\\" (five stars) a book which required so much effort. So, three stars, a simple \\"liked\\" verdict, it is for this work. This is definitely not a book for someone unused to literature of the Victorian era, as, in my opinion, this novel is some of the least accessible writing from that time frame."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in.

It is George Eliot's foray into the realm of historical fiction made popular by the earlier novels of Sir Walter Scott. Eliot is a great English novelists known for such classics as Adam Bede; The Mill on the Floss; Felix Holt; Middlemarch (her masterpiece), Scenes of Clerical Life and Daniel Deronda. Romala is the only novel she wrote not set in the British Isles. It is her least popular and known work though she considered it her favorite. The book is lengthy and intricate in its recounting of the life of the title heroine Romola in fifteenth century Florence. The major players are:Romola Bardi: She is the idealistic daughter of a blind scholar Bardo de Bardi. She falls in love with the young and amoral Tito Melema a Greek who has arrived in Florence. Tito is the assistant to Bardo in the latter's classical studies. Tito sells the precious classical library of Bardo. Tito's selfish character is revealed to Romola who leaves Florence for a short time in utter despair. Savanarola persuades her to return to the city.Tito also betrays Bernado del Nero one of five men executed by the government. Bernado is the godfather of Romola and dies before her eyes in a gruesome beheading. Romola learns that Tito was instrumental in the arrest and death of del Nero. Romola becomes a supporter of Savanrola as she ministers to the poor. She also learns of his adultery.Tito Melema: Handsome husband of Romola who has a second family with the poor girl Tess. (she has two children by Tito). Tito is a schemer and adulterer who is ambitious for fame and fortune. He has stolen money and abandoned to slavery his stepfather Baldassarri. Baldassarri tracks down Tito with murder in his heart. Baldassari reveals the deep and sinful past of Tito to Romola.I do not agree that the characters in this novel are flat. Villains like Tito and Baldassarri are well drawn as is Romala. Eliot was the first great psychological novelist in English influencing such writers as Henry James.Savanorola is the real life religious reformer who seeks to clean up decadent Florence. He is famous for the bonfire of vanities in which Florentines threw away many luxury items in an effort to become more faithful to God. The reformer was burned at the stake in 1498.The City of Florence is a character during these turbulent times. Pietro de Medic the ruler of Florence has died and the French army under Charles VIII has become an occupying power. The League of Venice declares war on the French and Florentines. Hunger and plague run rampant through the streets of Florence on the Arno River. The political machinations are hard to follow. Machiavelli the real life author of \\"The Prince\\": appears in the book.The novel concludes with the death of Savanarola and Tito. Romola has taken Tessa and her two children under her wing. Romola, like George Eliot, is a kind woman who learns the secret to life is helping others as a good samaritan. She has emerged from her personal tragedies to become a wonderful woman. The Penguin edition contains a definition of many Italian words and phrases used in Romola, textual emendations made to the manuscript and an incisive and helpful introduction. Penguins are the best paperbacks for classics!George Eliot and her lover George Henry Lewes did a great deal of on site research in Florence; read deeply in the politics of the Renaissance era and put that knowledge to work in Romola. The book is a classic which tells a fascinating story. Like all of George Eliot's works it is a gem in the literary crown of the author. Romola is hard reading but the story is compellinig and it is worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"Romola is constantly called Eliot's weakest novel, with even serious critics reluctant to praise it. However, it was seen in the 19th century as Eliot's masterpiece. Some of the blame for the novel going out of fashion must rest with F.R. Leavis who said that &quot;few will want to read Romola a second time, and few can ever have got through it once without some groans.&quot; If Leavis, viewed as one of the great literary minds, thinks this, then more average readers like us are bound to be put off.True, the start of Romola is bogged down in detail, but it is introduced by a wonderful, stirring and majestic 'Proem' which sees the Angel of the Dawn sweeping across the Earth and loftily states how humanity is the same now as it was when Romola is set. After this, the notes are best ignored - consult them separately, and concentrate on getting into the book. It is a stirring and sometimes hard read, and moves one with awe at what Eliot has created - you really feel you are experiencing Florence in the 15th century. There is one scene that stands out for me - the haunting and almost surreal episode where Romola drifts by boat to an apparent coastal haven. Images of peace and life are reversed disturbingly.So ignore Leavis and the dissenters. If you've read another Eliot, you'll like it. If you haven't, maybe start with something else, but come back, for it's a rewarding read"},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"George Eliot spent two years preparing &quot;Romola&quot;, and the result is a rich, densely detailed &quot;Tale of the Renaissance&quot;. Never a facile writer, here she is concerned with one of the most intellectually challenging (not to mention politically complicated) periods in history; and she paints the panoply and power struggles as a background for the personal tragedy which is the novel's crux. While not an &quot;easy read&quot; in the Sir Walter Scott sense, &quot;Romola&quot; presents in sumptous detail the banquets, the festivities, and the famous bonfire of vanities that one associates with late 15th Century Florence.But from a purely literary viewpoint, the most important thing about the book is its delineation of Tito Melema, the young man who in the opening chapters is the story's hero, but slowly, irrevocably becomes its villain. Neither Sir Walter nor Charles Dickens has psychological insight (in the modern sense) as sharp as George Eliot's, and this study of a fictional character's downfall is one of the most stunning depictions of corruption in English literature. That he is the husband of the heroine, a sensitive, finely sensual woman, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. Scenes involving historical characters (including Savonarola and Machiavelli) tend to be a little stiff in costume movie style. Oh, and because the story takes place in the 1490's, one must imagine the Piazza della Signoria without Michelangelo and Cellini. This must really have frustrated a connoisseur like George Eliot."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"Given the majority of Eliot readers begin with Middlemarch, I found myself in the unique position of not only beginning with Romola, but also on a subject that I find most interesting. That of Renaissance Italy. Beginning at the death of the great Lorenzo di Medici in '92 I read this great novel twice. Once quickly as any other Twenty-First century paperback; the second, slowly, with more respect for the intellectual scope within the pages.After the first attempt I was mildly disappointed. I came away with no true sense of the whole that is fifteenth century Florence and a bewilderment at the inconsistent central characterisation of Tito Melema and his golden-haired wife, Romola. The supporting actors were brilliant, from Fra Girolama's fantatical Catholicism to Bratti's salesmanship. But I was left disappointed, believing in the superficality of Tito, the maddening naivety of Tessa, and the almost puritanical martyrdom of Romola.So I re-read it. Slowly.It is now extremely clear why this great work of english literature is, as Eliot herself puts it, a \\"book of mine which I more thoroughly feel that I swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood\\".Each scene is mesmerically depicted, the infintesimal attention to details and Eliot's total control of her subject matter shines through.Renaissance Florence wasn't so well depicted by its contemporaries.From Tito's waking at the Loggia de' Cerchi to his final fall at the Ponte Vecchio his character moves through a full range as you would expect from a man in his early twenties. His child-like mesmerism coupled with his Greek tutorage gives rise to a cherubic man whom Florence loves. His fatal flaw is his desire for love and a single terrible lie he gives that, like Murphy's Law, evolves into a a stigma that alters his very persona. What is all the more damaging is that you truly believe he is unaware of the pain he causes. He is truly egocentric, in an almost blameless way. For Romola, you cold argue the opposite. Indeed she is potentially more culpable. Her fierce intellectualism is offset by a descent into a world of religious supersition, a world where religion is used as a political tool. Throughout she has the knowledge of where her actions will take her and a terrible sense of duty and restrains her. From the beginning, with the story we hear so often of Tito's escape from drowning, to his final near drowning at the hands of the mob, to his strangulation by his father there is a certain bitter justice until all that he leaves is his proud and world-scarred wife Romola and the innocence that he preserved with Tessa. Tito's move from innocent 'hero' to startled villain is an excerise in human failings. Yet it is not a sufficient single human tragedy, as Eliot says, \\"Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the preparation of a deeper tragedy\\".In many respects \`Romola' is Eliot's King Lear. The parallels are many, including Baldessare's depiction. There is no Edgar, nor Edmund but the Fool is here in many guises. In taking one of Shakespeare's finest themes, Eliot has given true life to fifteenth century Florence and it is, perhaps, best encapsulated by Romola's final statement to Tessa's son, Lillo:\\"There was a man to whom I was very near... who made almost everyone fond of him, for he ws young, and clever, and beautiful...I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds - such as make men infamous.\\"So, Eliot's \`Romola'. Read it, delight in it because it truly is, as the author can rightly claim, one of the finest works in english literature."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"Yes, it bristles with Glossaries and Appendices and Notes like so much barbed wire. (And if you actually read the Penguin editor's introduction, it's a sure thing you'll never read the novel: she makes it sound like about as much fun as chewing rocks.) But don't let all that deter you. You may have some rough going at the beginning, mostly because Latin and Greek scholarship is so important to the plot. Use the notes and they'll enhance your enjoyment of the story, but ignore them and you're still in for a thrilling tale gorgeously told. Tito Melema is one of the great characters in fiction, and he's someone we all know: a thoroughly despicable human being who has no idea he's anything but a nice guy. Eliot has wrought a dreamy and hair-raising hybrid of fiction and history, infused with her own astonishing insight and complicated sympathy and delivered in her matchless prose. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"Romola was a difficult book to read. If I did not happen to be on a business trip that left me long hours on seemingly endless international flights, I doubt if I would have had the perseverance to stick with it. In writing this book, Eliot spent six months in exhaustive research on fifteenth century Florence, and she is going to give it all to you whether you like it or not. This made it difficult to enjoy because I was constantly going to the back of the book get the translation of Italian and Latin phrases, reference to obscure historical characters, and other minutia which would only be clear to someone with a doctorate in Italian history. I was frustrated by this throughout the book. Having said that, the book is worth the wade! As always Eliot's writing is a pure joy to read. Some of her description is so beautiful that I have to step back in wonder that someone can create narrative so rich and inviting. Her characters are complex, intriguing and well developed. First, Tito was the most original antihero I have run across in years: a man who avoids unpleasantness and discomfort to the point that he betrays anyone he has ever loved while intending only to take the easy way in all his dealings. Romola is a women deeply learned, but raised only by her aging father and the classics, is unprepared for what the fates have brought her: love, duplicity, and purpose. And lastly, Savonarola, Tito's opposite: a religious visionary who strives to lead Florence to a new order, and is willing to give up church, state---anything but his place in the order, to see his prophecy fulfilled. This is Eliot's favorite book. I can see why."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"Funny how Eliot's least-loved novel today was the author's personal favorite and her best seller during her lifetime. How did it slide into relative obscurity? Partly because Eliot's acknowleged forte is her depiction of rural life in Victorian England, whereas this novel is set in a large Italian city (Florence) during the Renasaissance. Also, the novel does bog down a bit in its own scholarliness, as nearly every reviewer has mentioned. Still, the innumerable references to prominent Florentines can be glossed over without losing much. As for the urban setting, Eliot's Florence is every bit as vivid as Dickens' London, or Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg. And, of course, every page is filled with Eliot's trademark wisdom.For anyone who cares about great books, all seven of Eliot's novels are absolutely mandatory. So, by all means start with \\"Adam Bede\\" or \\"Middlemarch\\", but don't neglect \\"Romola.\\"A word about the Konneman edition: I love the compact format (It fits easily into a briefcase or purse), the lovely cover art and the high-quality cloth binding. Be advised, however, that it is loaded with typos, some of them hilarious. It's still a good buy, however."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"I loved this book! Set in fifteenth century Florence, Romola explores the deep recesses of the soul. Renaissance Italy with its political/religious conflicts, intellectual, pursuits, artistry and pageantry are all beautifully protrayed throughout Eliot's magnificent love story. Deceit, greed and selfishness are artfully displayed against the purity of a nobel soul which knows no compromise. Romola, the book's main character is a study in virtue, while Tito her husband has but the veneer of goodness. Tito falls forever because of one lie. This is a book to read slowly and savor."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"A book with unforgettable characters - in Tito who demonstrates the degeneration of the soul in the pursuit of money and an ideal character in Romola who personifies duty. This book characterizes George Eliot's concept of truth. Truth according to her is not only what is real, but also, what should be. Another character who fascinates is Savonarola - we see him as a human being, with strengths and weaknesses. And Eliot teaches us to be like Romola - to appreciate the good in a human being instead of damming him completely. Along with true to life characters, ideal characters,historical characters, also a superb depiction of rennaisance Italy. Whatever critics say about 'Romola' being the least readable of all Eliot's books, it remains her most idealistic work which makes one feel deeply, and want to emulate the good. Hence, a great classic which is enjoyable and which sets you thinking about your own inadequacies."},{"Title":"Romola (Her George Eliot's works)","review":"Romola is a dense, compelling historical novel by the master of English fiction, George Eliot. Although this book is a bit slow going at first, the true-to-life characters and the towering themes make the reader's efforts more than worthwhile. Like the great film &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman,&quot; this novel deals with love, betrayal, parenthood, revenge, greed, spirituality, religion, and deceit, in ways that seem remarkably modern. I read it three times!"},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"After finishing \\"The Stars, Like Dust\\", Asimov started working on a third novel which would be called \\"The Currents of Space\\", which he was intending to publish in \\"Astounding\\". After discussing the idea with Walter Bradbury of Doubleday & Co., Bradbury expressed interest in publishing the third novel as he had the first two. The novel was published in October - December of 1952 in \\"Astounding\\", and by Doubleday in December.\\"The Currents of Space\\" is easily the best of the three precursor novels to the Foundation series which have become known as the Galactic Empire Series; however that is not all that difficult. This story takes place in Asimov's universe chronologically between the other two books, at a time when Trantor had become an empire, but not the Galactic Empire that it would become later.The story is centered on the planet Florina and on a man named Rik, who initially appears to be mentally challenged, but who is in fact a spatio-analyst from Earth who has had much of his mind erased by a Psychic Probe after he tried to warn of the impending destruction of the planet. When Rik's memory starts to return, people from Trantor and Sark (the world which rules Florina), and perhaps others as well become aware of his existence and try to find and control him.As with the first two Galactic Empire novels, Asimov wrote an afterword where he explains the scientific errors in the story. In this story the error is rather significant to the plot; however, the other elements of this story do not suffer as badly as they did in \\"Pebble in The Sky\\" or \\"The Stars, Like Dust\\". Regardless, this is only a fairly average novel, and not the best place to start if you are unfamiliar with Isaac Asimov."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"This is certainly the best of the three Empire novels, and one of Asimov's best science fiction novels of any type. I love his early fiction in general more than his later stuff, like FOundation and Earth and Robots and Empire and Nemesis. In comparison, Currents is much tighter, and more cleanly written, with a plot that GRIPS you like a good mystery(which, I think, is the type of writer Asimov was at heart). My one regret about this novel is that it is one of the last of his that I have to read, and I don't want to be left without any more. And if there was one thing I was left wanting in the book, it was for a certain kiss(not to give away anything) to develop into something more-- but I suppose that is the working of modern hack-fiction on me, and Asimov's abstinence from such cheap &quot;attention-catchers&quot; demonstrates his superior writing ability. He didn't NEED that to make the book more interesting."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"Having read all of Asimov's early works, it's fair to say that this is the best of the crop of the Empire novels, and is better than all the Robot novels as well. It's not quite up to the Foundation stories, hence the rating of 4 stars.The plot is interesting, and has aged well. There is not very much that makes you snicker in the light of current scientific knowledge. He has a lot of characters for a 200 page book, but it is never confusing; they are individuals and it's easy to keep them separated in your mind. The story draws you in and keeps you interested from beginning to end.Asimov had the tendency to throw too many cliffhangers/revelations that didn't go anywhere in his early novels (as compared to, say, Nightfall), and it feels like he's cheaply manipulating the reader. This book, while containing some of these events, are far more logical and less contrived than in the other Empire and Robot novels. This makes it a far more enjoyable read.It is a shame that these books are out of print. I think the fact that 14 people have written reviews of this book points to the fact that there is still a following for Asimov out there, and maybe the publishers should print another edition of these early books, even in a single volume (as each Empire book is only 200 pages or so)."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"One day, on an agricultural colony planet run by a empire as harsh as the Roman Empire in biblical times, a local functionary finds a man whose mind has been destroyed in one of his town's fields. A peasant woman is tasked to re-raise this man from pretty much a second infancy. But now things are starting to come back, and the supervisor, although a native himself, sees the threat this poses to his masters' power. The principal crop on this world is a form of cotton that grows only this way on his planet--it's used in expensive clothing. But before his mind was &quot;wiped&quot;, the victim was a scientist who had discovered a menace which threatened that planet. Although the story has Ludlumesque head games by people in power, its strong point is in the human factor in the form of the victim, his female protector, as well as his former boss who's concerned about what became of him. That's why I say Wouk. But this is a sci fi book, right? Well, don't let that scare you off. It's a hell of a story in a middlin' size book--you don't get the two in a single package all that often."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"Yes it's a tough read. Yes it requires patience and determination. But the fruits of the labor are an opening of the mind, a refreshed perspective of our world and the universe. Choose your chapter that meets your interest and be entertained and educated. This is not one to read straight through from front to back. This is one of my favorite books and truly not only a fascinating set of facts but an arrangement of concepts that expand the mind."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"While clearly science fiction by its setting, this novel also contains elements of detective novel, future history/social commentary, and espionage. The setting is an agricultural planet (Florinia) that yields a unique and highly valuable crop (a high-quality luxury cloth fiber), and the natives are exploited at a peasant/slave level by the rich and oppresive Squires from nearby planet Sark. Meanwhile, Sark is, due to its rich export, able to stave off conquest by the encroaching Trantorian empire. Within this setting, a scientist has discovered a danger to Florinia, but before he can alert officials, he is captured and his memory erased (with a sci-fi device) by an unknown party. The story begins with the scientist, renamed Rik, barely able to function and not knowing who he is, working amongst the Florinians and remembering things piecemeal. From here, the various sides are all trying to figure out what is going on, and struggling to get their hands on Rik, as he and his companions try to elude capture. Asimov keeps both the action and the ideas going to keep the reader interested, and creates a beleivable and sensible \\"world\\" and plot, without resorting to two-dimensional stereotypes or suspension-of-disbelief moments. Even the overlords come across as human beings, despite their reprehensible social system (one remembers even America's \\"founding fathers\\" included slave-owners). Everything makes perfect sense at the end, yet I didn't guess the truth before I read it. Although written over 50 years ago, the science-fiction aspects don't come across as dated (although the underlying science of Rik's belief of danger for the planet has been discredited, it was beyond my scientific knowledge until I looked it up).Asimov's genius lies in the ability to tell an engrossing adventure story intelligently. Although well crafted, lthis IS a quick read - I'm surprised to find it listed only as an expensive hardcover; this is prime mass-market material; and at 200 pages each, they really should bind Asimov's three similar novels (this, \\"Pebble In The Sky\\", and \\"The Stars Like Dust\\" - not closely related, but all set in the same \\"universe\\" between his \\"Robot\\" and \\"Foundation\\" series) into one 600-page paperback! So, I suggest reading it, but (unless you like to collect hardcovers) pick up a used copy at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"The elite of the galaxy are usually dressed in Kryt. It is the most beautiful fabric known. Its iridescent threads are nearly indestructible, and above all, it is so, oh so expensive.It has made the sellers of Kryt fabulously wealthy. Its trade is controlled solely by one planet, planet Sark; a planet which lies outside of Trantor's expanding galactic empire. Other planets have tried and failed to grow it; it is not known why Kryt grows only on one planet. It doesn't even grow on planet Sark, but on a planet that Sark controls: planet Florina.That is where you are: planet Florina. At first, you don't know that. In fact, you know practically nothing; somebody has blocked your memories, so much so, that you can't even speak. But a native woman takes you in, teaches you, gets you a job at the Kryt mill, and gradually your memories begin to seep in. And then one day - between bites on your lunch break - you remember something about your profession: you were a Spatio-analyst, one who collects and correlates data about the space between the stars.

The three \`Empire' novels by Asimov are a great example. All three books are wonderfully written and fill the gap between The Robot novels and the Foundation series beautifully. These novels also give us a glimpse at the state of science in the fifties. If you are an Asimov fan and see any of the Empire novels available for loan or purchase please do so. You will not be sorry. To clear up some confusion on the part of some, the reason these novels are called \`Empire' novels is because they take place just before the Empire referenced in the Foundation series began, during its infancy and during its peak. Very much fun indeed."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"The world of Sark exists in the minority in having thus far eluded annexation by the Empire of Trantor. The sole reason for this evasion rests in Sark's dominion over a no-account world called Florina. No-account, that is, except for a wondrous crop that grows only upon Florina. This crop is so entwined in the culture of the galaxy that Sark has become unbelievably wealthy, so much so that Trantor fears the large army to be raised by such wealth.Upon the planet Florina, there is a man whose memory has been erased for the danger it poses to the delicate balance that exists over Florina's condition. In his profession he uncovered a secret now lost, one of paramount importance to the safety of all Florina.This novel chronicles the mystery surrounding this mind-wiped man and the adventures that ensue as his memory begins to return. Asimov again displayed his excellent plotting ability as he leads you in various directions, so that you come to conclusions that are completely wrong, lest you recall the earlier-placed clues that would prevent such erroneous conclusions. When the questions are all finally answered, too many viable suspects have been eliminated, and there is left only the guilty. Asimov was successful in twisting the events such that any reader would be kept guessing.This book is the second of the three Empire novels, which depict different time periods in the creation of the Galactic Empire. This takes place after the Empire is relatively well established. Preceding these novels, but not necessary for any understanding (as Asimov did not tie them together until well after the Empire novels were published) of the events.Following the Empire novels are the Foundation novels, which chronicle the fall of the Empire. In order to truly get the feel of this universe, this book clues the reader in as to how Trantor progressed in its Imperial goal. Also, he provides information that indicate the state of things in the third Empire novel, Pebble in the Sky."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"Uncharacteristically of the other two Empire novels, you really get a feel for the characters in this one and begin to understand them as if they were real people. You feel the panic and helplessness of Rik, a man with a bad case of amnesia of everything prior to a few days ago when he woke up and didn't know where he was or who he was, and just happened to have the good fortune of being taken in by a kind woman. On the planet Florina, still untouched by the rising Galactic Empire, lower class workers toil for their masters on the aristocratic world of Sark, and Rik struggles to find who wiped his mind and why. I was somewhat disappointed by all three Empire novels by the fact that none of them actually deals directly with the Empire or its rise, they only take place during it. Other than that, this is a superb novel."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"I'm with SA (Alabama)...

It is a bit dry and not like his novels.More of a textbook than anything else."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"The Currents of Space is the second of Isaac Asimov's Empire novels, the first one being The Stars, Like Dust, and the final one being Pebble In The Sky. The Empire books fill the chronological gap between his Robot book and his Foundation books, all of which intertwine together to form a very long and convoluted fictional universe (this is ignoring the books set in this universe that were written by other authors.)Sound confusing? It is; but don't let that worry you. Although the books are best read in sequence, they all work fine on their own as well, outside of the larger universe in which they are set, and they will serve the reader just fine, if he or she elects to pick and choose, though they will be missing a lot. I have no doubt that, after reading any one of the books, any reader will want to read all of them, owing to their high level of quality.This particular novel is a fast-moving, suspenseful, science fiction/mystery/adventure romp. Improving upon the previous Empire novel, Asimov here wrote a very tight, smooth book that is very entertaining to read and can be enjoyed by almost anyone, whether they are a fan of science fiction or not. Like most of Asimov's novels, the book, though ostensibly science fiction, has the basic structure and feel of a mystery novel. Not surprisingly, then, his novels, though always scientifically literate and full of interesting scientific ideas, not to mention eminently worthy political and philosophical concepts, have a generally wide appeal. This is one of the reasons that Asimov is one of the most well-known and perennially popular of all science fiction writers: many of his novels feature a mainstream appeal that is atypical for the genre. His books are also invariably well-written and deserving of their large readership. The Currents of Space is no exception. Here Asimov displays his immense plotting talents, which would come to full fruition in his later works, weaving an interesting and complex web of mystery, intrigue, and suspense. He writes a solid, tight story that will keep the reader interested and entertained -- not to mention on his or her toes -- all the way through. It also makes very clear one of the most admirable traits of Dr. Asimov's: his love of peace. This book, like the later Foundation stories, features practical, sensible political solutions as an alternative to war. One cannot help but admire the good doctor for not using his premise of a futuristic world and technology as an excuse to fill his pages with senseless interstellar wars, as many science fiction writers, even the great ones, often do.This is a book that any fan of Asimov will definitely want to read. That said, although it is a definite improvement on its prequel, this is not on the same level as some of the author's later and better-known work: though it is a solid story, well-told, it lacks, for the most part, the extra layer of deeper meaning that much of his later work would contain. It is for this reason that I give the work four stars. It is a bloody shame that the entire Empire series is no longer in print: they are a worthy series of books and fill in an important chronological niche in the Asimovian universe. Pick it up if you can find it."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"It is really an enormous tragedy that so many of Isaac Asimov's great Science Fiction works remain out of print. The three \`Empire' novels by Asimov are a great example. All three books are wonderfully written and fill the gap between The Robot novels and the Foundation series beautifully. These novels also give us a glimpse at the state of science in the fifties. If you are an Asimov fan and see any of the Empire novels available for loan or purchase please do so. You will not be sorry. To clear up some confusion on the part of some, the reason these novels are called \`Empire' novels is because they take place just before the Empire referenced in the Foundation series began, during its infancy and during its peak. Very much fun indeed.If you want to read them in order read The Stars Like Dust First, which takes place before the birth of the Foundation referenced Empire. Then read The Currents of Space which takes place during the infancy of the Foundation referenced Empire.

This one is a great one of the future that stands alone as stories go."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"it was as good as I expected. I enjoy Asimov stories and General Sci Fi books. I'll be back for more."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"It's actually nice to finally be able to read this novel. I bought the darn thing probably around fifteen years ago when I was a teenager and on an Asimov kick. What I didn't realize at the time was that it was the only novel in the Empire series in print. Being slightly picky about such things (and probably not totally realizing that the novels aren't all that related) I tried to order the other two, failed, and then put this volume aside for quite some time. Eventually due to the magic of the Internet, I was able to find used copies of the other two and I was able to satisfy my strange urge to read them all in a row.Was it worth it? Actually, it was. I'm glad that I read it after the first two volumes because there's such an uptick in . . . I won't say \\"quality\\" because all three are decent but however you want to quantify the elusive factor known as \\"knowing what you're doing.\\" Inspiration, maybe? That could be it. This one feels more inspired.After a beginning where a scientist predicts that a planet will be destroyed to someone who not only openly scoffs but then proceeds to drug and mindwipe the poor guy, we're shifted to the world of Florina, ruled by Sark. Upon arriving we discover worker Rik, who was mysteriously found in a field a year ago knowing little more than a baby did and slowly putting himself back together and learning basic skills. Until more than basic science skills come back to him, kicking off a search that threatens to drag every conceivable faction into the mess.Of all the Empire novels, this one shows off Asimov's sometimes underrated skill at building intensity, something that we only really saw in the early Robot novels. Far from being bound to acting like a SF novel, at times it seems more like a political thriller with SF trappings as everyone seeks to gain the upper hand by finding out who knows what and when, and more importantly, what they don't know. Meanwhile Rik is caught in events without having much idea how he even got involved in this stuff in the first place. A vast stretch of the novel doesn't even involve him, as the faction on Sark and the agents from Trantor all vie to intimidate each other and figure out who the mole might be, almost like Asimov had gotten bored with good ol' Rik (who isn't much of a character beyond the amnesiac scientist type). In fact, when the novel isn't ignoring Rik, it's looking at the Townsman as he goes on a minor killing spree as he tries to evade the authorities, coming as close as Asimov ever did to that slippery beast he called \\"action.\\" His quirk of staking anything that might quicken your pulse in the periphery is already in full force, with killings being described after the fact, or in such clinical brushed off detail that a friend of a friend of a friend might as well be telling you about it. It becomes maddening after a while, especially when you're waiting for a fight scene to break up all the people talking at each other and the book decides to give you more people talking about the fight scene you just missed. Gah.But his footing is surer here than the other Empire novels and you finally get a sense that he's figuring this stuff out. The relationship between Sark and Florina is fairly well thought out in its totalitarian complexity and the tangled politics between Sark and Trantor ground the settings with a new urgency, so that it feels like the events that are happening here matter. All the political maneuvering between the Squires and Trantor doesn't quite reach the sophisticated heights of CJ Cherryh but comes close to stuff that Poul Anderson would be doing in his own series of novels. You can see a lot of instances here where other SF writers would take and refine these concepts further (the whole Spatio-analytics concept seems like something Van Vogt would have had fun with). I don't know who did it first, or if this book was influential at all but it's always neat to see the roots.Still, it's got flaws. As I mentioned, its talky in that Asimov way, where pages and pages go by of people debating things. This would be less of a problem when the central conceptual hook was good enough to justify all that chatter (the Robot novels, mostly, as most of the Foundation stories are shorter) but here it's not quite enough. Rik isn't a very strong character, we're supposed to feel bad that he's being buffeted by events out of his control and thus feel sorry for him but it's hard to get too worked up when his initial warnings are ignored by even the novel. It also seems like Asimov treated romance much the same way as action, handled off screen, which means that anyone who is a woman gets a bit of the shaft in terms of their narrative potential, mostly being around to add some local color. But what's worse is that the idea that is supposed to get us into the novel, the imminent destruction of the world, almost becomes a MacGuffin of sorts, in the background until the plot requires it to be and handled with any sort of sense of urgency or worry.Which means you stick around for the scenery and the political action. In this case it's strong enough to save the novel. Not enough to make it one of his all time classics but such a cut above the other two that you can definitely see the well from which the actual classics would eventually spring."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"The book is in nearly new condition. I'm very happy to have found a copy of this out of print book for a low price, and look forward to reading it."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"The Currents of Space is one of the novels in Isaac Asimov's so-called \\"Empire Trilogy\\", but it stands alone - YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ ANYTHING ELSE TO UNDERSTAND AND ENJOY THIS BOOK. Asimov had already written the Foundation trilogy, but those were originally written as a serial in a magazine. Thus the Empire books are Asimov's earlist full-length novels that were written as such. All of the elements which make Asimov's writing great is there: realistic science fiction, compelling mystery, and well-developed characters. However I feel that there is something in this presentation that is lacking. As good as this book is, it just doesn't stand out when compared with later books like the Robot novels and the later Foundation novels. I don't have any complaints about this book. By any other author it would be 5 stars, but by someone as accomplished as Asimov it is slightly forgettable compared to his other works.The setting: The rise of the Galactic Empire of Trantor long before its downfall in the Foundation novels and long after mankind's origins on earth had been obscured in the Robot novels. The planet Sark (independent of the Empire) has taken over the planet Florina to exploit their resources, and Trantor wants control of both planets. A scientist from Trantor has discovered a danger that could destroy the entire planet of Florina, but when he tells someone about the danger his memory is erased and he is dumped in the middle of nowhere. He is as a helpless infant and is cared for by an illeterate Florinian laborer until he starts being able to take care of himself and gradually recovers some of his memory. He is also watched closely by a low-level politician who may or may not have his best interests in mind. Rik, our memory impaired protagonist, remembers that there is a danger to Florina, but he does not know what that danger is. He must save the planet while evading capture on all sides, getting caught in political intrigue, wondering who he can trust, and trying to figure out who erased his memory in the first place.This is a short book, but it is full of action and suspense. Asimov keeps you turning the pages, and you are done reading it in no time. In the end Asimov ties everything up nicely. No, I did not predict the ending. Yes, the ending was satisfying.If you are a fan of Isaac Asimov you can't go wrong with this book. If you haven't read him before, read his Robot or Foundation novels first. This book can stand on its own, but it is appreciated much more when you are familiar with Asimov's universe."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"This book was a really fun book to read. The science parts(a star exploding because of carbon currents in space) weren't all that interesting or complicated, but the political frenzy is everywhere. Every man seems to be suspected of being the mysterious criminal \\"X\\", but the one that is not suspected turns out to be the criminal- and for different reasons than anyone would imagine. But all that hassle about the criminal sidetracks them from the matter of real importance- the universe's most valued world, Florina's imminent destruction by the explosion of a prenovae star. The only way to find out how this breathtaking mystery, political and suspence masterwork by Isaac Asimov ends is to read the book- or buy the Kindle version, like I did."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"Again Asimov enthralls us with another exciting and suspenful story with good characters and fast action.

But, the planet Sark stands in the path of this conquest. Sark is an independent planet but, more important, is its sale of kyrt. Kyrt, a cotton-like substance, is the foundation of most of the materials in the galaxy and is only available from Sark.Sark doesn't produce kyrt by itself. Instead, kyrt is grown on the planet Florina. Sark uses the population of Florina as cheap slave labor to produce kyrt. Many have tried, but none have succeeded in growing kyrt anywhere but on Florina. These imitations are more like plain cotton and nowhere near the quality of kyrt. Due to this relationship, Sark has become extremely powerful and wealthy, while Florina has suffered under the rule of Sark.But, a man has entered the picture with information which could prove devastating to Sark, Florina, and Trantor. This man claims to have knowledge that Florina and it's valuable supply of kyrt is in danger of being destroyed. This leads to an exciting story of murder, political manuvering, and intrigue.I'm a big fan of science fiction, but this is only the 2nd Asimov novel that I've read, the other being the classic \\"Nightfall\\", which I also recommend. I thought this book was good, but I had some difficulty following the story. I thought Asimov introduced too many characters in such a short book, too.

It is set somewhat prior to the establishment of the Galactic Empire--Trantor's Republic consists of over one million star systems, and the Empire is now in sight, but there are still independent star systems and stellar groups that Trantor has not yet assimilated.This story is set on the planet Florina, which is harshly ruled by the nearby planet Sark. Florina, alone in the Galaxy, produces Kyrt, which is a fabric with fabulous qualities and which makes Florina the key to great wealth for its Sarkian overlords. No one knows why only Florina can produce Kyrt, and the reason for this contains the doom of Florina. More would be telling; no spoilers here.This is quite a serviceable story, which has aged well despite certain anachronisms. I first read it as a teenager, and after picking it up after a delay of nearly 35 years I still enjoyed the book. This is not always true when revisiting books one enjoyed as a youth.Asimov was a giant of science fiction, and with his passing it is good to see that his stories are being republished and that they will be available for future generations of readers. This one is very recommended, and I rate it 3 stars only because so many of Asimov's other works are even better than this one."},{"Title":"The Currents of Space","review":"When a man known only as Rik finds himself on the planet of Florina, he has no memory of his past and little hope for the future. He knows only that he is destined to work in the fields, growing the wondrous kyrt plant that is found only on Florina and is therefore a highly valued commodity across the galaxy. But with the help of a kind and loyal local woman, Rik manages to rediscover his own identity and help free the Florinians from the domination of the Squires of Sark, who have been exploiting Florina for its kyrt crop.The second book in the Galactic Empire trilogy, Currents of Space will not fail to satisfy fans of Isaac Asimov's famed brand of hard SF/space opera. The GE trilogy takes place in the era before Asimov's classic Foundation books, when the empire of Trantor does not yet control the entire Galaxy. Asimov's speculations about carbon currents, which are at the center of the plot, are no longer tenable after 50 years, but it doesn't matter. Currents is solid, exciting, old-fashioned SF that is hard to beat."},{"Title":"Schizophrenia (Psy) (Encyclopedia of Psychological Disorders)","review":"I am almost finished reading this book, and find it very educational and informative from a diagonistic standpoint.

I can't recommend it to you enough."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is an entertaining, original and insightful work.However reading it did not change my life.I do not even think that reading Proust changed my life.But this perhaps indicates that I am not the best, not the most attentive of readers.One of the lessons of this work is that reading Proust should make us more attentive readers not only of literature but of our own lives and minds.Here I think there is something to be said for the idea that Proust is very possibly the most detailed and complicated observer of his own psychological life that has as yet appeared in the world.But Botton does not want to do the impossible i.e. teach us how to learn from Proust how to be great geniuses. For that is of course impossible to learn from anyone, but rather can only come as a gift of God.Botton does however try to teach lessons about certain aspects of Proust's experience which he believes most of us can learn. Some of these relates to the theme of suffering, which Proust certainly was a fine expert in, and the other jealousy and love.It is strange but I in reading Proust never believed that the kind of degradation in suffering he found so fascinating is something most of us would be very wise to imitate.I also found the Proustian torments of jealousy and absence something not so much unreal, but truly secondary in what might be called a different kind of love drama or story.Is there in Proust's world a single story of love based on mutual respect, understanding, on kindness , on consideration, on recognition of the autonomy of the other, on real physical intimacy and pleasure which also has an element of sanctity?I don't think so.This is an amusing book, but it does not touch upon worlds which I believe are much richer in human blessedness."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Enjoyable book by a young, enthusiastic author.

Proust was a name I certainly knew, but the notion of sitting down and reading his seven volume Remembrance of Things Past was (and is) rather distasteful. Here, de Botton has applied his imagination and deft, witty prose to using the Frenchman's mammoth novel as a sort of self-help guide cum literary biography. It's a strange mix, and the pleasure comes in seeing how de Botton pulls it off, rather than the actual &quot;lessons&quot; drawn from Proust, which are rather obvious pieces of common sense (at least to me).

He doesn't mock or over play faults to make void the entire, but shows that due to this fault they may be great but human, if not great observers on the nature of what it is to be human. This is also the type of book that if in parts you feel like it doesn't speak to you then you might consider yourself fortunate. Some of it was a bit hard to swallow, like Virginia Wolfe's suicide being attributed to Proust the way it was. Ruskin's influence on Proust as intensive as it was is believable, however. Ruskin had a profound influence on many from Gandhi to Oscar Wilde and Ruskin's style strikes an intimate immediacy to it that might motivate anyone to action.I like how De Botton respectfully humanizes his subjects the way he does."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Proust can certainly change your life. However, de Button's book won't necessarily convince many of this. Nonetheless, this book will function as an introduction to Proust for many decades and for thousands of readers. It is a highly accessible introduction to the work and ideas of Proust. It successfully introduces a Proustian way of viewing life. What de Button accomplishes in this book is a demonstration that reading Proust can be fun, entertaining, and highly enjoyable.At the same time, if Proust can really change your life, which indeed he can, Proust must be read quite serious. It is on this account de Button is far less successful. If you are looking for deep insights into Proust and his \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" this is not the book. If you are looking for a basic introduction, or a brief reminder of your enjoyment of reading Proust, this is an excellent book.Many of the criticisms of this book, seem to me, are unfair. The real problem is that the title \\"How Proust Can Change Your Life\\" suggests a very deep and serious analysis of Proust, instead it is a rather lighthearted and whimsical introduction. But as an introduction to Proust this book succeeds brilliantly. If this book succeeds in convincing readers to read Proust, they will potentially discover for themselves how Proust changes lives; hence de Button's title may not be as misleading as it appears.I read in a review of this book that Proust is not meant to be cute and sweet, and his \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" is not meant as a lighthearted, whimsical read. I necessarily disagree. Art, such as \\"In Search of Lost Time\\", functions on several dimensions simultaneously. For example, in my opinion, there is no book, psychologically, sociologically, historically, etc., more serious than Twain's Huck Finn, however, it can be enjoyed as a playful adventure by middle school children. This is not a misreading, but the multi-dimensional capacity of great Artists, and how their Art, or great literature, speak to us, i.e. multi-dimensionally.Moreover, de Button does certainly have some depth, for example he states in the final chapter that great authors help us understand how to feel, see the world, and appreciate life. This is surely correct, and accurately describes what Proust does. I would also like to add, a friend of mine who attempting to read Proust, reported to me, so often for her \\"nothing of substance\\" seems to be happening in dozens of pages at a time, now she reports, after reading de Button, she feels far more capable of more fully appreciating and better understanding Proust and what he is up to with his long sentences, digressions, and seemingly trivial and overly detailed descriptions. Indeed it was this report from my friend which convinced me to write this review and highly recommend de Button's book (with the above qualifications).De Button's book tends to make people feel good and appreciate things they may have been taking for granted. Most readers will thoroughly enjoy de Button, but just don't expect de Button, by himself, to convince you Proust will change your life. For Proust to change your life you must read Proust for yourself."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Well, that was not the point of the author's book but I couldn't think of a better title. Botton tells us how Proust's life and writing can be a guide towards better living, particularly in such areas as friendships and appreciating life more. Proust was physically ill most of his life, suffering from asthma and other ailments. He wrote his magnus opus while lying in bed in a dark room. In many ways, he could be considered an odd character - going out in spring with three sweaters and a fur coat, regularly giving waiters a 200% tip. Botton finds self-help wisdom from Proust's observations, many found in Proust's novelIn Search of Lost Time: Proust 6-pack (Proust Complete), where he gives expression to feelings and emotions for which most of us could not find words. For example, he portrays characters who dismiss the objects of their frustrations as if they never cared about them to begin with, rather than admitting the disappoinment and responding in a more productive way. Botton includes lessons learned like this for every chapter. Botton's work differs from other so called self-help books in that the wisdom is arrived at via biography, anecdote and literature, not in the usual Ten Rules of... or Seven Habits of... style, but in a manner that requires the reader and self-help seeker to ponder and ruminate before accessing the pearl of wisdom. I did not necessarily \\"get\\" all of them, but perhaps this is the best way to achieve lasting change, by \\"getting\\" the advice through the time capsule of reflection rather than via the instant results of cliches."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"If it weren't for his graceful writing, graceful thinking, graceful gracefulness, this book might, like De Botton tells us Proust was, be too ingratiating.

In Search of Lost Time, also called Remembrance of Things Past, Proust's one-and-a-quarter-million-word magnum opus, does not contain a trite sentence or conventional thought. You can learn much about living from such a profound genius, including how to spend your time, how to see and feel things, and why, sometimes, it is best just to stay in bed.

Few people, and I number the most voracious readers among them, can stomach trudging through Proust's work, and who can blame them?

We all know that the market is flooded with How-To advice books that purportedly teach us how to stay positive, make a ton of friends, etc. However, this book does something totally different and surprising - it takes on a typical premise of a How-To book (in this case, &quot;How to Change Your Life&quot;) but does it in such an intelligent and incisive manner that one is tempted to create a brand-new Book Category called &quot;Cliche-Free How-To Books Which Don't Insult One's Intelligence and Actually Manage to Educate and Entertain at the Same Time&quot;.

It is on the one hand a clever subversion of the cliches and platitudes that plague most self-help books; yet it is still itself a self-help book that offers concrete and applicable advice. Though I would not call it \\"frequently hilarious,\\" as the back cover suggests, I found some of its conclusions to be wonderfully unconventional.

Whether Alain De Botton succeeds in rendering Proust faithfully is not something I can address with competence. But I can say that his book makes me want to read Proust; for if the nuggets of wisdom contained in this book are an inkling of what lies in store for the ones who tackle Proust's work, one can be sure of an experience that will deepen one's perception of the world and how we experience it. And, in the Proustian universe, it is this that is the goal of reading.In a way, I found some of Proust's observations (distilled for us by De Botton) very familiar to those by Walker Percy, addressing the phenomenon of people coming to see the Grand Canyon for the first time: one's initial experience is so often conditioned by the images that we already hold of the thing as-yet-to-be experienced.

A need to change our life arises at least once during our life course. As long as the chasm between our definition of happiness and reality remains almost abyssal, the quest to improve our life by radically changing its direction, continues to be pending, tempting and worth examining.Historically, the procedure involved some of the masters of philosophy. AdBotton makes a surprising exception by choosing M. Proust's writings as a mental vehicle to convey a rather demanding message.One can easily diagnose that the effort is doomed from the very beginning. Botton must succeed where Aristotle and Plato did not. He must succeed where whole schools of thought did not. And he had to do it with Proust. If we were about to judge the book as an attempt to deal with a challenging issue by using weak means (in order to prove one's skilful writing), we can safely declare that Botton may claim a moderate victory. On the other hand, if we consider the title's statement as a definite result expected to happen to the reader, the book sails dangerously over the deep waters of naivety."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Disappointing self-help/literary guidebook that came utterly lavished with positive reviews; The New Yorker said of the book \\"Curious, humorous, didactic and dazzling...It contains more human interest and play of fancy than most fiction.\\" Maybe I'm missing something or was just looking for something else, but it seems to me that Alain de Botton's book is nothing more than a banal self-help book that is more eloquently written than the other works in this dubious genre. Botton doesn't offer the reader much in the way of literary analysis or explication, rather, he merely uses the life (and scatterings of the work) of Marcel Proust to launch into his mediocre prescriptions for living. Surprisingly, little is actually said about In Search of Lost Time, the author prefers to inundate the reader with scatterings of anecdotes about Proust's health problems and social life. There are a few sections which are worthwhile, such as the great \\"what if it could have been another way?\\" conversation between Proust and James Joyce that reads like,\\"PROUST [while taking furtive stabs at an homard a l'americaine, huddled in his fur coat]: Monsieur Joyce, do you know the Duc de Clermont-Tonnerre?JOYCE: Please, appelez-moi James. Le Duc! What a close and excellent friend, the kindest man I have met from here to Limerick.PROUST: Really? I am so glad we agree [beaming at the discovery of his common acquaintance], though I have not yet been to Limerick.VIOLET SCHIFF [leaning across, with a hostess's delicacy, to Proust]: Marcel, do you know Jame's big book?PROUST: Ulysses? Naturellement. Who had not read the masterpiece of our new century? [Joyce blushes modestly, but nothing can disguise his delight].VIOLET SCHIFF: Do you remember any passages in it?PROUST: Madame, I remember the entire book. For instance, when the hero goes to the library, excuse my anglais, but I cannot resist [starting to quote]: \\"Urbane, to comfort them, the quaker librarian purred...\\" (pg. 112).There is also some interesting discouragement from Virginia Woolf upon reading Proust's great masterpiece,\\"I detest my own vocabulary. Why be always spouting words? [...] Take up Proust after dinner and put him down. This is the worst time of all. It makes me suicidal. Nothing seems left to do. All seems insipid and worthless.\\" (pg. 187).Unfortunately however, How Proust can Change Your Life is ultimately an overstated, dressed up self-help book with many useless suggestions about how you should live. It is not substantive literary criticism. For the latter, I suggest you seek out the work of Edmund Wilson."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"De Botton pays homage to Proust by making his prose almost as impenetrable as the prose of the man he writes about.

Proust will not change my life or yours."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Marcel Proust, like his fellow modernist icons, Kafka and Joyce, produced a literature which is entirely personal, devoid of the kind of universality which had, up until their time, characterized the Western Canon. If it is a coincidence, it is a revelatory one, that the key moment in Swann's Way, if not in all of In Search of Lost Time, comes with a perversion of the Communion. A bite of madeleine and a sip of tea sends Proust's narrator/Proust reeling back through the years, turns him entirely inwards, and inundates him with personal memories and feelings. During this reverie, Proust's older self essentially communes with his younger self, or selves. Here we have the individual, whole unto himself, needing only his own feelings and memories to find those things which give his life meaning.This stands thousands of years of the Judeo-Christian tradition on its head. It has been the dream of Western man, and a noble one, that we might rise beyond purely personal concerns and achieve something together as a species, achieve one day a kind of godhood ourselves. In no small part, it is this shared dream, and its requirement of communality, which has led us to create the liberal protestant capitalist democratic institutions which have made possible social progress over the past several centuries. Though these institutions vindicate individual rights, they are focussed on the ways in which men can co-exist and work together. Each in its own way is premised on the Golden Rule : Do unto others as you would have done unto you. Each of us, as individuals, will reap the benefit of the general adherence to this stricture, but it is primarily concerned with how we behave towards others. Similarly, during the Communion we turn not inwards but outwards, remembering the sacrifice that Christ made, taking our sinfulness upon himself, that we might approach closer to God.It is unsurprising then that the 20th Century, with Proust (and Darwin and Nietzsche and Freud and Marx and Joyce) leading the intellectual way, saw the near collapse of Judeo-Christian tradition and Western institutions and a descent into barbarism, as people acted out the ideas of the vanguard, with every man seeking only his own self interest. What is surprising is that so many chose to listen to the utter blather of such men. And none of those men, bizarre as they generally were, made a more unlikely prophet than Proust.A truly curious conceit animates the cult of Proust, the belief that the very characteristics which made Marcel Proust so completely aberrant, also made him uniquely perceptive about the human condition. Here's how de Botton puts it :The magnitude of Proust's misfortunes should not be allowed to cast doubt on the validity of his ideas....Though philosophers have traditionally been concerned with the pursuit of happiness, far greater wisdom would seem to lie in pursuing ways to be properly and productively unhappy. The stubborn recurrence of misery means that the development of a workable approach to it must surely outstrip the value of any utopian quest for happiness. Proust, a veteran of grief, knew as much.Meanwhile, here's as good a one sentence description of Proust as I could find :A mother's boy who never really grew up, a part-genuine, part-imaginary invalid totally incapable of looking after himself, a reluctant homosexual who may never have known genuine fulfillment, he spent his early manhood in Parisian high society and then retired, hermit-like, to his famous cork-lined room, where he turned day into night and night into day. -John Weightman, Books Unlimited review of How Proust Can Change Your LifeOkay, so that would make him a gay, hypochondriacal, mama-loving, French, recluse. And it necessarily raises the question : what does someone who was little more than a bundle of neuroses--someone who seemingly incorporated most of the pathologies of a 20th Century which we generally consider to have been a blood soaked disaster--have to tell us about life in general ?Alain de Botton believes Proust has quite a bit to tell us, and he tries mightily to make Proust seem pertinent to our lives. In effect, de Botton reads In Search of Lost Time as a huge self help manual. This is often very funny, and is presumably intended to be ironic, but is ultimately unconvincing. The many stories he tells about Proust and about contemporary reaction to his writing are quite amusing, but he can never quite get us convincingly past that first big hurdle : Proust was simply too screwed up for us to accept that he has much to say to us. Having successfully turned inward himself, he found nothing but himself, and an unpleasant self at that. The resulting fiction is necessarily idiosyncratic and personal, rather than universal. In the end, all Proust really had to say was what it was like to be Proust, which does not seem to have been a particularly enjoyable experience. Combine that with the fact that he said it in the most stultifyingly boring fashion and at interminable length and there's just no compelling reason to read him.Each chapter of de Botton's book is based on something he maintains Proust can teach us, and the final chapter is called &quot;How to Put Books Down.&quot; One has to assume that this is intentionally humorous on de Botton's part, because there may be no other author who has forced as many readers to put his book's down as Proust. They are truly unreadable, as the comments of even his friends and family acknowledge. If, like me, you feel some obligation to at least familiarize yourself with Proust's work, do yourself a huge favor and read How Proust Can Change Your Life instead of the original novels. Despite its ostensible intent, it will cure you of any desire to pick up a Proustian tome in the first place.GRADE : B+"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This book is a very poor attempt by what I have grown to call a &quot;self appointed intellectual&quot;.

When you finish it, however, you will be seriously contemplating having a go at Proust's masterpiece in its entirety.Consider the chapter titles. The fourth is &quot;How to Suffer Successfully.&quot; The seventh is &quot;How to Open Your Eyes.&quot; The eighth is &quot;How to be Happy in Love.&quot; The last, and my favorite, is &quot;How to Put Books Down.&quot; The author draws on the ideas and characters found in Proust's masterpiece and renders Proust's response to these issues. All of this is very wittily done. The whole thing is leavened with fascinating biographical tidbits concerning this strange, brilliant man, Marcel Proust. In that last chapter Mr. de Botton (apparently a Brit) presents us with Proust's view of books and their proper place in life:&quot;It is one of the great and wonderful characteristics of good books (which allows us to see the role at once essential yet limited that reading may play in our spiritual lives) that for the author they may be called &quot;Conclusions&quot; but for the reader &quot;Incitements.&quot; We feel very strongly that our own wisdom begins where that of the author leaves off, and we would like him to provide us with answers when all he is able to do is provide us with desires . . . . That is the value of reading, and also its inadequacy. To make it into a discipline is to give too large a role to what is only an incitement. Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.&quot;On the other hand should we expect any lesser eloquence from a man who on a different subject said this:&quot;People who are not in love fail to understand how an intelligent man can suffer because of a very ordinary woman. This is like being surprised that anyone should be stricken with cholera because of a creature so insignificant as the comma bacillus.&quot;I loved this book. It was indeed a tonic, and I think you might find it so, too."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This book has been ludicrously dismissed as 'facile' by sniffy snobs. The dismaying fact remains that in this age of overcrowding media vying for our attention, you have to be pretty convincing to make people want to give a large chunk of their lives to a 4000 page novel about sponge cakes, silly aristocrats and sickly fops.De Botton manages this with ease. His book is an excellent precis of Proustian concerns - time, love, friendship, literature - told in deceptively simple language masking thoroughness and complexity. His aren't the last words on these subjects, they are starting points which allow the virgin reader a map when starting on the vast terrain of A La Recherche.His own prose is elegant, suggestive and sometimes very funny, while his emphasis on the personal is at the same time endearing, a way into the book, and true to Proust. He fills in his narrative with much biographical, historical and anecdotal matter, drawing on letters, newspapers, memoires, which are both illuminating and entertaining.His own method is seemingly the opposite of Proust's, immediately lucid and precise, but the form of his book follows the Proustian pattern, whereby the book heading in one direction turns in on itself, becomes a book about itself, its own creation, even negating itself as it tells us to abandon Proust if we want to be true to the spirit of Proust.The book isn't perfect - sometimes the prose is a little TOO easy; both Proust and De Botton come across as near-saintly figures, full of understanding and kindness, when the truth (with Proust at any rate) is much messier; and the last two chapters are a little rushed. But few books outside the thriller genre have delighted me and kept me reading feverishly to the end like this little trinket."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This book deserves all the praise it has received. It does something I've never been able to do when talking to friends: it articulates the value of reading and studying literature. You don't have to have read IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME to enjoy this book. In fact, de Botton could probably have subsituted Joyce, Faulkner, or Woolf for Proust and produced a similar study. The self-help format seems appropriate (even if sardonically intended). De Botton seems to be directly addressing (and at times challenging) the earnestness of people who turn to books to improve themselves (and who expect books to show them the best way to improve those around them). My favorite chapters were &quot;How to Suffer Successfully&quot; and &quot;How to Be a Good Friend.&quot; The final chapter, &quot;How to Put Down Books,&quot; should probably be photocopied and stapled to the door of every library and bookstore. I cautions us against bibliolatry.One tiny gripe. De Botton does not always identify the works he is quoting from. We don't need to know specific page numbers, but it would be nice to know if a quotation is from one of the volumes of IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME, or from an essay or letter. In one case, I wasn't sure if the quote was Proust's or Ruskin's."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Alain de Botton's slim volume contains a reasonably good argument for making the considerable investment of time and energy required to read In Search of Lost Time. I don't recall the author promising that reading his book will change one's life, or that reading Proust's work will necessarily be a life-changing experience--only that it might turn out that way.I was given a dog-eared copy of How Proust Can Change Your Life by a friend whom I'd told I was considering giving Proust a go. I read maybe half of it, found it amusing, and found the portrayal of Proust amusing as well. The book seemed to fizzle out after that, but what I'd read was enough to get me started on Swann's Way. I had not expected Proust to be comical in any way, but I credit Alain de Botton for illuminating Proust's self-deprecating sense of humor. Had it not been for that, I might never have made it past the famous and seemingly interminable description of juvenile insomnia that opens Swann's Way, much less enjoyed it.Five years later, I have just finished The Captive and plan to begin The Fugitive within the next month or so. Has Proust changed my life? Well, yes. His work has attuned me to the importance of paying attention, resisting the dulling effects of habit, slowing down, finding meaning in the ordinary rhythms of life, accepting the painful inevitabilities of existence, laughing at my own foibles. There's more, but I won't bore you with it.Proust is not everyone's cup of tea. But he might be yours. And if he is, you're in for what can, in fact, be a life-changing experience. (At the rate I'm reading him, it could also be a lifelong experience.) You may not be happier, handsomer, thinner, richer, or smarter, but you just might have a better understanding of why being who, what, and where you are is worthy of your attention.If you're thinking about diving into Proust and not sure that it will be worth the effort, I'd recommend spending a few bucks on this primer first. If it inspires you to move on to the real thing, that's great. If it doesn't, you will have saved yourself hundreds of hours of what could be, for some, utter tedium. And if happiness, beauty, and wealth are what you really want, and you want them now, there's always Dr. Phil."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I can see where this book might rub some people the wrong way. People with an old fashioned dedication to literature probably won't appreciate Alain de Botton's clever re-contextualizing of Proust within the modern genre of self-help. I might feel similarly if de Botton claimed to be writing a real self-help book or a serious examination of Proust, but he never attempts to perform either feat.Instead, de Botton accomplishes several things. He parodies self-help books, he undertakes a humorous and highly personal exploration of Proust, and he makes a witty argument about how literature can aid us in our daily lives. The heart of de Botton's message is actually paradoxical. From one perspective he is saying, &quot;don't take literature too seriously&quot; and from another he is saying, \\"literature is a critical tool in everyone's life\\".I believe that all of us essentially reinvent what we read and use it to interpret our lives and the world around us. De Botton simply provides a humorous and intelligent blue print of this natural process."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I will start out by saying I'm somewhat biased towrd the subject matter as proust is one of my favorite writers - 'philosophers' (peut -etre ?). Nontheless, compliments do no justice to this excellent book. It is possible to read it in a weekend, on a beach or in the library, yet the wisdom it contains will last a lifetime. As it examines peculiarites of Proust's life and character, as well as his famous novel &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, De Botton distills the contents of the seven volumes to provide valuable advice on friendship, love, money, work and ultimately how to live a better life. Ulike self help books, &quot;How Proust Can Change your Life&quot; does not ask you to make lists of things to do, change your personality or tell you that &quot;if you can see it you can be it&quot;. Nor will you find quick solutions to complex issues like personal change and many of the associated buzzwords of most intellectually insulting guides like 'proactive', 'multitask', 'lifestyle' or even 'successful'. It will not tell you how to become rich. It merely asks you to examine and think about your life so that you may understand yourself better. It also shows how paying attention to minor details is the key to appreciating others, ourselves and the world. It is simply an excellent book. Unfortunately, too few will read it, but those few will have a rare privilege."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"First, while I really love this little book, it doesn't quite deliver on the title. Not that the title isn't accurate. Very few fiction writers can actually change one's life, but Proust is one of a very few that can (reading him has very definitely changed mine), but I'm not quite sure that de Botton gets at the reasons why. At least, he didn't get to the specific reasons that Proust has had that effect on my life.Nonetheless, this remains an amazingly good introduction to Proust, and is a marvelous first-book for anyone contemplating reading Proust's masterpiece. Proust is, of course, the author of what is very widely considered to be the great work of literature of the past century and what is increasingly considered one of the great masterpieces in the history of literature: IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME. de Botton's volume isn't precisely an introduction to Proust so much as a series of reflections on themes that can be illustrated by aspects of Proust's life or by passages in his great novel. Many of these are marvelous at assisting even a veteran reader of Proust to gain new insights into his book.Is the book worthwhile for someone who does not plan on reading Proust but just wants to read an enjoyable book? Certainly. de Botton is unfailingly witty, almost always interesting, and frequently insightful. None of this relies either upon having read Proust or intending to. The book can certainly stand on its own. Reading this book is fun and easy; reading Proust can be fun at times, but it is also challenging and demanding frequently. But that may be why de Botton's book is unable to show how Proust truly can change your life. Proust has a way of sucking you deep into his book, making you so much a part of it that you feel almost that it is you and not the narrator from whom all these feelings and emotions arise. You almost become a part of the novel, and your life can change because Proust can create a story that becomes a mirror to your own life, instilling a sense of the things we ought to have done but didn't, but providing the revelation that it isn't too late. Proust can also show how all the failures of the past can become the material for future success and accomplishment. de Botton hints at some of this, and even quotes some key passages that in the context of the novel most eloquently display this (cf. the Elstir speech on p. 67, which I believe displays the central theme of the entire novel better than any other passage in Proust).I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone wishing either a fun read or a light-hearted intro to Proust. But even more I recommend reading Proust. Only in doing that can one actually discover how Proust can change one's life."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Looking at the reviews of this book, you wonder whether people are talking about the same book. Some call it excellent, others a complete load of nonsense. I can see why people might complain. They might say that you need to read Proust and not read a guide on Proust. But that misses out what this book is really about. It's not attempting to be a &quot;guide&quot;; It's certainly not attempting to replace Proust. It's just looking at a certain side of Proust's thought; what one might call his therapeutic side, and tracing it very skillfully through the letters and the biography and the novel. It reads unbelievably clearly - and so, if one's feeling ungenerous, it might be accused of being &quot;simplistic,&quot; but that's naive. This kind of clarity and lucidity requires an enormous effort and huge talent. Alain de Botton's work is uneven. The Romantic Movement didn't really work, Kiss &amp; Tell was Ok but only OK, but he triumphed in two books; On Love and now this title. I can only urge serious readers to take a look at this book. This is a book that matters. It's going to go down in history as one of the finest, most intelligent pieces of literary criticism of the 20th century."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Alain de Botton offers a charming overview of Proust's achievement with so light a touch that it cancels out all the usual criticisms of this fascinating writer as boring and tendentious. Which of us have the time to wade through seven volumes of Remembrance of Things Past? No problem: De Botton gives us a rundown on the oeuvre by isolating themes within the work, employing a framework of gentle mockery of the self-help genre - the temptation to turn to a great author in the hopes that he can provide us with a roadmap on how to live our lives. In the process he includes enough commentary and quotation to richly illuminate the extraordinary depth of insight and no-nonsense common sense running as a fine vein beneath the musings of this nineteenth-century provincial invalid, nowadays largely relegated to the ranks of the effete and irrelevantby those who have done no more than dipped into him. De Botton's achievement is to remind us of the unique dimensions of Proust's profound understanding of the art of living, even as he gently moves us away from the temptation to idolize the writer. De Botton concludes his book with the insight that \\"a genuine homage to Proust would be to look at our world through his eyes, not look at his world through our eyes;\\" adding this final dictum from Proust himself: \\"Reading is on the threshold of the spriritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.\\" The final sentence of De Botton's volume sums up the conclusions of his own study: \\"Even the finest books deserve to be thrown aside\\" - words which offer the purest homage to the essence of Proust.

What's more, De Botton takes pertinent passages in ISoLT and contrasts them with how Proust actually lived his own life. Sometimes Proust writes one way but lives a different way; for example he was a great friend, generous and attentive, but he writes that friendship is a waste of time. Which is his true opinion? Probably not that friendship is a waste of time... But the point is that De Botton breathed life into parts of Proust I previously dismissed, including the last hundred pages where the narrator finally experiences the \\"how and why\\" of his life.I'm always a little suspicious of self-help books. Too often they're written by quacks and sometimes the advice they give can be dangerous. I'm also always open to good advice and De Botton showed to my surprise that Proust is full of genuinely helpful hints on how to live better. I bought How Proust Can Change Your Life because I was interested in Proust not because I wanted to change my life; the helpful hints are a fringe benefit.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Then, as a chocolate truffle comes at the end of a seven course meal and threatens to dissolve the wonders of all the complexities of taste that had come previously to the pallate, came Alain de Botton's How Proust Can Change Your Life--for, having been introduced to Proust, like M.

Take time and make effort in describing ideas slowly and in your original way and detail, \\"N'allez pas trop vite\\", Experience the actual reality, instead of \\"notion\\" of reality, with the example of impressionists (also had fun looking up all the paintings he loved.\\" I particularly liked the last chapter, \\"how to put books down\\" with his perspectives on reading \\"Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.\\" It was an easy read with delightful wisdom and wit."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Delightful read, a fine example of how to carry erudition lightly and convey it with authority and elegance. If you haven't read Proust, this will put you in appetite; if you have, it will help you refine your own insights and amuse you along the way. An impressive achievement."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I hate literary criticism. Few things make me bristle more than the thought of anonymous critics deconstructing classic works of literature and reshaping them to fit pre-constructed agendas. Alain de Botton, in his delightful, &quot;How Proust Can Change Your Life,&quot; proves that if a critic is a writer first, even the distatsteful act of criticism can sparkle. de Botton has a quirky conversational tone, seamlessly blending personal anecdote, biographical background, and literary wordplay (check out the swirling sentence in Chapter 3) to create the greatest possible result, making the reader want to revisit the always daunting Marcel and his brilliant &quot;Remembrance of Things Past.&quot; This is the greatest achievement a critic can hope for, and De Botton accomplishes it marvelously. This book is perfect."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"The book walks fine lines between biography and criticism, seriousnous and humor. It also achieves the odd combination of being a self-help book. Through Proust, and through the author's interpretation of Proust's life and writings, the reader is given some sage advice on a broad spectrum of topics. And it's funny. I laughed out loud at one point, which I don't often do when reading. Finally, it made me want to read Proust. It's an excellent book, and I highly recommend it"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Quirky. Quick read. Intriguing hybrid of self-help, biography, literary criticism, and philosophy. With chapter titles like: How to Read for Yourself, How to Suffer Successfully, and How to Be a Good Friend, I found myself wanting to take notes. That I'm ultimately seeking relationship advice from a \\"reclusive, mustachioed novelist not known for his interest in golf, tennis, or bridge (though he had once tried checkers, and twice aided in the launching of a kite), a man who spent the last fourteen years lying in a narrow bed under a pile of thinly woven woolen blankets writing an unusually long novel without an adequate bedside lamp\\" really says more about me, than it does about this book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I loved this book. It introduced me to Proust's life and works and so far, I have finished Volume I of In Search of Lost Time and have started on Volume II. The well crafted sentences and witty writing are a pleasureable introduction to Proust."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Reading Remembrance of Things Past in my 20's changed my life, (30 year's ago), so it was a pleasure to revisit the experience with this book. This delightful book is a paean to Proust slyly disguised as self help--with a few jabs to Proust's weaknesses, which is the best way to approach a masteripiece. Proust especially influenced my attitudes toward friendship. At an age when every quarrel meant the end of a relationship, Proust's view, which was from the end of his life, gave me frankly, a view of a life as a work of art, or at least a story that over time made sense."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I bought this book because of its title. I have always wanted to read \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" , but got discouraged because of its length.I thought this little volume would sort of distill the wisdom of the original work. I was wrong! The book contains bits and pieces about Proust's life and book.I found it somewhat boring and not helpful at all, but perhaps my dissappointment stems from having a different expectation from this book, that is emplied from a deceiving title."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book because, having never read Proust, I gleaned a lot of his ideas and philosophies. De Botton is a fabulous writer who effectively compares these lofty ideas with real tangible events in our lives.Great read."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"IF you want to know about Proust without reading him, this is a very fine book.

If you were suspicious of self-help, and thought it couldn't teach you anything, then this book will prove otherwise. It's packed with wise, humorous and genuinely insightful advice"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This &quot;not a novel&quot; can be advertised as a self-help book to the same extent that McDonalds can be advertised as a health-food store. You are left wondering in either case if it is just a joke that you did not get. Botton's attempt to compartmentalize Proust into a Happy Meal is certain to offend any thoughtful reader, whether he has ever read a word of Proust or not.Proust's life and his novel are worth learning about, even though it is debatable whether Proust's novel itself is worth reading. Those who have the misfortune of finding themselves trying to understand Botton's impenetrable writing might find a return to Proust easy going. Just to show us he is a regular guy, he even includes a picture of his girlfriend in his book. Issues, indeed!When others purport to explain art to you so that you can understand it, beware. If you want self-help, go read Proust himself or a diet book, or better yet, Walker Percy."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Someone told me last night that they were averse to starting Proust because they had read a 110-pagelife of Proust and his character was not the most admirable. I say, before consigning Proust to the dustbin, he might want to read this funny volume! I am not claiming to have read all of Proust, but some of it canbe a delight, like for example, the initialSwann's Way: In Search of Lost Time, Vol. 1 (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition), is I guess my favorite. I can't tell you which is the best edition and/or translation, though last night we were saying the older Montcrieff was good. You can read Botton's book whether you are ever going to read Proust or not and it'll be a blast. For a pre-Proust read, definitely Alain de Botton."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is a brilliant book. Written with great humour and understated but piercing intelligence, its a really enjoyable work that riffs off Proust with dazzling style. Enjoy this early work from one of Europe's rising literary stars."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"The reviews speak of wittiness and humor. While I have read fiction (&quot;High Fidelity&quot;, &quot;Keep the Change&quot;) and non-fiction (&quot;Culture of Complaint&quot; &quot;I'm Dysfunctional,You're Dysfunctional&quot;) which I have found intelligent and humorous, this was not one of those books. At no time did I laugh. While I did find parts entertaining, I give this book a lukewarm 3 stars."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This monograph on Proust is very enjoyable. Who would have thought that the Master's observations could be neatly paraphrased in a Self-Help format? And yet, here they are. De Boton should be commended for writing a book that is charming, witty, and, most important, lucid (how can one write about a book which seems to have said it all?) But his depiction of In Search of Lost Time is, in some ways, skewed; it's much EARTHIER than he makes it out to be. In the chapter, &quot;How to Open Your Eyes,&quot; for example, De Boton alludes to Proust's belief that great art can reawaken the senses, allowing us to perceive afresh &quot;the aroma of fresh asparagus,&quot; among other things. It is not, however, the smell of asparagus itself, but its scent in the narrator's urine which excites him: &quot;...all night long after a dinner of which I had partaken of [the asparagus], they played (lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare's Dream) at transforming my chamber pot into a vase of aromatic perfume.&quot; More troubling is the omission of the narrator's predilection for sadism, and Proust's homosexuality, which is given only a glancing treatment. I would suggest an additional chapter to Mr. De Boton: &quot;How to be a Good Bottom.&quot; It would include anecdotes about Proust's patronage of MALE prostitutes, passages from &quot;Cities on the Plain&quot; (&quot;By dint of thinking tenderly of men one becomes a woman&quot; is one of the more delicious ones), and drawings by Tom of Finland. I admire De Boton's book; it's great fun! But after putting it down, I felt slightly cheated: When will we get a biography of Proust that neither omits the less rarefied elements of his writing, nor whitewashes the &quot;unseemly&quot; aspects of his personal life? Proust's nonjudgmental depiction of sexuality was one of his most profound innovations. I would tell readers to enjoy this slightly superficial treatment, and then look forward to a serious biography, perhaps the one that ! author Edmund White is supposedly working on now. White is a more thoughtful writer, and probably won't insert a picture of his boyfriend, the way De Boton puts in his girlfriend (what was THAT about?) Overall, a strong 7. If you love Proust, you'll probably scarf it down, like I did, in an afternoon; but if you're looking for something more serious, just read Swann's Way."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"It's hard to imagine that anyone who has read this thing and liked it has also read Proust. It's scary to think too much about what kind of person would give this &quot;not a novel&quot; five stars--but never mind; I'll stick to the rules and discuss the book. For one thing, Botton can't write; grammatical, structural and usage errors pepper the pages. I'm sorry that I have room to point out so few. On p. 5 he mentions a writer who &quot;blithely declared his intention to devote himself to a final game of bridge, tennis and golf.&quot; Imagine that--all three rolled into one game; now that would be diverting indeed. B. does no better with parallelism on p. 9 where he notes that Proust's novel is a &quot;universally applicable story about how to stop wasting time and start to appreciate life.&quot; Mere quibbles, you may protest, but what about a &quot;writer&quot; who can't even make subject and verb agree? (p. 25: &quot;. . . there are a stream of extraordinary benefits attached.&quot;) And I defy anyone to understand the opening paragraph of Chapter 4: &quot;A good way of evaluating the wisdom of someone's ideas might be to undertake a careful examination of the state of their own mind and health. After all, if their pronouncements were truly worthy of our attention, we should expect that the first person to reap their benefits would be their creator. Might this justify an interest not simply in a writer's work but also in their life?&quot;Even if you make allowances for B's inability to use pronouns that agree with their antecedents, can you tell what the antecedents are supposed to be? And even if you get that far, the &quot;this&quot; in the last sentence has so many possible antecedents that any attempt at comprehension becomes impossible. Dangling phrases, misplaced modifiers, hopelessly-tangled syntax--B is master of them all. But enough. The careful reader, the astute reader, the kind of reader that it takes to read Proust will, if she or he cares to bother, find such howlers on every page of this not-a-book. As for the content, B seems to think that he invented the (sophomoric) notion that the characters in literature are to be &quot;identified with.&quot; He even goes so far as to include a photo of his girlfriend to show how much she looks like Proust's Albertine. Has the man no shame?You're either going to read Proust or you're not, but in either case Botton's whatever-it-is will add nothing to your understanding or appreciation. And while Proust may indeed change your life, you certainly don't need this puerile and pretentious collection of scraps to help you realize it. The thing starts to live up to its title only when its compiler quotes, summarizes or &quot;explains&quot; Proust's novel, but why should you listen to Botton's simplistic and anti-grammatical ramblings when you can have the enchanting experience of reading Proust's work itself?"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This book was a very interesting treatise on human characters, not to mention Proust himself. Makes a good companion for the novel that it references, In Search of Lost Time if I'm not mistaken. Though not an easy reading at times, it certainly is worth digesting. I do sympathize with Proust on how sick one can become from listening to other people speak in cliches. Even better was Alan's The Consolations of Philosophy."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"From being a bit of a science fiction junkie (because there was no sex in it) I've become a bit of a literature junkie. Joseph Conrad probably started it, but the non-SF novels of Philip K Dick had a big influence too. Gradually I've explored Turgenev, Huysmans, ETA Hoffman - as well as more traditional fare such as Dostoevsky, Eliot, Sands ..... (And the less traditional - Anna Kavan, WH Hudson, and so on). But not Proust.I'm not sure why I picked up 'How Proust Can Change Your Life' - perhaps I was looking for something - anything - that would change my life. I recognise that my view of Proust is entirely coloured by de Botton's view, but even so I am amazed at what I read. It's not that I think there is anything especially good about Proust - a battling, struggling individual who just happened to have a way with words - with lots and lots of them. But I do see so much of myself in Proust. And I can understand why some people don't get it: to see the world the way Proust did (as described by de Botton anyway). For example, to be free of the mask of familiarity that devalues so much of the - no, it's not beauty of the world although that's what de Botton calls it - it's the reality of the world. And yet, if what de Botton is describing is accurate, it is something I share with Proust. And, with that overwhelming view of the world, I can understand why so much of Proust's life was 'degraded', 'diminished', 'withdrawn' - scattered with bursts of escaping but having to return to the seclusion.Will I read Proust for myself? I am unsure if I can. I am unsure if I will be able to resist. If this book doesn't mean a lot to you on first reading, I suggest you read it again. It's not such a labour to do so. Keep an eye open for surprising views of things, and let me assure you that such sensitivities do exist - although I have no reason why.The one thing I would have liked with this book is a list of references. Since Proust wrote so much - where do de Botton's quotes come from. There are authors quoted too, without specific refernce to where the quote came."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I'm posting this on behalf of a friend:The book has such wide application. I think I benefited particularly, as a \\"writer\\" of sorts, from de Botton's discussion of the avoidance of cliche, of expressing yourself clearly, of NOT letting a great work of literature (or art, or music) paralyze your own voice. Then there were echoes, too, in the part on suffering successfully with some of what Dr. Timothy Johnson covered in that book my mom sent me.And perhaps because it's fresh in my brain, having read it just a matter of hours ago, I really enjoyed his assertion that there's folly in trying to soak up some sort of cosmic significance in monuments, historical sites, and other artifacts that artistic idolaters hold dear. How many times have I found myself at So-and-So's ancestral birthplace, or the site where Such-and-Such wrote his opus, and felt...absolutely nothing. Just a place. Just a house. And I always thought my lack of emotion was a consequence of my shallowness.Granted, I didn't agree with all of de Botton's conclusions (a stance of which I think Proust would approve), and was somewhat taken aback with his notions on friendship--I mean, what if I really DO want to know whether my poetry stinks or not? And sometimes, I felt as if he was weaving elaborate Proustian examples in order to illustrate some pretty basic points.But in all, even if de Botton didn't exactly change my life, I'm more prepared than ever to start \\"Swann's Way\\" and see if Proust can. (Seriously, I'm actually looking forward--with trepidation, mind you--to starting that thing. But the time! When will I find the time?!)"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is a very interesting look at Proust and his way of looking at things. One thing puzzles me though - the author stresses at one point not to fall into the trap of idolatry.

Previous examples of these particular experimental novels include Woolf's &quot;Orlando&quot;, Stein's &quot;The Autobiography of Alice B. Tolkas&quot; and Winterson's &quot;Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit&quot;. De Botton's narrative is an indication of an influenced by Proust De Botton, and, interestingly enough, there are moments in the book itself where one can actually visualize the two authors in conversation. What is it that we can learn from the Master's experiences that are not included in his opus? One thing I learnt was that even Virginia Woolf was so enthralled with Proust's work that she almost gave up writing. However, she held her head high and continued trying and then came up with &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot;. The book is in a DIY Acheive Happiness form, and what can be more refreshing today than that? My favorite chapter - in the sense that I have picked up something from it that will stay with me for life - is the &quot;How To Open Your Eyes&quot; chapter where De Botton points out that with a short story, Proust was trying to teach us an important lesson: namely, not to ascribe any value to the objects - tangible or non - that surround us but the _correct_ value. And in a world that tends towards superfluity and insatiability, what could be a better awakening?"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"It is a very fine text: it makes you laugh like hell and show you, really, how to enjoy life in front of Proust who was stocked in his bed. Unfortunatelly Alain de Botton does not writes about &quot;How to enjoy French music&quot;. He did not considered the so famous Sonata that Charles used to beleive he was in love.

The author's voice is like that of a perfect friend taking you through some issues you always wanted to think about but never quite got around to. Though the book is ostensibly (and in fact) about Proust, it's also about a thousand other things - why we read, why we fall in love, why we love nature, why we go travelling... It's a complete one-off, and a small masterpiece in my view. I've tried all of de Botton's other works. He's an up and down writer.

I knew these sorts of folks back in school. There is a word for them, but I can't mention it here.P.S.

Now that I've established my honesty and credibility, maybe I can say a few words about this book. Personally, I think the author wouldn't be such a bad fellow to know. I like the way he segmented the book and described relevant portions of Proust. I am a soldier and spend a lot of time in the field; currently in a part of the world which is undergoing an uneasy truce. I read whatever I can get my hands on and am tired of the muscle and skin magazines, car magazines, etc., which is the normal fare. When a book like this comes along, which is fairly easy to read and digest and more importantly, makes me want to attempt the real thing, then I don't think it's such a bad book and certainly not deserving of one or two stars. As for re-evaluating life's experiences, I hope that I can sit back one day and use a &quot;Proustian&quot; view to re-examine my current experiences; something which I have not been able to do as I've only been able to react.

I've read Proust, but it isn't necessary to have read him to love this book. In fact, this book makes a nice introduction to Proust, and if you wanted to fake having read Proust, this would be an enjoyable way to pick up enough information to do just that :-)This book is simply one of the loveliest meditations on reading and life, and how they intertwine, that I've ever read. It's not a book for people who don't like to read, but for anyone who DOES like to read, I think it would make a lovely gift. I gave it to myself, and I thanked myself for it very much."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This essay on Proust's life and on how and why to read him starts with the following beauty of a sentence: \`There are few things humans are more dedicated to than unhappiness.' Who can put down a book that starts thus? I can't. Why had I picked it up in first place? I saw it on my daughter's desk and was surprised that Proust was a part of her world. She agreed to lend it to me. I read it on the plane home. I think her education is not an entire failure. (She studies \`writing, publishing, and literature'.)\`How to open your eyes' is in my eyes the best chapter in the book and the one that comes nearest to capturing Proust's strengths. It relates to Proust's reception of arts, his infatuation with the impressionists, his devotion to the English art historian Ruskin, whom he actually translated into French (though he hardly mastered the English language at the outset; a friend said he would be unable to order a lamb chop in a restaurant.)Another chapter is called: How to suffer successfully. We suffer, therefore we think. (In longer words: we don't really know anything properly until there is a problem, until we are in pain, or until something fails. If we don't learn the hard way, it will not sink in.) Take your time, n'allez pas trop vite!See some more pearls found here: the greatness of works of art has nothing to do with the apparent quality of their subject matter. (People of \`taste' said about Proust that for a man of talent he had stupid tastes. He read newspapers with much patience and he could spend much time with trivia like rail schedules. We can see Romeo and Juliet, or Anna Karenina, or Madame Bovary grow out of newspaper stories on domestic tragedies.)How to be a better friend: this chapter taught me a new word that I will try to remember. To proustify, which leads to proustification, is the act of excessive exaggerated friendliness and flattering attention. Proust was aware of the antagonistic relation between friendship and truth, and he preferred to overdo it on the friendly side. Calling this hypocrisy is a distinct possibility. The man surely was a snob during phases of his life, but it seems that he overcame some of the worst excesses of it.The book confirms what I thought anyway: I need to go there again, to Proustland. Next time I must do it in French. (First I need to finish Zola's Rougon - Macquart though.)The author of this book was previously unknown to me, but seems to have quite a following. He is Swiss, but seems to have written in English. Some critical voices say that he states the obvious. Maybe, but isn't repetition the mother of learning?"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I've become more of a fan of Alain de Botton than of Proust, although this perceptive, wonderfully written book is making me reconsider picking up In Search of Lost Time. De Botton is what I imagine the ideal college professor being: he treats his subject with both wit and sympathy; he manages to find the most vivid and engaging examples without being gimmicky or verbose; and he ties together insights from so many disciplines (literature, psychology, philosophy, art, etc.). I recommend this for anyone who loves literature."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Upon the reccomendation of a friend I picked \\"How Proust Can Change Your Life\\" up, although I've read only excerpts of the first volume of \\"In Search of Lost Time\\". Not only do I find myself wanting to give Proust a more serious try, but I also find a desire to live my life differently. In fact, I think subtle changes are already taking place. It's not so much about changing your entire lifestyle as it is about changing how you see your life. According to de Botton through the filter of Proust, if we take a closer look at the details, put more effort into being interested rather than interesting, and use our trials as impetus for change or creativity, amongst other things, we will live a happier and more fulfilled life. This all sounds easy to say but hard to do. However, once you read this book you will realize just how simple it is. Artists must read \\"How Proust Can Change Your Life\\". And so should anyone else with a desire to get more out of every day."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is a very engaging and deft homage to Marcel Proust. Proust, rather than his immense novel (&quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; is de Botton's preference over the usual English title &quot;Remembrances of Things Past&quot;--he does not comment on whether &quot;The Sweet Cheat Gone&quot; is an improvement upon &quot;Albertine disparue&quot;) is generally the exemplar. I.e., the books is about what can be learned from the suffering author more than from the suffering narrator of his masterpiece. As filled with delights and profound lessons as the book is, I felt that De Botton evaded THE major question about transforming Proust's experiences of frustration in loving males into the narrator's experience of frustration in loving females. Because it is Proust rather than the fictional Marcel who is central, this is all the more crucial. Did the climate of repression of the time prevent Proust from writing from an openly homosexual perspective about life and love? De Botton is eager to accept Marcel's heterosexualization, even supplying a picture of his girlfriend (to prevent anyone thinking that so deep an immersion into the life and writings of a homosexual indicates the author is also one?). This is not merely a matter of identity politics. The possibilities of sex on a first meeting, to take one instance of what De Botton discusses, are (and were a century ago in France) different for male partners than for female ones. Still, De Botton's book is brilliant with many insights that are not compromised by not problematizing Marcel's heterosexual liaisons. I can't imagine a reader of Proust not finding passages to nod &quot;Yes, exactly&quot; and sections that will make her/him laugh aloud."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is another one of Botton's fine contributions to contemporary writing--a combination work of literary criticism and practical study of Proust's In Search of Lost Time. Having recently completed the first volume of Proust's novel, this book gave me a deeper insight into Proust's handling of such themes in the book as love and friendship. As in his books On Love and The Romantic Movement, Botton shines in his ability to sensitively express various aspects of love and its influence on relationships. He also does a fine job of using various Proustian plots to help the reader understand how to simplify a complicated world. For example, one of my favorite pieces in Botton's book is his comparison of Albertine to the Duchesse de Guermantes and their polar approaches to appreciating art and apparel. This differentiation, in turn, raises an awareness of the joy and fulfillment that can be achieved in being non-acquisitive when it comes to attaining one's desires. For anyone wanting assistance in seeking a more spiritual life, Botton's book is a gem"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is one of the most amusing and perceptive books I have ever read. De Botton manages to capture the essence of Proust and to provide a work that is utterly focussed and coherent. An admirable and skilful exercise. I cannot recommend it enough."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I have to appreciate Alain de Botton's graceful prose and neat (if somewhat arbitrary) categorizations of human problems. The title is more or less a joke--this is not liable to institute sweeping changes in your life, but may change your perspective on certain matters, which is more or less changing your life, I suppose. It made a very good before-bed book."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Unlike Marcel Proust, Alain de Botton does not beat around the bush! While Proust's ideas dance around the verbosity of the ordinary, I'm more impressed with Alain de Botton's lesson of understanding and appreciating the seemingly banal. As the director of a Philosophy department, Practical Philosophy might as well be Botton's specialty. His many books on similar topics are witty and fun musings into the nature of reality. His many works range from the abstractions of love to the joy of travel, and even the meaning of work! I recommend this and all his books."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Another fascinating book by Alain De Botton, and a book on a fascinating character. Amazing insights and suggestions into living in this world with topics as diverse as our relationships, being a good friend, expressing our emotions and what to get from reading. Made me want to launch (with some trepidation) into Proust's work."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"or do a professor of mine once told me. I did not even know where to begin, so I was glad to find this book. It gives a nice overview of Proust as a person and a literature and cultural studies icon. De Botton has the gift of making the complicated world of literary theory and philosophy approachable, enjoyable, and even funny!See my review of \\"The Consolations of Philosophy\\", another novie friendly piece of his."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I bought this book as an introduction to Proust. The author synthesizes Proust's philosophical perspective quite effectively while providing interesting background on the incongruities with the French author's actual life. I still intend to tackle Proust's novel this fall, but as a Virginia Woolf devotee, I was surprised to learn how much she was influenced by Proust. Wouldn't it be fascinating if they could have had a conversation? I understand Woolf was not overly impressed with Joyce who actually did meet Proust. I think Woolf's insights would have been astounding. I do recommend the De Botton book."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"It's amazing, I read this book years ago an still remember it very vividly. Philosophy is usually not my kind of thing, but Alain de Botton makes for a very enjoyable and entertaining read. I read all his books and found them to be absolutely fantastic. Can't wait for the next one..."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"There are few works of literary criticism that have touched me as much as this one. Botton brings a lightness of touch to the deepest ideas, and what shines through is how funny and observant he is. I had never read Proust, and I don't know if I will even now. It's wrong to read this book as some kind of guide to Proust - a dummy's guide. It's far more than that, or rather, it's not really interested in teaching something like for a college class. It feels like a personal, intimate book - where the author, via Proust, discovers some essential things. Buy it."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Like all the best books, this one has generated serious controversy: some people saying it's brilliant, others not seeing the point at all. I can see why one might not like it - hey not everyone can be the same - but this is going to go down in the history of lit.crit as a completely original and revolutionary work. Could not be more highly recommended."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I've never read Proust before, and never thought I ever would, but having read this delicious little gem, I think I will start straightaway. This book is deeply infused with a love of literature, and it communicates it brilliantly to the reader."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I found this book to be original and thought-provoking.For some reason, it evoked a similar state of mind to that which I experience while reading Iris Murdoch's &quot;Under The Net&quot;.It appears to be a light philosophical treatise, albeit disguised as light literary criticism. As such, it passes the essential test of practicality. I have found myself (mentally) referring back to certain passages when wondering what to do about this or that situation in my own life.I also found it to be very good fun to read.Time and re-reading often do strange things to books. So I am not prepared to come to a conclusion about &quot;How Proust Can Change Your Life&quot; until I have read it again in a couple of years' time. But I am already looking forward to doing so.Meanwhile, thanks Alain de B for a very unusual experience."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I admit that I have never read Proust. Having heard of the books collectively called &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;, I had also heard that they were quite long and involved. However, after reading this slim volume I believe I might pick up Proust's masterpiece. What struck me the most about this book is the ability of the author Botton to find those small snippets of prose which seem to speak the loudest. One of my favorite parts is the attack on hackneyed phrases used by authors to describe things like the &quot;shimmering moon&quot;. Proust argues that by reducing complex thought to such a rote phrase, man looses to ability to see the true object and make his own observations. I have actually started to apply this to my own life. I try to look at objects I see everyday and think how I could describe this.I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone with an interest in not only Proust but on the effect of literature on our lives."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Yes, don't go so fast...stop, savor and enjoy the many extraordinary pleasures of the ordinary things which are strewn around your everyday life.This gem of a book is filled with these kind of delightful bon-mots distilled from Proust's life and works. Alain De Botton's entertaining,educating and often illuminating book belongs to a unique genre. It is is part literary criticism, part exploration of Proust's life and work and a part self-help manual.I gained a lot of perspectives from this book, on topics as varied as\\"How to read for myself\\" to \\"How to be a better friend\\". This book also opened up two interesting authors for me ...Marcel Proust and am now itching to read his oeuvre as well as Alain De Botton's body of work (especially his treatise on architecture)I am sure i will go back to this book from time to time for a dose of some witty and well articulated \\"life lessons\\"."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I just finished reading Swann's Way, and was sure that that would be the beginning and the end of my reading of Proust, at least for now. But then I found this book. It's written in a tone half-serious and half-tongue in cheek, and manages to be both reverent to Proust and damning of his &quot;reputation&quot; as difficult, dense, overlong, and too damn philosophical to be entertaining. Its breaking up of Proust's great (and his trivial) themes into easy-to-handle morsels and &quot;morals&quot; is frequently hilarious and always pointed and accurate. (The last sentence in particular made sense to me, having just spent 2 hours struggling to read the last 40 pages of Swann's Way...)But the greatest praise I can give this book is that, because of it, I am going to buy In a Budding Grove this weekend. Great stuff, highly recommended, especially for those unsure if they wish to read more than one volume of Proust. (It may be a little less appreciated by those who have never read any Proust, but it is still entertaining and may convince you to pick up the book itself.)"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"A reviewer wrote- &quot;I'ts hard to imagine how Proust can change your life if you don't actually read Proust&quot;. That is true, but then on the other hand, never, while reading this book, did I get the impression that Alain de Botton was trying to replace Proust. I don't think he was trying to offer a guide to Proust, nor trying to write literary criticism or anything like that: After finishing the book, the impression I got was that this is more a self-help book (and quite a witty and funny one, actually, much better than the usual saccharine-sweet self help books) and less a book about Proust. The good thing is that &quot;How Proust can change your life&quot; will probably give you an appetite for more Marcel Proust...and that has to do with the clarity and lightness of touch with which de Botton writes: you can't resist his admiration for Proust, even though you might have objections to the way he chose to express this admiration: but then who says that books about philosophy or about literature have to be dead serious and heavy? I think Alain de Botton has written an original book, a book that's a kind of experiment, as it combines self-help insights with good literature and important ideas. If you read this as such, as an interesting experiment which may bring more people to Proust, then you won't really be able to find any fault in the book."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"How Proust Can Change Your Life is an easy read and its themes ambulate like John Cleese in The Flying Circus, however their target is always met with utmost accuracy. This is a rich and insightful book. What could have been an incomprehensible abstract mosaic turns out to be a triumphant effort to bring together Proust's eccentric life with his prolific writing. De Botton is able to touch on the paradoxical nature of humanity, alluding to the ambiguities of one of the greatest western novelists. De Botton's work is not a proscriptive self-help book. It is an account of a man struggling with life's triumphs and toils. It is a revealing account of Proust's struggles and the literature he produced as a result. De Botton never tells the reader how to deal with pain or loss, rather, he reads into his subject's life and humourously analyzies Proust's psyche. This is not an attempt to extemporize a pschology or philosophy that will enable us to deal with our vexing personal problems. It is a cogent attempt to open our minds to those problems and ambuguities that we may feel are abnormal, making them more normal. It is an intransigent work that is sanguine and lucid. A book full of irony and humor that I have read cover to cover and still pick up for a good laugh and pick-me-up. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I know I'm in the minority,but I simply could not stand this book. In fact, I resisted reading it for many months, but friends finally talked my into it. I wish I had held my ground.de Botton is certainly right about one thing: Proust can definitely change your life. He's changed mine. I just don't think anyone's life will be changed in the manner in which de Botton suggests.How Proust Can Change Your Life is meant to amuse, but I found it more than mildly irritating. Had de Botton been a better writer I suppose I would have been amused, or, conversely, had Proust been a lesser writer, I might not have been irritated, but as it is....Non-Proust fans will probably not understand the gist of this book. Proust fans will be able to correctly second guess de Botton every time. Thus, either way you look at it, the fun is spoiled. It might serve as an introduction to someone who wants to read Proust but finds the genuine article a bit daunting, but I do have my doubts. I think those who enjoy this book haven't read and studied Proust...in depth.I do have something positive to say...it is obvious that de Botton has read and studied Proust. Why he chose to mock this great author in this manner is simply beyond me. Proust was never meant to be cute and sweet as de Botton attempts to be. And he certainly never meant to degenerate into self-help.I love Proust. He is one of my alltime favorite authors. Read Proust, by all means, but read the genuine article. You'll come away far, far more enriched."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is probably the most approachable and happiest work on Proust ever written. It's a small book and easy to read, yet holds some nice surprises and insights. Some of the harsher reviews, I think, find fault with it for not being what it was never meant to be.At only 200 pages, with plenty of illustrations and blank spaces, it's no substitute for reading Proust, and it's not intended as a scholarly monograph. A few found the title deceptive, and were disappointed to discover it is not a self-help book.If you've read any of de Botton's other books, then you know he's intelligent, informed, cocky, irreverent and witty. Really an entertaining writer. He's also conceited, and probably speaks better French than most of his readers, which is always enraging, and if anyone wants to give him a one-star for that, I can certainly understand it.If you have a somber veneration for Proust, believe me, de Botton's flippant style is going to make you reach for the anti-acid tablets. Still, there is an absurd side to Proust's life, as Proust himself saw, and to be fair, de Botton reminds the reader, that as in the case of the artist Elstir, it was Proust's whole life, the grotesque as well as the sublime, that brought his art to bloom.Despite his flashy erudition de Botton makes grammar errors that would have sent Proust to Cabourg for his nerves. After awhile you wonder if the author doesn't purposely salt those in now and then just to give the book \\"sprezzatura\\" -- a kind of artistic nonchalance.I've read Proust, and about Proust, more than I have any author but Dickens, and I still found much I didn't know, lots of it trivia (Proust's phone nunber) but also fresh thoughts and new ways of looking at Proust's life and work. The book is meant to be fun, so take it for what it is. I'm glad I made time to read it."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"A specific theme is explored from a variety of perspectives in many of de Botton's books, including ~Proust~, and that is, how to successfully respond to the vagaries of life. These vagaries and pre-occupations include the pursuit of love, happiness and, most importantly, how to make use of suffering, how to learn from the inevitable pain that this life will bring to some. However, what is it that makes de Botton's advice more palatable than the common spewing from your garden-variety self-help manual? Apart from his user-friendly writing style, it's his approach, his unique way of interpreting great works of philosophy and literature, and re-moulding age-old notions into workable methods of application to the personal and everyday.The key, I believe, to fully appreciating what this particular text has to offer, is to understand Proust's various responses to the world - what I like to call his inner-worldliness. It is well known, of course, that Proust was not a 'worldly' man in the common sense of the term, but worldly in that vast terrain known as the imagination. In fact, this gentle and fragile writer, most of his short life, rarely stepped out of his bedroom, let alone transverse the expanses of Europe. Proust's gift was the uncanny ability to observe something as apparently mundane as a pocket watch or a scrap of bed linen, and through a mental process of rich association, create new and meaningful experiences. What Proust taught us through his voluminous works, which de Botton points out, is what we all too often take for granted, ironically, has the potential to give us what we need.~How Proust can Change your Life~ is one of those texts that you can pick up after lunch and finish before dinner, yet the contents and practical wisdom should remain with you for a long time."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Alain de Botton has done what many may believe to be impossible-- he has found a lucrative use for philosophy. Okay, maybe he isn't the first one, but he certainly has done a good job of it. His style of prose is addictive-- de Botton is witty and light while still maintaining a level of profundity and intellect. The book certainly does not read like an academic monologue, but one comes away from it with something of the feeling of having partaken in something intellectual and educational. In addition, the pictures and drawings that pepper the pages will often make you smile. I came to it without previous knowledge of Proust; nevertheless I was able to appreciate it quite a bit. (At times I longed for footnotes so that I could pursue a deeper study of Proust, but it isn't that sort of book). Beginning with &quot;How to love life today&quot; and ending with &quot;How to put books down,&quot; de Botton does an excellent job of relating the work of Proust to our everyday lives. De Botton has an instinct for understanding human behavior and enjoys deconstructing it with the tools of philosophy. Read it and enjoy; reflect on the content, and it might well do some good."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Alain de Botton knows how to delve into subjects that really matter. He is a genius who certainly knows what he's talking about. There are self-help books that aren't, well, very helpful. How Proust Can Change Your Life isn't one of them.Step by step, de Botton guides the reader into the realm of self-improvement. There are chapters like &quot;How to Suffer Successfully&quot; -- a chapter that, despite its ironic title, helps deal with personal problems and unexpected circumstances. Also, there is a short autobiographical portrait of Marcel Proust -- the author that influenced this book.I cannot fully attribute the incredible work of this book to Proust, but it is evident that he had something to do with it. One thing is certain though: Alain de Botton is a genius! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Not that De Botton needs my 5 stars, he seems to be a power force of his own. But I just closed this book and loved it from start to finish. It was witty, intelligent, joyous and very very much made me ready to go read the MAN. He achieved something miraculous for a frightened self-taught reader, he welcomed me into the world of Proust. For that I doff my cap."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I have read several titles by this particular author and have NEVER been disappointed. I studied for a PhD in literature and psychology in my youth. This sort of analysis of Proust is a gem for modern life -- and a guide to appreciating Proust's world as well. Many of Proust's eccentric habits were doubtless \\"self-inflicted\\" but the reader will confront how complicated the requirements of his society were at the time. My first exposure was \\"On the Art of Travel.\\" This is NOT a \\"Rick Steves\\" sort of volume with suggestions of places to visit and how to spend less money doing it. It is a first class analysis of what makes us WANT to travel and of what rewards our psyches achieve from it.Whether you beg, borrow or buy, this author will be a consistently valuable addition to your lifetime reading list."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"At first, I thought I needed to have read (at least some of) In Search of Lost Time to understand it. But actually, I think this book will help me better comprehend and absorb Marcel Proust's masterpiece. I loved the comparisons and funny remarks. I'll definitely by rereading this (and buying Swann's Way!)."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"I have never read Proust and this is the first book I've read by Alain De Botton. I am now intrigued by Proust as it seems he had some interesting things to say about everyday life and the problems which beset us all. Falling in love, friendship and putting books down among other subjects are covered in this interesting little book.As well as receiving some useful life advice such as listening to your friends rather than insisting on telling them about yourself and your concerns; I formed a vivid picture of Proust himself. I liked the way he moved round the table when he held dinner parties so that each of his guests received his undivided attention for a time. Yes he was a hypochondriac and valetudinarian but he was also a good friend and has many useful things to say about friendship.It seems from reading this book that Proust's epic novel concentrates on everyday happenings as demonstrated by the famous madeleine incident. I particularly enjoyed the chapter about not taking your own views from famous authors but using them as jumping off points to establish what you yourself think. Read books but don't take them as absolute truths - think for yourself as well.I thought it was interesting that Virginia Woolf felt her own work was no good at all after reading Proust as she thought he had written the perfect novel and there was no point in anyone writing anything else. Overall this is an interesting book as it is a mixture of biographical information about Proust himself and a dissection of some of his writing. If you're wondering about reading Proust but are wary of dipping a toe in the water then this would be a good place to start."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"If you have considered reading this book, you are probably aware of who Proust is, but I honestly knew little about him before reading this book. I've been on a French author reading kick for, oh, five months or so, and I've had this book in my TBR for quite some time, so this was a must-read for me.The question is, then, How? And, importantly, Can He?The answers read like a how-to-be-happier self-help guide, but this book is not of that genre; this book is actually a book of literary criticism, oddly. Reading Proust can change your life by teaching you to focus on slowing down, relishing, thinking, reading thoughtfully, and your senses.That's the How. Now for the Can He.I say yes. Of course I do. I am a librarian, for goodness sake. Of course Proust can change your life. I'm of the opinion that all books can and do."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Short and sweet, as most of this writer's works are (in strong contrast to Proust!). This is an interesting book which gives some insight into Proust, but, as usual, more into Boton. It's not his best writing, but very good. Enough to make you want to at least scan Swann's Way again."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Listening to the audio edition helps greatly in bringing these words to life. This volume is separated into three CDs, each unique to one another. CD1 starts out as sort of biography of Marcel Proust, largely explaining his physical frailties and the unlikely codependent family environment which spawned a genius. While listening/reading through this first part, you may wonder what exactly is inspiring about Proust's life. It is largely due to Proust's physical afflictions that we are allowed the pleasure and depth of his reflections. He always insisted that suffering could serve as a lesson, provided one was able to recognize it as so. By his bed-ridden isolation, he was allowed to scratch the depths of the human soul. This is made clearer as we move on to CD2.Here, the author shares Proust's advice on friendship. Surprisingly, Proust thought it best to learn of another person's interest, and mainly talk about them when in their company. His conversations were often less than intellectual, but this served to keep his friendships warm rather than coldly cerebral. We later learn that this won him many friends. His intellectualizations, the author shares, were largely done while he was alone, and/or writing to someone else. He considers that talk is useless, but nevertheless indulged others and always interacted in a kindly way, as he was motivated at being remembered for being a nice and generous person towards others. Proust also talks about the nature of romantic relationships and suggests that delaying gratification is the way to extend the feeling of being in love. By having a woman maintain the uncertainty of being physically intimate with a man, she prolongs the chase, so to speak, and promotes further desire in her partner. It is only through force of habit, namely co-habitation, that intimacy can expect to be lost. The author then goes into a Q & A with Proust answering a series of practical questions on the problems of intimacy.CD3 talks about one's relationship with a book. The author shows us that Proust praised the value of books only in their ability to awaken a person's spiritual life. His basis was that exploring another writer's thoughts was a way to enable the person to explore their own inner world, through questions and points shared by a given author. I always had a sense that fine literature was a way towards transcendence. Proust demonstrates this beautifully through his words. We are warned of the dangers of books, in that the author could be mistaken for an oracle of sorts, that could potentially make the reader miss the point of exploring their own inner depths, at the expense of glorifying an author.The book concludes that while Proust is remembered for his details of observation in the human condition, we should not forget to practice this skill in our own lives. After all, imitation is the highest form of praise."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"This is De Botton at his erudite best. An insightful, witty and intelligent book. It's a quick read unlike Proust and the great thing is you do not even have to have read Proust to appreciate it. De Botton is a marvellous writer and disects Proust's work in an ingenious manner. Throughly recommended."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"One of the biggest reasons for melancholy in my life is having already read Proust's Recherche: I can't have again the pleasure of reading it for the first time. Therefore the book by Alain de Botton was a great experience. It allows you to read again Proust without re-reading the novel. I recommend this book to all those who feel melancholy when they see the already read volumes of the Recherche on their shelves. Jos&eacute; M G&oacute;mez. Spain."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Well, it won't on its own, I must warn you silly, avid self-help devotees. I do love the idea of a Frenchman following in the footsteps (or ironically appearing to) of so many self-help writers. This is strictly an American genre, and it's amusing to see the European version. It's better by far, needless to say. I'll take De Botton over say, Dr. Wayne Dyer, for example. One starts with quality literature, the other ends with wonderfully hopeless psych-homilies.Anyway, the book does a service if it effectively points you away from itself and onward to Proust. Proust will save us all."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"And those of my friends, to whom I lent them.

I was not impressed with the flimsy essense that de Botton derives from Proust's work. The concept that original observation requires self editing and avoiding stereotypical labeling and categorization is not new news. The concept that reading allows us to reflect on our own circumstances and experiences is also not new news. The third theme that the best artists observe the world in a unique way, allowing others to appreciate their vision and possibly develop a vision of their own was the last straw for me. There are some adolescents with limited life experiences that may find this book of interest. For a more experienced reader, go to the source itself, not this weak distillation."},{"Title":"How Proust Can Change Your Life: Not a Novel","review":"Someone writes, &quot;I have read Proust, thank you very much.

Regarding: &quot;I haven't bothered to proof-read this message for grammatical or spelling errors, so feel free to criticize these at will, if it helps distract you from the actual content of the message.&quot; Criticizing grammatical errors in an amateur review (mine, for example) is very different from criticizing them in a published book. If the reviewer below who finds them in this book has quoted it accurately, that is reason enough to avoid this book or to review it unfavorably.

The 3G part is not just WCDMA (or UMTS) but also the CDMA2k. A book covering all these subjects could be thousands of pages, and Ian Poole did it in less than 200. Impressive.It started good! The first four chapters cover the real basics of cellular communication. The authors finds a balance between the detail and the overview. I was impressed by the start... except for the writing style. The style was very 'engineering' and felt the book could use some additional editing. That would make it easier to read.In chapter five (analogue systems), the speed increases a bit, but still relative easy to follow. Chapter six covers the GSM standard. Here, I felt the author was going way too fast and covers too much details. Any beginning reader would be lost by the short explanation of the radio channels and their acronyms. Additional pictures of how calls would be set-up would really improve the book, but they are not there. I've got a background in GSM and could still follow, if I wouldn't, I would be lost. And...Chapter seven/eight covers NA TDMA and cdmaOne. The author continues with the amount of detail he used in the earlier chapter. Giving the names of all radio channels, frame formats, but doing it such a speed that its really hard to follow. The same was true for the CDMA2k and UMTS (WCDMA) chapter: too much detail, too little overview, too fast, too much 'engineering' writing.I found chapter eleven (position location) interesting again, it went in a slower speed. The final chapter (12) covers conformance and IOT, but I couldn't understand why this chapter was included in this book. It seems to not fit there at all! It could better have been removed.All in all, I find the idea of this book good, the start was good, but then the author was kind-of lost. I wasn't sure anymore whether the book was for beginners (chap 1-4) or for people who have more of a telecom background (chap 5-10).Conclusion. I wouldn't recommend this book as an overview book to people new to the subject. Instead, better pick up one technology and read that (e.g. the excellent GSM Networks from Gunnar Heine). This book is a good overview of the different standards though, if you are looking for that, then this is an option. Good... but not great."},{"Title":"Cellular Communications Explained: From Basics to 3G","review":"Good overview of cellular operations.

Ward leads the reader through the LSAT, the law school application, classes, law school exams, the bar exam, and first attempts to find a job. Particularly fun are Ward's depictions of law students by type, complete with photographs.What makes this book funny, of course, is that there is a ring -- and a bite -- of truth to what Ward writes. His humor might go over the head of new or prospective law students, but anyone who has been through at least one set of law-school exams should appreciate it.If you started law school out as an idealist and you're now an embittered cynic, this is the book for you. If you started out in law school but ended up in truck-driving school, Ward will remind you that you may have come out ahead. And if you're the spouse or partner of a law student and you're sick of law students, this book will serve as good entertainment during the next (boring) law school party.

Examples include unexplained symbols (symbols on charioteer's belt, the fool's clothings, and many others), desciption of the emptress being 'virgo intacta', etc.- Some of the cards' descriptions contradict, or at least appear to contradict, the pictures on the cards.- Waite borrows a lot from earlier writers, but then goes on to pass criticism on his sources and belittles them.So the book has to be read very carefuly, criticaly, and with a lot of patience. And those who do so *will* gain - the book is better than many of the instant tarot reading guides, giving truer and deeper information from the horse's mouth.I suggest people to read this book, but *not* as the first book on the deck, and preferably along with other material (e.g. books about the golden dawn, tarot history, or symbolism)."},{"Title":"PICTORIAL KEY TO THE TAROT","review":"While Waites influence and authority in the esoteric world is without question, and equally without question is the massive influence he had on the art and practise of tarot, this book is not his finest work.'Pictorial Key' is tolarable as a simple catalogue of meanings (which now can be got at any number of web pages) and gives a simple spread it is deviod of any real explination of why and wherefore. It does not explain the principles underlying the construction of the tarot and the practical results that come with the understanding of those principles. I would even go as far as to say that Waite deliberatly obscured and provided misleading information, prehaps in order to keep his obligations of secrecy to the G.D. or his own Order.As a practical beginners text I would say look elsewhere for clearer texts that have expanded and illustrated what Waite has published in 'Pictorial Key'. For more advanced folk I would say the 'Pictorial Keys's best application would be to bury it in peat for several hundred years, dig it up and use it to light a fire. I gave it a rating of three purely for its historical importance. To rate it on a scale of usefulness would be to rate it several points lower."},{"Title":"PICTORIAL KEY TO THE TAROT","review":"Rating this one is difficult. The rich symbolism of Tarot was forever impacted by the Order of the Golden Dawn, and A.E. Waite's &quot;Pictorial Key&quot; is a glimpse into that symbolism. Readers with a serious interest in occult Tarot will find this an essential text. Waite, though, considered himself bound by vows of secrecy, and mixes misinformation and blinds in his work to lead the &quot;uninitiated&quot; astray, so reading critically is a must. To make matters worse, his prose style is ponderous and leaden, deliberately overcomplicated and abstruse, less animated than Al Gore. However, modern tarot decks borrow and adapt from the Waite-Smith deck design; to understand the symbolism that underlies almost every deck on the market today (frequently symbolism the deck designers had no awareness of), this book is absolutely necessary. It won't be a fun read, but it *is* necessary"},{"Title":"PICTORIAL KEY TO THE TAROT","review":"I got this book along with the Universal Waite deck. I was interested in the original book that A.E.Waite published along with his now-famous deck of cards.What I find interesting is that Mr. Waite states quite clearly that the Tarot never had any origins in Egypt, nor is it associated with other doctrines such as Astrology, Numerology or Kabbalah. His writing style is, at best, witty and sarcastic. He gives us the meanings of the cards (at face value) and leaves us to figure out the rest.Of course, Tarot has undergone several changes and has had several associations with all the abovementioned doctrines. The meanings have gone through a radical change; and correctly so, since all associations with the cards pictures and archetypes must change over time.All in all, it is a wonderful book for someone who is interested in the roots of Tarot - especially connected to his deck - which forms the basis for anyone who is interested in learning the Tarot.On a more personal note: I like the wit and sarcasm of Mr. Waite.

That deck has, since 1910, become one of the most widely accepted and used decks of Tarot cards. The clarity and simplicity of this book accounts for much of that popularity.This Pictorial Key to the Tarot, by Arthur Waite of the Rider-Waite-Smith deck, was conceived to explain the complex symbolism in the pictures on that deck drawn by Pamela Coleman-Smith under Waite's direction and then published by Rider. In 1910, Waite's interest was standardizing the Tarot deck, justifying his scholarship, and explaining the symbolism for Tarot readers whom, he would assume, already broadly understood the cards' meanings. His assumption is that the (new or newly pictured) symbols rise from the meaning of the cards and his readers probably know the meanings.Today, beginners benefit from over 100 years of refinements by a large number of authors whose works follow Waite's original book. There are, therefore, MUCH better books for beginners. I teach novice readers using Sarah Bartlett's excellent Tarot Bible.If you are a serious student of the Tarot it is always helpful to return to the source and this is it. Therefore, I recommend this book for advanced readers and students as an important reference book to include in their Tarot library."},{"Title":"PICTORIAL KEY TO THE TAROT","review":"A.E.

There are many better books on the the subject of How to Study The Tarot, but this is a good Beginner's lesson. So many people try to make the Study of Tarot a &quot;cut &amp; dry&quot; issue (i.e., &quot;this is the way it is....&quot;)--however, in actuality, it is a life-long process of Study, Experiment, and Collection of Knowledge.

Arthur Waite was a master of the arcane and a famous person and Golden Dawn member from its heyday in the late 1800s and early 1900s. You could get this book just as a sampling of the greatness of the author Mr. Waite and the occult mastery he stood for. But as a referance for his own masterpiece the Rider Waite tarot it is indespensible and thee source for more information on the cards other than that given in the instruction booklet. The beginning of the book is a history of the tarot cards and then the meanings of the cards with pictures of each individual card. The meanings of the cards themselves take up one page each and the picture of each card also takes up one page each. As for the ease of reading, I would say if you can go to at least a division III university and pass English 101 or any other English class numbered 100 or higher, you could read almost anything. The thing about these books available for enjoyment that you can buy at bookstores is they don't use very big words, just technical information as it pertains to the sibject. Something like the 4 of cups if you didn't have a previous knowledge of tarot that might confuse someone. They do not use geeky versions of words, for example the word hate they would not use in a published book the word \\"animosity\\" as a synonym for the word hate.

[no. 315])","review":"This is not for anyone!This book is written in 1830s and marks the Egypt of that time. People who aim at reading about \\"Egypt\\" should know that reading a book about an early 19th century Egypt, is not going to inform them about today's Egypt.This said, the book is a remarkable anthropological work that records in amazing details the everyday life of Egyptians in the 1830s. This of course is a time of change for Egypt. Mohammad Ali, the Viceroy of Egypt is already sending young Egyptians to study European sciences to come back to \\"Modernize\\" Egypt according to western standards. Within 30 years of the publication of this book, Egypt was transformed into a totally westernized island in the Middle East (which came with the horrible consequences of the British colonization of Egypt in the 1880s).This book observes Egypt before the change.The book is filled with drawings by Lane in which he records with an amazing eye for detail, every little aspect of the Egyptian way of life. The women's attire and men as well; the different classes, the traditions, celebrations, religions, different Sufi sects, political views, and music. I myself being a native speaker of Arabic, am very amazed by Lane's ability to not only learn Arabic but to be able to record with so careful an ear for detail, the different accents of Egyptian and to also write down the lyrics of many of their songs.This book is often cited by Orientalists and is looked at carefully by Edward Said in his 1978 book Orientalism.To read this book, one has to also read Edward Said's Orientalism afterwards to look at how Edward W. Lane is like many other Orientalists, relying on stereotypes to assert stereotypes.I repeat again, that this book is not for anyone. It is only to be enjoyed by specialists who wish to know more about early 19th Century Egypt, and those who study the history of Orientalism."},{"Title":"Reading and Writing in the Time of Jesus (Biblical Seminar)","review":"As anyone interested in ancient history knows, all the ancient libraries, like the fabulous library of Alexandria with its reputed 500,000 roles, have vanished. \\"The major Greek and Latin texts we possess today are copies of copies, almost all from the Middle Ages\\" (p 19). Only a few precious papyrus fragments are left, and most came from rubbish heaps in Egypt where the dry heat contributed to their survival. Tragically, most of the books written in Roman times have vanished forever.Also we can't even figure out what percentage of the population was literate. Scholars have come up with wildly varying guesses--ranging from a low of 5% to 50%.Milland does an impressive job capturing every shred of evidence he can to answer the problem. He not only lists all the evidence, he also supplies pictures, making this book invaluable to anyone interested in the subject.I can't think of another book quite as thorough. And it has lots of pictures, so you can judge items yourself.One surprising place where he finds evidence for multilingualism among Jews is at Masada. \\"It is on the ostraca and labels on jars...There are ostraca in Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew, to indicate...which...was ritually pure\\"(p 136). Clearly, \\"On Masada there were people who could use three scripts and write in three languages\\"(p 138).Indeed, the Jews may have been the most literate group in the Roman empire. They shared a strong tradition of education and thought that, in theory at least, every man should be able to read from the scriptures in synagogue. We do know that Simon ben Shetach, in about 100 BC, said that every child was to attend school.What about the rest of the empire? Some scholars argue that only a few of the wealthy were truly literate. Yet we have \\"graffiti from Pompeii, made by a fuller, a weaver, and other craftsmen\\" (p 155) not to mention the Roman habit of putting placards everywhere (such as on top of the cross of Jesus Christ) that would suggest a far greater number of peoplecould read.One very interesting section concerned the possible way that the gospel was written. Many people carried note-books which they \\"carried for their day-to-day business, perhaps hung at the belt\\"(p 223) where they have have noted any striking sayings of Jesus.Altogether, an outstanding book on the subject. No one interested in literacy in the ancient world should be without this."},{"Title":"Reading and Writing in the Time of Jesus (Biblical Seminar)","review":"One of the mysteries of Christianity is the lack of proof that Jesus ever existed. Most of what we rely on is found in the New Testament, none of which was penned during Christs lifetime. Pauls letters to various Christian groups around the Middle East were written about twenty years after Christs death and Paul never met Christ while He was alive. The four Gospels all appear to date to after 70 A.D., and it is unlikely that they were written by writers who ever met Jesus. So, all of our main writings about Christ are second hand accounts.This begs the question of why Jesus followers werent furiously taking notes while He was alive. Had Christ arrived today, he would have easily entered peoples diaries, emails, newspaper articles, magazine profiles, police crime reports, probably even some television broadcasts. In short, anyone who was making this much of an impact on even a small number of people would have created a paper trail. Indeed, in Brooklyn right now, a Jewish sect called the Lubavitchers are furiously debating whether their latest rebbe, who died in 1994, is really a Messiah who will return from the dead. That debate is creating a big paper trail. Was life so different in Jesus time that no one took notes? Were diaries unknown? Why didnt the Romans, a bureaucratic state with a paper obsession, at least record some details of Jesus death?One possible answer to this mystery is provided by Alan Millard's book, Reading and Writing in the Time of Jesus. Millard has studied the state of literacy and writing in the first century and beyond in Judea. Much of his evidence is fragmentary - pieces of broken pots were used as scrap 'paper' during this period, showing that non-scholars often wrote down messages to each other. Erasable wax tablets shaped like books were often used on the job for writing down accounts and ledgers. The weekly services at the Jewish synagogues required the men to be able to read from the scared scrolls. Millard concludes that literacy certainly existed among common Jews, so there's no reason to believe that Christ's memory could only be handed down orally.The problem, Millard argues, is that so little written material of any kind has survived the ravages of decay. There is precious little original documents written by Roman officials from first century Judea, Millard argues, so we shouldn't be surprised at the dearth of letters and messages describing Christ's actions. Lots of people could have been writing down their impressions of this new Jewish teacher, without any of it having survived. Indeed, Millard argues that the few documents we have from this period come from the arid deserts of Egypt, where the environment preserved scrolls written at this time. Moisture, and the constant recycling of written material, may be the prime culprits for the absence of additional written evidence of Christ's life.(...)"},{"Title":"Reading and Writing in the Time of Jesus (Biblical Seminar)","review":"I was very interested in the topic, and the book provides the information, but it is not an easy read.

The most helpful thing about this book is that you realize that EVERY generation has noisy advocates of one style of parenting or another, and you see the swing from discipline to leniency and back again. As Hardyment points out, a thorough study of centuries of childcare advice shows that whatever advice is given has \\"science\\" to back it up, and will almost certainly be overturned by new \\"scientific\\" research. So, do what the \\"experts\\" do - read the research, then come to your own decision based on what makes sense to you and works with your circumstances. There is no \\"one right way\\" to parent, and the vast majority of children turn out just fine, despite the many different ways they are raised. Ultimately, YOU are responsible for your parenting decisions, and this book is designed to reassure you that you will do just fine using your own intellect and intuition, regardless of what \\"experts\\" may try to make you believe.A drawback to this book is that the author tends to jump back and forth in her quotes of authors, which I sometimes found confusing because I felt the authors hadn't been identified sufficiently in the beginning. And sometimes she skips briefly over topics I would be interested in knowing more about.

Stonehouse's full-scale portrait is a vivid and inspiring picture of a Christian of apostolic ardor who, at his untimely death in 1937, was called \\"the first Protestant minister in the nation.\\" Acknowledged by his critics and admirers alike as the greatest leader of the whole cause of evangelical Christianity in modern times, Machen raised the intellectual acuteness of Protestant orthodoxy to a point where observers such as H. L. Mencken and Walter Lippmann claimed that in the religious debates of the twenties and thirties, the liberals had yet to answer him.Writing out of the experiences of more than seven years of intimate asociation with Machen and a wealth of sources which reveal completely the mind and heart of this learned and valiant spiritual warrior, Stonehouse tells the complete Machen story: the childhood years, the student days at Princeton under Warfield and Patton, the years abroad at the universities of Marburg and Gottingen, and again in 1918-19 in France and Belgium, Machen's books, his deep attachment to his remarkable mother, his cultural pursuits and love of literature, and the historic controversies at Princeton which led to his reorganization of that seminary, and to the founding of Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, in which Machen played a leading role.Dr. Stonehouse's biography is a perceptive and illuminating account which reveals in Machen, warmly and personally, both the man and the scholar; and, becaue of Machen's weighty influence over the ecclesiastical world of his time, is an intimate history of the twentieth century evangelical struggle.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Mastering Coreldraw 8","review":"I picked up this book in my local bookstore, opened the book at random in two separate places and learned something I didn't know instantly, both times.

The book here is another example of poor design that want to earn quick buck. I trully feel sorry that DRAW has such a miserable field presentation in comparison with Photoshop or Painter but I am begining to believe that is the case because the software itself is inferior."},{"Title":"Azerbaijan (Cultures of the World)","review":"I am not aware of the content of the book, but I totally agree with A.

It is shame that David King has chosen to depict the cover in such a misrepresentative way."},{"Title":"Azerbaijan (Cultures of the World)","review":"As being an Azerbaijani, I also claim to the picture which is on the cover of the book. Azeri men dont wear this kind of dress which is called \\"turban\\" or whatever.It shows that how much the author knows about Azerbaijan, its history, people and respectively, their culture and traditions. Standing from this point of view, in addition, i would say that his ideas given in the book more likely dont reflect the reality as the cover picture. It might not be truth (i wish), yet still i highly recommend the picture to be replaced by a picture, in next volumes, that represnts real Azerbaijan, Azerbaijanis and the culture, history and traditions that they possess."},{"Title":"Azerbaijan (Cultures of the World)","review":"Any book starts with a cover -- and in this case, the cover is completely misleading and thus fails not only its primary objective -- \\"one picture is worth a thousand words\\" -- but fails the book completely. The man depicted on the cover is probably either from Pakistan or Afghanistan, but definitely not from Azerbaijan. In fact, it is easier to spot a similar looking and dressed person in large cities in the UK and USA, than in Azerbaijan. It is unfortunate that such unprofessionalism creeps into books for American schoolchildren."},{"Title":"Azerbaijan (Cultures of the World)","review":"I also didn't read the book, but the mistake on cover explains much.

Totally unknown to the majority before independance from the Soviet Union in 1991, even to specialists it stood as little more than an outpost in the Soviet empire, largely Russianized. The reality, however, is much more complicated and much more interesting.In \\"Cultures of the World Azerbaijan\\", author David King leads readers into the most challenging set of nations yet published in the \\"Cultures of the World\\" series, the Asiatic states of the former Soviet Union. For Azerbaijan, the greatest challenge concerns scarcity of sources, particularly in English. Few bookshave been published on the history or descriptive culture of Azerbaijan, and of those published, most discuss specific topics such as political relations with Russia or theNagorno-Karabakh Dispute with Armenia.The author sets the keynote of the book in the Introduction where he comments \\"Azerbaijan is a nation where the ancient and the modern often exist side by side\\"(5). He then proceeds to describe the picturesque geography of Azerbaijan, well supplemented by vivid photos. History comes next and now the task of writing becomes very difficult. In the millions of books listed in bookstore Internet catalogues, not a single volume (at least not in English) exists on Caucasian Albania, the distant predecessor state of Azerbaijan which (as best as isknown) is unrelated to Albania in the Balkans. Similarly early modern history of Azerbaijan as part of the Russian Empire remains virtually unknown, despite the oil boom of the late nineteenth century making Azerbaijan the world's largest producer and refiner of oil in 1900. While the author can do little more than identify these points, he does draw attention to incredible gaps in the historical record.King continues through chapters ranging from economy to arts to food drawing attention to ancient and modern aspects of Azerbaijani society and culture unfamiliar to the outside world. Two chapters highlight this approach. In Arts the author discusses development of literature and music. One example is \\"mugam\\" which started with ashrugs (medieval travelling storytellers) recounting their tales, often while strumming a \\"kobuz (traditional stringed instruments). This evolved into the modern form of mugam as a performing trio with a singer and two other musicians playing other traditional instruments(94-95). This has been further adapted in more recent times by fusion with jazz to become improvised mugam jazz(96).Lifestyles forms the other highlight chapter. There the author describes stark contrasts between urban and rural life ranging from urbane workers of Baku to hardy, legendary long-life mountain farmers of the Caucasus. Of note in discussion oflong-life legends, the author indicates that while subjects to exaggeration and some fraud, all very old age claims cannot be lightly dismissed(69).A further note should be added about the use of photos. As usual with this series, they are well-chosen and of high quality. In this volume, however, they raise further questions. In Geography chapter, one photo shows a tall ship at anchor(10)(presumably on the Caspian Sea) very similar to Western ones that sailed the oceans of the world about 150 years ago. Is this ship Russian-built and if not how did it get into the Caspian Sea which has no water connection to the oceans? A second case occurs in Lifestyle chapter showing a schoolboy writing on a blackboard with a teacher watching(71). The schoolroom, however appears to be inside a tent with both student and teacher dressed in heavy winter clothes which opens the question education in Azerbaijan with its difficulties, achievements, and challenges. More specific photo captions would be helpful.The book series \\"Cultures of the World\\" is officially written for middle school and secondary school students to provide motivation for understanding and respecting diversity of cultures. Azerbaijan accomplishes these goals admirably by opening a perspective on a little-known part of the world. It achieves however much more for it places middle school student and Western scholar almost on the same starting line. By identifying major gaps in the historical record, particularly in the early modern oil-boom period, it opens the door to a kind of\\"industrial prehistory\\", a topic which seems to have received little if any attention previously.The reasons for this absence of research could form the basis for a scholarly article in a learned journal. Consequently the book invites research to begin regardless of the level of the researcher. It can be highly recommended to anyone interested in history and culture as well as the motivations behind the presence or absence of each of them."},{"Title":"Azerbaijan (Cultures of the World)","review":"I wonder if it's the author's complete ignorance on the subject or intention to misrepresent the country made him place this totally irrelevant picture on the cover.

They are usually strong enough to standalone. Being passingly familiar with the main character typically helps, as you can then more readily follow the reimaginings and nods to events in the main continuity. This title is a good entry in the series, the premise is interesting and points to an innate 'good' in the central character no matter where he might grow up. However, lacking a good understanding of the 'New Gods', Darkseid et al, will impact the average reader simply looking for a 'different' Superman tale. They'll still find it a good read, with some pretty good art, but not exceptional. The &quot;Red Son&quot; variant, with Superman growing up in the Soviet Union, might be a more readily grasped book for casual collectors when it becomes available in a trade."},{"Title":"Superman: The Dark Side","review":"In the last decade Superman has been through a lot and I was glad I was there for the ride..This isnt a typical Superman story but a Elseworlds story which for those who do know is take a character and put them in a diffrent timeline or alternate reality etc..

But when Kal-El arrives on Earth and meets reporter Lois Lane, he begins to question his perception of what is right and wrong.The book is a fun Elseworlds story that pays perfect tribute to the characters created by Jack Kirby while exploring new alternate ideas about the Superman mythos.

It is written in such a manner that it captures your attention right away and makes it almost impossible to put down. Imagine building your own home with nothing but an ax to cut the trees, debark them, notch them and measure with. No boards, so the floor is dirt, the door is made of hides and your nearest neighbor, if your lucky, is only 20 miles away! No roads or paths to follow. Just the sun and the top of a mountain on a clear day to find your way around. This story is about two young people Whit and Melissa who meet and marry in the town of Kettleford NH now Bedford NH and travel by birch bark canoe north to become the first settlers in the town of Tamworth NH. Too poor to purchase a piece of land in a settled township, they are forced to go north where Whit has to roam the wilderness in order to stake out 100 acres of land that will provide for their needs and then clear it and build his house within so much time in order to keep it and claim his cow that he will get for a bonus. If you ever wondered how the states were settled and what life was like when the wilderness was uninhabited, then this book is a must read.

While the summary of the book sounds to be quite entertaining and interesting, the contents of the book are quite the opposite. Do not be fooled by the words, \\"Enthralling Epic\\" on the cover. Enthralling in this case means, \\"boring.\\" And Epic means, \\"long.\\" The 410 pages of small font size and large amounts of useless dictation are less than exciting. More important events seem to \\"blend in\\" amongst the swarms of words, making it much more difficult to comprehend and sort out the vents as they unwind. While I am supportive of descriptive writing, the descriptive writing that this book contains is bland for the most part. And the dialog between characters between characters is unrealistic at best. If reading the dialog aloud you'll have the urge to start using a southern drawl even though the setting takes place in the early days of settlers in New Hampshire.

The author gives a guide to the huge overlayer of extensions and standards that have accrued atop XML, like barnacles on a ship. Unfortunately, threading this maze to understand what you might really need is not easy for many. So his viewpoint might help you.Also, at the implementation level, he offers practical advice about such key usages as XML data. He gives advantages and disadvantages. The latter is the best part of the book. Because other books that might explain the topic to someone new to it often just talk about the syntax and the great things that you can accomplish. Rarely will such texts discuss any limitations that have been found through painful experience.It's not just for XML data that he does this.

It contains results of 573 papers in the field, but requires few prerequisites beyond basic abstract and linear algebra. It's perfect for independent study.The key parts of the book for those interested in the matrix multiplication problem, like myself, and related problems are chapters 14-18. Chapter 14 describes the theory of the multiplicative complexity of bilinear maps, of which matrix multiplication is one, in terms of the concept of rank (also tensor rank), especially in the context of matrix algebras. The rank of a bilinear map is essentially a measure of the minimum number of multiplications in a bilinear algorithm for computing the map. Chapter 15 introduces the exponent of matrix multiplication in relation to the asymptotic complexity of the latter, and describes the fundamental relations between these asymptotic and bilinear measures, including the proof of Schonhage's important asymptotic direct sum inequality. Chapter 16 shows the fundamental importance of the exponent because it is found to determine the complexities of other important matrix operations such as inversion, taking of determinants, computing of characteristic polynomials etc. Chapters 17 and 18 describe further extensions, applications and links, including an interesting link between the ranks of finite fields and the minimal distances of linear error-correcting codes."},{"Title":"Algebraic Complexity Theory (Grundlehren der mathematischen Wissenschaften)","review":"This book is valuable for somebody who is well grounded in advanced mathematics and has a serious interest in the subject.

They are presented under a very harsh and realistic light that makes them the more repelling."},{"Title":"Virginia Bedfellows","review":"When Queen Elizabeth II came to the United States last May to visit Jamestown on the 400th anniversary of its founding, writer/activist Larry Kramer quipped that historic records prove that Jamestown was the first gay male village in America. Kramer asserted that there were \\"widespread coupling[s] of men with each other, indeed even with personal commitment ceremonies.\\"So it shouldn't be too farfetched that Gavin Morris' erotic history novel 'Virginia Bedfellows,' set in 1740s colonial Virginia, includes a romantic white male couple, a few (eventually) coupled friends, and a gay-tolerant slave owner. The tone is a bit fanciful, and written in a retro style reminiscent of straight romance novels, with much less pent-up frustration and much more frequent sex scenes.Indentured servants brought from England in shackles, contented African slaves in Virginia, and longterm gay romantic relationships make up the elements of Gavin Morris' novel.After being jailed for fighting a London policeman who had insulted his sister, working-class Lance Morley, a hardy 17, ends up chained with other, mostly African prisoners on a cross-oceanic journey. Set to be delivered to a cordwainer (shoemaker) by the kindness of the otherwise cruel ship captain Henry, who takes a liking to him, Lance is locked up in the captain's cabin for occasional romps after they meet.Meanwhile, Adam Bradley, having been handed off by exhausted parents with a dozen other children, is apprenticed in horse-tending and gay sexuality by amorous stable-hands while a servant at a Kent estate. Adam gets into trouble by refusing the rapacious advances of Lord Cromley, topping the older gent, and toppling the class order. Shipped off to America as an alternative to prison, Adam becomes a servant under Mr. Ashley, the same plantation owner who eventually employs/buys Lance. The two gradually reveal their desires, and a pants-bursting romance commences.What appears to be a good deal of historically accurate detail is countered with the conceit that several men were able to maintain indiscreet relationships on a par with contemporary couples, including the occasional friendly three-way with a visiting Indian. The suffering of African slaves is mentioned, but the book focuses more on the imagined lives of its white protagonists, and their passionate romance.The earnest tone of the book occasionally veers toward the Saturday Night Live sketch \\"Tales of Ribaldry.\\" But this is historotica, after all. Much is made of the size and uncircumsized condition of men's genitalia; and the kindly and pseudo-Libertarian slave-owner seems yet another fiction, countered by a few malicious troublemakers who provide some plot drama, but eventually meet tragic ends.While they weren't called \\"gay\\" in their day, there is no doubt that male sexuality existed in the early days of our nation. Jonathan Ned Katz's 'Gay American History' provides bountiful facts. And Morris' 'Virginia Bedfellows' provides the fanciful romance."},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"I home school so we buy and read a lot of books every year.

So I'm going to make them buy another copy!The book is about a class of kids in ancient Rome trying to solve a mystery that they ran into. It is fun, exciting, and full of Roman life that one can learn. It is so neat! More books should be written like this so that kids and adults can learn about history in a fun setting.This book has such wonderful humor that it makes me laugh all the time. I still remember when the teacher asks about how somebody should be punished for a minor crime, one child answered, should we throw him into the mouth of Mt Vesuvius? It is such boy humor!Actually, forget the library. I'm just going to get a copy for myself right now. This book is too cool, and its high rating is totally justified! Both fun and educational, a perfect read!"},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"Six boys are searching for clues that will set their friend free from prison.

The question is: Who is responsible for reporting the crime and who is the vandal besides Rufus? Find out in this interesting, well written book.The story takes place in ancient Rome. The main characters are Caius, Rufus, Antonius, Mucius, Flavius, Julius, and Publius. They are the boys that attend the Xanthos School. It all begins when the boys arrive at school one morning to find that their teacher has been assaulted. They try to figure out who could have been responsible when another problem occurs. Rufus is sent to prison under suspicion of vandalism and dishonor towards the Emperor. They are convinced that Rufus was not responsible, so they set out to find who is. Their antics include a chase scene and the recollection of an exciting dinner at Tellus's house.This book by Henry Winterfeld is very well written and fun to read. It's hard to put down. In my opinion, everyone who likes mysteries should read this book."},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"Detectives in Togas is a mystery story full of great suspense!It is about a group of boys in the time of ancient Rome.

We liked to read the book everyday and beg our mom, \\"Please, please, please, read just one more chapter?!?!\\" There are heroes and villains, excitement, fights, disguises, and clues. We had to think about what was happening but it was impossible to figure out the mystery. The ending is good because the bad guy, Lukos, gets what he deserves - he dies. (This review is submitted by two 8 year old girls and a 10 year old boy.)"},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"One still, quiet morning in Rome, six young boys, pupils of the well-known Xanthos School, try not to snicker as they watch Rufus, the seventh pupil, quietly hang up his wax writing tablet at the front of the room. On it are scratched the words, \\"Caius is a dumbbell.\\" When Xantippus, the teacher, discovers the prank, he angrily banishes Rufus from the school.The next morning, the boys are shocked to find those same words scribbled in red paint on the wall of the temple at Minerva, which is dedicated to the mighty ex-consul Tellus. And the words are written in Rufus' own hand! This mystery leads the boys on the most wild and dangerous adventure they could ever have imagined. Is Rufus really at fault, or did somebody forge his handwriting? Why is there a pile of sopping clothes underneath Rufus' bed? And why would somebody want to rob Xantippus' house, knock him out, gag him and stuff him in the wardrobe - and only take a few cheap textbooks and Xantippus' work on the acute angles of the obtuse triangle? It all doesn't make sense. What's more, the clues are leading straight towards Tellus, who is so rich and content that there certainly seems no need to deface a temple in the middle of the night. Then Rufus gets thrown and prison, and the others are determined to rescue him. But when they get trapped in the house of Lukos, the eerie soothsayer, it seems that all hope is gone for Caius and his friends...This book is absolutely amazing. It's so creepy that it makes me tense up just reading it! All the loose ends are tied neatly in place at the end of the book. The suspense is gripping. I also recommend Henry Winterfeld's other book, \\"Trouble at Timpetill.\\" I think it's a pity that he has already passed away so that he can't write any more books!"},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"My husband just finished reading this book to our four boys.

It has all the elements of a good book - suspenseful mystery, vivid imagery, intriguing characters, humor, friendship, enemies, and danger.Young students of a Greek schoolteacher have an argument that culminates with a mean statement written on a student's wax tablet. When that same statement is found written in red paint on the emperor's temple the next morning, their young friend finds himself in serious trouble. But are things as they seem? If you are like me, you won't figure this one out 'til the very end!"},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"Roman history, boring? You wouldn't think so, reading \\"Detectives in Togas.\\" Seven high-spirited Roman boys and their crabby teacher make up the cast of this outstanding head-scratcher, set in the heydey of Rome's domination.Rufus disrupted Xantippus's class by writing \\"Caius is a dumbbell\\" on a tablet, provoking Caius to start yelling. In the blink of an eye, Rufus has been thrown out of the schoolmates, alarming his classmates. What's even more alarming is that the same message is scrawled on a sacred temple's wall the next day -- in Rufus's handwriting. This act of sacrilege will destroy Rufus's life, and for some reason he won't deny it.The day of the defacing, Xantippus's house is robbed and the wax tablet is taken, but the robber leaves behind a beautiful golden brooch. The boys go to the soothsayer Lukos, but that goes horribly wrong when the soothsayer chases them out, and they leave behind Mucius, who then proceeds to fall into the Baths of Diana -- discovering that Rufus spent the night there before. The boys soon become enmeshed in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse centering on politics, money and revenge.Henry Winterfield clearly had solid memories of being a teenage boys. His gaggle of young boys are entirely realistic -- they bicker, they make idiots of themselves, they make all the wrong decisions, they all have distinct personalities. With a cast including seven young boys from similar backgrounds, you would think that they would all be the same, but Winterfield manages to make each one unique. Xantippus is the crabby grandfather with a marshmallowy interior. He clearly cares about all the boys, but is impatient about their blunders.Kids may leave this charming mystery with a wish to learn a little more about Rome (and to read the sequel, of course). And don't be surprised if you hear someone shouting, \\"Mike asinus est!\\""},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"Making ancient history entertaining? For children?!? You bet.... Enhance your history studies by reading books that are written specifically to a child. Great book complete with historical accuracy & lively illustrations.

I would't go so far as to say that they have much historical accuracy (something tells me that the Romans didn't use the word 'dumbbell' to describe a dunce) but, again, they are so funny...I disagree with anyone who says this is a 'slow' book - unless you have a VERY short attention span, I would say that they are rather fast-paced. There are several climaxes, but the biggest one is at the end where it should be, so why worry? Besides, climaxes help to keep your interest moving...I smile just thinking about these books. They're thoroughly good-natured, and for once the teacher isn't portrayed as a hideous monster -!"},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"This and the Mystery of the Roman Ransom are longtime favorites from my childhood and I've been a Roman history buff to this day.

Anyhow, its a great story, unlike any other books I have read."},{"Title":"Detectives in togas","review":"Usually novels set in ancient times are really sort of boring but not this one. The charactors are cool and the plot moves along just like if it were set in modern times. The author said that the idea for this book came about because he had heard of a kid writing graffiti on a temple wall. The sentence was \\"Caius is a dumbbell\\" only written in Latin. Yes, they had a problem with graffiti in B.C. days too. Detectives In Togas takes that one sentence and builds a pretty good story around what might have happened if whoever wrote the words was someone important in the town. Could it be true? Did someone frame one of the kids to take the blame for something? If you like your mysteries with a little bit of cultural history thrown in this book will make you want to find out more. The historical parts might even make you want to learn about how like was back then as well. So it's like a 2 for 1 thing.

Many parts kept me on the edge of my seat, such as the mysterious soothsayer. I would reccomend this book to people who like historical fiction, mystery, and action.

This book is real fun for kids , telling a charming story of little Roman boys who have kindness, a sense of adventure, and the right spirit to help their friend. They solve a dark mystery, hiking throughout the City of Ancient Rome (not very ancient for them, but their home) in order to do that. The novel has sinister characters as well, with sinister names (but I should not tell what this is about...), but it is not cruel or violent. I liked the book very much, and the fact that I remembered it after such a long time when I came across it in the amazon catalogue, is telling. I want to be its champion here, because it gives - like a good historic fiction book should - you a familiarity for the characters their life and life style. After reading I wanted to have the second book in the series (which exists, by the way), because I could not wait for the next adventure.

As I have read much Greek and Roman mythology to him I had been at a loss trying to relate ancient Rome as a living city to him. He understands the ruins and the appearances thereof from Nat'l Geographic . . . . This book filled him with the images of the ancient city as a regular place for kids and people-something different than the decadent structures we see today. My fondest recollections of this book from my childhood were picturing the images of the academy the boys attended, Caius' home, the temple and other places in Rome. Until I studied Western Civ and read more sophisticated literature, my clearest and most descriptive pictures of Rome were somehow related to this book whose title I only recently recalled.

I read it aloud to them last year, when they were in 2nd & 3rd grade, as part of our study of ancient civilizations. The book is set in ancient Rome, but the children are essentially modern. My kids related to them much more than they did to, say, Laura and Mary Ingalls in Little House on the Prairie. Those girls were very much part of the pioneer era they lived in and my kids consider them humorless and boring (blasphemy -- I loved those girls!), unlike the lively boys in this book.At any rate, the book is a delightful way to learn many interesting facts about daily life in Rome, from how people got their daily news to what their homes and schools were like to what people ate to how the roman baths were cleaned, etcetera.If you are not inclined to read aloud to your child (and if not, check out Jim Trelease \\"The Read-Aloud Handbook\\" - it may change your mind!), I think this book is better suited for the older elementary child, or for one with superior comprehension.

I am currently a criminal defense attorney, and former assistant prosecutor. The topic of illegal drugs is rather interesting to me, and is very important in our criminal justice system. I was looking for an informative book on the topic of cocaine.I just finished chapter 1, and am a few pages into chapter 2. Thus far, this book is terrible! I must say that it is absolutely, hands down, the most poorly written book I have ever read.It is difficult to read because the use of punctuation is horrible. Run-on sentences and poor grammar abound. Much of the first chapter presents itself as speculation and there are no citations or references. Terrible jokes and analogies riddle what I have read so far. I'm not kidding, it's awful!!Example: On page 41 of the soft cover version, the author quotes a source written in 1577. The style of English used in the quote is obviously very old. The author then, after giving us this quote, spends half a paragraph ripping on it. The author critiques the person who wrote the quote: \\"His spelling was also atrocious: how could he spell the word \`receive' and not manage \`they'? My spellchecker nearly exploded. Like some cutesy-retro hotel chain, he used the word \`ye' a lot and virtually every word he wrote ended in \`e'. It all felt rather twee.\\"This kind of useless nonsense is everywhere. Is the author trying to be funny or cute? It really does get old, especially when you bought the book for the purpose of an informative andintellectual read. I've wasted so much time reading through his dumb analogies and stupid \\"jokes.\\"The biggest problem I have is that the author speculates a lot. Further, the information he tries to covey as being fact is not backed up by any citations as to where the information came from. Given that this book is written so poorly (it really does sound like it was written by a stoned high school student) I cannot help but treat all the information within it as extremely suspect. The lack of citations wouldn't be so bad if the book was at least written in an intelligent manner.If it improves in later chapters, I will update this review to reflect any such improvements.

The book is fascinating and an eye opener - worth picking up."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Streatfield treats us to a well-researched saga of a nondescript plant turned worldwide scourge.The harmless looking coca plant was a staple of native South American societies for millennia. The continent's natives chewed a compound based on coca leaves to increase their endurance during long, trans-mountain treks; the chewing of which also reduced the food they would need on these grueling voyages. Coca, when taken in this manner, would provide a prolonged, but mild effect, in comparison with the 'high' that comes from the more pure forms of the substance that have been produced by modern science, medicine, and 'criminal enteprise'.Streatfield explores the newfound interest in the plant occasioned by medical research in the late 19th century, when many doctors and scientists, during the course of studying this remarkable drug, almost invariably found themselves 'addicted' to it. (Whether cocaine can truly be called 'addictive' is still a subject of debate and controversy. Opponents of the appellation 'addictive' emphasizing that cocaine, unlike drugs such as heroine and alcohol, does not produce withdrawal symptoms in the user who ceases its intake. This is anoverblown debate, unfortunately, as, like many high-profile debates in society, the point of contention is not substantive but semantic.)Streatfield documents the decline of cocaine use in the early to mid 20th century, and tracks its subsequent rise on the heels of the blossoming drug culture of the 1960's. One interesting point involves the attempted duplication, by an American distributor, of the smoked variety he sampled in a South American labaratory. Unawarre of the crude nature of the mixture, he set a scientist upon the task; and the result was not the comparably weak cocaine smoked in the remote laboratories, but the first ever purification of cocaine into freebase. This massively more potent form, together with the relatively short nature of the high, were to revolutionize the drug culture in America, especially in the inner cities.Most impressive about Streatfield's work, however, are the steps he takes to get firsthand knowledge, not only of the drug, but of the persons involved in the violent trafficking thereof. He visits and interviews many persons- law enforcement agents, imprisoned dealers, and even the armed compounds of wanted Colombian kingpins- putting himself in predicaments that have been the death of many before him.This book provides a wonderful history of the plant itself, and a tremendous survey of the politics, crime, and fortunes that have arisen alongside it in the last 40 years. Fascinating."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"If you ever wanted to know an extraordinary amount of detail about cocaine and then some, this is the book for you. Written by a documentary filmmaker, Streatfield's enormously thorough tome not only takes you across various geographies, but also through time. Starting with the Incan and Aztec uses of the coca leaf, Streatfield takes us on an incredible journey of a substance that leads us through to the Latin American domination of production while highlighting the U.S. consumerism of the product.The amount of detail in this book is staggering as Streatfield has spent a lot of time researching materials as well as tracking down individuals around the globe. Statistics are liberally used to drive home his points. For example, in the 1980's the Miami Federal Reserve Bank had an unexpected surplus of US $5.5 Billion. This was more than all of the other 11 Federal Reserve Banks combined. The book is full of statistics like this that demonstrate the scale of impact of cocaine.In addition to the facts and figures, we are introduced to some fascinating characters on this journey. We learn of Sigmund Freud's addiction to cocaine (there are some who believe that his great work would have not been possible without cocaine), the American distributor George Jung (popularized in the movie Blow), super narco-terrorist Pablo Escobar and his ilk and many others. Some characters are superfluous (i.e. Freud) but others are more central to machinations of the cocaine industry and their impact is thoroughly explored (i.e. George Jung, Carlos Ledher).If there is a con in the book, it is that some chapters are not labeled as properly as they could be. For example, the chapter where we are introduced to George Jung and his Colombian buddy ends with an extensive discussion about Colombia and Pablo Escobar. The chapter title leads us to believe none of that and probably could have been titled \\"George leads to Colombian dominance\\" or something like that. This would give the reader a better idea of what to expect in each chapter.If you are even the least bit curious about Cocaine, then this book is a must for you. Streatfield's writing style can be a bit whimsical at times but it provides just the right note of humor in a tome of documentary proportions and scope."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"This is truly one of the finest books I have read in a long time. Streatfeild starts with the background of Cocaine, how it came in to existence in the western world, what it is, etc. For this he went to libraries and read books that haven't been read in decades about Cocaine. This part can be a little laborious, but very useful and helps you appreciate what cocaine is all about and how it is more complicated than a drug that is just evil. You use the background he gives when you get to the rest of the book where he goes in to how cocaine has basically shaped the entire political and economic part of Latin America. His stories about the smugglers kept me up all night, they were so interesting, informative and lively, even more so as they are true and really matter to millions of people. He actually talks to maney smugglers in America, Columbia, Bolivia and elsewhere. His research throughout is superb. He went to any length to get the real story. Great Job!"},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Ok, so, basically, there's this really cool leaf in South America that natives have been chewing for medicinal and epicurean purposes since before the reign of the Incas. This leaf, if you believe Streatfeild, was largely responsible for maintaining a labor force to strip South America of its silver - miners would work days without hardly taking a break as long as they had their precious coca. Apparently, this leaf is relatively harmless in its natural form. When you chew it, you will get very small doses of several drugs, one of which provides the name for this book.Fast forward to present day. The natives are still chewing coca, but instead of mining silver, their harvesting their favorite leaf, converting it to a crude paste, and selling it to narco-traffickers who then make it into pure or almost pure cocaine. Of course, this is illegal, and the United States in particular has a bone to pick about the leaf (unless it's being used for one of its few legitimate purposes - such as flavoring coca-cola, which it is STILL used for, despite popular belief). But people want their cocaine. That's why we've got the drug war. Yes, the drug war is very very stupid. And Streatfield never misses an opportunity to drive this point home. Hard.I like this book. It has a plethora of trivia that's actually worth knowing, and it provides a new context to several historical events. But I don't really like Dominic Streatfeild. I get the feeling that if I met him I'd have to constantly force myself to smile. Awkward. He's like a nerdy Sherlock Holmes. His plot development techniques get a bit formulaic. I got very tired of paragraphs beginning with questions such as \\"And then what happened?\\" followed by him answering his own question. It's a rather tedious method of moving the story along. But I do admire the courage he had to have had to go where he had to go - deep into the nexus of the cocaine industry. He even interviewed two of the most infamous narco-traffickers, the Ochoa Brothers. But once he got in those situations, he didn't really get to the big questions. I don't blame him, of course. I wouldn't feel comfortable accusing one of the world's most powerful criminals of murder or torture either. But it was a bit anti-climatic.Worth reading.. The chapter on crack is particularly interesting."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Dominic Streatfield presents us with a beautifully crafted and written piece of work. Even though this book contains nearly 500 pages, I suspect it could have numbered far more. Nevertheless, I appreciated his chronological presentation of the role *coca* played in pre-Columbian South America up to the contemporary use and abuse of *cocaine* by Americans and Brits alike (the author is in fact British!). And even though this book is non-fiction, the author's injection of his personality and experiences while researching the book were refreshing and comical. In short, a great read that can provide hours of conversation fodder!"},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"When I originally picked up this book, I wasn't sure what to expect. Would this be another in a series of right- or left-wing infused prose that do very little speaking about the subject but, rather, speak more to a particular political agenda? I am pleased to report that the author did a very good job of playing the role of consumate researcher, and it shows on every page of this book, not political afficianado. From quote after quote, to Mr. Streatfeild's own &quot;experimentation&quot;, he goes the extra step to complete this work and should be commended for it. It's always difficult to take a chance on not only reading but writing about a subject so taboo as cocaine, but the characters who provide the content for this book are well worth the read.While I feel that I came away from this book having learned a great deal, I still think the author should have touched a bit more on the involvement of the CIA and other government agencies in the cocaine trade. (Although they were mentioned in great detail regarding Iran Contra) Overall, the book read very slowly, but the end result was worth it--I'd recommend this book to people who want to learn about a topic they never thought much about, but, beware: Patience is a must!"},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"As a pharmacist, I figured I would get a little bit of \\"cocaine\\" history. I got that, plus a view on American vs. Central American politics that was an eye-opener. This book has made me question the motives of American government in the war on drugs, and changed how I view the narcotics trade in general. Very well researched and political."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"For those of you with a lot of time and imagination on your hands, I highly recommend Dominic Streatfeild's history of cocaine. It'll probably be the most fascinating beach read you'll ever pick up and as he drives us from the Incas to Pablo Escobar, Streatfeild's sense of adventure is contagious.His prose is funny and not as heavy-handed as some researchers'. I think that if all history came in this format, American schools wouldn't have so many problems with disinterested teenagers.The fact that Streatfeild includes himself and his shenanigans in the book may seem unprofessional to some, but to me, it made the book a hell of a lot more fun to read. I really hope to read more of his work in the future (I wouldn't mind a thorough history of opium, because Martin Booth's version is hardly as readable as this)."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I bought this book to use for my capstone paper in my final year of college. I quoted from it extensively. The book covers the history of cocaine thoroughly, including the original uses of coca among the Andean people and the Spaniards' reaction to it. It also covers more modern times and issues, and is thus an excellent starting point, giving you all the general information you need. If you're writing an academic paper on cocaine, I'd start with this book and then work off of it, researching more in the areas you decide you want to pursue. It's definitely readable; the author has a good sense of humor, and you'll get through it much faster than you will other works. He isn't without bias, but he never claims to be objective in the first place, and there will be no difficulty whatsoever in sorting the editorials from the facts (much of the editorials are logical conclusions based on the facts provided though; you can decide for yourself). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"If you're looking for a very well-researched and detailed book about cocaine and the cocaine trade, this is it.This book covers everything: the history, Freud, the druglords, the Sandinistas, how cocaine benefits the economies of Peru, Colombia, Bolivia and Mexico, etc.The author also includes nuggets not found in other books on cocaine, like firsthand accounts of cocaine use dating back hundreds of years, how crack got started, and what \\"free basing\\" really means."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I've remembered my younger days as a kid always being told to stay away from drugs, and not to mention the famous slogan of \\"Crack is Wack.\\" Whenever I walked with my mother through the streets of Lower Manhattan in New York City during the mid to late 1980's, I would notice a lot of crack vials and syringes on the floor. The violence drugs caused during the 1980's and early 1990's. I was always curious as to why many people were being killed for drugs. The movie Scarface answered many of my questions. During my freshman year of high school is when I first heard of Pablo Escobar, and it was in part of his death. I knew drugs profit in huge amounts of money, but then I wondered how it was made. While in high school, I've asked several people as to how it was made, but was not satisfied with the answer. I have always wondered the history of this drug. On occasions I've searched the internet looking for information regarding cocaine, but was not content with the results either, until I discovered this book on Amazon.com. Before purchasing this book, I had bought and read: Kings of Cocaine by Guy Gugliotta, and Jeff Leen; Killing Pablo: The Hunt for the World's Greatest Outlaw by Mark Bowden; and The Big White Lie: The Deep Cover Operation That Exposed the CIA Sabotage of the Drug War : An Undercover Odyssey by Michael Levine. All these books are 5 STARS as well. As I mentioned earlier I was familiar with the violence that drugs caused, but wondered on the history of the illicit drug. This book has answered all of my questions, and hopefully it will answer yours. The author goes in depth from Pre Columbian times, the world's advertisement for remedies, to its illegalization, and to the approximate present. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I picked up this book a year ago with a couple other books for a Summer full of some readings. I never got to this one book since my first year of college kicked off by the time I got the chance to even open the book. Lately (with the boredom and unwillingness to study for midterms) I found this book while cleaning my room. I am regretting the moment I bought it, I cannot put this book down.I have only read the first 70 pages of this book and I find myself reading until the itty bitty hours of the morning. In some sense, it's a huge research paper with the perfect narrative and support.I would highly recommend this book to anyone, despite the appalling reaction the title of it creates."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"This is an interesting historical journey for a non-scientist like myself. he author is humorous about his exhaustive research into the history, medical effects and cultural and political implications of cocaine. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Dominic StreatfeildDominic Streatfeild is not exactly a well known author. He has done a few travel books and a few TV documentaries, none of which I have actually read or seen. His profile on Reed publishing website states, \\"Dominic Streatfeild has been underachieving for thirty-one years, ten of them professionally.\\" Since then Dominic has done one thing that changed it all. He wrote this book.A product of \`just say no' propaganda, I have always had a very black and white view of substance abuse. I have personally supported war on drugs and everything that it represents, government interference, strict sentencing, manipulating foreign governments and billions of dollars in policing a problem that won't go away. I'm not so sure anymore. Not after reading this book.I'm very impressed by the research put into this book. Some methods of research however are a bit dubious. That doesn't take away from how captivating this book is and what a great job it does of not just putting across all the variables in this complex equation, but also staying neutral while tackling what is essentially an extremely polarizing topic.Anything you need to know about the experience, history, politics and chemistry of Cocaine, you will find it here."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"This book traces the knowledge and uses of the coca plant from its origins in the Incan empire pre-Colombian times to the year 2000. The book is laid out chronological and covers the spread of coca from the Peruvian highlands out through the whole of South America, into the Caribbean islands, to the doctors' offices and high society of Europe and finally onto the streets of Mexico and the USA. Along the way, the author details the major personas (i.e. Sigmund Freud, George Jung, Pablo Escobar), companies (Coca Cola, Merck, etc...), and governments (i.e. Germany, Bahamas, Bolivia) involved in the on-and-off spread of coca and its derivatives throughout the world.The style is written in first-person; the author spends several years researching this topic, and relates not only his discoveries, but his efforts and mishaps in doing the research. This includes dead-ends, transcripts from other books, and quotes from his interviews with various figures in law-enforcement, academia, drug cartels, and prisons. The writing style is a blend of travel - writing and mass - consumption history along the lines of a David McCullough piece. Altogether, this book makes for entertaining and educational reading.The book itself has no endnotes or footnotes. Instead, at the end of the book, the author cites important studies of coca throughout history; these include medical studies of its effects on humans, economic studies of its impact in the agricultural sectors of various nations, scientific studies of its uses, and demographic studies of its usage and prevalence within societies.After reading this book, one gains a lot of insight into the history, economics, demographics and sociology in the countries of the Western hemisphere over the last 200 years; such has been the influence of coca in this world. This book is neither an argument for or against the legalization of cocaine; the author comprehensively shows the positive and negative effects of both the use of coca and its role in local and national economies, both legal and underground.Overall, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"If people took more time to read, perhaps we could avoid the idiotic things like the War on Drugs, or, the War on Terror."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"This was one of the more entertaining and informative reads of my whole life. There is more in that first chapter to entice and educate than all the culmative drug literature I had previously had jammed down my throat. For once, someone was able to capture the true power and value of the drug.I was captivated by the author's laid back style that would under other circumstances have had me running from the book with at least five hundred feet between us, but in this setting it works. I have long held the oppinion that drugs should be legalized, but this book puts so much logic into the assertion, with facts to back it up, that those of us that discovered the principle on their own feel foolish for having trusted the ignorance put upon my generation by our DARE program rather than truely taking the time to explore the concept when it was first presented in school. If everyone read this we could have one truely informed populace to have a consideration as to the nature of drugs.Abandon the darkness and come into the light of Cocain: The Unauthorized Biography."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"A wonderful book!Back in the 90's, yellow beard (Richard Branson) packaged himself as the hip and trendy and pro drug entrepreneur. Yellow beard crashed hot air balloons over the Atlantic, stuck Pamela Anderson's tits on his coke bottles, and, more hilariously, opened a book publishing business for lads. This trendy Virgin publishing house catered for the self regarding consumers of 'Lads Culture' and 'Cool Britannia'; you knew them by their floppy hair; they were the ones consuming any old tat with the allure of drugs and fannies on the cover. Enter Dominic Streatfeild; only Virgin would allow Dominic Streatfeild anywhere near a typewriter (they probably still used typewriters back then), because only a guy like Streatfeild can tell the truth, you see.Streatfeild knows how to crack a joke and he doesn't take himself seriously, like stuck academics do, with their peer review and their following the propaganda line. Dominic Streatfeild isn't like them. Streatfeild possesses acerbic wit, tongue-in-cheek humor and extremely readable thoughts and comments on cocaine and the weird paradox of the War on Drugs.You may yourself enjoy Streatfeild's conversational, best mate down the pub style of writing, I know I did, and you may find it very commendable that Streatfeild is so down to earth enough that he has pretensions and all that; however, I don't want a new best friend, I just wanted an expert's take on the history of cocaine! I did enjoy the humor though and you will not find a cocaine book as fat as this one, so it's the best book out there.Academics and most writers are cowards and so it is very hard to find the historical background to cocaine, so Streatfeild is useful in this regard. So Cocaine: An Unauthorised Biography has plenty of history of cocaine, from the time of Columbus to 19th century Germany, and culminating in Sigmund Freud's wacky adventures with the uber-powder (apparently, in the 19 century you could walk into the local chemist and buy pharmaceutical, i.e pure, grade cocaine). So according to the history books), when Sigmund Freud was a young man, uncut cocaine was legally available throughout Vienna and the rest of Europe! You could legally purchase pure cocaine powder or liquid, to mix with your favorite beverage (coca-cola); just pop along to your local chemist; and snort it, which, funnily enough, this is what Freud and his peers did. Uber-Coca, as Freud called it; could very well have been the catalyst tool for all the psychology coming out of Germany and Austria at that time.. Yes a tool, because pure cocaine is a supercharged mood enhancer, throwing your mind hither and thither into fresh insights on the horrors and manias of personally. Sigmund Freud used cocaine throughout the 1880's, but he wasn't an addict, just an enthusiastic user (though he did addict his best friend, but that's another story). Now compare the phenomenological literature on cocaine (how it feels) to Freud's description of narcissism. The more I look, the more I wonder; it's weird the way this fact isn't mentioned by the robot 'experts' out there. Streatfeild notices the strange rewriting of history and he's being paid by Virgin to write a book about it which is weird!Steatfeild also mentions that years ago, woman would overdose internally through sex! And not just in the act, but in the olden days, women used to take cocaine from down there! This confused me as I have never come across this information before and I wanted to know more, however, Streatfeild doesn't reference his findings, and so I'm left pondering the implications of woman who, rather than snort, hose the stuff up from down there!The most radical thing about this book is the LEGALLITY of the white powder in the Victorian era. Now what I discovered in this book was that pure cocaine powder was perfectly legal throughout Europe in the 19th century, and this was at a time when European empires peaked; that is, Europe owned two thirds of the planet and was far richer than it is today, and they didn't even have a war on drugs back then. So is cocaine dangerous for a society? Yes? Well not if we read the history! According to the history books, cocaine was legal and packaged in Coca Cola and red wine for decades; it was also marketed in tooth paste, cough medicine and women's make up and nobody died from the decade's long acceptance and normality of the drug.Steatfeild asks the obvious, that is, if cocaine really is as dangerous as we are now led to believe, then why didn't Europe collapse under the rush of crazed drug addicts? By the way, all of the above facts are also documented in a good documentary on the Discovery. I think it's called something like Drugs and How They Became Illegal. You can find it on YouTube (Queen Victoria, Pope Leo XIII and later Pope Saint Pius X all enjoyed cocaine wine!). Though all these facts are well documented, nobody raises the contradiction with today's evil drug climate and the world our great great grandparents lived in. The historical amnesia is like in Orwell's 1984, when they rewrite the past to fit the present.Isn't it refreshing though, to realize that politicians who panic the electorate about the perils of legalization have their history the wrong way round? There is more to cocaine than meets the eye then and Dominic Streatfeild points out these contradictions very well.Dominic is funny when he talks about the strangeness of our so called stuffy Victorian ancestors having a jar of cocaine powder in the cupboard or cocaine toothpaste upstairs in the bathroom and nobody batting an eyelid.This is a class act!"},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"This is my first time ever writing a review. I love looking at peoples reviews before making a purchase. It helps me get different perspectives on an item to be purchased. That being said, I am writing this review to let others know just how good of a read I found this book.I was introduced to this book by a friend who was reading it and loved it. After reading a few pages of his copy, I did not want to put it down. I ordered the book that same night. Once I got my copy, I couldn't put it down. In fact, my girlfriend argued with me because I wouldn't stop reading the book every chance I got.The book goes into a lot of detail, including a detailed history. It talks about the effects of the drug and experiments that were done on its addictive properties. There are tons exciting stories of drug cartels, traffickers, dealers and the governments involved. It even gets into why the farmers grow it. Most importantly, it talks about cocaine and its problems from a variety of different perspectives.Like I said, it is an AMAZING BOOK. A must read for anyone with an interest in coke."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"I have read this book three times, and it's been a page-turner every time. Streatfield manages to make a history book feel like a conversation with a knowledgeable friend.The first 150 pages are a little slow, but you need to read this part as Streatfield is giving you important information that is referenced later. The information provided in those first 150 pages are relevant to the topic, not just some collection of data points and useless facts. I'd equate the first part to a very good movie setting up the plot.Once the book makes it to 1960 and cocaine's resurgance, book some time alone as you will not want to stop reading. Streafield examines all the countries that were/are major players in the coke trade. Most of is information comes from his many interviews with DEA agents, confessed smugglers (such as George Jung) the man who alledgely invented crack, and even the Ochoa family of Colombia. He spends a day in a crack house in Brooklyn, and visits the farmers who are affected by the current US program eliminate coca growing in the Andes.Though, not a political piece, Streatfield does end the book with some thoughts on current drug laws and policies based on all he learned while researching his book. Much to his credit, he makes is points calmly and logically, and does not beat you over the head with his opinions. This book is perfect for a vacation or a long flight. It's and easy and fun read."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"You'll let it disrupt your life and eat up your free time. You won't want to give it up. You may even try to foist it upon your friends.\\"Cocaine\\" is just that type of book.With an eye for detail and an ear for illumating quotes, Dominic Streatfeild chronicles the rise and rise of one of the most powerful drugs known to man. In describing the early uses of the coca plant, the process by which people began refining it to produce cocaine, and its early ascension to \\"wonder-drug\\" status (thanks to enthusiastic proponents and users like Sigmund Freud), Streatfeild gets the reader hooked on entertaining stories and fascinating quotes. His early chapters leave the reader with a visceral sense of the drug's power; later, he shows how, after a period of dormancy, it re-emerged in the Seventies and Eighties, tearing through North and South America, leaving a trail of corruption and ruin behind it. The stories of Columbia's efforts to clamp down on it and George Jung's efforts to widen its distribution make for compelling reading; one hopes someone will eventually make a better movie than \\"Blow\\" to dramatize this compelling tale.Still, some of Streatfeild's annoying habits blunt the book's power. All too often, he inserts himself into the story, showing how his research unfolded, for instance, or describing his efforts to observe a real crack house on a typical day. Occasionally, this can be amusing, like when he comes to realize that so many of the drug's early chroniclers wrote so enthusiastically and so prodigiously because they were using it. More often, though, his personal interjections feel sloppy and self-indulgent.More annoyingly, he uses much of the latter book as a platform to talk about drug legalization, and he buys the standard legalization arguments without giving enough consideration to their potential cost. While the current \\"war on drugs\\" may be far from ideal, cocaine is not just like any other commodity, and it's far from clear that legalization will ease society's problems with it; indeed, it may well be a problem that has no solution.Still, this is an educational and worthwhile book for those seeking to understand this powerful drug. Streatfeild has done his homework, and you'll thank him for it. And you'll never look at Freud the same way again."},{"Title":"Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography","review":"Dominic Streatfeild penned an excellent book outlining the nature, history, and effects of coca and cocaine. The unauthorized biography contains just about all the information there is pertaining to this topic. It is also written in a fun and breezy style. My only problem with the text is that it was about 100 pages too long. There are too many asides and too much meandering on tertiary topics in my opinion. The narrative is strongest at the beginning and at the end. Streatfeild's depiction of coca's discovery and indigenous use in South America is absolutely fascinating as are his later chapters on Bolivia, Columbia, and Peru.

He has covered the science, the folklore, the national policies, the Congressional Hearings, as well as interviews with users and pushers. With only one reservation noted below, I can say that here few of the reader's questions will be left unanswered. He brings the story full circle from the coca plant being just a mysterious wonder drug from 2500bc, to today's present day use of it as the hub of the global cocaine epidemic, involving \\"crack hos,\\" \\"crack houses\\" and \\"coke mules,\\" etc. where it finally has become the scourge of the inner cities, as well as of the international economy.This is both a detailed and a nuanced treatment, covering the drug's social, scientific, health and religious impacts. Its social history moves from wonder drug (if its leaves are chewed instead of smoked or injected as was done for centuries, it is a complete food with more calcium than milk, ample amounts of iron, vitamins A, B and E, plus a hell of an energy kick), to its use as a religious way of knowledge (in the Carlos Castaneda way of learning and teaching about the soul), to an experimental psychotropic elixir (Sigmund Freud both used and prescribed it, and cocaine was a part of the original recipe of Coca Cola from whence it got its name), to its use as the centerpiece of the underground global economy (as for instance in most of the cartels of South and Central America).For last 500 years of use, no stones are left unturned as this book, in a single volume, summarizes everything that I have found in at least twenty other books, including those by rogue investigators such as Gary Webb, ex-politicians/users/dealers like Webster Hubbard, and dealers extraordinaire, such as LA's \\"Freeway Ricky Ross.\\"The only disappointment I noted was in the fact that even though the Iran Contra CIA and Pentagon connections were covered in great detail (including Barry Seal's and Oliver North's respective roles), the things that went on in Arkansas, including Mena, which was part of North's operation, were not mentioned? Since cocaine money allegedly played such an important role in getting Bill Clinton elected, this book would have been the natural place to finally clear up that matter once and for all. However, the author remained mute on the subject? [Maybe this means he is a card carrying Democrat? Or, he took the fears voiced on pages 188-89 about Barry Mc Caffrey literally?]Despite this rather glaring omission, I am not kidding when I suggest that it reads like one of Kitty Kelly's best exposes -- and this time that is meant as a compliment.

This is a fascinating book that takes on a global social problem.Written in a no-nonsense, informal, investigative journalism style, the book gives a good history of cocaine, from the ancient South American Incas and other tribes, to the out of control abuse in the modern world. Everything you can think of is covered, from the first cocaine epidemic in the US that you never heard of, to the freebase rock \\"epidemic\\" of the 80s and 90s, to the secret ingredient in a certain major mass consumed beverage and their \\"secret\\" research facility in Hawaii.The author really went out of his way to interview anyone he thought of connected with the cocaine trade. Some of the best interviews are with Freeway Ricky Ross, George Jung (whose character was played by Johnny Depp in a movie), and the Ochoas(!).A few points from the book I should note: politicians always inflate their stance on the so called war on drugs to make them look tough, because its one of the few things voters will agree on from most political perspectives. So its always a vote getter. Also cocaine the drug should be considered separate as a concept from the coca leaf. The leaf is about 1000 times less potent than the powdered cocaine hydrochloride. Do you consider your morning coffee a dangerous drug?It becomes quite clear that to control the cocaine problem the US has got to do more on the use and demand side of the equation, and not just hammer the supply side. I think they should still try to clamp down on drugs entering the US. They have got to put more customs agents in the ports and scrutinize what is coming into the country, and stop the DEA and others from meddling with the poor farmers in other countries. Once the demand dries up, the supply will dry up too and the farmers will look to growing other, hopefully more legitimate, crops."},{"Title":"Rings of the Templars","review":"Poorly written with a rehashed plot and a very unsatisfactory end."},{"Title":"Rings of the Templars","review":"I couldn't put this book down.

It shows you many basic chords, the basics of guitar tablature, a couple techniques such as hammering, and some arpegio playing. Overall, I found it to be decent.My main problem with this book is that it doesn't explain much of the theory behind the chords, and what notes correspond to what frets on the guitar. I have been playing the piano for a while, and, while I know the theory behind the chords used, absolute beginners to music may not.This book had a nice chord chart towards the back. Unfortunately, it wouldn't make sense for everyone. The author never mentioned minor, diminished, and augmented chords before - they just magically appear in the chart.Enough ranting. I found this book to be simple and easy to follow, and I definitely learned chords this way. Another book to follow this one up would be the &quot;Hal Leonard Guitar Method.&quot; This book teaches more about individual notes and a little bit of theory piece by piece.If all you want are the basics of guitar, this is a great book."},{"Title":"Mel Bay You Can Teach Yourself Guitar (You Can Teach Yourself) (You Can Teach Yourself)","review":"I brought my first guitar when I was about 11 years old.

My first and favorite song was \\"Drunken Sailor\\". My chord changing wasn't that great but I played for my own pleasure. I remember many happy hours with my guitar and this song book.

The story is gripping, though slow at times. The style reminds me of Hemingway--simple sentences with lots of coordinating conjunctions, and simple repetitons to create a poetic sense of setting and mood.John Grady Cole is the archetypal teen on a quest to grow up, and he is complex. The moral dilemmas build this character, and his coming of age is rough and dark. Cole's lost innocence symbolizes the changes in the country after WWII.This is the first novel in a trilogy, and I am looking forward to the other two."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy has managed to separate the literary men from boys with The Border Trilogy. Readers who were disappointed mentioned the lack of narration and punctuation. The first 10 pages of the first book caught me off guard. It felt a little like being left in a strange country with no one to translate. I kept going and fell in love with this style of writing. Everything I read afterward seemed like it was written for children; all the obvious tricks.The story is stark. The writing is too. It fits. I was completely engrossed is this trilogy and yes, it was somewhat depressing. But for authenticity , the characters are flawless.It takes a certain 'adjustment' to read, but anyone with a love for the west and nugget or two of gray matter can enjoy it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I had to read reviews to see what I was missing and I still don't get it.

How it won the National Book Award is beyond reason. Though McCarthy paints a good picture in one's mind, the content does not flow well.

Some of the books I didn't finish, but All the Pretty Horses was one that I did.

L'unique point noir est que cela risque de vous couter cher puisque vous voudrez lire ensuite tout McCarthy.

I also had a hard time reading it because of the lack of quotation marks, puncuations and so forth. I also lost track of who was who in the story. Otherwise, his description of Texas and Mexico, the lonely life as a cowboy, waxes lyrical. I would recommend this book for those who really likes cowboys and westerns. It just didn't appeal to me very much!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Toward the end of \\"All the Pretty Horses,\\" the main character John Grady Cole shoots a deer. When he reaches the doe, he kneels beside her to usher her tenderly to her death. His mind is filled with thoughts of the tumultuous journey that has brought him to this point:\\"...he felt wholly alien to the world although he loved it still. He thought that in the beauty of the world were hid a secret. He thought the world's heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world's pain and its beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for the vision of a single flower.\\"Later, John watches a funeral from a distance: \\"...for a moment he held out his hands...as if to slow the world that was rushing away and seemed to care nothing for the old or the young or rich or poor or dark or pale or he or she. Nothing for their struggles, nothing for their names. Nothing for the living or the dead.\\"Rife with these types of profound observations, this wry, beautifully wrought, sometimes comic novel is compelling, exultant, and heartbreaking.Clearly, \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" is a multifaceted love story. First, it reveals the affection between John, a miraculously gifted horse whisperer, and his subjects: \\"What he loved in horses was what he loved in men, the blood and the heat of the blood that ran them. All his reverence and all his fondness and all the leanings of his life were for the ardenthearted and they would always be so and never be otherwise.\\" Second, there's the more traditional, yet troubled love between the impecunious John and Alejandra, his wealthy boss's refined and beautiful daughter. And finally, there's the love expressed between John and his best friend Lacey Rawlins. In fact, this fraternal relationship may be the novel's most fleshed-out. McCarthy rarely expresses this love through dialogue, yet reveals it clearly and deeply: \\"They rode out on the prairie and sat on the ground and let the animals drift with the reins down and he told Rawlins all that had happened. They sat very quietly. The dead moon hung in the west and the long flat shapes of the nightclouds passed before it like a phantom fleet.\\"In a much broader sense, this novel illuminates a writer's unbridled love for his setting. McCarthy's broad affectionate descriptions of the Texan and Mexican landscapes are uncommonly detailed and full of integrity. In this, my third McCarthy novel, I'm finally beginning to get a real sense of his unparalleled use of setting as a character unto itself. That's a rare quality, even in the most accomplished writer.\\"All the Pretty Horses\\" explores the perpetually inventive ways humans simultaneously revel in life, drinking in every vivid particle, while inexplicably separating themselves from it through fear, cruelty, and indifference. Perhaps this inherent compartmentalization explains how people can inflict evil on others and still sleep at night and also how victims somehow manage to extract tiny shreds of forgiveness from a soul otherwise decimated by their victimizers. Sometimes that perpetrator is life itself."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"PAGE 141 (punctuation is as the author intended)\\"...They'd ride at night up along the western mesa two hours from the ranch and sometimes he'd build a fire and they could see the gaslights at the hacienda gates far below them floating in a pool of black and sometimes the lights seemed to move as if the world down there turned on some other center and they saw stars fall to earth by the hundreds and she told him stories of her father's family and of Mexico. Going back they'd walk the horses into the lake and the horses would stand and drink with the water at their chests and the stars in the lake bobbed and tilted where they drank and if it rained in the mountains the air would be close and the night more warm and one night he left her and rode down along the edge of the lake through the sedge and willow and slid from the horses back and pulled off his boots and his clothes and walked out into the lake where the moon slid away before him and ducks gabbled out there in the dark. The water was black and warm and he turned in the lake and spread his arms in the water and the water was so dark and so silky and he watched across the still black surface to where she stood on the shore with the horse and he watched where she stepped from her pooled clothing so pale, so pale, like a chrysalis emerging, and walked into the water.She paused midway to look back. Standing there trembling in the water and not from the cold for there was none. Do not speak to her. Do not call. When she reached him he held out his hand amd she took it. She was so pale in the lake she seemed to be burning. Like foxfire in a darkened wood. That burned cold. Like the moon that burned cold. Her black hair floating on the water about her, falling and floating on the water. She put her other arm about his shoulder and looked toward the moon in the west do not speak to her do not call and then she turned her face up to him. Sweeter for the larceny of time and flesh, sweeter for the betrayal. Nesting cranes that stood singlefooted among the cane on the south shore had pulled their slender beaks from their wingpits to watch. Me quieres? she said. Yes, he said. He said her name. God yes, he said...\\""},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses offers the reader an homage to the great westerns of an earlier time. This like McMurtry's Last Picture Show is the western of the dying American West.In a landscape now filled with cars and highways, John Grady Cole sets out the find the West of the past that he cherishes so much.After the death of his grandfather and the sale of the ranch that means so much to him. Cole sets out on a journey to Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins to find the land and western adventure as cowboys they have always dreamed of. Along the way they pick up another youth, Jimmy Blevins, and the true adventure begins.The narrative reads like a wierd hybrid of Ernest Hemingay meets William Faulkner but the careful reader will have no real problem following along. In addition, McCarthy's descriptions of the Mexican countryside can only be described as breathtaking. The horsebreaking scenes alone are woth the price of admission.This is not to say that there are no flaws in the novel. The characters have a tendency to act on a level way beyond their years. The minor characters are not developed as well as they should be. In fact the affair between Cole and Alejandra feels like it was added as an afterthought and goes nowhere.Perhaps the biggest flaw in the book is its ending. It seems that McCarthy tried to make his book too much of an adventure. The reclamation of the horses and capture of the captain scenes feel to Rambo like to be a part of so beautifully written a book.But overall this is an extremely well written narrative that deserves a read.The flaws feel like defects in fine leather. Yes there are flaws but overall the picture is superb."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy writes like cowboys think. He describes scenery, women, and horses through the eyes of grizzled young riders in the Texas dust. His landscapes are remarkable -- dry, dusty, steaming, other times lush, but always hot. His characters are truly wonderful, 1950s cowpokes and members of the Mexican aristocracy lost in time, not yet used to the world of the automobile, unaffected by the Baby Boom and the economic surge post-WWII.John Grady Cole, a 16-year-old horse handler on the run from his mother's affairs and his father's illness, is what we all want to be: noble, wise, rugged. His pal Rawlins is a hilarious sidekick, though more than that. He lacks Cole's early wisdom, but enjoys life more and makes fateful decisions on instinct alone. Cole's romance with the beautiful Alejandra is masterfully handled, though the awful cover of this movie tie-in would tell you otherwise.Find your favorite chair, turn off the phone, and curl up with this gem."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"It's not that I didn't enjoy the story, but I feel it could have been told in 1/2 the words. It just didn't keep my attention and took about a month of forcing myself to stay into it to finish. Also, if you don't know Spanish, you may want to keep a dictionary handy. It could be frustrating otherwise."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I had to read this book as one of my summer reading assignments for AP English. I doubt I would have even finished this book if I didn't have to. Personally, I was annoyed by McCarthy's style. Many of his sentences would either be really short (especially the dialouge) or a paragraph long. It seemed to me like the author would try to throw in a few really long lines once in a while just to be pretensious. Additionally, the style of the novel (especially the first 15 pages) was confusing. There were shifts in time and setting without even a break in the paragraph. I also didn't understand McCarthy's reasoning for leaving out many punctuation marks including quotation marks, some commas, and apostraphes. I may have been biased against this book from the start though because I don't like reading westerns."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I am a big McCarthy fan but I was not engaged by this story. The writing, as always, is phenomenal. But that wasn't enough to pull the story through for me or keep me interested. It pains me to write this review because I have read some truly great work by this writer. But All the Pretty Horses is not one of his best, not by a long shot.I cannot recommend this novel."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"If you take a look at the reviews for this book, you'll notice several by those who found it &quot;aggrivating&quot; [sic]. If you think you may find it &quot;aggrivating&quot; to read some long sentences and Spanish phrases, and might consider poetic use of language pretentious, then just skip All The Pretty Horses. If, on the other hand, you think you might be able to deal with artful writing, get to your local library or bookstore, pick up a copy, and read one magical, beautiful, memorable, and awesomely well-written novel. John Grady -- and McCarthy's prose -- will haunt you forever."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This novel is a gem in the shelf of Americana. It requires moderate input by the reader, but I enjoyed how McCarthy contrasts the minimalism of the American cowboy to the multiplicity of Mexicana. McCarthy deftly presents the Cowboy world as rooted in the American frontier, a place where there are few or no political boundaries and a lot of open space. Just the right amount of humor balanced out the violent descriptions of the rough cowboy life. This is a wonderful tribute to Americanism."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Before I start I want to say I loved this book. It was enjoyable and profound and I will recommend it to nearly everyone. However some of the sentences were too long, I think someone counted 40+ ANDS in one sentence? and it was difficult to read at times. This was not necessary in my opinion. I am a fast reader and I sometimes overlooked the meaning of whole paragraphs because of this problem. It meant that a lot of backtracking was necessary. Hemingway used long sentences as well, leading one reviewer to call it deceptively simple writing. I would call it unnecessarily complicated. The best books should be a pleasure to read. I would say easy to read, but then I would need to define 'easy'. No, writers write for people to READ, and they read not because they have to , but because they want to, where it is an enjoyable pursuit. I did enjoy this book. McCarthy is very good at his craft. But I cannot resolve this issue of over long sentences. Can someone explain why they NEED to be this long???? Another thing. . On the front of my version was a review by the Guardian (quality newspaper in UK) declaring this book to be one of the greatest works of american literature ever or something. And then looking at the reviews within this site, I cannot help my distasteful feeling at the pomposity with which some people approach commentary. YES, YES, YES, YES this is a good book, but so is Catch 22, and Catcher In The Rye etc etc Hearing what people have to say about Cormac McCarthy's writing is like listening to sycophantic supporters at a radical politics rally. Its not the only book in the world you know. ."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"cormac mccarthy's striking, bleak story of john grady cole's maturation is a marvel in both language and storytelling that is most certainly for the mature reader, and one who loves reading at that. This is not a light tale, and the violence is often excruciatingly graffic, and his unusual lack of punctuation (there's not a quotation mark to be found) can put off a reader who is not willing to look past this. In fact, the lack of quotation marks in conversations has the interesting effect of making the blend almost seemlessly with the descriptions... speaking of which, there are some truly beautiful passages in this book, worth quoting for the masterful pictures they paint. This magnificent book should be read by anyone who's mature enough to handle it's unconventionalism, and it's violent themes."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I picked up this book, having seen it listed for readers who enjoyed &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. I was stunned by what I consider pretty lush prose, considering the barren landscape and lifestyle McCarthy is trying to describe. The stylistic choices in this novel (the use of Spanish, no quotations) that seem to have bothered others (and in &quot;The God of Small Things&quot; drove me batty) seem perfectly matched to the story itself; the starkness of the very appearance of the page matches the story. McCarthy did a wonderful job, in my opinion, of showing us people who just manage to keep going - they persever in spite of all the obstacles. I loved this book, and plan to follow up with the other two volumes in the trilogy."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Never have i felt more in touch with a novel than with this one. Though on surface i would seem to have nothing in common with the charecter John Grady, his feelings about life and his struggle with inescapable hope are relatable for just about anyone. McCarthy's style flows much more than most contemporary writers' do, and his words do complete justice to the beauty of the terrain of Mexico and Texas. A wonderful read, easy to understand and extraordinarily influencing."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I struggled initially with the author's style. But after a few pages, I was so caught up in the story that the writing style was no longer noticeable and came to realize that it was an important contribution to the tone of the book. It was a great adventure that caused me to put aside my current Tom Clancy and spend the weekend with &quot;All The Pretty Horses.&quot; It was good enough that I have ordered the second and third books in this triology."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Excellent reading. Some people complain about the use of Spanish in parts of the book. I think it ads to the realism. You can log on to cormacmccarthy.com to get the translations for all three books in the border trilogy."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book a few years ago now and reread it whenever I want to remember what real writing is like. There is a musicality in the phrasing, the way the sentences fall onto the pages like a scattering of seed. McCarthy is brave enough, and trusts his powers of illumination enough to explain very little. The reader is simply left to either pick up those seeds or leave them be and move on. Though the book is really about all humanity McCarthy chooses simple people to tell his story. John Grady, Blevins, Alejandra and the Duena Alfonsa are at once real people and works of art. As a vignette of the book and in fact Cormac McCarthy's whole style, read the short passage in the middle of the book where Alejandra comes riding down out of the mountains with a thunderstorm building behind her. The author puts more power in that one scene that most writers summon in a career. As one of the early reviews said - trust me, this is a journey worth taking."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"It's one of those books that it takes you the first fifty, or so, pages to get into, but once you're past that I would be surprised if you could put it down.

I want to warn everyone to avoid reading the review titled \\"Ok, but if you have a choice, don't read it.\\" The cretin that wrote it revealed many plot points that you won't want to know (while still managing to grasp nothing of what the book was about). My experience of the book was the unabridged audio book read by Frank Muller. There is some interpretation involved in any reading, which may not suit all listeners, but I thought Muller did a fantastic job of capturing voices and the rhythm of the story. A delight to listen to."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I picked this book off a list for my Adv. Lit summer homework because it was short and looked less dry and boring than the other ten or so choices. Normaly the 'good' literature chosen for english classes never fails to dissapoint me but All the Pretty Horses changed my stereotype. In fact I actually liked the book(oviously)even though I like neither westerns nor most national bestsellers. The plot could have used some speeding up, the unpersonal way it was told iritated me, the romance was pathetic and the untranslated spanish diologe was maddening. To be honest it was the way it was written that enthralled me. The way McCarthy captured compleatly the landscape, people, language and culture. He wrote some of the descriptions and realizations of the protagonist with such skill and deep meaning that it stoped me dead in my tracks. The descriptions were lenghthy but once I paid attention they were amazing. The very cadence of the words pulled me in. The sentences were long drawing on and on with a continuous stream of 'and the...'s but when i stoped careing what came next and acctually just took the book sentence by sentence it captavated me like no book has done before. I stoped careing about John Grady and only read the book for the words. It was an interesting experiance but one I recommend."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"At first I was worried that I would have to read &quot;All The Pretty Horses&quot; slowly to understand what was going on, but I quickly got into it, reading perhaps seventy pages in the first sitting and read the rest in less then a week. The simple, yet long sentences do require some adjustment and it can be frustrating to go through the Spanish dialogue, though usually enough clues are given to let readers figure out what is going on. McCarthy's use of dialogue is brilliant, especially his use of dialect and realistic conversations. I really wanted to know what would happen to Grady and Rawlins to the very end. Page turners are a rare occurence in contemporary novels. I was a little disappointed with the ending, I couldn't understand why Grady would risk his freedom to go get his horse. For a few pages it seemed like he was going to repeat the fatal mistake of Blevins. All it all, &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; is an excellent novel, well worth picking up and enjoying McCarthy's writing that often nears poetic, especially in his description of horses, which he seems have have an innate understanding of."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Mid-twentieth century, in a place simply \\"out there,\\" at a time when the American frontier faces invasions from highways and Ford trucks, two cowboys barely eighteen ride south across the border in an idyllic journey through the breathtaking landscape, described poetically by an author whose eye for the primal disposition of nature is superceded only by the sheer beauty of his writing. By happenstance, the young men are joined by a boy even younger than they, and as they ride further into the cruelly civilized world that the main character, John Grady Cole, has so often seen in his dreams, the pain of an unforgiving reality strikes at the boys' hearts as they, before our eyes, transform into men against a backdrop of innocence, maturity, and above all, a love borne from the grandest of circumstances.John Grady Cole soon finds himself struggling to survive in a setting that has transformed from serene and scenic to tumultuous and brutal, \\"a place where dreams are paid for in blood.\\""},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"If you're not into reading other languages and you can't speak Spanish then All the Pretty Horses is not for you. In the novel the author does not use the same writing techniques that we use in English. Instead he is more cultured and uses a Spanish style of writing. The book is about a young man named John Grady Cole. He travels down to Mexico to this hacienda and falls in love with the owner's daughter. He now must suffer all things that love can bring. The story is one of romance and adventure. The character is sent to a Mexican prison for killing someone in self-defense. This is just one of the many adventures that he encounters. The author has written many novels with this sort of cultured writing style. Overall the book was intriguing and exciting. It took you on a cowboy ride to Mexico and back. If you like reading about a young boy's life and like to read of love and action then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy is a skilled and talented linguist who knows just how to pull a reader into the world of the novel, enveloping them in a richness of language that is truly amazing.I admit, I haven't even finished this book yet, but I am so impressed by the writing that I couldn't wait. I have read two of McCarthy's other novels, Suttree and Child of God, and both demonstrated McCarthy's ability to create a vivid fictional world and characters, embuing them with such deep humanity. However, I've found that All the Pretty Horses so much wider and encompassing than the other two. Perhaps it is because the characters are young, touched with an idealism that had long escaped the characters in the other novels, they are more accessible and easier to understand. I've found this book impossible to put down, and would recommend it to anyone interested in a book that really draws the reader in...I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book for summer reading for an American Lit. course in high school, and at first I found it awfully boring... so I rushed through the novel.

He used more words to describe plains and grasses than Cole and Alejandra's relationship. However, the moral lesson was very realistic and moving."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"No way. He gave the book ONE star? idiot. Sometimes you may think that the only intelligent person in a group is the minority, right? Cause after all, when does the crowd know anything? well, let me tell you, that guy up there must really have the worst taste on earth not to like this one. I wont even write about what i love about this book. its been covered by plenty of other people here!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Briefly noted: McCarthy's body of work has thus far been compared to: Homer, Dante, Milton, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Melville, Faulkner, Joyce, Woolf. Among others. Need we explicate further?"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The center stage characters in this book are suppose to be ages 17 and 16. But they walk, talk andthink like worldly-wise old men. Totally unrealistic. I have never known nor even heard of a 16 y/othat sophisticated, that surefooted. You don't see full grown adults that cool and steadfast for christsakes! Especially when faced with death in a Mexican prison like these two where. Especially afterbeing beaten to a bloody pulp everyday forweeks on end, broken noses, jaw, broke out teeth, then stabbed! Come on! But old (young) JohnGrady takes it all in his stride, and goes back for more (the girl).Given their limited life experiences and schooling their is no way they could of accumulated such awide vocabulary and intellection.John Grady Cole's mom sells the ranch in TX so John (age 16) decides to ride his horse to Mexico.His parents (divorced) are each in their own little world which doesn't include John so he is on hisown. His best friend Rawlins comes along. Rawlins father/mother seems to share the same total lackof concern for their son as John's parents cuz ain't nobody come a looking for em. Again, totallyunbelievable cuz like I said these are two wise and wonderful kids. The type of child every parentdreams of having. 50 year old minds in 16 y/o bodies. What more could you ask for? No muss nofuss.Their trip is uneventful until Blevins a 14 y/o boy joins them.And what's with all this spitting? They didn't chew tobacco or anything but every time they openedtheir bloody mouths to speak they &quot;spat&quot; first. RidiculousHow this won the National Book Award in 1992 and why all the good reviews here is beyond me."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy's intentional misuse of written English is annoying and doesn't lend anything to the story. The decision to omit quotation marks is particularly perplexing since it diminishes the immediacy of the tale. The Spanish language quotes are excellent for adding flavor, but too lengthy and non-contextual for those of us who aren't bilingual. Attributes are insufficient to keep track of who is speaking. The story is one of the finest I've read- and I've read a lot of excellent books- but it's a shame the author didn't respect his readers enough to write so that his work was a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I was required to read this book this past year as a school assignment. First off it's rare for such a new book (it was only published 14 years ago) to be a school assignment (well at my school it is). I suppose that says something for this book. It's the easiest read but not bad. Rather boring in places. It leaves a lot of the story up in the air a little which I didn't like so much, and I definably found the end rather rushed. All in all, not my favorite book, but a good book in general."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"There are several books which I recall reading, being an english professor, none of which are this aggrivating. There are several objects of my disliking contained in the composition: nullified usage of quotations, run-on sentences, and the overwhelming ammount of conjunctions. Did this fellow fail English 101?"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Im sorry but I cant like this book, it is full of unending sentences, bad grammar and a society domanated by men, where women rareley have name and are only used for the plesure of men. The book is unrealistic and writen like it is a common for an seventeen year old to self cauterize a bullet wound with a burning hot gun barrel. I give MaCarthy credit for trying to make a poetic book but I just dont feel that you can romantasize throwing up, or use the word &quot;blood&quot; so many times. Although I do admit that the book did have many thought provoking conversations between Rawlins and John Grady Cole."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read the book, but don't recommend it. Why the two cowboys took off was not clear to me. They weren't doing anything constructive, like cattle drive, and had no destination in mind. Just took off and endured the desert.I did not like the way he broke horses. I've seen horses broke to saddle by the great Ray Hunt NEVER anything like hobbling them. I thought it was a pointless adventure. The more I read the less I liked the characters."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I was disappointed in the style of this book. I had just read \\"Water for Elephants\\" and was blown away. The reviews I read lead me to this author and the above book. The story line is good however he is slow to develop it. I appreciate discriptive text however a paragraph (or more) it seems to descibbe a dry river bed is a bit much especially when there is one on every page. Alas the last 1/3 of the book will go unread. And I will search for the next W.F.E."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Adventure is most often described as exciting, romantic, dangerous, suspenseful, mysterious, and unforgettable. In the world today not many people are able to experience an event such as this, but I know two people who are that lucky. In Cormac McCarthy's book All The Pretty Horses, John Grady Cole and his closest friend Lacey Rawlins ride horseback through a timeless adventure. While they travel from Texas to Mexico the reader gets sucked into the story to go along for the ride. When I first read this book, I thought the author's style was poor and unorganized, but my opinion began to change because the story is spectacular! The writer's tone is excited, because in every paragraph things are rapidly changing and it is a heart-racing event just trying to keep up with what is about to happen. My favorite character is John Grady Cole because I admire him for his honesty, dignity, loyalty, and courage. In the story, John Grady is introduced to a young, adolescent boy named Blevins. The boy wants to join John and Rawlins on their journey, however Rawlins is opposed to the very idea. John Cole allows the boy to ride with them to Texas and after some time he becomes fond of Blevins. I think that John Grady sees his reflection in Blevins and he understands the boy. John Grady Cole reminds me of my grandfather, because during his lifetime my grandfather was an honest man who was caring and considerate of others. I admire them both for their meritorious characteristics and hope that I too, may learn from their behavior. Later in the book, times get tough and the future looks worse and worse. However in all the conflicting troubles, never does John Grady give up. My favorite quote is when John and Rawlins are in jail and John is talking to an administrator named Perez. \\"It is not that he is stupid. It is that his picture of the world is incomplete. In this rare way. He looks only where he wishes to see\\" (Perez 192). I believe that this saying applies to life today. Perez is basically saying that stupidity is only looking at what one wants to see instead of what there is to see. Maybe if people would try looking beyond the obvious and taking a deeper understanding, the world might be a better place. In conclusion, the most important thing about this book is the adventure. Adventure is not only parachuting from airplanes or scuba diving in Hawaii. I think the main thing the writer is trying to say is that life is an adventure in itself and one can make it memorable if one tries. My advice to the reader is to have fun and enjoy this western extravaganza. It is a vacation from the chores of daily life. It is an excellent book!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This book was a waste of time to read. The boring plot along with the long-winded sentences made it absolutely trecherous to read. The lack of quotation marks, lack of character definition, and an uninteresting plot caused me to despise this book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I thought the book was rather hard to understand and extremely slow-moving. The author didn't use quotation marks when characters spoke, and he used Spanish in dialogue.

Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought \\"What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it.

I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE!!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Adventure, full-hearted love, revenge, the majestic wilderness, and of course horses: the western-movie staples are what moves this novel. Yet if All The Pretty Horses is a classic cowboy story, it is also that of a dying world, and all the more accessible to us that it is set in the post-war era.John Grady Cole, a young man of 16 years, leaves the country for Mexico together with his friend Lacey Rawlins, both on horseback, in search of a life that has become inaccessible to them in Texas. A cruel but romantic saga of tests and tribulations awaits them - which I won't spoil by giving too much of it.The dialogues are suitably laconic. The characters are frank and unambiguous, except for one key exception. Nature is reserved the richer, more complex, and admiring language. While the novel begins at a slow pace, making the reader wonder whether this is really a back-to-the-wild story, the action later quickens to a satisfyingly gripping climax. One warning: a good part of the dialogue is in Spanish, untranslated; though this won't throw you off the plot, if you don't understand Spanish, it may get annoying."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I will not be able to add much at all to the hundreds more articulate reviews. Nevertheless, I will write this novel is refreshing, beautifully written, and leads the reader down many intriguing paths. I hastily look forward to enjoying the two remaining Border trilogy installments."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A complete plumbing of the depths of this book has not been done. What exactly this book means is perhaps known only to the author. On the backdrop of a couple of Texas cowboys exploring Mexico, and getting into trouble in the process, there is a lot going on. At one point Alejandra's aunt delivers a long monologue in which she describes a worker at the mint placing the blank slug randomly one way or the other, so that the resulting coin, seemingly random of itself, is merely the product of an earlier random act. And so ad infinitum. True to form, McCarthy describes it all with a beautiful control of descriptive language, from the dry desert to the knifefight to the horses. If you enjoy McCarthy, this book will not disappoint you. If you have never read him before, this is as good a place as any to start."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I cherished the slow rides across the desert with the rich imagry and the long contemplations about life, love and God (which might be horses?). There are few explantions -- things happen because that's the way they are and answers either come much later or perhaps never at all. Life in this time requires complete trust in oneself and patience. It is a much different world than we live in today with our constant need for answers and information - perhaps that is why the book seemed like such an escape. All of this is illustrated through the story of John Cole and Lacey Rawlins and their sometimes companion Blevins and their trek through Mexico. I have yet to come across another author who's style, prose and imagry can compare to McCarthy's. I am a desert worshiper and appreciate that McCarthy captures so well, and helped to show me more, the bounty of life and beauty that the desert holds."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book in High School, about 8 years ago. When the movie came out a couple years later, I had to go see it because I had such fond memories of the book. Now, I am recommending it to my book club as our next book to read. Not many books I remember fondly all the way from high school, but this is one of them."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses reveals the fate of a young man trying to live his life by a code no longer recognized by the world. His personal integrity is based on his ability to follow through with his commitments to himself and others and to honor the values his western lifestyle forged by his West Texas upbringing. His lack of close relationships with females taints his view of love and when his survival depends on his willingness to kill, he struggles with the morality of living a life based on survival of the fittest. His journey toward manhood and choosing his own destiny is fraught with loneliness, moral dilemnas, and cruel lessons about human nature and survival. The best and worst of human nature is exposed in this bildungsromain by McCarthy. His style is difficult to follow but the beautiful prose more than makes up for his lack of speaker tags, punctuation, and quotation marks. This book is a treasure worth seeking out and discovering!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarhty paints a wonderful landscape across the border In All The Pretty Horses. This book by Cormac Mccarthy is a great book about the coming of age of 16 year old John Grady Cole. Like most coming of Age stories it is not particulary fast pased or thrilling. It is instead a book that slowly draws you into the characters journey and lets you along for the ride.It dosen't take long for you to cheer for the good hearted characters the McCarthy brilliantly portrays in his book. a would recommed this book to anyone as long as you have a little patience, as they will find that could things come to those who wait in all The Pretty Horses."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A story of two teenagers who embark on a world full of adventure, love and cruelty are faced with numerous obstacles that transform the young teens from kids to adults. Set in the olden days of cowboys, John Grady Cole and a friend decide to leave their homes and travel to Mexico. Cormac McCarthy's ability as a writer flourishes throughout this narrative. His ability to show the struggle of John Grady Cole being forced to become a mature young adult makes this story that much more interesting to read. His intense desciption of events as they occur allows the readers to vividly picture what is going on. His choice of using a foreign language, Spanish, and his lengthy syntax adds to the realism of this adventure John Grady and his friends decide to engage in."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I loved this book from beginning to end. What I was expecting to happen didn't happen at all nor did it end how I wanted it to. However, given the time period and circumstances, I am very pleased with the author's ending. The author did a great job portraying everything and he had very good descriptiveness. This book deserves 5-stars. Nice Job Cormac McCarthy!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Even if you've seen the movie, read the book -- for language that is gorgeous but doesn't get in the way of an adventure story limned with tenderness."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I found this book an effort to read. Confusing at the start, yet did grab me midway but I was ready to discard with about 1/3 left, but thought better of it and completed. Yes, his writing is very descriptive and captures the essence of every sense the reader needs to be placed within the story. However, it just seemed to skip and jumble along, the ending wasn't anything like the many my mind conjured up, it wasn't really anything special at all...Grady continued on rambling as did the book. I perhaps need to read another of his works to get a better grasp of the talent of this writer, as so many have applauded his style."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"ALL THE PRETTY HORSES is about the beauty of horses, the pain of making irrevocable decisions -- especially where love is concerned, the implacability of honor, and the darkness that is at the heart of the Mexican temperament. It is an unusual combination, but one that works surprisingly well.John Grady Cole and Lacey Rawlins are young cowpunchers who escape the postwar breakup of the range to head for one of the giant Mexican latifundos where one can ride a week before reaching the next estancia. Their work with horses and cattle is pure lyricism, such as the episode where the two promise to break sixteen wild mares in four days to get in good with ranch owner Don Hector and also for the sheer love of it.Their idyll is broken twice, once by the irresponsible young Jimmy Blevins who insists on tagging along with them and causing a broad swath of disaster in his wake, and the other time by John Grady's falling in love in Alejandra, the ranch owner's daughter. There is a sinister linkage effected when the outraged rancher has the Federales pick up Cole and Rawlins as suspected accessories to Blevins's crimes.For me, the culminating moment of the novel comes when McCarthy writes: &quot;He thought that in the beauty of the world were hid a secret. He thought the world's heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world's pain and its beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for the vision of a single flower.&quot;Cole and Rawlins's crossing of the Rio Grande was to be their initiation into a terrible knowledge whose consequences they barely escape with their lives. Blevins, on the other hand, is killed; and Alejandra, dishonored in the eyes of her family.A very powerful and very great novel!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book when it first came out, so it's been awhile. However, I remember that I did not enjoy it. It actually didn't do anything for me. The writing was irritating - the incredibly long sentences and the intermittent Spanish. Half the time I didn't know which character was talking. I kept putting it down... it definitely did not hold my interest. I couldn't get into the characters at all, nor did I care much about them. When I finished the book, for me it was just over. Absolutely no effect. I bought it because it won the National Book Award and, needless to say, was disappointed. However, I also bought Snow Falling On Cedars because it won the award, and I absolutely loved it. It's been interesting to me to read how many people loved All The Pretty Horses. I guess that's what makes life interesting. Things get drawn to people differently. By the way, I love westerns and own a horse, so it definitely wasn't the content that turned me off. Maybe one day I'll re-read it and see if it affects me differently."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a modern western (1949). Young 16-year old John Grady Cole has become the lost generation of the Grady family with his grandfather's death. He hoped to remain on the family's East Texas ranch and work cattle and horses, but his parents problems cause the ranch to be sold and he is on his own. He and his friend, Rawlins, take off for Mexico hoping to be cowboys on a ranch there. On the way, they are joined by a younger boy, Blivens, who has a great horse, is fast with a gun and very rebellious--the instigation of much trouble for John Grady and Rawlins. Once in Mexico, they lose young Blevins and eventually locate on a ranch where they are happy. John Grady gets involved with the rancher's daughter (Of course, this is not an approved relationship.) and eventually, he and his friend are turned over to police who take them to prison where they again meet up with their nemesis, Blivens.This book is beautifully written with much vivid description. Much time is spent describing emotions of various characters, and McCarthy aptly describes the good and kindly poor Mexicans as well as the cruel and evil ones with a little authority. He has the Mexicans speak in Spanish, which John Grady understands, but often, the Spanish passages are so long that the non-Spanish speaking reader cannot make sense of what is being said. I came away feeling depressed and not sure of exactly what was happening in too many places."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Every professional critic lauded this book as a great modern day western classic and perhaps it is.I was looking forward to reading this acclaimed novel by Cormac McCarthy, but found the going extremely difficult on a number of counts. Some of the sentences are over half a page long so that by the time you reach the end, the beginning has faded into the distant past. The absence of inverted commas to denote the spoken word was hard to get used to, often requiring a revisit to check if the passage just read was conversation or narrative. The final obstacle for me, even though it helped to conjure up the surroundings, was the frequent use of Spanish.Now for the positives. The story has a good plot with two charismatic leading characters who head off into a foreign land in search of freedom, but who discover adventure, romance, violence, hardship and tragedy along the way. The descriptions of the mountains, plains, storms and rivers of Mexico are excellent, so the atmosphere of that land is always floating there alongside the developing story. The love scenes and the prison scenes provide contrasting moments of relaxation and tension for the reader. Reading is a wonderful way to discover new words and even though it is purely imaginative, the word &quot;blivet&quot; on page 46 of the paperback edition, is now part of my vocabulary, albeit changed to suit the person with whom I am talking.&quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; has only recently been released as a movie and I would expect this to be one of those very rare exceptions where the movie is better than the book. I look forward to finding out."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The themes are important and well played out: religion, free will v. predestination, love, patriarchy, initiation, violence, Latin American history, language, and culture, sex, bravery. I am not annoyed with the Spanish. I am not annoyed by the vacillation between terse dialogue and lengthy prose. I am not annoyed by the excessive use of conjunctions, the lack of punctuation, or the tediousness of working through the syntax and recongnizing the underlying messages. I have been studying literature long enough to have learned patience and appreciation, even if I don't particularly enjoy a novel.But what I can't stand is when a novelist is a blatant thief. McCarthy shamelessly and directly plagiarizes phrases from Faulkner, the untouchable Southern writer-- not just in style, as some have recognized, but in actual phrases, especially from &quot;The Sound and the Fury.&quot; Further, he is &quot;influenced&quot; a bit too much by Hemingway's read-between-the-lines dialogue for me.I give McCarthy kudos for reviving a much satirized genre of the mythic American cowboy, and for addressing important issues such as the aforementioned. But when he steals from established and revered authors such as Hemingway and Faulkner, I can't give him more than a tepid pat on the back."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses is an intriguing story about John Grady Cole's journey to find the only lifestyle he knows. When his mother decides to use their ranch to searh for oil, John and his buddy, Lacey Rawlings, set out for Mexico to search for the ways of their youth. Along the way they run into all sorts of trouble and find themselves struggling to stay alive. There is also the forbidden love affair between John Grady and Alejandra, the daughter of a very important mexican cattle rancher, to add to the excitment. By the end of the novel the two boys discover that thier search for a more &quot;simple&quot; life is actually the most complicated journey they will ever experience. McCarthy did an outstanding job of writing this piece. McCarthy was out to write a thrilling novel about love, violece, and horses. With the combination of all three, along with his descriptive writing it is no suprise to see why this book won numerous awards."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I've been told that other McCarthy novels are better, but having started with this one, I have not been inspired to explore his oeuvre any further. My annoyance with this book probably has something to do with its being vastly overrated. I picked it up expecting, based on what I'd heard, to be astonished on every page, only to come away from it bored and puzzled. What is everyone so excited about? The plot is thoroughly conventional, the prose is some kind of dried-up, left-over concoction made up of one part Faulkner and two parts Hemingway, and McCarthy has a bad habit of constantly singing the praises (in his chiseled, understated way) of his insipid hero, John Grady Cole -- what a horseman! -- all based on an antiquated and irrelevant code of manhood, or something. Who cares?"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I had trouble at the start of the book. McCarthy's prose style came on too strong for me at first, and I put it down twice before I finally powered through the beginning (something about the beginning just hit me the wrong way).McCarthy is a brilliant writer. I especially loved his descriptions of the landscape."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This was the novel I expected to hate. Well - not really hate; after all, it was written by a very gifted and much praised author. But I just kept putting off reading it based on those silly blurbs from the publisher. So...reluctantly, I bought it, and began to read it. It started off slow (I really hate when others say that about a great book...but); however, my interest continued to build. What really held my attention was, in the beginning at least, McCarthy's prose. Yes, he breaks all the rules, and yes I am rather hung up on grammar and solecisms, but when your prose becomes poetry, you just can't argue with how it's done. I fell in love with the book. I was lulled by not only the fine writing style, but also by the mood and tone of the novel. I had travelled though Texas and stayed in Saltillo many years ago so I felt at home with the setting in a way. I read \\"The Road\\" and loved it but somehow felt this book was not comparable. I was right; it was even better, although you shouldn't compare apples to oranges. This is a credit to McCarthy's versatility as a writer. In the end - \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" was a great story which made it a winner, along with its other fine qualities. It is certainly worthy of the accolades it received."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"There is probably a little of John Grady Cole in all of us. At 16, Cole sets out to define the world for himself. With buddy Lacey Rawlins, the pair leave Texas on horseback for Mexico and new adventure. Cole has the desire many have to have been born in an earlier, simpler time. He and his traveling companion quickly find themselves in situations that today's young man couldn't handle and he winds up fighting for his life while, both physically and emotionally. His fight is to stay alive and return to his new love.McCarthy's writing has the ability to make you feel you are listening to John Grady Cole tell his story. McCarthy's decision to use the uneducated grammar patterns of a youngster from West Texas and his ability to describe both feelings and impressions leave you seeing the trails Cole rides and imaging the people he is fighting for and against.McCarthy's writing style and the story itself makes it easy to understand why this book won national awards. It's easier still to understand why everyone will enjoy reading this great story of a young man growing up painfully hard and fast."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This first novel in Cormac McCarthy's &quot;Border Trilogy&quot; is not one's typical Western tale of Indians and cowboys. I originally began to read All the Pretty Horses very reluctantly for my AP English Literature class in high school. However, the plot washed away all of my qualms. The protagonist, sixteen-year-old John Grady Cole, loses his father to illness and his beloved ranch to legal pettiness. With his friend Lacey Rawlins, he travels by horseback across the Rio Grande into Mexico in search of work and adventure. While they finally find work breaking horses on a hacienda of a wealthy hacendado, Cole and Rawlins also find romance and great trouble. While the plot is exciting, the actual story is not merely centered on horses and danger. It focuses more on a boy's coming of age and how he comes to terms with the choices he has made. McCarthy's style paints a wonderful picture of hacienda life in Mexico without using florid language and makes John Grady's tale an absorbing one. I recommend this National Book Award winner to anyone."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Open ALL THE PRETTY HORSES to a random page and you're likely encounter a classic cowboy sensibility. This emanates from McCarthy's hero, John Grady Cole, as well as from Cole's interaction with his friend Rawlins. To simplify somewhat, McCarthy captures these characters as men, competent in their responsibilities, sound in judgment, and experienced with guns and horses. As a bonus, they have laconic cowboy-style conversations--Yep.... Nope--that are often funny and surprisingly profound. All this works... provided the reader forgets that Cole is 16 and Rawlins is 17.Remember the movieRio Bravo? Well, in HORSES, McCarthy has placed the sensibility of the Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) into the body of Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson). This makes for a slightly weird book, with its often beautiful realism shadowed by Cole's impossible maturity.Of course, it's unfair to criticize an author for the book he didn't write. Still, I don't see why McCarthy had to make his hero and sidekick so young. McCarthy could have explored the same rich mine of themes--the search for the ideal of the American West, the power of individual integrity, the resourcefulness of certain men, the complex interfacing of cultures, and institutional violence--just as well with Cole and Rawlins, and their errant buddy Jimmy Blevins, at a credible 40. Yes, there's a young-love subplot in HORSES. But with adjustments (add a hot older woman), McCarthy could have managed this successfully. So, I wonder: Was McCarthy thinking ahead as he wrote HORSES, seeing the need to keep Cole young to write hisThe Border Trilogy: All the Pretty Horses, the Crossing, Cities of the Plain (Everyman's Library)? Or, does he just work best when a major character is a teenager or child?This is my third Cormac McCarthy novel. IMHO,Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West (Modern Library)is a masterpiece, with McCarthy telling the story of the Glanton Gang so that its violence has epic and profound reach. Similarly, The Road told a story of survival--maybe, after a nuclear apocalypse--in which the most basic achievements have deep reverberations. For depth in HORSES, McCarthy relies, in part, on an amazing monologue by the character Alfonsa, who tells stories of her Mexico, where unjustified and terrible violence lurks beneath a polished and civil veneer. Definitely, Alfonsa's Mexican interpretation is a valid overview of Cole's story. Even so, McCarthy finally shows Cole to be American, who decides (SPOLIER ALERT!) that the best resolution of his Mexican experience is to return to Texas with his property.ALL THE PRETTY HORSES is definitely a worthwhile read and features plenty of McCarthy's usual elegance and eloquence. A slightly strange novel but recommended."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Once again Cormac McCarthy demonstrates that he is one of the finest novelists in the English language, a master of description. His use of the language is poetic, descriptive, and unique. I found myself continually amazed at the metaphors and descriptions that McCarthy uses, built into sentences that flow and sway with the tides of the narrative, evoking long hidden insights about the human condition which centers of the human tragedy of existence. His work resonates with that of Melville, Faulkner, and Hemingway. Like Melville in Moby Dick, he experiences the tragedy of humanity, evolved beyond the other animals cognitively just enough to realize we are not God. Like Faulkner's bleak view of the defeated Southern USA, he invents and resurrects language, twists language and words, and makes juxtapositions that astound. Like Hemingway, he has an economy of description, giving just enough, making each paragraph a sprint to the finish line. I read at least 24 books a year and McCarthy has become my favorite living author. In this book, All the Pretty Horses, his considerable talents carry us on a terrifying journey of painful experiences and continual resurrection of the will to move forward.The journey, the trip, the odyssey, the quest is a very common armature in the novel form. It is expected that those on the journey will change in some manner. It is expected that they will meet a broad range of characters and experience a vast number of adventures, all of which shape and mold the characters and entertain the reader. In this regard, All the Pretty Horses is exactly on the money. It delivers. It is a bit more sophisticated than the typical coming of age story, even though the story is primarily about a young 16 year old man. To me it seemed that the story was more about how terrible challenges pull out the man in the boy rather than creates a man out of a boy, or at least this was my impression of All the Pretty Horses.There are passages of the book that are extremely beautiful, especially the description of Cole and Rawlins taming wild horses, one after another, all day long and into the evening, just to show they can accomplish this feat.McCarthy also demonstrates a post-modern influence in that he allows an elderly Mexican aristocratic woman to offer a long and complex narrative into the very center of the novel, shifting from the bleak, truncated narratives of the teenage boys to the philosophical and sophisticated narrative of this elderly women, still engaged in power and influence.Like many novels by McCarthy, we meet a character that seems like something out of mythology, and in the character of Jimmy Blevins, the 14 year old sharp shooting, horse stealing runaway trouble magnet, we are given a dose of this character that brings tragedy down upon all the other characters. Blevins, afraid of Jupiter's lightening, seems to evoke trouble everywhere he goes, with the effect that he seems like a curse upon his fellow man.McCarthy is a pleasure to read, his poetic dark music cuts deep, assuring us that it really is bad out there and survival is not a joke. But both physical and emotional and spiritual survival are all impacted in the worlds created by McCarthy and the one thing we can be assured of in his universe is that we will get bruised. In fact, we will be lucky if it is just bruises."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"John Grady Cole is a cowboy at heart. After his grandfather dies, he learns that his utopian vision of growing up on the ranch, with a good wife and all the pretty horses is dying with it. His mother is an only child, who upon inheriting the ranch decides to sell it, having little interest in the old life. John Grady finds nothing left for him in Texas and rides away on horseback with his pal, Lacey Rawlins, across the border into Mexico.Prior to their crossing, they are joined by a younger boy named Blevins, who is a mystery in himself. The two young men doubt his age, his name and his ownership of the horse he's riding, yet they allow him to travel into Mexico with them. John Grady's ideology is confronted with reality in Mexico as he is met face to face with events that trigger the deepest of human emotions: forbidden love, imprisonment and death of those close to him.At one point in the novel, Rawlins tells John Grady, \\"\\"Pretty women and pretty horses are more trouble than they are worth. All a man needs is one that will get the job done.\\" Many others try to counsel John Grady to neglect his ideal visions of the future in favor of reality, but he does not concede (even when faced with death).Cormac McCarthy articulates a wonderful story of a young man's coming of age in a world that refuses to grant his cowboy vision. I am increasingly becoming convinced that Cormac McCarthy is the greatest of the living contemporary authors today, and certainly _All the Pretty Horses_ is no exception."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I have looked at some of the reviews here, and am a bit surprised as the number of people who hated this book. It is a challenge to read, but this is no \\"Ulysses.\\" The main themes can be understood with a little careful attention. Some have compared McCarthy's style to Hemingway's but this is not a fair comparision. McCarthy's prose is far more complex. Hemingway wrote arresting prose, but at times his minimalist style was cartoonish. McCarthy is simple the way Picasso is simple -- that is to say, only if you do not look hard enough.McCarthy's skill with language is unequalled among living American authors. It is the language that is the star of this book, and if you cannot appreciate the language itself the story will not bear the weight. Yes, I found myself re-reading passages and puzzling out the construction of some sentences, but I did it with the same pleasure a sports fan looks at a replay of a spectacular play. This is a book for the patient. Not every book pays off like a James Bond novel."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy was born in Rhode island and grew up in Tennessee, but now lives in Tesuque, New Mexico. He is viewed by many as one of the more unusual and most talented of the current American writers. For example, Harold Bloom has written a number of things about McCarthy.Some describe Mccarthy as a loner. Coincidentally, that is what one might call the protagonist in the present novel: John Grady. The novel is set in the 1950s time period and Grady is a young man or mature boy caught between the horse and buggy days of the old west and the new west connected by modern highways. Grady has a fascination for horses and is a talented rider.The story is about two men who ride their horses into Mexico and work as ranch hands in Mexico. It is part love story and part a tale of justice and adventure, i.e.: Grady meets a woman in Mexico. The protagonist is a sympathetic character and most readers will find it to be a compelling read.Some might not like it for the prose. The prose is complicated by design. I thought the first thirty pages were sometimes a bit awful but effective as well, but then McCarthy lightens up a bit on his writing. He reminded me a bit of the opening of Farewell to Arms where Hemingway tries to set the mood through the use of prose: Hemingway uses a narrative of the natural surroundings. McCarthy uses expressions such as \\"the sun sat blood red and elliptic,\\" and these seem out of place when compared to the spartan dialogue of a father and son talking over a breakfast of eggs and coffee.Also, McCarthy uses what is called polysyndeton, or the use of several conjunctions in close succession, especially where some might be omitted. It is a stylistic scheme used to slow down the tempo. As pointed out by others, polysyndeton is used extensively in the King James Version of the Bible. For example:\\"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\\" Genesis 7:22-24One of the best parts in the book - and exceptional writing by the way - is where he describes a dream in the middle of the book about horses running free on a plain and he does so in 18 continuous lines with no punctuation.So, this is based on some universal themes, set in Texas and Mexico, and has some interesting and complicated prose. Once you get passed page 30 to 50, it is a novel that is hard to put down. I read most of the novel in an evening.Highly recommended page turner: 5 stars."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses is what I would imagine it would be like if Ernest Hemingway wrote a modern-day Western. Very rich language and vivid imagery, yet simple and direct dialogue. Not an especially complex plot and nothing unnecessary throughout, yet very deep emotionally. I'm eagerly making my way through the rest of the Border Trilogy and finding McCarthy a little more verbose and allegorical in The Crossing, but All the Pretty Horses has no wasted words in telling a fantastic story."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy redefines the Homeric hero in ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, a novel which places him in the company of Melville, Faulkner, Twain, Morrison and Hemingway. McCarthy's protagonist, John Grady Cole, understands completely the lesson of Santiago in Hemingway's greatest work, THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA: to transcend time and experience, you have to journey beyond your deepest fears, embrace your destiny, and carry your dream. Even when the journey places you in imminent danger of losing your life, it is the truth of the journey which teaches lessons that are profound and life-transforming, lessons which can only be learned once we, like Odysseus, make the journey. To see beyond you have to go beyond, and once you go beyond, the vision before you will change your life completely. The ancient Greeks believed that a Homeric hero must have &quot;arete,&quot; meaning excellence in all things--see ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE for Pirsig's brilliant interpretation of arete in the modern era. And in ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, McCarthy does many things masterfully, but, quite possibly, none so masterfully as his portrayal of John Grady Cole, who is convincing, selfless, and truly in the Homeric tradition. Of course, many a literature professor will say there is no such thing as a Homeric hero in modern literature. And that's why they are paid to teach novels, not write them. Five stars is not enough. Cole's journey is no accident, and neither is McCarthy's command of the American language in this novel. Nowhere in contemporary American fiction is there a voice as compelling and lyrical as McCarthy's. Viva McCarthy!!!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This one deserves an extra star. Beautiful is all I can say to this wonderful novel. This marvellous book has it all. The adventure and the tension is described in a way that makes you part of it. Cormac McCarthy's use of language is wonderful. Like a wave he sometimes describes things, a situation to the tiniest detail - but only for a few seconds. Then the wave drops down on you and he lets you roll within his and your imagination. The nature, the horses, even the romance; you're there and it won't let you go. A novel to reread again and again."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All The Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy is a beautifully written novel. His great attention to detail and vivid imagery create scenes that come to life, jumping right out of the page. Reader's experience stunning imagery such as: \\"Shrouded in the black thunderheads the distant lightning glowed mutely like welding seen through foundry smoke. As if repairs were under way at some flawed place in the iron dark of the world.\\" This kind of description is unlike any other novel I have read and this is what made the story most enjoyable for me.When I first began to read this book I was shocked by McCarthy's sentence structure. I was on the second page and had just come to my attention that I had read nearly half a page and gone through three sentences. I did not think I could go on reading a book like this, but I became used to it and I began to appreciate his syntax. Although any stickler may not appreciate McCarthy's usage of punctuation, or lack there of, the long lines flow off the page in a poetic fashion. The poetic feel of McCarthy's writing adds to the experience seen through the eyes of two young men searching for meaning in their lives.I also enjoyed John Grady and Rawlins' perpetual adventure riding their horses through the rugged Mexican Landscape. Never was there a dull moment in the story. Whether Grady and Rawlins were stealing back a horse, dodging bullets, or chasing after a girl, there was always something going on. Any reader who likes stories of western adventures or of adventures in general will enjoy McCarthy's skilled telling of two young men's adventure through Mexico."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses is a book of power. Following the death of his grandfather and the sudden collapse of his hopes for a traditional ranch life, the young hero John Grady Cole embarks on an ill fated odyssey south of the border, accompanied by his best friend. Disillusioned and mourning in a sense not just for his grandfather, but for a way of life under threat of erosion by more modern values, the young man casts all to the four winds to seek adventure for the hell of it. There is no clear plan. They cross the border on horseback and enter what at times seems like an alien world. There is an almost surreal quality about the narrative, as if the young men are caught up in some shamanic vision quest, an unspoken drive toward manhood. The dialogue is spare and to the point. Cormac McCarthy is a master of detail and makes the very landscape speak for him. At times his prose borders on the poetic, and indeed there is a dionysian quality about the novel, a sense of danger and impending tragedy. It's no surprise that the book was turned into a film, for it is very visual, sharp as a duelling knife and panoramic in its imagery, but ultimately it must be enjoyed for itself. Only the reader can interpret the spirit of it in a way that suits them personally. This is the Old West in modern times, with all the epic sights and sounds, and the author uses them to punctuate the tension - the stomp of a hoof, a wary eye on the horizon, the smell of worn leather.Enter a young runaway with an unstable nature, a doomed love affair, and the ugly shadow of death, and John Grady's adventure quickly turns sour. Back to the wall, he faces the only choice open to the traditional western hero - to ride away or even the score. John Grady chooses the latter.At the end of the trail, crossing the border back into Texas, he presents an image of a bygone era to the baffled individuals he initially encounters, an image of tradition, honour and unshakeable attachment to the old world and the land.This is a novel you read and read again for different insights every time, a story that should stir the restless heart of the wild in all of us."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"ALL THE PRETTY HORSES is the first book of Cormac McCarthy's \\"Border Trilogy\\", a series of novels set on the US-Mexico border in the years around World War II. At its heart, it is the story of John Grady Cole, who on the eve of manhood leaves Texas, where his family's ranch has just been sold, for Mexico where he hopes to find work. Accompanying him is his best friend Rawlins, and as they are crossing the border they are joined by a younger boy who calls himself Jimmy Blevins. In Mexico they find work on a ranch owned by a rich family. John Grady falls in love with the ranch owner's daughter, but while this is a meaningful part of the novel, the work as a whole is not a mere love story.Behind its \\"horse opera\\" plot, ALL THE PRETTY HORSES is about many other things. It is a paean to the ranching life that was disappearing in the late 1940s. It is also an exploration of the simple values of people with a greater connection to the land, where transgressions are attoned for with blood and where adversity is constant.This was the first work by McCarthy that I have read, and his style is quite individual. He does not use much in the way of quotation marks or punctuation, so his writing approximates stream of consciousness. He also is fond of similes, especially strikingly odd ones for this genre. At one point, for example, the protagonist sees another awaiting him sitting under a tree, who looks \\"like some figure in meditation.\\" Much of the dialogue is left in Spanish, which makes for a great authenticity, and readers will get much more out of the book if they have some knowledge of the language. McCarthy's style is indeed peculiar, but it makes for pleasant reading, and I look forward to moving on to the subsequent volumes in this trilogy."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"\\"All the Pretty Horses\\" is a deceptive title for this book, since no matter how beautiful the setting in which a scene takes place, violence is never far away. Although there is beauty in the form of horses, an untamed western landscape, and a (doomed) love affair, evil and ugliness abound in the coming-of-age tale of John Grady Cole. On a trip that changes the rest of his life, Cole goes from teenager to survivor to hero, becoming a hardened but wise man along the way.I'm stunned by some readers' dismal views on \\"All the Pretty Horses,\\" because I think it is one of the most beautiful, lyrical novels I have ever read. McCarthy's writing style is a bit tough to adjust to--yes, he does have a propensity for the word \\"and,\\" a clear resentment of quotation marks, and an odd habit of making compound words out of everything (i.e., \\"candleflame\\")--but these are things I had no trouble adjusting to. Alas, I even enjoyed McCarthy's quirks as a welcome departure from the formulaic, mass-produced fiction that currently dominate bookstores' shelves (\\"Da Vinci Code,\\" anyone?). Though the whole boy-grows-into-a-man concept has been done repeatedly, few do it more effectively or captivatingly than McCarthy here. Your literary repertoire is incomplete without \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\""},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I loved this book. The novel is about a young man and his friend who set out across the border of Texas and Mexico to become horse wranglers. However, their ideas of life in Mexico are abruptly changed through the happenings of romance, danger, and suspense. McCarthy has a great writing style that grips you into the novel. Through his dramatic descriptions of the Texas and Mexico ranch and trail life and his elaborate discussions of honor and reason, 16 year old, John Grady Cole, grabs you into the novel with the gripping sensation of you wanting to continue reading to find out what happens next. McCarthy's style includes no punctuation, making it hard to follow, but is written well enough to grip the reader into reading on to find out the next dialogue sequence and the changing detail of the scenery. McCarthy deals with major themes such as: honor, religion, and death. For a boy of 16, these areas are hard to understand. Death takes a hard toll on a person regardless of age, however; it affects a younger age more so because they do not know how to handle the problem. Honor is an acceptance of manhood and maturity. As the novel develops, Cole is described as growing up and maturing. He knows honor to be held as sticking by his friend, Lacey Rawlins, and standing up for his rights and what he believes in. Religion is also a hard topic because a boy changes so much in his teen years that he has many doubts and fears of what truly exists. I highly recommend this novel to anyone that likes western novels with romance and gunplay."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Elegiac, frightening, and at times rarely beautiful, this National Book Award-winning novel is Faulknerian in its style while rooted in the tradition of the great Western.McCarthy's biggest triumphs here are his remarkable descriptions of the barren Mexican landscape - a kaleidoscope of color, lights, and shadows. Part III, which takes place in a Mexican prison, is also particularly gripping.It takes a few pages to get into the flow of the characters and plot. It also doesn't help that McCarthy doesn't use quotation marks to separate dialogue from prose, but once you become acclimated to his writing style, this ceases to be a distraction or a source of confusion.My only real criticism is that I found the 4th part a little ponderous and perhaps a little too bogged down in description. While my attention didn't flag, I found myself wishing the author would just get on with it. But the ending is truly moving and the overall reading experience is one you are not likely to forget any time soon.Now let's see how the movie turns out."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A western, coming of age novel, a transformation from innocence to road-worn. One quality remains unchanged throughout this story of two young men that leave their home in Texas for adventures in Mexico, friendship. McCarthy's Mexico is a vast other-world with it well described life styles of the vaqueros and the breaking of wild horses. The prose is sparse and haunting, prompting the reader to use their imagination. A refreshing approach from the contemporary American way of reveal it all in the most graphic and shocking detail. The story is intense and riveting, I couldn't put it down. All the big themes are depicted here: friendship, maturation, love, survival and family. It did remind me of Faulkner's work, in that, the story unfolds in a series of almost orchestral movements. An important author who should not be missed."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"If you like westerns and good ol' boy characters then this book is for you. In many ways this book resembles a western style DANTE'S INFERNO. ALL THE PRETTY HORSES was assigned to me in an English class and I finished the book way ahead of schedule. I found it very interesting, especialy the romantic aspect. The book is broken into four sections. The first section could be characterized as a withering garden. The second section is the new garden, while the third section is excile from the new garden into a sort of hell. The fourth section is purgatory, or a cleansing of the main characters soul. I recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormack McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses seemed somewhat too affected for my tastes. His hero is somewhat one-dimensional and there is a sense of a desperate search for significance within the novel - in the end most of the themes appear trite and I could not convince myself that this novel was very significant at all. McCarthy's The Crossing is a much better novel - a more finely tuned existential treatise, but still with too many stale ideas"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a fantastic story - powerful, amusing, and moving.

It is an excellent &quot;story&quot;. I loved the intertwined languages and often encourage my students using that format. The Spanish vocabulary is wonderful!

They find it through a series of adventures that take them deep into Mexico and back again. Skilled with horses, they wind up working at a horse ranch owned by a wealthy family. Cole falls in love with the daughter, but despite the respect he's earned from her father, the family intervenes, and Cole is arrested and put in jail. On his way back to freedom, he has to fight for his life, his love, his friendships, and his horse.This book is more about mood and character than it is about plot. Despite all of Cole &amp; Rawlins' adventures, the book is slow moving. McCarthy writes beautifully, paying attention to the details that make up the simple action of putting a saddle on a horse, for example, or lighting up a cigarette. At times I found this relaxing, but other times it made me restless. I can see why this book received such praise, since the writing does create such a peaceful atmosphere, even when talking about violent events. However, it didn't work for me that well. I ended up feeling distant from the events and the people in the story, never fully understanding their motivations or reactions to events. I enjoyed the read, but I didn't especially look forward to getting back to it each evening."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This Book is a modern-day western full of excitment about cowboys and horses. It deals with a fictional 16-year-old character named John Gragy Cole, who is the last of a long line of cowboys. He is feed up with texas and all of his family problems there, so he decides to run away with his cousin to Mexico. Their adventure is both dangerous and idyllic, but they have sworn to tough it out through thick and thin. Many of times the book is comical at how it deals with situatios and characters abroad. The energy of the author (Cormac McCarthy) can be felt through the whole book by his passion and knowledge al horses and the northern cowboy life. The rhythem of the book captures the bad lands of northern Mexico and its culture with characters and plots ideal for every situational stage of the John Grade adventures. The first quarter of the book sets up the rest of the story in a dramatic way. Although the beginning I found slightly boring, it pays to stick with the story because it builds up and pays off later as you read. Overall, this beek is well written because it is more broadly based than the title implies. I recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a book with a little bit of everything in it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"for anyone to say that this book has too much detail (as one reviewer here did) is to say that mozart's music has too many notes..."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"For anyone not giving this or any book written by McCarthy, 5 stars, I question their literary competence.

Sometimes I had to read a part over several times just to find out who was talking to who, and even then I still didn't know sometimes.

John Grady Cole is sixteen years old and everything he has ever known is coming to an end. His parents are divorced and he doesn't appear to have much of a relationship with either one. With his grandfather's recent death, the ranch on which John Grady was brought up is to be sold - depriving him of the only lifestyle he'd ever wanted. With nothing left for him in Texas, Cole decides to cross teh border into Mexico and seek work on a ranch there, He doesn't leave alone, however - he's joined on the trip by an old friend, Lacey Rawlins. The pair meet another teenager on their way, one who introduces himself as Jimmy Blevins. The pair recognise his instantly as trouble and have little doubt that the horse he's riding is stolen. Nevertheless, they allow Blevins to travel with them for a while - a decision that leads the pair further into trouble than they could've forseen.Although I can see \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" is so highly thought of, the style and approach McCarthy adopted didn't always work too well for me. In fact, I felt that - at times - the style hindered the story, rather than helping it along. The lack of punctuation is often commented on and, while it helps establish the sort of characters that feature in the book, it occasionally left things a little unclear as to who was saying what. Similarly, some sentences featured five or six 'ands' and ran beyond the length of a standard paragraph. As a result, there were times I couldn't stop myself from drifting off and absent-mindedly turning the page. Overall, I'm glad I read it - I'll just not be in much of a rush to read books two and three of \\"The Border Trilogy\\"..."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A lot of people struggle with this book in the beginning.

The paragraph long sentences and the absent quotation marks created a continuous stream of thought and an excellent flow to the book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy's stunning novel is a tribute to the men of another, lost age. His prose complements the sparse landscape of Mexico and embodies the quiet fortitude of the men of the Old West."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I love to read, and I usually enjoy my summer reading assignments. However, I found All the Pretty Horses very hard to get into. The first few chapters are very slow, and frankly, quite boring. The rest of the book is dizzyingly action-packed. There is also a lot of dialogue in Spanish, which makes some of the story hard to follow if you don't speak Spanish.McCarthy also has some grammatical eccentricities that I found very distracting. The book begins with pronouns that lack antecedents, completely lacks quotation marks (not even dashes a la Steinbeck), and has the longest run on sentences I have ever seen."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"There is no option for zero stars, but that is what it really deserves. Mexico is depicted as a land made up of two elements--mysticism and whorehouses. Mr. McCormick has an infallible ear for local Texas speech, but everything else is blimp material--hot air. As a resident of Mexico, I can assure you that it is inhabited by ordinary people who don't spout profundities while selling you a Coke, and the country is not made up of heart-of-gold prostitutes, knife-fighting pimps, and other very, very silly characters painted in such shallow tones that they are little more than stereotypes."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new \\"style\\" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating.

One is transplanted to another time and place. It's as if you know the characters personally, and know what it is to live with them."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Sometimes when I'm out riding on my family's ranch, with the huge blue sky arched overhead and not a sound but the breeze and the soft treading of my horse's hooves on the prairie grass below, I think, how could I describe the stark beauty of this moment? Not the easy, pretty, green grass and blue sky beauty, but the deeper, raw beauty of the emptiness, of being at the mercy of wild things and finding some sort of wilderness deep in your own heart. Cormac Mccarthy has the gift of capturing the sometimes brutal, yet starkly beautiful essence of the West with such accuracy that you feel as though you are watching a cinematographic masterpiece. His characters are masterfully developed through their actions and their dialogue, rather than through descriptions of their inner thoughts. As an example of his beautiful imagery, read this description of a train racing through the Texas countryside at night: \\"It came boring out of the east like some ribald satellite of the coming sun howling and bellowing in the distance and the long light of the headlamp running through the tangled mesquite brakes and creating out of the night the endless fenceline down the straight right of way and sucking it back again wire and post mile on mile into the darkness...\\". He so accurately captures the ways in which, out in the open plains of the West, any moving light draws shapes out of the darkness before plunging them back into the black. Along with his beautiful descriptive writing, Mccarthy, unlike so many western writers, actually pays attention to the horses. So many western novels and movies either totally ignore the horses, making them simply vessels upon which to showcase the cowboys, or anthropomorphize a particular horse to the extent that it becomes less a horse, and more a human. Mccarthy allows the horses to take center stage, while at the same time keeping them horses. John Grady, in fact, seems intent on protecting the soul of his horses, which he understands, from the unpredictable nature of man, which he doesn't understand. This is true of so many cowboys. It seems that as hard as a horse can buck, toss its head, or spook, the cowboy more clearly understands his horse than he does any man (or woman)."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Sometimes a book completely floors you with how much you are enjoying it! This is one of those books for me. It kind of sneaks up on you and then you realize just how good it is. I can't wait to read the other 2 books in the trilogy! I know this was written long before \\"Prison Break\\" - but can't help but see some interesting parallels with the Mexican prison scenes (and I loved Prison Break). If you like suspense, drama, and find the bond between men and the bond between men and horses fascinating, you will like this book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All The Pretty Horses is an \\"American Western\\" turned up-side-down. The hero, teenager John Grady Cole, is a superb horseman and cowboy. He meets a girl, loses her, but doesn't get her back.The anti-western quality is foretold by a beautiful metaphor in the very first line of the novel. A candle flame (and its reflection) in a pier glass, twists and then rights itself, when Cole enters his family's ranch house on a cold night. He is there to view the body of his grandfather, who ran the family cattle ranch in western Texas.The story takes place in the late 1940s -- after World War II. The ranch is up for sale. Cole's mother, who inherits the ranch, has taken up acting -- a peculiarly non-Western career choice. Despite Cole's pleas, she insists her son (and only child) is too young to run the ranch. Cole's father, emasculated by the War and by his wife, is unable to run the ranch himself, or even intercede on his son's behalf.Disillusioned, Cole takes to the road on horseback. Not to the American West. It has vanished. But, south to Mexico, a terribly beautiful land where he encounters lawlessness, official corruption (that would make a Philadelphia policeman blush) and many very bad people.He is joined by his best friend, reluctantly; and by a companion they meet along the way who provides some comic relief. But, that is ephemeral; and, apart from a brief and forbidden love affair with the aforementioned girl on her father's cattle ranch -- an Eden-like place deep in the heart of Mexico -- all sorts of bad things happen to the adventurers.Things so bad that they bend, but do not break, Cole's idealism and adherence to the cowboy code. The code, a remnant from the old American West, values thoughtfulness over verbosity, modesty over boasting, concise wisdom over elaborate argument and repression of emotion over expression of fear. Think- Clint Eastwood or Hemingway's alter ego, Nick Adams. Sadly, this ethic is now rare among men.There is a sunset in the final scene. While the hero rides off into it, he does so without any sense of well being, accomplishment or resolution."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy is one of our greatest living authors. I love Southern Gothic style and he executes it brilliantly. This book is part of a trilogy that is challenging if you do not speak Spanish since so much of the action takes place in Mexico. I used online translation sites to get the most out of it. It took extra effort but was worth it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I picked up this book at random when I was at the store with my daughter because I liked the title. Once I started reading I could not put it down. I live in Houston and enjoyed the description of Mexico. I also liked the way that Cormac used Mexican language, it makes you feel like you are closer to the characters and because my daughter speaks/reads the language she can interpret for me.The bleak plot was engrossing and true to life. I am a 50 year old male and I can look back and easily imagine myself making the same choices that cut both ways.Loved it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a good book, but wanders off course about two-thirds of the way through. I would not rank it among McCarthy's best."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"For all of you who are worried about the aforementioned spanish content - give in to it. I read the book with zero knowledge of spanish and loved every minute of it. McCarthy understands lyrical novel writing and is in the same league as Ondaatje when it comes to letting words play music upon the inner voice. The very clip and melody to the spanish conveys its meaning. To dissuade yourself from this novel because of some spanish would be to dissuade yourself from one of the seven wonders of modern literature. Fierceness, Love, Courage, and Truth - these are the concerns of McCarthy's characters, and with their integrity, we can glimpse what is possible in our own lives when we are true."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Okay, so it's a little crunchy and difficult in spots, like eating wild game with the shotgun pellets still in it, it's still wonderful. Forget the obvious, 'boys-2-men' plot, ignore the occasional too-purple description, and savor the atmospheric power. It doesn't get any more evocative than this. Lyrically, it's an Everest of a book, hard and cold and high and lonely and very beautiful."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"You too can be Cormac McCarthy--here's how: 1) plunk down interchangable teenage cowboy parts into approapriate southwestern landscape (this lack of individuated character apparently counts as mythic power these days. 2) kill off the most interesting characters before the second act. 3) Make sure interchangable teenage cowboy parts eventually land in jail where they have painful, violent experiences (apparently considered &quot;rites of passage&quot; to manhood). 3) Neglect to write a convincing or engaging ending. 4)Omit any sense of humor and be sure to take yourself quite seriously--after all, these ain't westerns, they's lit-rit-chure! Congratualtions. You have written both &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; and the darker (and better) &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; (&quot;The Crossing,&quot; too, from what I hear). Perhaps I exaggerate. But it is a little disconcerting to get the earthy, believeable, Hemmingway-esque dialogue jammed next to the Faulkerian flights of literary fancy--sort of like mixing champagne and whiskey. And sure, you're better off reading McCarthy than most of the dreck that captures the reading public's jaundiced eye, but how much is that saying? For my money, Larry McMurtry may finally be repeating himself as much as McCarthy does, but at least he's got a sense of humor and doesn't take himself anywhere near as seriously."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I had never read Cormac McCarthy before picking up \\"All The Pretty Horses\\". Though I have an M.A. in Literature and thus have read some rather challenging-to-read books, I found myself a bit put off at first by the highly stylized writing. I was reading this book for fun, after all, and here I was having to \\"work\\" to read it -- plus I don't like to \\"notice\\" style that seems to call too much attention to itself, as I felt this book was doing.Fortunately, I don't give up easily when it comes to novels, and it was not long before my mental faculties adapted to McCarthy's much-discussed disregard for punctuation, grammatic tradition, etc. Soon I was simply flowing along, absorbing the amazing and abundant gifts of what had now come to seem an entirely natural, appropriate and deeply enriching use of language. My recommendation, therefore, is to give yourself and the novel a chance, even if it seems to make your brain ache at first.Once you do settle in, you will find a fantastic, page-turner of a story alive with unforgettable characters. Action, adventure, romance, tragedy -- it's all there, centered around the character of young John Grady Cole -- whom all men will want to be and all women will want to be with. Okay, I guess there will be some out there who don't feel that way, but you would indeed be hard pressed to find a more appealing character than this wise, courageous, capable, noble and romantic young cowboy.One thing that I don't think is emphasized enough is the terrific sense of humor in this book, which sparkles all the more brightly for the bleakness that often surrounds it. The dialogue between Rawlins and John Grady, the things that come out of the mouth of Blevins -- subtle and in character and hilarious. The use of language and inflection of the characters' voices is also a treat -- you can hear their accents perfectly, envision the way they move and sound and even smell.I think I've read this book four or five times now, and although I know what is going to happen, it is a rich and much-savored treat, every time.I will say that I did not enjoy the other two books in the trilogy nearly as much. I couldn't bear to see what he does with John Grady's future. All the Pretty Horses is not a happy ending, by any means, but it's a pretty gentle one in the world of McCarthy.As for the movie, I expected it would be disappointing and it was. Sort of like the difference between standing in front of Niagara Falls vs. looking at a faded snapshot of Niagara Falls. No way to capture the magnitude and all-encompassing power of the one in the other.One last comment: Some have suggested that women might not like this book, that it is rather a masculine tale with too much violence and too much of a \\"guy's point of view\\". Nonsense! Love it, love it, love it, even the violence, which is necessary and important to the fabric of the story. Don't be put off, ladies! There's a handsome young cowboy in this book just waiting to sweep you off your feet! I promise that you will wish you were that girl in the lake, and if John Grady's heartbreak doesn't break your heart in the most exquisite way, well, then you don't like romance much. Guy's book indeed! : )"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"We are not in Texas anymore.Read this book for the reward of a compelling story. It narrates the experience of two friends who wander into Northern Mexico, motivated for adventure. Along the way they meet an odd but fierce boy named Jimmy Blevins.Blevins loses his horse to some rustlers. He takes great risks to get his horse back. Being near him, while a bit risky, reminds the men of the moral order of people who would not stand for letting someone steal your horse. Even if you die in the process. Blevins Then Blevins is gone.McCarthy employs rich language. The verbs cloak description. It can be obtuse reading when the language utilizes so many cowboy terms. But, that's part of the value.I read this over two airplane trips across the country. Stuck in a cocoon of canned air, this book gave me something to imagine. It is part of a trilogy. I am reading the next one, Cities of the Plain, right now."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty HorsesIn the first few moments you know how the film will go wrong. Voice offer-which is often misused in movies based on books as a way to capture some of the original author's voice-is especially damning here. We hear the miscast Matt Damon offering Cole's commentary on what has happened where he lives, what is wrong with it, and thus, why he must go. The problem is, that commentary doesn't exist in the novel. In fact, we never get inside a character's head except through witnessing acts and listening to dialogue-and this is true of all of McCarthy's work. He writes, in essence, beautiful screenplays. Stories that are told in carefully controlled images and well honed and realistic dialogue. Director Thorton and screenwriting Tally make the huge mistake of trying to give this film a \\"literary\\" feel. Most certainly they were overwhelmed by the beauty and the poetry of the descriptions of place and action offered in the novel, and I suppose some of the choices they've made were out of a kind of panic. Damon, who is too old and earnest in the wrong ways for the part, may have been likewise intimidated by the source material and decided to make the character his own as opposed to McCarthy's. The Grady of the novel is not one who is just pure and straightforward; rather, he is a character at odds with the darker ways of the world, for it can be navigated only through careful use of reason and he is a character who doesn't just choose to remain more true to his feelings, but who can hardly help it, a character emblematic of a stubborn type of innocence that carries with it an infectious aura of danger-we see it and its consequences later on in the third book of the trilogy, Cities on the Plain. To create a work film which doesn't understand and showcase this trait is to do not even the minimal of justice to its source.A good film can be made of McCarthy's work; it will take boldness and a screenwriter and a director who realize that the poetry of the prose can only be approximated-perhaps paralleled-in the poetry of the cinematography, and that, beyond that, the plots and what they represent, and the efficiency of the dialogue, is enough. Maybe even more than enough."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"In Cormac McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses the most important part happens to be theme. This is a story about sticking to the cowboy code no matter what obstacles get in your way. The protagonist John Grady Cole faces many challenges to keep him from his goal. All he wants is to be a cowboy. But since the cattle industry in America is down, he rides into Mexico to pursue his dream. There he finds the girl of his dreams. However the girls father refuses there relationship which could ruin her reputation. The father sends Grady to jail. Every struggle that Grady faces he survives with deep passion. His only will to live is to see his lover and ride with the horses. He endures torture and pain, but he never once breaks his cowboy code. He is true to his lifestyle. He lives in a mystical Western world where everything is perfect, and he can ride his horse all day. Not even a stubborn bronco could stop Grady's hopes and dreams. He refuses to bow to the fate of the world. But works harder to achieve his ambitions. McCarthy inspires the reader to never give up their dreams because of minor obstacles. The only defect of this novel is the often use of Spanish. I, even taking Spanish, had trouble understanding the dialogue. The story is long and slow but the bigger picture is inspiring. Is there any such thing as fate? Can we let it get us down? McCarthy shows the reader that fate has no power over our lives. Our hearts control the paths that we take. I would definetely recommend this book to anyone who wants to challenge the fate of life."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Like many readers, this much-heralded book has been my first encounter with the writing of Cormac McCarty. I enjoyed the novel, as narrated by Frank Muller, but I am going to walk, not necessarily run, to pick up the remaining volumes of McCarthy's &quot;border trilogy&quot; since this novel left me wanting a little more.The tale is simple- John Grady Cole, a 16 year old Texan, leaves his home when the family decides to sell their marginally-profitable cattle ranch. He sets off for Mexico with his buddy Lacey Rawlins, with little more than the clothes on their back and a couple of sound horses. Along the way they encounter the younger, boastful runaway Jimmy Blevins, who is a great marksman but is terrified of lightning, and Blevins and his beautiful Bay mare tag along with dire consequences.Lacey and Cole end up at a hacienda in Mexico where their hard work and considerable skills in the horse arena earn them the respect of the ranch, and where Cole falls in love with the owner's beautiful daughter. Although I won't give away any more of the plot, at times there is little plot to give away, as McCarthy often spends pages describing the sparse, dusty landscape or recounting the beans and tortillas eaten by our heroes seemingly at every meal.The narration here by Muller is excellent, as he convincingly changes voices for every character and appears to speak in a convincing Mexican accent for the non-gringo characters. This was one of my pet peeves however, since there are fairly long dialogues in Spanish, which were largely lost on me with my mostly-forgotten, high school grade Spanish ability.Also, Cole seems almost supernaturally cool and brave for a 16 year old kid, especially given the circumstances in which he is thrust by the author. Finally, while we hear minute details about landscape, meals, care and feeding of the horses, etc. throughout the novel, at times seemingly relevant details are left out. What happened to Cole's father for example? It seems like Cole, at the end of the novel, didn't deem it important enough to ask, as he was more interested in the welfare of the poor former employees of his family's ranch. McCarthy can definitely tell a story, and I have heard that Blood Meridian is one of the best American novels of the past twenty years, but I suspect All the Pretty Horses is not necessarily his best work. I rate it a generous 4 stars, 3 1/2 if they'd let me."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I loved this book. The novel is about a young man and his friend who set out across the border of Texas and Mexico to become horse wranglers. However, their ideas of life in Mexico are abruptly changed through the happenings of romance, danger, and suspense. McCarthy has a great writing style that grips you into the novel. Through his dramatic descriptions of the Texas and Mexico ranch and trail life and his elaborate discussions of honor and reason, 16 year old, John Grady Cole, grabs you into the novel with the gripping sensation of wanting to continue to find out what happens next. McCarthy style includes no punctuation, making it hard to follow, but written well enough to grip the reader into reading on to find out the next dialogue sequence and the changing detail of the scenery. McCarthy deals with major themes such as: honor, religion, and death. For a boy of 16, these areas are hard to understand. Death takes a hard toll on a person regardless of age, however; it affects a younger age because they do not know how to handle the problem. Honor is an acceptance of manhood and maturity. As the novel develops, Cole is described as growing up and maturing. He knows honor to be sticking by his friend, Lacey Rawlins, and standing up for his rights and what he believes in. Religion is also a hard topic because a boy changes so much in his teen years that he has many doubts and fears of what truly exists. I highly recommend this novel to anyone that likes western novels with romance and gunplay."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I do not suggest that I am subject to prescient visions of things to be. However, allow me to assure you that in Year 4999 CE scholars of long forgotten linguistic traditions in unimaginable institutions will examine McCarthy's Border Trilogy for what it might reveal about our age and our fundamental understandings, much as scholars today are transfixed by Homer and Virgil. And while McCarthy may be no more representative of this time and place than Homer was of his, can we hope to be forgiven by the ages to come as unconditionally as we have been by McCarthy?"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"i was able to identify with this mainly because i had spent 4 years and 2 weeks in the jail that was described in the book &quot;all the pretty horses&quot;.

I must say that this author had to have been inside this prison to have described it so well. even more amazing was that the cowboy was thrown in a corner cell on the sixth floor of this place and I was thrown in a corner cell on the sixth floor, the first night that i was there and preceeded to spend the next few years in that same cell. The kitchen scene was well described and came vividly to mind when i read it and beleive me I saw many just as brutal scenes on my sojourn in Castelar 203. i wrote the publisher asking about being able to get ahold of Mccarthey but got no response.

The boys are forced to grow up too fast for their own liking as they deal with the truths of the world.Nothing about the writing over-reaches. Mccarthy describes what happens without explaining. The dialogue is real and perfect. And I can't imagine a more poetic description of the open plains, the weather, and guys just riding around on horses. You feel the cold of the nights, the passage of time as they cross the landscape, and the impending darkness that hangs over almost every part of the story.

This book needs to be considered in its totality - the wonderful story, the beautifully written descriptions, and the style. Combined together it is an excellent book. McCarthy has a habit of taking of with descriptions story and dialogue, before the reader has a chance to get her balance. It is worth rereading a few paragraphs or pages here and there.This is the kind of book that were I an English teacher I would give as assigned reading. I think it will hold up over time to be a much read coming of age story, compared with many of the greats."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is the first novel in the set of McCarthy's so called \\"Border Trilogy,\\" and by far, the best. It stands on its own as a classic American novel.It is the story of a taciturn 16-year old Texan, with a love for horses and a gift for training them, who sadly (or so it seems; his emotions are never explicitly revealed) comes to the realization that there is nothing for him in Texas anymore to keep him there. With a friend, and on horseback, he embarks upon a journey to Mexico. Plotwise, the story is unusual in that, unlike the usual standard western, it takes place in 1947, an era way beyond cowboys and Indians. Reminders of this are contained throughout, such as the sudden appearance of a noisy automobile, or the description of a line of telegraph poles stretched across the distance, as far as one can see.Yet Mexico even in 1947 is still in many ways a savage land, and the young men's adventures there are the subject of the novel. I can tell you that when I use the term &quot;adventures,&quot; I mean exactly that. This is an exciting novel, a page-turning novel.The lads finally reach a place they wish to call home: a large, sprawling ranch in central Mexico, where they become hands, and where the protagonist ultimately achieves a somewhat exalted position training and breeding horses. I'm not going to give away too much of the plot here, but it's moved to a large degree by the presence of the ranch-owner's daughter, a well-educated, headstrong, black-haired and blue-eyed 17-year-old beauty. Suddenly confronted with the arrival of this lanky, brave, adventurous and mature-for-his-age American . . . well, you can almost guess what will happen, but the story nevertheless veers from cliche and instead becomes fresh, believable and extremely moving.More than the plot, though, is the simple, almost sparse nature of McCarthy's prose. His descriptions of the landscape through which his characters travel is poetic, almost dreamy: &quot;They'd ride out along the cienaga road and along the verge of the marshes while the sun rose riding up flights of ducks out of the shallows or geese or mergansers that would beat away over the water scattering the haze and rising up would turn to birds of gold in a sun not yet visible from the bolson floor.&quot; The spare language, and also the lack of punctuation, lend to the almost surreal nature of his prose, which, I should add, is never difficult to digest.It's similar in many ways to the best of Hemingway both in style and in subject matter. Both authors write rough-and-tumble, outdoors adventures; both of them use stark prose; both of them spare the reader layer after layer of psychological analysis, and simply tell the story. Hemingway may have had a better grip on character development, but McCarthy is by far the more poetic. This is fiction of the first drawer, and not to be missed."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"i saw this book around for several years, and the movie only piqued my curiosity...started on it last thursday and finished it last night...wow, this is a great book...more than just a western novel..maccarthy takes on some very heady themes here: death, religion, philosophy, honor, etc...it's as if oddyseus lost his sea legs, got some boots and a stetson and decided to take a journey on the open plains...maccarthy's style is sparse, but there's a poetry to the simple language...the only other book i can think of that shows more reverence to horses and their beauty is &quot;the horse whisper&quot; by nicolas evansjohn grady cole is an extraordinary hero, but i loved the fact that he had flaws and that made him endearing...sometimes the large than life types can be a bit cornpone for my taste... i felt really bad for him when he didn't get the girl...if anyone deserved alejandra's love, it was him...i dodn't know if i want to see the movie yet, now that i've read the book. it was trashed by the critics and bombed at the box office...and yet,i can't think of a better john grady than matt damon...but the book won me over to maccarthy. he definately has a fan..."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I abandoned this book after 5 pages a year ago -- and for all the 'annoying' reasons above, ie the non-quoted dialogue, the Spanish, the dry, terse and 'lengthy' landscape narrative.Read the reviews--and made it a goal to read it during my Mexican vacation. This was a very easy goal because once I read the reviews I realized that I hadn't given the author's obvious talent a chance. By far the best book of the year I have read. It is not a difficult read at all, but it simply can't be skimmed, and you won't want to. The beauty of it is hearing every word in your mind - as if you are sitting by a campfire and hearing a very, very wise person tell the story.I hate (!) westerns, but all the really significant themes of living one's life are here.Take the time to savor this book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"First of all, I'd like to address the many negative reviews for this book on Amazon. I've read through many of them, and they all have one thing in common; they're all concerned with McCarthy's style over his story. Yes, he has a strange style, but many people happen to like it, myself included. All these reviewers say that they had a hard time understanding the book because of the lack of quotation marks. Two points here. One, how hard is it to identify speech when it has \\"John Grady said\\" after it? Two: folks, if you can't understand the book, then why are you writing a review about it? That simply doesn't make sense to me.Now, onto the review. McCarthy is probably the greatest living author there is. His prose is simple, but it packs a punch, and his pacing is utterly perfect, with no boring parts whatsoever. But these two aspects only work to bolster the already incredible plot. The plot is the high point of the book. It's funny, tragic, and heartfelt, but above all else, thought-provoking.The point here is if you haven't already read this book, do so now. However, know that you aren't reading the latest James Patterson. McCarthy writes seriously, and this is a tough book to read because of that. But it's worth the effort you'll put into it. Is it ever worth it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This book was assigned reading in an English course I took about a year ago. It blew my mind. The writing style is very simplistic, even more so than Hemmingway, in that there is very little punctuation. There are no quotations, but they really aren't needed. Once the main character, John Grady Cole, finds his way to Mexico, there is some Spanish, but it isn't neccessary to know the language, as there is no exposition in it and a decent explanation is given soon after. It also helps to make you feel a stranger in this land, as Cole is. What is tragic is that Miramax has cut the original four hour film translation of this masterpiece down to a piddling hour-forty-five. Read this. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Many readers have written many things about this book, and some of their comments I find curious. But the single word I feel comfortable using to describe this work is stunning, because I was truly stunned by its beauty, its pace, its ability to capture the human spirit.If this is a coming of age tale, then it is the quintessential example of this genre. McCarthy's style is so unique, yet bears well when compared to the eloquence and characterization of Faulkner and the rhythmic beauty of Marquez, as McCarthy's style encapsulates the best of these authors while retaining its own voice. Reading this tale is enthralling and exhausting."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses grabbed me from the outset by its alternately terse and unusually descriptive prose. The hero, John Grady Cole, appeared to me as the apotheosis of young manhood--valiant, honest, and smart--and seemed at times to have been blessed with the noble soul of a fabled knight. That McCarthy highlighted Cole's fallible traits--such as naivete and (occasional) recklessness--eased my own ability to find strains of myself in Cole as I reflected on my own view of the world as a young man. His equine and topographical descriptions can be a bit much at times, but I often found myself rereading passages in astonished admiration. His disregard for grammatical convention is more than compensated for by his poetic passages. The to-the-point dialogue between Cole and Rawlins , Cole and his father, and Cole and everybody else, come to think of it, underscores Cole's strength, and yields a great impact whenever he speaks. The violent scenes are well-written and highlight the idea that life--particularly life in the Southwest for the last cowboys--is a battle. Women may not like this book, for it is largely about the pain and rewards of becoming and being a man. I urge anyone who picks it up to stick with it and not to fight McCarthy's tide. In sum, I was extremely moved by All the Pretty Horses."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is the second Cormac McCarthy book I've read, and this author's prose is like poetry. He really has a way with describing scenes of the countryside, the love of horses, and the tragedy of a man's destiny within a blind, or indifferent, universe.The story focuses on the young John Grady Cole, who sets off on an adventure, on horseback, into Mexico with his childhood friend Lacey Rawlins. Along the way the encounter this kid, Jimmy Blevins, riding a beautiful horse. The resulting incidents lead the trio into deeper trials of their character and courage as they face the worst in humanity, love, and the land itself."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A fine Western,very fine...An adventure story and a love story, a man's love story told from his perspective about a forbidden love (aren't they the mosst daring kind?) Told against the backdrop of a young man seeking hope and a new life, clashes of Mexican and American culture and tradition, Old World/New World values and experiences, Youthful hope and optimism against middle and old age maturity and, perhaps, conventional wisdom. Throughout there is a yearning for a successful resolution, but you will have to read the book to know its ending. It's hard to read about a man aching as much for his love as John Grady Cole aches for his lady.One of the most touching passages is on page 284 of the paperback edition: \\"He stood at the window of the empty cafe and watched the (wedding) activities in the square and he said it was good that God kept the truths of life from the young as they were starting out or else they'd have no heart to start at all...\\"Lots of macho stuff, too. riding, roping, fighting, even a little dancing...lots of male bonding and friendship of the highest level and degree.If you like Westerns, don't miss this; if you like adventure stories, don't miss this; if you don't mind a good love story told from the man's perspective, don't miss this. Starts off slow, but stay with it--it will blow you away.The hero John Grady Cole gives us all hope...and, as with Mary and Joseph, it is hard to realize that young people, seemingly so very young, could endure so much and accomplish so much. It's about youth, their toughness, their durability, their dependablity and, ultimately, their hope.(No sacrilege meant with the comparison of John Grady Cole and Mary and Joseph--just meant to show that young people, 14-15-16 can and do accomplish great and admirable things while enduring seemingly unbearable hardships.)"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Sometime in the 1940s, John Grady Cole and Lacey Rawlins, two Texan teens, head off to Mexico on horseback. Their journey is one of laughter and horror, as these two boys are forced to grow up fast and hard.That's about the best I can give you for a plot summary. It's amazing that \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" runs just over 300 pages. It feels more epic in nature. It IS epic, I suppose; just a short one. McCarthy's prose is as rich and vibrant as ever, though it's a bit more restrained here than in other of his works--I can see why this book is among his more commercially successful novels. Indeed, it's an odd companion to his other great Western piece, \\"Blood Meridian\\" (which is arguably a superior book; but then, that's like asking which gold medal shines brighter--there's just no reason to contrast two great literary works). Perhaps this makes \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" a good starting point for those interested in reading McCarthy's novels (I also recommend \\"No Country For Old Men,\\" as it is even leaner and than \\"Horses\\"). That's not to say, though, that \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" doesn't stand up to the rest of McCarthy's catalogue--it does, admirably so. Cole is an interesting and engaging protagonist, and the way McCarthy switches from humorous scenes to tragic ones reflects the patterns of daily life. \\"Horses\\" is an amazing, enriching novel, and Cormac McCarthy is without a doubt one of the best writers/storytellers out there today. They don't call his novels \\"classics\\" for nothing."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I can read English, French, Italian. This novel ranks with Proust's La Recherche du temps perdu, and Manzoni's Promessi sposi. Breathtaking scenes follow more breathtaking scenes and the whole leaves the reader breathless. Magnificient, none like it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I don't normally read fiction, but was forced to read this book eight years ago for a college assignment. I couldn't be more delighted that my instructor forced me to read this book! My reluctance turned to joy and determination as I whiped through the pages as fast as I possibly could. This book has everything: joy, romance, action, life changing events, tragedy, unexpected twists, not to mention human loss and suffering. I found this book to be well written, and much better than the movie that attempted to capture it's essence a few years back (Matt Damon is in the movie). This book lives up to the five star votes it has received from so many readers. I hope you enjoy, I did."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a classic novel, solid writing and straightforward narrative. The narrative is driven forward by John Grady Cole's desire--his desire for a bygone era of Western ranches, his desire for the daughter of a wealthy Mexican ranch owner, his desire to act by his own strict ethical code in a world that is largely indifferent to such a code.The novel is full of great passages of descriptive prose, drawing out the landscape before the narrative settles down into the characters and action. The expansive descriptions remind me of the way a Western film pans out to the cowboy landscape, to the lone men in the landscape, to horses and cattle. It reminded me somewhat of Zane Gray novels or similar such genre work, except the characters are much more complex, and of course the language is nothing like a genre Western. It is only the plot that makes me think of classic Westerns--working cowboys, guns, horses, the pretty daughter of wealthy landowners.I tend to read for long stretches, so there were moments when the rhapsodic descriptions of landscape seemed repetitive--almost as though the writer felt obliged to remind the reader that this was after all the Great American West. I didn't need to be reminded and the descriptions often took me out of the action. Though I suspect that I might not have noticed it if I did not read at such long sittings.McCarthy created secondary characters very well. Some of the greatest insights come from Alfonsa, the aunt of the beautiful daughter. The characters of the ranch-hands and town folk are nicely filled out. They are not simply backdrops or props, off of which bounce the protagonist or the action. They have their own lives and their own stories. It adds depth and credibility to the story. And all these characters are smart. That is one important thing that comes through in this novel; the characters are always the smartest people in the room.It is refreshing to read a book that does not employ those little cliff-hangers, those chapters that end like a Scooby Doo episode or an after-school special--to borrow from the end of the first chapter of American Pastoral, \\"I was wrong. Never more mistaken about anyone in my life.\\" Or the end of the second chapter, \\"...only then did I discover that Jerry Levov, having arrived late, was among us.\\" This always feels cheap to me.McCarthy runs the narrative out. I don't know what life will bring for Grady, but I do know that this story was the defining moment of his life. Everything that happens to him will either spring from or be compared to this trip to Mexico."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I admit it. I picked up \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" more for the photo of the horse on the front cover than for its reputation as a good book (though that helped). And once I began reading, I was more than a little doubtful of McCarthy's writing style - I've read Faulkner and Hemingway and been less than impressed with some of their output. But after a few pages I adjusted and began to appreciate the beauty of the less-than-correct writing. \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" is the stuff of legends, of a bygone oral tradition, and it reads as though someone were really telling a story, not just writing words on a page. The story lives in a way that is as real as a horse snorting in your face. The themes and ideas that McCarthy addresses are simple but powerful and his characters have the uncomplicated aura of those in an epic, which this book is. I read the ending too quickly because I was dying to see what would happen; and anyway, to fully appreciate the scope of this book, I'm going to have to read it again. I look forward to it with pleasure."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"It is seldom that an author can move his reader to the actual place where the sights, sounds, feel and even smells are real and in your face. This book does it. The Crossing [his next installment in the Border Trilogy] does it even better and the third combines the lead characters of each of the first two, John Grady Cole and Billy Parham, with an ending that is as brutal and tear jerking as any read out there. McCarthy has gone on to write No Country for Old Men [soon to be filmed by the Coen brothers], The Road and a new short play Sunset Limited. This is writing at its very best. No contemporary author is even close."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Dispossessed and alienated by the death of his grandfather, the divorce of his parents, and the imminent sale of the ranch where he grew up, 16-year-old John Grady Cole heads for Mexico with his friend Lacey Rawlins to pursue the lives of traveling horsemen. They find a hard, Darwinian world where the weak and foolish suffer. Cole is scrupulously ethical and strong-willed, and he needs to be. Every time he shows love or compassion for another, he is made to suffer for it, and only his own strength of character allows him to persevere.Cormac Mccarthy's prose style is challenging at first, but I soon grew accustomed to it. His long galloping sentences effectively emulate the rhythm of travel, and his simple yet often startling turns of phrase bring the landscape of the Texas/Mexico border region to vivid life."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This, the first book in Mccarthy's reputation making border trilogy, is what every novel should be: a good story told well.The book follows the adventures of a young boy as he travels with his best friend to mexico. Mexico in this novel is an ambiguous place and seems to be the last bastion, at least in the boys' minds, of a way of life that problebly never existed. The thing that breaks with other such narritives is that Mccarthy does not write in stone why the boys decide to leave their country. There is no hidden treasure one of the boys hear about or some crime they are tring to escape,they just go and you as a reader, I promise, will follow with them even when the going gets tough. And all the Cormac fans know that this writer's tough is a whole different monster than the standard breed to be found in most books.This may not be his best book, but that is like saying Portrait is not Joyce's best. McCarthy is a writer who will be remembered as someone who contributed something genuine to American letters. A must for any fan of literature or the western in general."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Easily his best, outshining 'The Crossing' by a long way, and more mature and less mythological than 'Blood Meridian'. His style is the main pleasure for me. Superb, economical and audacious writing that is impossible to imitate (I know because I've tried). He brings a real poet's ear to sentences that last till the end of the world and could easily become ponderous and pretentious. This man pulls it off every time. One of the few novels that I re-read regularly"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses, winner of the National Book Award and National Book Critics Circle Award, is fiction of the highest calibur. The story recants the travels of John Grady, a boy from Texas, looking for adventure and his future in Mexico. The journey to and within Mexico parallels the young Texan's own inner quest and search for self. Admittedly the book is lathargic in the beginning, but a particularly poignant passage in the last third of the novel in which an older Mexican woman offers her hard earned wisdom regarding life is well worth the wait. McCarthy has written a rare book which avoids cliche, predictable plot evolution and merely guides readers along as the climax methodically builds. Events and misfortune befall the unemotive John Grady yet he continues in stride, not out of hero bravado but rather because that is the only response he can muster. In the end, life has shaped John Grady into a man and his journey is complete"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I couldn't put this book down once I started it. Having grown up in West Texas close to where the story begins, it recalled many childhood memories. Mr. McCarthy's style is different, but he masters the language like no current author.

His characters are supremely one-dimensional (in &quot;Horses&quot; anyway), and he lets the action bring any little character development there is. But the strong elemental prose gets to you - if you believe in the power of fate, and the beauty of ancient landscapes. It's a good thing though that he doesnt include too much dialogue - most of it is abysmal, and at least the Spanish phrases distract a little from that. Overall though a story that will take you places no other writer can - its worth the effort."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Beautifully written prose"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"What a fantastic book. Somehow both stark and lush at the same time. McCarthy's power of description is astonishing. A handful of scenes here are among the best of modern American writing.

One minor point: perhaps a few less &quot;ands&quot; next time."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Loved it from beginning to end. Grady is the best character in American literature today. Great use of language, and not too much talking, which hurts many great books. Very unique style."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Perhaps the beauty of McCarthy's work is one that men can relate more to; the fantastic grittiness that is found in the myth of the cowboy, the mystique of the ranch-- fully laced with black coffee and hand-rolled cigarettes. But this piece is more than just a good story; it is undoubtedly artistic in its nature, beautifully written with its unique prose style and inconsiderate use of Spanish. One critic stated that a film version of this novel may destroy its true quality; however, if it was as masterfully directed as say, &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, it would be an accompished movie as well. I recommend this novel without reservation; I believe that McCarthy is the best contemporary writer alive, bar none."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Run-on sentences and a lack of quotation marks is no reason to condemn this beautifully-written novel. Actually, I found Mr. McCarthy's style wonderful because it gave me the feeling that I wasn't reading the story, but rather it was being told to me. This was appropriate, since the story felt more like a mythic tale than a western. On many levels this is a book about journeys. John Grady Cole embarks not only on a physical trek, but an inward maturation. He is escaping from a country that is maturing itself, and threatens to have no place for his type anymore. Those looking for a fast-paced &quot;shoot 'em up&quot; will be disappointed. McCarthy's writing is truly reminiscent of Faulkner. The content is more philosophical than action-packed. Overall, the word that best describes the book is &quot;hypnotic.&quot;"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"For those who did not particulairly like this book for its long sentences and use of Spanish, I say go back to reading the mundane and boorish books you must be use to. This is a classic mix of art and writing that is lost on so many books today. Most books I've read lately seem to have been adopted by the writers of USA Today. Why not read something that will cause you to slow down for a second and read a book the way you would sip a 12 year-old scotch. Imbibe the words and let them swirl in your mind.

I have read other works by McCarthy, including the other novels in this trilogy, and none match this book. The prose is powerful and moving, the plot riveting, the characters compelling. I have not seen the movie -- how could I be anything but disappointed in it? -- but even if one sets aside the grace and fluid strength of the writing, the story is remarkable for its passion and authentic feel...The punctuation meshes dialogue with narrative better. There isn't that much Spanish, it's ordinarily translated by other characters, ...-- a lot of the story takes place in Mexico...."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"In a nutshell: beautifully written and the characterizations were perfect.

A classic, good book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"It was a pretty good story, and I didn't find it as hard to read as some people claimed it to be. There are some parts in which McCarthy put in WAY too much detail though."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The richness and sensuality and mythology of McCarthy's work cannot be denied. As with all works of genius and its consequent complexities, this laconic work of love and loss interspersed with death and idyllic ignorance is indubitably bound to be unappreciated by a fair amount of people. However, the stature of McCarthy as perhaps the most important Southern writer of the century, omitting Faulkner, necessitates that the reader should attempt to experience his work on its numerous levels. At once a bildungromanic saga of a Southern boy's violently tragic yet uncomplaining initiation into a manhood governed by forces beyond his control, forces which over time clearly become other than those in whom he was brought up to believe--it is also an important continuation of the creation myth first established in &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; of the United States not only as a nation and a people, but also as an ideology, an experience, and a consequential destiny other than that promised by forefathers whose alleged intent and perfection had already been engraved in the halls of false American deism. This parable of disenfranchisement and the exile of the damned impoverished descendants of Southern society, the wandering sons of Cain who, disadvantaged and sensing their more naturalistic way of life vanishing in the vacuous moral chasm surrounding the years of the Second World War, have found the face of country their ancestors have taken from the Native Americans suddenly foreign and unwelcome, devoid of an enriching culture which is needed to sustain a society. The wanderings and listlessness of John Grady Cole are not just driven by youthful wanderlust, but by an ancestral guilt as well as an inherited subconscious longing for other lands, the same longing his forefathers felt and left their countries for to invest their tears and blood into the violent earth of a youthful America. Through his poetry not only of incredibly described landscape and locals of various locales, but his poetry of underdescription, of painful destinies and thoughts born but left unsaid, McCarthy presents us with not only a criticism of what the modern Americas have become, but also a lament for the loss of traditions and inherited cultural strengths which have either been whittled away by war or drained by the imminent encroaching standards of materialism which have led Northamerican society to judge a man not by the merits and resiliences of his heart but by the quality of fabric of which his garments are made. By presenting his myth of seemingly senseless death and pain and destined wandering into lands south of the border through the only truly Northamerican symbol that approaches the archetypical, that of the vagabond cowboy, McCarthy simultaneously calls into question and subverts the religion of superiority and violence named Manifest Destiny, thereby calling into question the very bloodstained foundations upon which our society has been built at the exact postwar point in historical time when America can truly be said to have lost its farcical innocence and purity and soon began to tear itself apart in an internal revolution criticizing the inhuman treatment of non-european Americans, and eventually combusting in the sixties into a criticism of the very aggrandizing imperialism upon which the country was built. At the end of McCarthy's work, all of the violence and malevolence lurking just beneath the surface of substances seems to presage the destined course of Cole's country, and after all of his wandering upon an endless terrain of sand, one begins to question just what the foundations of his country were built upon in the first place. Despite this, Cole survives, not as an American, not as a Mexican, but as a man who transcends national boundaries and is left without a home, left only with the resilience, the strength, and the stubborness of his forebears; and perhaps also a love for an unattainable Mexican woman of Spanish descent, the crimes of whose ancestors have also been called into question, a relationship and a passion which so astutely personifies the relationship of violence and fascination that still exists between Mexico and the United States even today. The entire work attests to the genius of McCarthy, both the subtlety of his implications as well as the sheer sensous beauty of the worlds his words create."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"the good points: the story itself is interesting and moves along for the most part making the book readable, and it's gets into some interesting detail and perspective in terms of mexican landscape and culture and horses, and it's not bad for an adventure story, which is why i finished it.the bad points: the book is almost entirely emotionally shut-down (written at about the emotional level of a fifteen year old, and not a very mature one at that), it totally idealizes machismo (glorifies being emotionally detached and tough), gives no reason as to why the two main american boy characters are close aside from some &quot;mysterious&quot; bond of loyalty which seems not to grow or change throughout the book - and their occasional philosophizing is trite and sillyfurther bad points: the main character grows to comically mythic proportions by the end of the book, almost as if he's become immortal and cannot be killed by the silly and foolish mexicans - on their own turf no less!, which to me is not only unrealistically pro-american but idealizes the myth of the invincibility of youth, which is dangerous...other trivial points that annoyed me: author's use of stylized grammar shifted throughout the book. for example, in the beginning ten pages in the prose (not the dialogue) he spelled the word &quot;didn't&quot; as follows - &quot;didn't&quot; - but then after that point, and for the rest of the book, spelled it &quot;didnt&quot;, with no apostrophe. annoying! and also, i felt the author was a show-off and a tease with his use of spanish dialogue. as i happen to speak spanish it was fine by me, but i find it annoying when authors gratuitously use foreign languages at length and do not translate, leaving the reader potentially out in the wind..."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Note: I made some Mormon reader angry over my reviews of books written by Mormons out to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews.So your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated.

McCarthy's flat, distinctive prose reads like poetry, and several passages were so breathlessly beautiful that I went back to read them again and again.All the Pretty Horses exists at a crossroads, both old west and new, as Cole and Rawlins leave their small town in Texas in 1949 to cross into Mexico at ages 16 and 17 looking for adventure. Along the way they meet up with Blevins, an even younger runaway who tries to recover his horse after losing it in a lightning storm. They end up being chased by the Mexican authorities, working on a ranch, breaking horses, falling in love, getting thrown in prison, and learning about the good, the bad, the old, and the new of life along the way.Truly this is a book to savor, and at the end I wished that it would go on.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy. I thought that it was a book worth reading and I liked it a lot. It was the story of a cowboy John Grady Cole who decides to go to Mexico with his best friend Lacey Rawlins. They believe Mexico will be a great place to live but it doesn't quite turn out like they thought it would. The book has no marks of punctuation such as quotation marks or exclaimation points. I believe this shows a lack of emotion from the speakers. Without quotation marks, it is also difficult to recognize a change of speaker and i often became confused because of this. The story line was good and i liked the theme of John Grady trying to become a carefree cowboy along with his friend Rawlins. This is not a sterotypical cowboy novel though. There is a lot of violence and some killing. John Grady also does not have a happy ending as one would think he should. He finds romance but it doesn't work quite the way he wants it to. What i didn't like about the book is when the characters begin speaking in Spanish. I didn't know what was happening and it really wasn't translated in the following text. I knew that they were in Mexico, so obviously that's why they spoke in Spanish. Overall it was a good book about John Grady not conforming to what others wanted and making his own destiny. He never took anything lying down. I give it a four out of five stars."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Not that I have a point of reference, but it seems that this book is extremely realistic and possibly autobiographical. The very detailed descriptions of horse husbandry, topographical details, and the culture of Texas and Mexico really wrap you into the story. The dialogue and actions of the characters also seem very authentic to the regions and customs.But that's not what the story is about. The story is about the meanderings through this countryside of a 16-year old boy and his maturation as he encounters people and events. There's no real plot to follow and anticipate (I would put the climax at 2/3 of the way through the book) but as John lives his life we see his development as a person. While at many times his command of Spanish and insights into people seem much older than his 16 years, his growth in responsibilites and consequences becomes the main highlight.I'd give it 3-1/2 stars if I could - at times, the story becomes bogged down in the details, but I was very satisfied with the book and, though not the most enjoyable of stories, is well written and worth the time, if just for the insight into the cultures and lifestyles involved."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book without realizing it was the first in a trilogy. That would explain the odd ending. As an historian of Spanish/American History, and one who operated a horse ranch in CA for more than a decade, I confess it is authentically written. Readers without knowing at least a modicum of spanish will find it essential to have a good Spanish Dictionary handy since much of the dialog is in that language. Parts of the book are exemplarary for its understanding of the cultures involved; southern Texas and Mexican, that exprresses as beautifully as any I have read the concept of the Mexican mind as it relates to the gente de razon as well as ordinary types with whom it would be best to stay clear. The first part of the book is tedious, but I found myself emotionally spellbound by parts in the latter portion of the work. McCarthy is a very good writer, and may have touched me because he and I are so close in age, and have had similar experiences. I would recommend the book to persons with open minds and who appreciate the subtleties of Mexican philosophy as essential to their lifestyle so different from our own. I cannot say toward what the plot is leading in volumes 2 and 3 since I have not read them; nor do I have a strong inclination to do so. From what I have read, it seems to me the title is totally inappropriate since there are so few pretty horses. I can only presume that the connection will be made in the later two volumes. The plot, as far as I am able to make it out, is a comparison between two cultures. Beyond that, I cannot say what value the book offers except that it contains passages of great beauty and comprehension toward the end."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Although it started a little slow, I was so happy w/it when I was finished.

I have read all of his books at least twice. I never get tired of him. All the Pretty Horses was my initiation into his canon. It will stand as a great work for years to come. His writing is lyrical and beautiful. I would suggest All the Pretty Horses to anyone who wants to get lost in a book. McCarthy builds a world for you to get lost in. The whole Border Trilogy is worth reading."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I am in the middle of my third reading of this book. McCarthy is incredible, and &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; is one of his best texts to date. My favorite aspect of owning this book is the ability to pick it up at any time--open to any page--an just start reading. The text reads like poetry and will put you in another place all together!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book for an English Class. You would think that for an English Class the book would be boring because it is one of those &quot;have to read or fail&quot; things. I not only read and kept up with this book, but I read ahead. I got lost in time with the book. The words, once I got used to McCarthy's prose, flowed together like nothing I had ever read before. The pages jumped out at me, and before I knew it, it was 2 oclock in the morning, and I had read my assignment for that night and the next night. McCarthy has a wonderful was of describing the events that Grady goes through to achieve what he wants to be. I highly recommend this book to everyone who get past the punctuation, or lack thereof if you will. This book is one of the best that I have ever read."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy writes the more vividly than any writer I have ever read. His plotlines absolutely refuse to be boring; they mix gunplay, love and greed in a way that I find utterly compelling, fascinating reading.My only criticism -- and it is a minor one -- is that in this book I had a harder time finding a \`\`point'' to the story as a whole.There is no shame in writing a story without a clear moral (esp. if the story is as good as this one), but I urge readers to check out some of McCarthy's earlier work that blends thought with plot a little better."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a major piece of work by a major writer.

Well Done!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I find it amazing that some of the reviews I've read here have found McCarthy's prose difficult.It is his supreme achievement that he is able to intensify his storytelling and brought such vividness and economy to his scenes like no other writer.This is done through a hard, laconic and spare style that allows him to roam and stretch his story into the epic without unnecessary length.In the hands of hacks,this story would have ballooned to 700 pages but McCarthy kept it down to a lean 300 without sacrificing tone.What was it that Hemingway said about prose; that it should be architecture and not interior decorating.This book is verbal cinema on a grand scale."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I don't know what to say, except that it's almost shocking to read something so beautiful and tragic. The book, like life itself, is full of wonder and full of pain.How can an author write such a book? I don't know, but good for us that he did."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I am a big McCarthy so thi smay be biased, but this is a fantastic book. Awesome environmental descriptions, you can almost smell the air on the plains. Main character perfectly realized, twists, turns and tragedy. Not your everyday western."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Book was written in a very impressionistic style. It's surreal and dreamlike and beautifully done. Touching, disturbing and sad in parts. Not your everyday novel with cowboys as subjects. A real piece of literary art."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I found the book &quot;All The Pretty Horses&quot; by Cormac McCarthy to be an exciting and compelling story of a young boy going out into the world and doing what he loves best, and that is to ride horses. On his journey, he comes across dangers, love, and friendship, as he learn that the new world he has come and love is not what it always seems to be."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Clearly &quot;genius&quot; is in the eye of the beholder. Sometimes reading through even a classic is slogging through muck, but ya make yourself do it, cause you know it's an established classic. I felt like I was reading great writing, but did find it fairly difficult to understand in places. Even after rereading passages (especially dialogue-who said what), it seemed not terribly clear. The genius of his style (if that's what it was) was lost on me, although I did like it allright. Also, while I appreciated the authenticity of Spanish dialogue, I felt like I could have been missing something significant, which annoyed me (I broke down finally and used a Spanish dictionary). Thought the story was brilliant, and the characters soulful. There do exist in this world precocious people, but John Grady Cole must be the most maturely drawn 16 year old in the history of literature. 18 woulda made a little more sense. I'd say it's a great book that I only liked a whole lot."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"My least favorite of McCarthy's works. I found this diorama and even the words he used extremely fine and spare, like the elegance of a bone found bleached white in the desert, but I personally prefer the rich gothic settings and language of his earlier work. Despite my dislove of the Border Trilogy McCarthy is still one of my all time favorite writers."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This book was pretty boring from the start. It's about John Grady Cole a teenager who left home to go to Mexico. On the way he has many adventures and trials. Him and Rawlins leave and ride across the border. On the way they pick up a skinny little guy named Blevins. He has a real nice horse and gun. In a freak storm he loses his horse and his gun. In Mexico they are hired to break horses at a hacienda. Grady falls in love for the owner's young daughter. Which in turn leads to an arrest and a sentence to a Mexical jail. He murders a man that is trying to kill him in jail and ends up getting out of jail. After he gets his horse back from a Mexican ranger. At the end of the story he goes home and meets up with Rawlins and says hello. Then he just drifted away. This book is great for anyone who likes boring reading that takes a long time to get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I was moved to write this review because of the number of badly written and uninformed reviews I read at this very site. McMarty's novel is elegant, brilliantly written in the Faulknerian tradition, evokes Melville and Dante, and is the most heartbreaking book I have ever read. Perhaps the nearing release of the movie has caused more teenagers to read the novel, but it's clear that many were not prepared for it. It's not an easy read. It's not for kids. It is for those who appreciate great literature and have the background to take on the contemporary modernist style that McCarthy uses. If you think you can handle these things, stop reading this review and go start reading right now."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I found it by accident when looking for a western to begin a couple hours before turning in one night. I'd been listening to Townes Van Zandt and wanted a novel full that kind of space and poetry. But it needed to be a western. It was available in ebook format from my local library and it immediately made my chest rise and fall and I could not sleep through the whole night. The next day I bought the physical copy to hold when finished. When I did finish, I read the last paragraph over and again. You don't review these books, you stand in wonder."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"He sure writes a pretty story, but in the end it all seemed like there was no meaning to it all. A boy has an adventure, and then it's over. That's it? I guess I missed the point."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"'All the Pretty Horses' is a very well written saga of a teenage boy from Texas, circa 1940s, wandering off down to Mexico with his buddy. Both guys are horsemen. Their Mexican adventure turns sour very quickly and they are then thrust into a mix of love, death and everything in between. The author's prose and characterizations are perfect. The only reason I don't give this book five stars is because I found the heavy use of Spanish dialogue to be very distracting. Although oftentimes one can get the gist of what was being said, too many times I was left puzzled. Yes, the use of Spanish did add quite a bit to the feel of the story. I think it would have been helpful if the author supplied translations (in footnotes, for example).Bottom line: quite an amazing story, .. and I don't even like horses. Recommended."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy seems to be everywhere right now--Oprah's book club, a recent Coen Brothers film adaptation, one of the top novels of the past quarter-century. I decided it was time to check out his work, since he's considered the modern Faulkner, and a great depicter of the violent and beautiful American southwest. All the Pretty Horses both lives up to my expectations and kind of frustrates them. The novel starts out gloomy with the funeral for the protagonist John Grady's grandfather, turns comedic when Grady and his friend cross the border into Mexico in search of adventure, then shifts into a semi-melodramatic romance, finally returning to a state of pitch-black gloom and despair. All throughout, McCarthy retains a distance from the world of the novel, coldly surveying the raw beauty of the Mexican landscape and stubbornly refusing to enter the heads of his equally stubborn characters. In some ways, this narrative distance works quite well, amplifying the frankness and simplicity that Hemingway is known for. But it also prevents the novel from striking home on any real emotional level.The most problematic part of the novel is Grady's passionate love for a ranch owner's daughter, Alejandra. The two are a sort of Romeo and Juliet pair, deeply desiring one another, but knowing that their love can never be allowed to flower. The romance, however, is jarringly out of place with the events in the rest of the novel, and feels a little bit contrived. Especially irritating is the lack of insight into Alejandra's character; she is given no more than a handful of lines, and it is never really clear what she sees in run-down, dirt-poor Grady.Minor criticisms aside, the icing to top off this striking novel, however, is McCarthy's metaphysical musing that underlies all the events of the novel. Most profound is his consideration of the workings of Fate in human activities. One of the best passages in the novel occurs when Grady confronts Alejandra's grand-aunt for the second time. She is determined to prevent him from stealing off with her prot&eacute;g&eacute;, but respects him enough to deliver a haunting and thorough account of her reasoning. She expresses her deep frustration with the randomness of life, describing a coin minter who arbitrarily decides which way to press each coin he makes, blindly affecting countless coin flips down the road. She laments the inability of mankind to ever know the alternative course that their actions could have taken; for a history that never sees the light of day, and can never be judged against what actually transpired. Building off this theme is Grady's fascination with the long-dead frontier of the American West. Early in the novel we see him wistfully imagining the hunting parties of the glorious and departed Native American tribes, disappearing in the red light of the setting sun. At the end of the novel, Grady likewise disappears, fading into history like so many movements whose splendor the world will never see."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I can't believe I've waited this long to get into Cormac McCarthy. We Texans have always known him to be one of the great Texas western writers, right up there with Larry McMurtry, earning a place in our hearts. But Cormac is bigger than that. Bigger than Texas, you say? His craft has been compared to Faulkner and Conrad. We're talking about literature here.After I saw the movie, \\"No Country For Old Men,\\" I knew I should read this guy and I'd start somewhere near the beginning. I picked \\"All The Pretty Horses,\\" the first in a series of novels called \\"The Border Trilogy.\\" John Grady Cole, last of a long line of Texas ranchers is sixteen years old and from San Angelo, Texas, takes off with friend Lacey Rawlins, on an adventurous hero's journey by horseback across country, over the Rio Grande and south into Mexico.Even though the time period is in the late 1940s and on the cusp of modern life, with cars, trucks and radios, the story is basically a western, with horses, cowboy coffee made over an open fire, guns, and hand rolled cigarettes. I like the sprinkling of Spanish throughout, even though I didn't comprehend it all. It was a nice touch.I'm not sure if it's the lack of some punctuation such as quotations and apostrophes, or the ultra long sentences, or the full to the brim characters, but it puts this novel in a class of its own. The writing is beyond good, it's classic. For all us regular folks who can't take the high-literary of Faulkner, here's a true and gritty albeit well written western. I plan to read the next two books, and find I can't wait to get into volume two. \\"Pretty Horses\\" was haunting, it's emotion and realism hard to stop thinking about."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy is undoubtably the finest American writer at this time. His prose has a lyrical quality that is not often found in modern writing, while always remaining attached to the reality of life in the raw. His prose is evocative of the land in which the story arises and of the people of the Texas border. Much of the writing defies convention in terms of structure. Much of the writing is wrong in a technical sense, but just so right in an evocative and emotional sense.This is writing that cuts straight to the heart. Like all great literature it opens a new window into the soul of humanity."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthyThe first volume of what's known as The Border Trilogy, All the Pretty Horses encompasses what I love about McCarthy's writing.Set in the late Forties, All the Pretty Horses follows teenage Texan John Grady Cole seeking a better life for himself in Mexico. He travels by horse with his slightly older friend, Rawlins, and on the way down they join up with a very young teenager named Blevins. They can tell Blevins is trouble, and he causes them more problems than they ever could have imagined. But John also finds some danger without the help of Blevins, and it involves the daughter of his new ranch boss that he just can't quit.McCarthy offers a bit more descriptive narration than I care for in this work, slowing it down at times, but his tight-lipped, capable, honorable, humble, and just plain tough John Grady Cole represents what I enjoy most about McCarthy's creations. John Grady Cole is the perfect McCarthy protagonist, and this neo-western perfectly conveys all that it means to be human--love, loss, betrayal, redemption, loyalty, and resolve.It is with great anticipation I look forward to completing The Border Trilogy.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This was one of the best reading experiences Ive ever had.

The dialogue took some getting used to and this isn't a love conquers all story, but I'll be looking for other books by this author."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"When I read this book, I was completely impressed with the author's power to draw you into the scene of the story. I mean, I was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses - and I've never seen them in real life. This book is very well-written, and the imagery is powerful and moving.The main character, Cole, is chasing after a lifestyle that has passed. A life that is no more. He wants beauty in the world; all he finds is pain and sorrow. And maybe that is the way it is for all of us. We want what he wants, but reality crushes our view that this world can be made perfect if only this could happen...if only that could happen...It cannot. This is one of the most powerful themes in the book: we are all chasing a life that in many ways cannot exist in this world."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy's wonderfully told story about western life is gritty. His characters shift through a perilous purgatory with depth and realism. You can almost feel the dust on your own clothes, the sun's heat on your neck, and smell the lathered horses. The story takes place while the true west is drying up before a cowboy's own eyes. He's caught between his family's ranching heritage and his own cloudy future. Often the characters fall from the razor thin ledge of purgatory into the pit of hell, but find a way back out.

I used to play television's Virginian for many years, and I hope that gives me some kind of credit in reviewing this book.I thought the book followed along well, but it was a pretty harsh, perhaps too harsh book at times.Anyone interested in reading about the West but not necessarily what one would call &quot;Westerns&quot; might want to pick up books by Elmer Kelton, Kirby Jonas or Mike Blakely as well. And give Cormac McCarthy a try. You might as well see for yourself. It may be just your style."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I have heard a lot about this book and finally got around to reading it (actually I listened to it on audio- the unabridged version, kudos to Frank Muller who did the reading). McCarthy's writing is absolutely amazing. Through much of the book, not a lot happens action-wise, but the writing is so fantastic that you are enthralled nonetheless. The dialogue in the book is unparalleled, I found myself wondering if McCarthy had studied philosophy at some point. Every character in the book has their own philosophical outlook, that through amazing dialogue, McCarthy is able to justify as a valid perspective on human nature. It is no surprise that this is a National Book Award Winner."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Over the weekend, I determined to read this National Book Award winner. The first 100 pages were about as much fun as a forced march with the Marines through a swamp.Mc Carthy, the author, introduced characters by pronoun, created mystery by obscurity, and chose to thumb his nose at Strunk and White. Quotation marks were absent, capitals, nearly so, apostrophes hit and miss in his contractions. He writes: cant, couldnt, but restores the \` in I'll, I've. He sprinkled Spanish over the desert description, which made me wonder how a reader from Wisconsin without an \\"enchilada\\" in his vocabulary might lose the picture. All the Pretty Horses relies on a comic book plot of teen-age fantasy. Tough, abandoned 16 year old boy and his cousin meet up with Annie-Oakley-sure-shot idiot who's some kind of a metaphor for Del Rio religious lightning, grunts his was to romantic tryst with Mexican beauty who slides into his bed nightly without waking up the hacienda, then finds himself an incarcerated horse thief, knives a Mexican hit man in the heart, is rescued Mexican style (jailer paid off) by feminist angel who lectures him in a 10 page monologue.His girl calls it quits in deference to her family but gives him one last lusty bed bounce in Zacatecas before a tearful goodbye.Our hero recovers his horses, fights his way home, is absolved by father-figure judge and I felt like the Indians when he passed the Yates Field, \\"They had no curiosity about him at all.\\""},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"What it is is a pretty good novelization of George Miller's great movie The Man from Snowy River (based on a poem by Banjo Paterson). McCarthy hasn't WF's metaphysics, these are replaced by truly brilliant descriptions of the southerwestern landscape that you need a Baedecker's to decipher. He's good at describing Marlboro Men doing Marlboro Men type things, but couldn't write a decent woman character if it meant five miles of downed fenceline. That McCarthy is so popular is less a reflection of his brilliance than the dearth of good literature out there. Then again, better read him than say, Colin Harrison. Or read Blood Meridian -- a truly brilliant work of genius., nothing like it in American Lit."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a rather depressing story - I don't understand why all the good reviews. The author has an irritating style of not clearly identifying who is speaking, so you have to kind of interpret who is saying what much of the time.

Novel however is an incorrect term as there is nothing new about what there is to enjoy which is every tenth line that in its stark simplicity and roughness harks towards the stylistic terms of Hemingway and the countless hacks who follow him. Is shallow masculinity a given in this territory? It would appear so if Mr McCarthy is to be taken as the future(ha,ha) of American writing. Why don't we all just admit what we like in his work, the pseudo-intelligent manliness...yes this is just a trumped up dime cowboy story so its best enjoyed as such. Indulge, preferably by getting all liquored up or by lighting up a butt(excuse the non pc image) out in the noonday heat of the ranch and read a little by little of a watered down teenage John Wayne. Just don't kid yourself that this is great writing, it is just great at delivering what we all hanker after, depressing as it may be to admit it.

That was not sleeping. That was not sleeping.&#65533; The books point of view for this novel is in second person. The main character of the story is John Grady Cole. John Grady is a dynamic person because he changes from a quiet kind of guy to a murderer and then falls in love that changes his personality.The major conflict of the book is that John is running away, along with his friend, Rawlins, from Georgia to seek a better life in Mexico, so they thought. After reaching Mexico John falls in love with a girl named Alejandra, whose family disapproves him and Alejandra leaves him. Because of this John becomes broken hearted and gets drunk and is thrown into jail. The captain of the jail house takes John out into the desert intending to leave him there, but John finds his pistol and shoots the Captain and leaves him there to die.John goes to a judge and tells him everything that he has done.

McCarthy wrote this book with ferocious energy and puts other writers having their noses looking down on the ground.

I had a difficult time with character dialogue not being surrounded with quotation marks and extrememly long sentences left me lost without time to pause for thought. The main character, John Grady Cole,is tactfully designed to include all the elements of romance within this fictional novel and is of paramount importance to thematic setting.

And this stuff, with its pompous drawn out sentences, ain't worth squat either."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a unique book, to say the very least. It is also HIGHLY overrated. It is NOT as good as the fantastic reviews of it would have you believe. It's very aggrivating and confusing to read. To begin with, all the Spanish is aggrivating to wade through, especially when you do not speak the language. (I've been told it's all meaningless by people that have translated it all, but it's still aggrivating.) The dialogue is hard to follow, and the complete lack of punctuation makes me wonder if McCarthy failed freshman English in high school. (Throughout the entirety of the book, I kept thinking that if I wrote a paper as grammatically flawed as this novel for school, I would fail miserably, and I sure wouldn't win any awards.) The one saving grace of the novel comes with Alejandra, and she is the only interesting character as far as I'm concerned. Her final scenes are emotional and painful to read, and it's impossible not to feel the same emotions John Grady feels. This is the one good point to the novel, but it's not enough to save the 200+ below-parr pages that comes before and after it. Personally, I'd much rather have read a novel about Rawlins than John Grady."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I'm only on the second page and cannot believe this book actually won awards!

After the fifth or sixth time I had to reread to see if it was text or quote I thought, gee, this author is too smart for a dum-dum like me, I guess I'm just not sophisticated enough for him. Well, good for his arrogance, but the pretentious writing style turns this reader off."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I would normally say this book was torturous, but there were a good...maybe ten pages in the book. It is all description, but not about anything of interest. There is very little action and when there is action, it is in run-on sentences and you wind up completely confused in the end anyway. I'd say- don't read it. You'll be sorry if you do."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Years ago I tried reading this book and stopped after seeing the author did not have the consideration to use quotation marks for his readers. Twice I could not read five pages before giving up. Then I bought a Spanish copy and gave it another shot (though it didn't matter for me, I thought it inconsiderate of the author to his reader...), and stopped after 82 pages. The story is not so bad, but to have to reread sentences to figure out if its text or not so often detracts from the story. Dilletantes can boast of the aesthetic and how it adds, and that's fine, I love style, but I'm also considerate of the reader. Damn, the guy's a smashing success, so what does he care? But would the story be any less if it were an easier read?"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I agree with mr. niceguy. What is with McCarthy and his excess use of word 'and'? Admittedly, the word 'and' is very important in the English language, however, excessive use of this word is outrageously ignorant, not to mention very distracting? You hear 'and'quite a bit in everyday speech, I admit. But no one really use 'and' like a gazillion times in one sentence, like McCarthy attempts in all of his books, not just in 'All the Pretty Horses'. The first McCarthy's book that I read is 'The Road'and I have to say, it wasn't a bad read, although not very original. Nevertheless, I read on to his other books and it was uncanny how much he tries to be Hemingway, except he does not use the apostrophe for a word like 'didn't' (he writes didnt, how about a good typewriter huh?) nor does he use the quotation marks, just to be original I guess. But hardly, this guy is a hack. I love Hemingway and I appreciate his use of the word 'and' in his writing. This guy is no Hemingway. He just tries too hard to be the great Hemingway and he uses a lot more 'and' than he should. Anyone who reads and loves this guy, I'm sorry to say, is just not willing to admit that, deep down, this guy is untalented, unoriginal, and a hack of Hemingway at best. I would puke, yes puke, if they are stupid enough to award him the Nobel Prize. Well, they did give him the Pulitzer for a book about nothing more than a man, a boy, and a shopping cart with one bad wheel, \\" The Road\\" I admit is not a bad read, but for crying out loud, not something deserving of a Pulitzer Prize?"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy's &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; was critically acclaimed as one of the better works of modern American fiction. After reading the book, I can't help but agree with the reviewers. McCarthy has created a classic, a must-read for anyone, regardless of personal taste. For one thing, there is a little bit of everything - a heartbreaking love story, violent action sequences, realistic portrayal of mid-20th century plains life, and inclusion of even the most minute details of setting. The careful attention to detail can get tedious (it's almost reminiscent of Dickens -- \\"oh no!\\") but the landscapes McCarthy creates are beautiful enough to make the descriptions worth your while. The violent scenes are created so bluntly, as if McCarthy is talking about the weather as of late, that they seem all the more shocking to the reader. And the love story - wow. I've never read anything that seemed more real; McCarthy took some of the most trite and often-used ideas of romantic stories (the girl being the most beautiful thing the man had ever seen, the man being out of breath when he saw her) and created a tragically beautiful story that was startlingly realistic. His descriptions of the ordinary events that transpired in the novel were anything but trite or commonplace; McCarthy used fresh, thought-provoking similes and metaphors alongside deep psychological character analysis to pursue the realistic aspects of his character and plot. In short, I highly recommend this book to anyone, even those who don't particularly like \\"westerns\\", because to call it a western would be to shortchange this novel. It is a profoundly emotional yet soft-spoken tale, highly entertaining and edifying."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"In retrospect, this novel is one of my favorites in a long while. I found the structure a little daunting at first (somewhat Frank McCourt-like, to my eye), and it took a few pages (no chapters here; just four &quot;volumes&quot; within the novel) to get going, but once I got into the rhythm of McCarthy's stylistic prose, I found the plot riveting, and LOVED the characters. Speaking of the characters, they are developed through spare, telling dialogue and their actions, a refreshing change from the too common technique of authors outlining of characteristics. It's funny; as I was reading it, the Brad Pitt character (Tristan?) of the &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; film came to mind for John Grady--then I saw that he reads on the audio version and, I surmise, will star in the film. Wish this had been my assigned reading in AP English--beats Joseph Conrad, in my opinion!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I though the book was O.K. and that it was thoughtful and evocative of emotion at some points but that the overwhelming problem with it was the never-ending continuation of sentences which began to get on my nerves and admit it got on yours too especially since there was no punctuation whatsoever in many cases and you just got more and more frustrated as he just kept refusing to add a single comma and if he had it certainly would have helped a little bit and in conclusion while this was an interesting and at times very emotional while remaining intellectually objective book I just got sick of the lack of punctuation and frankly I dont think I would read other stuff by the guy until he learns to drop the conjunctions for once and finish a simple sentence."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Just read this book. Like all of McCarthy's stories, this one pulls at your heart. A superman cowboy falling in love with the perfect senorita in Mexico. But in my humble opinion, the writing is too deep, too artsy, too ambitious. It's like he's trying to win a trophy for elegance. I found myself reading many of his sentences over and over and over trying to figure out what exactly he was saying. For many of the sentences, I still don't know. Clueless. One sentence took up half the page, and rambled on and on and on about the sky and the mountains and Lord knows what else. Don't get me wrong, I love his stories. The Road still haunts me to this day. Read it if you haven't. But sometimes I think his writing could be more succinct without losing its depth and color. I'm ashamed to say this, but with All The Pretty Horses, I found myself skipping over large chunks of description just to get to the meat of the story. I've never done that before. I'm an avid reader. Have been all my life. But this book wore me out. Of course, it did win some pretty prestigious awards. So I imagine someone out there enjoys his over the top style of writing. I'll keep reading McCarthy, but I'll also keep skipping over 120 word sentences. By the way, if you're going to read this, get a library card and read it for free. You might also have a Spanish translator handy."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I guess I am late discovering Cormac McCarthy. I've heard of him for years but and now finally reading his novels. This is my third.This is a highly stylized Western themed novel that combines cutting edge writing techniques with old fashion speech patterns. I wonder if there are really people who are so calm and cool, especially at that young age. And did people ever really say things like \\"yon side of the river.\\"Wonderful writing -a beautiful book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, although it's probably more highly praised than it deserves to be. You can tell its serious literature because of the general lack of punctuation and unconventional composition. McCarthy's writing style is likely to be off-putting to some, but there is a lot to like about this novel. While novels that are branded (rightly or wrongly) as works of serious literature generally have something to say, they often don't have a story to tell. This is something that I really appreciate about McCarthy as an author. There are issues and themes that he clearly wants to explore in his fiction, but he builds his novels (at least the one's I've read) on the foundation of a compelling story.Ultimately, the theme of this novel reminded me a lot of No Country for Old Men. From my perspective, both novels are essentially about how the world (or at least the Country) is changing and how futile it can be for one man to resist it. In All the Pretty Horses, John Grady Cole romanticizes the cowboy era, a way of life that is fading away, like the setting sun. He stubbornly refuses to compromise his world view, speaking plainly and honestly, doing what he feels is right no matter what the cost, and standing up for what he believes in. Needless to say, this kind of integrity comes with a price and Cole, and his companions suffer greatly for these choices.McCarthy's prose is at times stark, at times gorgeously realized. Descriptions of the harsh land and vivid sunsets are, at times, quite astonishing. But it is the dialogue in this novel that is especially sharp and insightful. McCarthy draws obvious contrasts between the straight-forward words of John Grady Cole and characters who engage him in philosophical discussions, speaking with eloquence and manipulating language. Some of the best dialogue occurs between Cole and the great aunt of the girl he loves. These passages are worth reading again and again.I do have a few complaints though. One definite shortcoming is the romance in the story. The character of Alejandra is superficial at best and the entire romance feels a little too contrived. My other complaint might sound strange but I found the action in the final pages of the novel, while compelling, actually held the novel back a little. In the end, the action takes over the final pages of the novel and reflection on the larger issues and themes become secondary. While the pages turn quickly as Cole engages in shootouts and a race across the Mexican badlands, the strength of this novel comes in subtler forms; in the dialogue and ruminations about fate and religion. It's as if the novel abruptly switches gears. While on some level I enjoyed the pacing at the end, I was left with a sense that much of the story's potential had been sacrificed.McCarthy is fast becoming one of my favorite authors. All the Pretty Horses is not a perfect novel, and perhaps not worthy of all the aclaim it has received, but its well worth reading. 4 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy is a great writer, and this a great American novel. The novel is conventionally plotted and very readable. Like \\"The Road\\", it is a book that one can love; it does not require the effort that the novels of writers like Pynchon or Dellilo do, nor does it tax the reader's patience. Reader-friendly fiction is a good thing, and the novel's accessability makes it no less literary or substantial.McCarthy's prose is breathtaking. His descriptions of the landscape, his dialogue (including dialogue between the American hero and a variety of Mexican characters) is flawless, and every now and again McCarthy will deliver lines with the force of a shot to the solar plexus. Literary critics compare him to Faulkner, though sometimes he sounds like Hemingway. It is amazing that McCarthy could be compared to two such different writers. But he does have elements of both, and is a great stylist in his own right. I must say that McCarthy moves me in a way that Faulkner never did.The protagonist, John Grady Cole, and his sidekick Rawlins are two very appealing characters. Cole's Mexican lover and her family are also complex and ultimately very appealing characters. These may well be the most lovable characters in McCarthy's fiction. This is part of what makes this book so appealing.McCarthy is a Pulitzer-prize and even Nobel-prize caliber writer because he struggles with ultimate themes. The book is more than a coming of age novel, though for that genre I think it is much better than \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\", \\"A Separate Peace\\", or \\"Rule of the Bone.\\" I see the youth of the protagonist as a good device for placing the individual in his proper context vis a vis nature and human society. The individual is small and insignificant compared to nature, and even humanity seems dwarfed in McCarthy's view. Cole struggles to meet his basic needs -- love, craft, survival -- in the face of a hostile world and alien culture.Most striking is Cole's desire to do the right thing. Ethics seems almost quixotic and comic in the face of the sheer ruthlessness of the natural and man-made forces arrayed against the individual. Cole's decision to go back to his tormentors and reclaim his property is remarkably foolish and self-destructive, but somehow necessary and appealing. In a nice touch at the end of the novel, Cole goes to an American judge for judgment and validation. Ultimately, he's his own harshest critic.Given Cole's appeal, I find the book to be ultimately positive and humanist in outlook, though perhaps Mr. McCarthy would snicker at this sentiment.This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy was born in Rhode island and grew up in Tennessee, but now lives in Tesuque, New Mexico. He is viewed by many as one of the more unusual and most talented of the current American writers. For example, Harold Bloom has written a number of things about McCarthy.Some describe Mccarthy as a loner. Coincidentally, that is what one might call the protagonist in the present novel: John Grady. The novel is set in the 1950s time period and Grady is a young man or mature boy caught between the horse and buggy days of the old west and the new west connected by modern highways. Grady has a fascination for horses and is a talented rider.The story is about two men who ride their horses into Mexico and work as ranch hands in Mexico. It is part love story and part a tale of justice and adventure, i.e.: Grady meets a woman in Mexico. The protagonist is a sympathetic character and most readers will find it to be a compelling read.Some might not like it for the prose. The prose is complicated by design. I thought the first thirty pages were sometimes a bit awful but effective as well, but then McCarthy lightens up a bit on his writing. He reminded me a bit of the opening of Farewell to Arms where Hemingway tries to set the mood through the use of prose: Hemingway uses a narrative of the natural surroundings. McCarthy uses expressions such as \\"the sun sat blood red and elliptic,\\" and these seem out of place when compared to the spartan dialogue of a father and son talking over a breakfast of eggs and coffee.Also, McCarthy uses what is called polysyndeton, or the use of several conjunctions in close succession, especially where some might be omitted. It is a stylistic scheme used to slow down the tempo. As pointed out by others, polysyndeton is used extensively in the King James Version of the Bible. For example:\\"And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.\\" Genesis 7:22-24One of the best parts in the book - and exceptional writing by the way - is where he describes a dream in the middle of the book about horses running free on a plain and he does so in 18 continuous lines with no punctuation.So, this is based on some universal themes, set in Texas and Mexico, and has some interesting and complicated prose. Once you get passed page 30 to 50, it is a novel that is hard to put down. I read most of the novel in an evening.Highly recommended page turner: 5 stars."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Why does this master craftsman, perhaps the dean, of American letters refer to hats six times in the first two pages of this masterwork of the West? \\"He took off his hat and came slowly forward\\" (the second sentence in the book). \\"He stood with his hat in his hand.\\" \\"He walked out on the prairie and stood holding his hat like some supplicant to the darkness over them and he stood there for a long time.\\" \\".... and the sound came lagging and he stood still holding his hat in his hands ....\\". \\"He hung the hat on a peg by the door and came .....\\" \\".... and the women sat holding on to their hats.\\" These references, of course, are carefully designed. The hat is to stand for something essential, is critical to the picture being painted.The ALL THE PRETTY HORSES story is about sustaining personal integrity as the very purpose and meaning of life. The setting is mid-twentieth century west Texas and northern Mexico. There are few possessions that matter, but those that do, matter fiercely. Horses and hats are among them. A horse we can understand, but a hat is an inanimate object. Why should it matter so much?To many, the western hat is a badge. Wearing it says something loud and clear about the beliefs and values of its owner. When and how to hold it, when and how to wear it, when to hang it, how to use it as a tool - this is much more than just another article of clothing. The importance of hats to this sub-culture of America cannot be overstated any more than one can overstate the importance of hats to Hasidic Jews or devout Muslims. Hats have always been important symbols. As covering to the cranium, is it any wonder? So add Cormac McCarthy to the list of those who understand and appreciate hats.

In other words, these people probably also had a hard time understanding the chronology of Pulp Fiction and couldn't figure out how John Travolta could be alive again since he was dead just a second ago. I never knew how someone couldn't immediately rearrange and make sense of the film's plot, but such a significant amount of people have been genuinely mystified by its narrative that I now accept that many audience members to art lack a certain ability to accept given information and make intuitive leaps except through the most conformist and old-fashioned methods. Their pleasure is dependent upon familiar tools and mechanics, and without them they are lost. I know this may sound condescending to some readers--I can guess who they are--but condescending is not my aim. As to the second complaint of McCarthy's repetitive usage of the word \\"and,\\" I can only say that it only makes sense that somone whose reading experience demands quotation marks would be equally baffled at McCarthy's poetic usage of the word \\"and,\\" a technique that is definitely out of the norm. That being said, this book was one of the great reading experiences of my life. It is one of the few books I've ever read twice. I was deeply moved at the and the prose is breathtaking and poetic throughout.

This novel is probably one of the most disengaging books I have ever read. Not only did I not finish the book, I had a extremely hard time keeping my mind on the story. I give it three stars because it was beautifully worded and it was very desriptive. As far as a plot goes, there was none."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"&quot;...his grandfather looked up from his plate at the painting as if he'd never seen it before and he said those are picture book horses and went on eating.&quot; (16) Horses are one of the main focuses in All the Pretty Horses. They are held as sacred and an object of affection for the characters in the book. They are what life is based around and an intense topic of discussion. John Grady Cole and his cousin Lacey Rawlings are the main characters in the book. Hardened by their tough life in the rugged area of southern Texas and northern Mexico, they set off on a perilous journey. Driven by the desire of a better and more fulfilling life, All the Pretty Horses reports a detailed account of their adventures. John Grady Cole is sixteen years old and like all of the other characters in the book, has a fascination and love of horses. There has been a recent death in his family and his mother left his father and him on the family's Texas ranch and went to the city. John Grady is a dynamic or round character. At the beginning of the novel, he is a little naive and unaware of the brutal harshness of life. He has been toughened by hard ranch life, but he does not fully understand the ways of the world. He shows compassion towards other characters in the novel. Although in a sense he has lost his mother, he does not know the true sadness of a lost loved one. By the end of his journey he understands the brutality of life and no longer enjoys the innocence of childhood. Rawlings is a static or flat character. He is seventeen and lives on a ranch as well. Little is revealed about Rawlings' past or home life in the novel. He is tougher than John Grady is and does not come across as being naive. He uses strong language throughout the novel and shows little sympathy towards other characters excluding John Grady. He is the definition of a true cowboy. His experiences throughout the novel do not have the same life altering effect on him as they do on John Grady. These two cousins and best friends yearn for something more. They want a better life and future. With hopes of achieving this, they set off for Mexico. They meet a young boy named Blevins who rides with them for awhile. Rawlings and John Grady share different emotions about Blevins, which reveals their characters more clearly. Blevins eventually gets them into serious trouble and the situation they arrive in forever alters their lives. The most remarkable aspect of this novel is the way it is written. Characters are often referred to as he or she. Dialogue never has quotation marks around it and the phrase he said or she said or something similar to that seldom is at the end of a statement of dialogue. Often times the reader must guess who is speaking. The novel is littered with foul language, however that helps to show characterization and the setting more clearly. Spanish is used quite frequently with no translation guide. Often times important parts of the book are written in Spanish. Studying three years of Spanish will be helpful in reading this book or a Spanish-English dictionary will be sufficient. There are a few things to consider when reading this novel. Be sure to read dialogue carefully and pay special attention to what is said because often times dialogue hints at who is speaking and more about the characters or their situations. Make sure you have a Spanish dictionary because entire conversations are done in Spanish frequently. At first the novel will seem slow and redundant. Do not give up. The novel is divided into three parts and the second half of part two and all of part three is extremely good. You will find it hard to put it down and become lost in the story. This novel is in a way a coming of age story. John Grady and Rawlings learn about themselves as well as the world. Teenagers will especially relate to this story and realize that they are not alone in the emotions that they feel. By reading this story, the reader will gain an understanding of what life was like at the beginning of the nineteen hundreds and become aware of the lawlessness and poverty stricken regions of southern Texas and northern Mexico. The reader will understand their dependency and relationships with their horses better and realize why the novel was titled All the Pretty Horses. There are many themes in this book and all of them are important. If taken seriously, the reader can be changed by the message in this book, however I will leave it up to you to discover what those themes are."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I understand why everyone likes this book, but all the hyperbole seems to be feeding off itself. There is little about \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" that will have people still talking about it a generation from now. It is not a classic, in my opinion, but I thought it might be one all through the first half of the book. The language is so evocative and poetic as it describes the south-western scenery and establishes the characters. Very spare and beautiful and pure. Then, when the story's complications set in down in Mexico, the book degrades quickly to a run-of-the-mill adventure tale. All the subtlety and poetry in the book vanishes as McCarthy does nothing more than relate a series of increasingly violent actions. This is a problem since the pristine poetry of the first half promises a revelation of truth - a promise that is not kept. Instead of any kind of rare, penetrating insight, the reader is served up an action movie in print. The story devolves from fine literature to genre fiction with alarming abruptness. As I read this book, I was reminded of the countless Hollywood films I've seen that start out so promising with clever, engaging scripts, only to lose their nerve and segue into the typical car chases, explosions and gun play. Very entertaining, perhaps, but common. Even the book's romance is generic. ... In the end, \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" is still a great read, it's just not great literature."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses backs life into a corner, to truly experience it at its core. A book of strength and power, it is profound to the last word. The struggle of man and nature are forver present, from John Grady Cole's intuitive sense about horses, to the landscape of the rugged south. The theme of man and horse is stressed throughout the novel, and is unlike any description ever written. Man and horse, like man and nature, have a connection that goes back before time was ever recorded. This theme plays out through the entire novel, from John and Rawlins taming of the wild horses in Mexico, to their bonds with their own trusty steeds, and to John's dreams of horses. The friendship between the two teens is one of deep trust and comraderie, a mirror of their souls. As John discovers life in it's true, and at times harsh form, he comes of age, finding himself among the desolate plains of Mexico. Through struggles and reality, John survives, his spirit changed forever. The end of the book breathes new life into the battered hero, laying the world to come before his feet. A book full of unique romance, struggle, triumph, and all that is western, All the Pretty Horses takes a dramatic look into the soul and spirit of all that is man."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"If any writer can be truly said to have taken up where Faulkner let off, it would be Cormac McCarthy. All the Pretty Horses is but one example of why this is so. Simply put, this is a phenomenal novel. That does not mean it is always pleasant. Often times its power comes in its bleakness and its shocking brutality, and this is because neither of those two attributes are arbitrary or gratuitous.This is the story of John Grady Cole, his cousin Rawlins, and the young drifter, Blevins, who takes up with them and who inadvertently involves them in the great conflict that rests at the center of the story. There is a love story here as well, also wrapped in tragedy. Above all else, in my opinion, the story is about the human search for transcendence and the war that the brutalities of life wage against that search and hope.Now, that is my opinion. It is based not only on my own reading of this novel but also on my reading of McCarthy in general. I believe that the tension between the seeming purposelessness of life and the human awareness of some transcendent truth or reality beyond this theatre of the absurd is one of McCarthy's great explorations and contributions.All the Pretty Horses fairly teems with this tension. One can feel the struggle in the repeated conversations between John Grady and Rawlins over issues of transcendence. Consider, for instance, their conversation about judgment.You think there'll be a day when the sun won't rise?Yeah, said John Grady. Judgment day.When you think that'll be?Whenever He decides to hold it.Judgment day, said Rawlins. You believe in all that?I don't know. Yeah, I reckon. You?Rawlins put the cigarette in the corner of his mouth and lit it and flipped away the match. I dont know. Maybe.I knowed you was a infidel, said Blevins.Or consider their discussion on the possibility of Heaven.You ever think about dyin?Yeah. Some. You?Yeah. Some. You think there's a heaven?Yeah. Don't you?I don't know. Yeah. Maybe. You think you can believe in heaven if you dont believe in hell?I guess you can believe what you want to.Rawlins nodded. You think about all the stuff that can happen to you, he said. There aint no end to it.You fixin to get religion on us?No. Just sometimes I wonder if I wouldn't be better off if I did.Or consider their conversations on the possibility of providence.You think God looks out for people? said Rawlins.Yeah. I guess He does. You?Yeah. I do. Way the world is. Somebody can wake up and sneeze somewhere in Arkansas or some d-- place and before you're done there's wars and ruination and all hell. You dont know what's goin to happen. I'd say He's just about got to. I dont believe we'd make it a day otherwise.John Grady nodded.Or consider their conversation about prayer.You ever pray? said Rawlins.Yeah. Sometimes. I guess I got kindly out of the habit.Rawlins was quite for a long time. Then he said: What's the worst think you ever done?I dont know. I guess if I done anything real bad I'd rather not tell it. Why?I dont know. I was in the hospital cut I got to thinkin: I wouldn't be here if I wasn't supposed to be hrere. You ever think like that?Yeah. Sometimes.The topic of God comes up even between John Grady and the kidnapped captain.The captain nodded at the wound in his leg, still bleeding. The whole trouserleg dark with blood.You going to die, he said.We'll let God decide about that. Let's go.Are you no afraid of God?I got no reason to be afraid of God. I've even got a bone or two to pick with Him.You should be afraid of God, the captain said. You are not the officer of the law. You dont have no authority.Perhaps most poignant of all is the brief but telling comment made by an old man to John Grady as John Grady is making his way back to Texas. In the scene, the two are watching a young and newly-married bride and groom emerge from the church building.He stood at the window of the empty cafe and watched the activities in the square and he said that it was good that God kept the truths of life from the young as they were starting out or else they'd have no heart to start at all.There you have it: \\"the truths of life\\" (i.e., the reality of evil, the struggle for survival), God (i.e., the great transcendent reality Who is there if seemingly distant at times), and \\"or else they'd have no heart to start at all\\" (i.e., the struggle to reconcile these two realities). I believe McCarthy's novel The Road is about the exact same thing. So is No Country for Old Men.McCarthy is a breath-takingly good writer. Truly. And All the Pretty Horses is a serious and important novel. It is what a great book should be.

When you are finished reading the trilogy, read Blood Meridian, another classic!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy stays with you--for years. I've enjoyed \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" but would have liked a Spanish dictionary on the table. Chsracters spring true to life."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is beautifully written even though the tale itself is somewhat contrived. The main character is a 16 year old boy who wants only to be a cowboy but his mother is selling the family ranch. He runs away to Mexico with a friend and there finds a series of adventures, work on a ranch and his first love. It is hard to believe in a 16 year old being so mature. He sets out on his journey and only looks forward. Never seems to miss anything behind. besides being an expert horseman, he is well read, plays excellent chess and can handle a gun. I enjoyed this for the writing. It captures the essence of a country and a way of life. The book forms pictures in a sparse and rough style. The sounds of the night, the feel of a horse. Like James Lee Burke's descriptions of the south , this is a richly drawn portrait of Mexico."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Wonderful, lyrical yet tough. Probably among McCarthy's top 3 books, and that's saying something. The rest of the \\"Border Trilogy\\" is very fine as well but I still consider this one the best."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book in my sophomore year of highschool but I didn't really grasp the brilliance and magic of the book. I do admit that I skipped a lot of the spanish conversations and I was frustrated with so much detail.BUT...I decided to read it again four years later and I felt like a complete idiot for missing out on the magic of Cormac McCarthy's words. The story itself is something I think a lot of people can relate to. No, not very many people actually run off to Mexico on horseback to seek adventure but how many of us just want to escape when life throws you a curve ball?the characters are so well done, the conversations between John Grady Cole, Rawlins, and Blevins are simple yet you are captivated and for the spanish I had skipped through my first time reading it, actually adds to the story. Its beautifully done so that it makes the story come to life but you don't really need to fully understand exactly what they are saying, Cormac has drawn the reader into the story and the emotions of their journey that you get a sense of what is being said just fine.The details of this book are amazing and paints the perfect picture in your head. Cormac McCarthy has a wonderful gift and his books are really pieces of art."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I haven't read a book by Cormac McCarthy that I haven't loved. I was skeptical of 'All the Pretty Horses' mainly because I was so unblown away by theBilly Bob Thornton movie. The book is amazing. It is more approachable thanBlood Meridianbut still wrestles with huge and heavy themes. I think I agree with my brother - McCarthy isnt just theFaulknerof our era, he's perhaps theMilton.McCarthy's books are poetic views of good and evil, heaven and hell, love and loss, courage and constancy, guilt and redemption, light and darkness, life and death. Screw the little things McCarthy only has so many words he can spare and only has time for the beauty and the music of things as they are."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The story was excellent but difficult to read at times. Unless you know Spanish plan to skip over conversations."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The first of Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy, \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" captures the magnificence and poetry of a now-disappeared American frontier.The prose itself imparts the characters' emotions even as their speech is spare; the sheer amount of attention, the carefully recorded detail, placed on the boys' surroundings shows the love both of them have for the horses and the land.Without punctuation such as quotation marks, the dialogue and the descriptions blend together like the earth and sky at the farthest horizon. The book is slow-moving at times, but that only serves to make you feel like you are trotting along with the characters for the many miles they cover. The reader can't help but be drawn into John Grady's world and to feel a fraction of his sense of belonging in and to a majestic land.Much like Mark Twain, McCarthy captures the easy, effortless dialect of a fading class of people. The cowboys refuse to be confined to convention and modern norms, and their speech reflects their nonconformity. Their dialogue is rife with run-on sentences and spelling that reflect spoken words, making it truly believable and captivating.This book has received great critical acclaim, including the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, and I can see why.Though I can't recommend this book to everyone--the slow, steady pace that pervades much of the beginning will be a turn-off to readers looking for plenty of action--I would recommend it to readers of genres spanning literary fiction and westerns, as well as to anyone looking for a good, solid read.For a complete review, visit my site, Melody & Words!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This was the first McCarthy book I read, and I found it riveting. The writing and the action are deeply engaging. I'm a big Hemmingway fan, especially For Whom the Bell Tolls, and this book reminded me of that story, somehow."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"After 20 pages of reading All the Pretty Horses, I put down my book and stared at the cover. What the heck was happening? What was Cormac McCarthy trying to say? There was a funeral. There was a boy named John Grady Cole. Some lady wanted to sell his ranch and he had a very confusing conversation with his father. The lack of quotation baffled me and the ambiguous characters frustrated me, but I couldn't stop reading.McCarthy has an incredible gift. The story he spins begins in 1949 in San Angelo, Texas. When John Grady Cole's grandfather dies, his mother sells the family ranch to pursue a more glamorous career in acting. For John Grady, life on a ranch was \\"the second best thing to dyin and goin to Heaven,\\" so he and his friend Lacey Rawlins set off for Mexico on horseback (17). Near the border John Grady and Lacey meet a younger boy who calls himself Jimmy Blevins. The three cross the Rio Grande and through a course of events end up discovering happiness, despair, and maturity among all the land and horses.Though the plot is very compelling, it is McCarthy's words and style that really make the novel impossible to put down. McCarthy has a style all his own that takes a slightly improvised coming of age story and makes it a classic. He juxtaposes long, complex sentences with brief statements and breaths into every character such life. Within the text he adds a great deal of Spanish without translation or explanation bringing the reader even further into Mexico with the protagonist. McCarthy is an anomaly in modern literature, and I would suggest this book to anyone seeking a simply well written, good book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I am reading the book for my Senior English class, and it seems to be ok. It is really confusing in the beginning which made me hate it, but it is starting to unfold. Overall, its not bad. Its a great piece of American literature. It is straight to it, there is no \\"trying to make people happy\\". It tells it exactly the way it is, foul language and all. There is some humor, and that really adds to it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I liked this book right from the start.I'd already read The Road (took me 22 hours) and No Country For Old Men, so I was a bit familiar w/ McCarthy's style.I had read 1/2 of Blood Meridian, but found it a bit tough to read, so I wanted something that read quicker.I gave this 4 stars, only because I'm super picky. A 5 star rating would need to totally rock my world, which this book didn't.But it was a very good read.The movie was very close to the book. I recommend watching the movie AFTER reading the book, which is normally the case."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"perhaps the most memorable of the Border Trilogy..Cormac McCarthy takes a little getting used to as far as his literary style but once you find the rhythm of his words sit back and enjoy being transported to a world of masterful prose..John Grady Cole is 16, parents divorced and his grandfather, the only adult he's close to dies then his world changes..deprived of life on his grandfather's ranch after it's sold..he decides to cross the border into Mexico..he's joined on the trip by an old friend, Lacey Rawlins..along the way they meet another teenager, Jimmy Blevins, most likely riding a stolen horse..the three amigos ride into Mexico..and what awaits is a journey that turns them from kids into men..in a harsh Western way..beautifully told...splendid imagery.."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The hero of the book is a teenager who takes off on his own when the grandfather who cares for him dies. Throughout his travels on horseback he meets a couple of other boys and they travel to Mexico. The traveling becomes more and more exciting, and all three main characters are fun to know.I read this book very quickly because I enjoyed it so much. The writing style is honest and direct, and the characters are richly developed.The movie was cute -- but nothing compares to seeing the actions and characters in the writer's own words."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read All the Pretty Horses about two years ago, and although I enjoyed the physical descriptions of the land (and I absolutely fell in love with John Grady Cole), I found Cormac McCarthy's writing style to be very odd. I wasn't used to tripping through pages of dialogue with no quotation marks to guide me! I think that, although McCarthy should be free to write in any style he wishes, to a casual reader like myself his style detracts from the pleasure of reading the book. If you, like me, don't want to wrestle through the novel itself, then I recommend getting the audiobook, read by Brad Pitt. Brad adapts a soft, slightly monotonous reading style that is perfect for the book and for its two sequels, and he really gets into it during the more spirited dialogues! Some of McCarthy's true literary fans will probably want to shoot me through the head for suggesting the audiobook, but I figure it's better to hear the story read to you than to never discover the story at all."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A classic American novel. Cormac McCarthy weaves an incredible tale about these young Texans and their fateful trek to Mexico. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy and you should not wait to begin it. It was fantastic and unforgetable."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"As the literary child of Herman Melville, Cormac McCarthy sends his characters off for their own taste of &quot;truth&quot; in their beautiful, violent, and life-affirming quests in the great Southwest--the last bastion of the archetypal American West. The three novels that comprise The Border Trilogy come as close to anything since *Moby-Dick* or *Huck Finn* to being the Great American Novel. Each in its own way presents a chapter on the American's search--even need--for meaning in life. Although not all characters truly come to that understanding--John Grady Cole, in his unstoppable desire to save anything small, frail, innocent, or weak cannot in the end save himself from the dangers of his search. Billy P. nevers really comes to the realization of his truth, but it is through him that we as readers (best exemplified as the woman in the closing sentences) come to an understanding of McCarthy's view of truth. Although *Cities of the Plain* is not the exciting and ambitious novel that *All the Pretty Horses* is nor is it the touching and relevant story that *The Crossing* is, it is a beautifully satisfying culmination to the search. It, by itself, may not be a particularly solid and worthwhile novel in the American canon, but taken with its two brothers, the trio stands head and shoulders above anything else written in the last fifty years. McCarthy deftly manipulates his readers with his lyrical prose, juxtaposition of bloody death and life-affirming action, doubt and certainty, love and loss. A thoughful reader is easily taken to the red sands of the desert by McCarthy's spell-binding imagery; the symbolism is at once obvious and hidden. The novel(s) are well worth the time and energy. They are getting very close to the epitome of what America has come to expect from its great writers."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I have always believed that the genius of Cormac McCarthy lies in his ability to transform the ugliest of people and situations into objects of art by his hauntingly beautiful narrative. The Cities of the Plains is no exception. While not as adventurous as the first two novels of the trilogy, this story draws you in from the opening paragraph and never lets you go. I caught myself stopping several times just to catch my breath and marvel at the sheer brilliance of the prose. The maestro's story of the padrino was particularly poignant and moving. McCarthy continues to be the leading voice of serious literature in this country."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The story was first rate, and I found myself very involved with the characters. But, CM's lack of quotation marks and use of run-on sentences drove me to distraction! A story that should have been a beautiful and lyrical read was continually interrupted because I had to go back to the beginning of a dialogue to figure out who said what. Ditto for the run-on sentences - he would start a sentence talking about one thing, and end it on a completely different subject. If I had the book with me right now, I would cite examples. I will only recommend this book to very patient readers, and I will tell them to persevere... because, buried in that grammatical mess is a wonderful story. Everbody else should wait for the movie. If Hollywood stays true to the story, it will be a winner!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This novel broke my heart. It gave me much greater insight into my dad, who is dead now. I had a hard time coming to terms with my dad when he was alive. This story illuminated lots of male-ness that is often inaccessible to me. The book overstated some things (I hope!). But it essentially rings true. Readers who liked this, but want more accessible writing should read &quot;Red Sky at Morning&quot; by Bradford which covers some of the same ground geographically, emotionally, and philosophically. This growing up is a hard way to go. And at the end, maybe leaves you betrayed and alone. I'm more generous &amp; gentle with the destitute now."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Last night I easily decided to skip work and stayed home to finish journeying what I think is the ultimate American masterpiece. I read plenty of American literature (Faulkner, O'Connor, Hawthorne, Poe, Twain, Stowe, etc) and nothing tops Cormac McCarthy. After finishing the journey with John Grady Cole, I broke down crying for hours and I never experienced feeling that way in my 30 years of reading. The power and beauty of Cormac's writing will haunt you forever. He paints millions of images in painfully beautiful words that will stay with you as long as you live! Trust me.."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"When making a book into a movie, many changes have to be made. There are three vital scenes in Cormac McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses which must be included in the movie to achieve the same effect. The scenes which the movie could not exist without involve courage, emotion, and comedy: three things that make movies great.The most important scene involving courage is John Grady Cole jamming the red-hot gun barrel into his wound. The movie could not succeed without this inspiring episode. In this scene, John Grady builds a scalding hot fire and puts his gun right in the hottest part of the fire, the coals. Only after the barrel of the gun glows red-hot does he drive it into the bullet wound in his leg. He then displays even more courage by ramming it into the exit wound on the other side of his leg. All the guys will love this gory scene.The most meaningful emotional scene is where Alejandra tells John Grady that she cannot go with him and disassociate with her family. John Grady tells her how much he loves her and asks her to come with him, but Alejandra will not aquiesce. Alejandra possesses strong bonds with her family, and she can never go against their will, no mat5ter what happens. As these two lovers part forever, never to see each other again, the strong emotions surpass any other emotions in the book. This final love scene must be included in the movie version if any females are to watch the movie.Finally, the funniest part of the book ocurs when the three travelers, John Grady, Rawlins, and Blevins, drink too much. Blevins is so drunk that he falls off his horse. When asked if he can ride, Blevins replies, &quot;Does a bear **** in the woods? **** yes I can ride! I was ridin' when I fell off!&quot;These three scenes I have mentioned are constitutive to make a movie about All the Pretty Horses. These vivid, emotional scenes draw crowds of men and women, young and old. A movie about this book cannot be made unless it includes the rudiments of courage, emotion, and comedy."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This book is a very well-written book. There is lots of imagry and symbolism. The book was fairly easy to read unless you can't understand spanish. There was a Spanish conversation about every ten pages. Also, the author never uses quotation marks, which makes it difficult to figure out who's talking. Another thing, he uses too many pronouns, which makes it unclear who is talking or who is being talked about. If you read it a second time, You would pick up 98% of the stuff you missed the first time.A very good book on the whole.It teaches lessons about growing up. This is a &quot;coming-of-age novel&quot; and very good for teenagers or anyone else to read."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A film based on this book is in the works. The Miramax-Columbia film has an all-star cast: Mike Nichols (producer), Billy Bob Thornton(director),Ted Tally (screenplay), and Matt Damon (lead role).I will be very interested to find out how the work will be transferred to the silver screen. I hope the film-makers will have the good sense to:- keep the buddies as presented in the book: Grady and sidekick Lacey Rawlins has a touching relationship and their dialogs are funny as is in the book;- change the ending: it is far too philosophical, gritty, and bleak for today's film market.The writing style takes a little getting-used-to, but I too find the book hard to put down once I got going. I did find some of the starkly gritty passages hard to stomach, but this is a book that leaves you thinking.Can't say I particularly like the theme though, which seems to me to be this: Pretty things (women, horses) are dangerous and their possession will only lead you to trouble."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This book was an exciting epic taken place in the 1950s. Sixteen year old, John Grady Cole has more than raising cattle in his plans. After his Grandfather's funeral, he and two other, somewhat comic, companions, Lacey Rawlins and Jimmy Blevins, make their way to Mexico to escape the hassles of their American culture. Soon they find themselves working on a ranch, where Cole shows his deep love and talent for training horses. Alejandra, the ranch owner's daughter, and Cole soon fall in love with each other, but their love is tested by the disapproval of Alejandra's family. This heroic, heart-throbbing novel is a tale that provides the search for romance and the challenge to pursue a cowboy's dreams. Although the lack of quotations was a change, the novel's comic relief and Texan accents gave it a unique style. The way John Grady defies the ways of society and continues to believe in the power of love shows a complete heroic character. I would recommend this book to any American romantics who enjoy a heroic story about a boy growing up in a Western atmosphere searching for adventure."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.

Cormac McCarthy does an excellent job of telling this comming of age story of a young boy who has lost everything of meaning to him and a mother who has lost interest. The pain that he has to go throung not just physically but mentally, that shapes him from a young boy into a man.

It isn't just your normal epic love story, they put horses in there, and they also pu adventure and suspence in it. I would recomend it to anyone who enoys reading about love, cowboys, or horses. I can honestly say that there was no point in the book when i ever wanted to put it down. I wanted to read it all day if i could. I woudl read it before i went bed until i was falling asleep, then i woudl read it in all of my classes anytime that i had a chance. It pulls you right in, you feel like you are in the story with them, you are going through the same things, and you always want to know what happens next.

The boy John Grady Cole was mourning over the death of his Grandfather and since the grandfather only had one child, a daughter, the family name would be gone forever. The ranch that his grandfather owned was now in possession of the boys' mother, which was an idea she wanted nothing to do with it. With this news John decides that he needs to get away. This decision composed of him meeting with his friend Rawlin to embark on a journey that they would remember for the rest of their lives, a journey that involved traveling on their own to Mexico. While riding they meet a young boy who is about the age of 13 and asks the men if he could join them on their journey to Mexico. They respond by saying, \\"You aren't riding with us\\", \\"You will get us thrown in jail with that stolen horse of yours.\\" Even with these situations the men still allow him to travel with them but under a close watch.Through this journey all the people in this close knit community are exposed to many situations and feeling such as love death and especially welcoming something that many experiences for the first time. This book expresses with great emphasis the changes that the characters went through in a way that different people can relate to.I would recommend this book to anyone who like's reading books when you don't know what is going to happen next. There are many different parts of the story that don't make sense in the beginning but all come together by the end of the story.

The setting could not be more real if you walked or rode a horse through it. McCarthy is a master of subtle nuance in his characters. West Texas and Mexico are hard, unforgiving places and he fully portrays that in his descriptions of the land, not to mention the people. Take a journey with McCarthy in any of his work and you will visit the very heart of life, raw, gritty and dangerous. I dare you to search out and visit the places he writes about, they do exist!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty HorsesIn McCarthy's novel, he uses well written description in areas to explain the people around the main character and death or dying. \\"He looked at the face so caved and drawn among the folds of funeral cloth, the yellowed moustache, thee eyelids paper thin. That was not sleeping. That was not sleeping.\\" The books point of view for this novel is in second person. The main character of the story is John Grady Cole. John Grady is a dynamic person because he changes from a quiet kind of guy to a murderer and then falls in love that changes his personality.The major conflict of the book is that John is running away, along with his friend, Rawlins, from Georgia to seek a better life in Mexico, so they thought.

McCarthy wrote this book with ferocious energy and puts other writers having their noses looking down on the ground. It gives people other thoughts of Mexicans and Mexico's culture and lifestyles. However, some areas of the book drag and are dull, but overall it is a well written book."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The era of the cowboy is gone, though some refuse to accept it. This novel is about two young boys who are desperately trying to hold on to the cowboy way of life, whose search for independence and the freedom to work with horses leads them to Mexico. But this is more than a simple book about horses--in Mexico the boys encounter a corrupt system of law and a firmly-rooted social hierarchy with which they must do battle.John Grady, the hero of the novel, falls in love with a rich man's daughter, but is unable to formally court her because he is poor and American. One of the focal points of this book is the social structure of Mexico, the rigid differences of class and the separation of the hierarchy (most of whom claim to be of pure Spanish blood) from the lower classes. More than just a love story, this book deals with the difficult aristocratic-like social structure which could not even be fully done away with in the Revolution of 1910-1917 (of which the book makes mention as well).This book is very valuable for its historical content, as well as for its compelling narrative, its very believable and truly remarkable characters, and for its excellent story. The one major complaint I have is that McCarthy's syntax and grammar are very poor. Don't expect any punctuation marks, and be ready for both fragment and run-on sentences, the former of which sometimes is only a few words without a verb or subject, the latter which sometimes goes on mercilessly for half a page without any commas or punctuation of any kind. I know this is a new stylistic preference which many authors use, but it is very annoying. A vivid description loses most of its savor when it composes only one sentence and the word \`and' appears fifteen or so times.Despite the horrid style of writing (which some, admittedly, may find appealing), this is a wonderful book, well worth the time to read for both its narrative and its historical value."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This was my introduction to Cormac McCarthy and I must say that I was very, very impressed. This is the story of two young cowboys (circa the early 1950s) who head off on horseback into Mexico from there homes in southern Texas. It is, however, no joy ride. The rich, vibrant tapestry of the landscapes painted by McCarthy form the backdrop to the tale as the two make there way south with no real goal other than to experience what comes there way. My only quibble with the novel is the especially young ages of the two... 16 and 17. Their ability to handle extraordinarily difficult situations with a maturity far exceeding their age is a bit of a stretch. Outside of that, highly recommended."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I finally read this book after having it in my possession from about 92? Whenever it was released. I could not put the book down from day one; the sometimes comical adventures of the two boys, and their progress toward Mexico is entertaining. However lacking Spanish translations I was unable to understand most of the Spanish dialogues! The boys do seem quite mature for their age, though, but all in all it is an excellent read, especially if one is inclined toward Western reads or loves horses as I most certainly do."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I would consider this a masterpiece but for one thing- large amounts of the dialog is in Spanish. I damn myself for quiting on Spanish after the Ninth grade but that self-criticism doesn't help me now. This would make a great movie but for the fact that there are few talented, serious directors left in film."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy's lyrical novel has its origins in the nursery rhyme &quot;All the Pretty Little Horses&quot;, emphasizing the rhyme's two-part structure of soothing, comforting images, and the bleak, harsh reality of the natural world. It also may have its roots in the poetry of Edwin Muir, particularly the images of &quot;Horses&quot;: &quot;so wild and strange, / Like magic power ...&quot;, &quot;Their hooves like pistons in an ancient mill&quot;, etc. The apocalyptic sequel, by Muir, &quot;The Horses&quot; offers correspondences with the malevolence of the earth, and yet the centrality of horses to human endeavours. Besides these literary allusions and those to Faulkner's prose structures, McCarthy has written a beautifully pained evocation of man's adjustment from innocence to experience."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"His prose and his ability to make you taste the Mexico-Texas landscape are what make him truly an extraordinary contributor to all of American literature. The way he can evoke characters, setting and theme will rock you, and remain with you for a long time.

I would say the central idea of the story is the inability to belong in a particular place or time. McCarthy's ability to choose just the right words and sparingly but perfectly describe a place or feeling is only matched by the greatest American writers of the early part of this century. The style is distinctive and not difficult to follow after a few pages. I will eagerly await the last book of this trilogy."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This book is wonderful.A great story line filled with passion and adventure.

The translation can be found on the web site of the Cormac McCarthy Society at http://www.cormacmccarthy.com/"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy's beautiful All the Pretty Horses places a Texas boy, John Cole, in the Mexican desert, and lays bare the soul of Americans in their search for love and life's meaning. No other recent book describes the restlessness of a nation, entwined in the story of a strong 16 year-old, with quite the power of All the Pretty Horses. At times heartbreaking and always fulfilling, John Cole's journey with his friend, his love affair with a Mexican aristocrat's beautiful daughter, and the landscape that scars Texas and Mexico are flawlessly described by Mr. McCarthy. Only one other book has moved me quite as much as this one, Gunter Grass' The Tin Drum."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"While the charm of another western tale is enough to call this book enjoyable, the author's distinct style of writing makes a palpable impression. With a brevity and clarity somewhat like Hemingway's, McCarthy spins out this tale of a pair of boys in Mexico. His spare writing empthasizes the leanness of the characters and creates a vivid vista that comes alive in the reader's mind and unites them with the experiences of the characters. Not to be read just as a western, but for it's humanity."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This refers to the unabridged audiobook: Like many one- and two-star print reviewers here or on goodreads, I never could get into reading McCarthy because of his minimalist punctuation and his polysyndetic syntax, producing seemingly never-ending sentences. I don't know whether McCarthy intended for it to seem biblical, but I couldn't stand reading it. On the other hand, Frank Muller's fabulous narration is a pleasure to the ear. His rendition of dialect and Spanish is amazing, giving each character a distinct voice. To succeed, he must also be like an editor who parses the writing to give it the correct pace and voice, supplying all the missing commas and quotation marks.The writing is classic prose, sure and profound, and the story addresses the deepest emotions of love and death. I recognize the inherent nostalgia for a simpler time and place. There are some conceits that are a little hard to describe without spoiling the story, so I won't go into detail. One is Due&ntilde;a Alfonsa's self-assured, lengthy monologue about her life and the history of Mexico, which strikes me as out of place in context. Another is John Grady's conversation with the judge at his home, which seems out of character. His self-expressed motivation rings hollow--as the judge suggests, only Jesus himself could be that ethical.The story balances coming-of-age romanticism and social Darwinism, all rolled up into a coherent whole. To me, the conclusion is fitting and realistic, but I have not yet read the rest of the trilogy.The book is a fine piece of literature that could never be faithfully transformed into a movie. In 2000, Billy Bob Thornton directed Matt Damon and Pen&eacute;lope Cruz in the lead roles and, by most accounts, failed. If they did not succeed, I doubt even the Coen brothers could."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of my daughter who has a PhD in English Literature. I thought is was pretty good, in fact, good enough to order and read the second in the series, which was merely \\"OK.\\" That ended my interest.

You know it from the moment you start the book and meet him at his grandfather's funeral. You are positive of it when near the mid point of the book he is finally able to talk to the daughter of his Mexican employer whom he has been worshipping from afar. They are riding their respective horses and she wants to swap. As he slides to the ground to comply with her wishes, he notes that \\"You are fixin to get me in trouble.\\" Her reply holds true for the rest of the book, \\"You are in trouble.\\"The story winds itself about Cole's troubles and adventures, dreams and disappointments and does so in a manner that draws the reader along to the point where you feel like a rider on one of the \\"pretty horses.\\"McCarthy's style of punctuation, i.e. lack of, and his frequent lapse into the Mexican language can be annoying, but there is nothing wrong with his story telling. It is the first book in what he calls The Border Trilogy and as such is a promising start with many trails to ride before it closes."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"&quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; is without a doubt one of the most impressive novels I've ever read. To me, more than anything else it's the coming of age of one John Grady Cole. A few years after WWII Cole decides to ride down from his Texas home to Mexico along with his friend Lacey Rawlins. Cole is a cowboy at heart, but circumstances have deprived him of his intended livelihood. His grandfather, the owner of a large ranch, has just died, but his mother (his grandfather's heir) does not want a thing to do with the ranch, and she arranges to sell it - lock stock and barrel. And since Cole is underage there's not a thing he can do about it. So...What follows is Cole's and Rawlins' odyssey in Mexico, and what an odyssey it is. They find work at a ranch, where Cole falls in love with the beautiful Alejandra. But because of events that occurred on the way to the ranch, their love is doomed and Cole and Rawlins learn some very hard lessons.McCarthy's writing style is rather unique; you need to get used to it. But once you do the story flows very naturally and you develop a feel for all the characters in the story - except for Jimmy Blevins, who I never quite got a handle on. He was much more believable in the movie than in the book; I suppose because I had an actual person to look at instead of someone to just picture in my mind.The only real complaint I have with this novel is that McCarthy seems to assume that the reader has a working knowledge of Spanish. I don't, and I'm only assuming that I interpreted certain Spanish conversations correctly. I would have benefitted from some kind of translation - whether in an index, in footnotes, or in some other form."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy creates an engrossing tale of two boys on a journey towards adulthood and a search for simpler times through his flowing style, dialogue, and imagery. John Grady Cole and his friend,Rawlins, explore the answers to the difficult questions such as religion and faith, love and death, good and evil. Cole finds love and romance with Alejandra which McCarthy skillfully portrays through Cole's eyes. Alejandra was &quot;so pale in the lake she seemed to be burning. Like foxfire in a darkened wood. That burned cold.&quot;(141). The use of the fire metaphor to illuminate Alexandra's personality showed her fire and passion, but also how she lighted Cole's world. It also reveals one of the novels motifs, red or fire. The passage glimpses into Cole's mind like Hemmingway's stream of consciousness glimpses into the minds of his characters. The exploration of evil by Cole and Rawlins also characterizes the novel. Cole also contemplates fate. Does it really determine his life? He explores fate with the help of a conversation with Alejandra's aunt. She claims that &quot;the world has always been more of a puppet show. But when one looks behind the curtain and traces the strings upward he finds they terminate in the hands of yet other puppets&quot;(231). The metaphor creates an image of interminable puppets and no sign of a puppet master. McCarthy own views are reflected in those of Alejandra's aunt. Fate is often referred to as an indeterminable thing in the novel that the fated have no control over. A Mexican prisoner in conversation with Cole defines the meaning of evil from a Mexican perspective. Evil &quot;is a true thing in Mexico. It goes about on its own legs. Maybe someday it will come to visit you. Maybe it already has&quot;(195). The ominous prediction made by the prisoner comes true for Cole as he learns the many faces of evil through his own experiences. McCarthy uses the prisoner and other minor characters to teach Cole about the world. McCarthy's style of dialogue deviod of punctuation also helps the novel to flow traveling through his narration and his words spoken through the mouths of the characters. Cole struggles with evil throughout his journey trying to understand and come to terms with it. The questions the boys struggle with help them to grow and change them forever. Cole's travel to find himself embodies the greatest theme of American literature, the journey, which McCarthy skillfully weaves with his beautiful style into a poignant masterpiece."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I LOVED this book. McCarthy's use of language is powerful and really swept me away. There were sentences that I read over and over again -- they were so beautful. I have yet to read the other two novels in The Border Trilogy (they are waiting on my shelf), but if they continue the experience I had with All The Pretty Horses, I will be thrilled."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses is a book about a boy named John Grady who sets off for Mexico with his friend. Along the way they endure many hardships that change their perspective on life. When John Grady falls in love he learns how oppressive social classes can be. McCarthy's use of imagery provokes such beautiful images in the readers mind. His style conveys the heartache and struggle for survival that surges through John Grady at times. We highly recommend that you read this book!! We had to read it for an English class and everyone loved it!!!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I'll keep it short. This is the best novel I have read in a long, long time. McCarthy's prose has been praised to high heaven before, let me just say it deserves every superlative anyone's ever granted it. But my love for this book stems from my awe at the hero, John Grady Cole, who is probably the best person, in every sense, I've come across in literature. As one of the characters does, I can only sit and gape at John Grady, not quite understanding who he is or how he does as he does, but knowing he's a better man than I could ever have expected."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"It is 1949, every family owns at least one car and society is used to many modern conveniences such as dishwashers and vacuum's. For a third generation rancher, these so called conveniences foreshadow the end of an era when a simpler lifestyle had value. After loosing his grandfather and his land, John Grady, the main character, flees from an industrial America. He tries to travel back in time by escaping to a primitive Mexico. This novel is commonly viewed as a coming of age story in which John Grady Cole matures into a man. However, the main purpose of this book, is to inform the reader of mans struggle to cope with his losses. Cole faces many losses throughout the novel. John Grady is forced to cope with the loss of his grandfather, his innocence, his first love, and his pride. These losses all foreshadow John Grady's ultimate loss of hope and contentment. The other two major characters of the novel offset Cole because of their ridiculous and often amusing actions. The novel is divided into three parts: John Grady's life in his home town in west Texas, John Grady's life in Mexico, and John Grady's life after he returns to Texas. McCarthy does a great job of revealing Coles feelings of alienation in the first part of the novel. During the bulk of the novel (while John Grady is in Mexico), McCarthy superbly identifies the fallacies of all of Coles fantasies. He accomplishes this task by harshly eliminating each one of Grady's hopes anddesires. This book is very well written and often depicts the characters emotions through the landscape. It's overall plot is not difficult however, the reader may experience difficulty discerning some dialogue because McCarthy does not use quotation marks. Initially, the reader may also struggle with extremely long sentences. While reading this book I quickly grew attached to the characters and I was eager to learn more about their daily adventures. However, the first fifty pages are rather uneventful. The reader should prevail because the plot gains momentum and the ending is rewarding. I would recommend this novel to anyone who has ever experienced loss because they will identify with the thoughts and feelings of the characters of this novel."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy's &quot;All The Pretty Horses&quot; actually turned out to be a fairly good work. I was recently assigned to read it and (hush hush now) got to the point where I couldn't put the book down, only causing me to finish about a week ahead of the rest of the class. I do frown upon his style just a bit. I had trouble understanding it at times, and often got lost and had to flip back to get the gist of what was happening. But, I will admit it is a very unique style, whether I was confused by it or not. It's his style that serves as one of the man's major trademarks if you ask me. A very good book. If you find yourself with nothing to do one day, this is one of those books you probably want to pick up."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I happened to have read this McCarthy novel within days of exploring the southwest Texas-Mexican border region, down to Langtry. The trip offered a certain familiarity with the journey portrayed in two cowboy's trek into Mexico. The artistic prose, longer than necessary adjectives of grass lands and hills slows the reading down, but captures the essence of the era and locale. The reality of this fiction is quite close to home as the potential for tragedy always lies around the corner from impetuous decision making. In this case, two teenage cowboy partners made the decisions of the heart that brought tragedy and an ill fated love affair with a Mexican heiress. There are parts of the novel that are built on simplicity and humor, and even within tragic moments McCarthy uses simplistic conversation and somehow paints the image of the pain and hope in the hearts of the two cowboys. Friendship, sadness, loneliness, abandonment, hope and attraction are all woven into this well planned story line. An excellent choice if you are interested in a modern western that paints a story of life in the southwest area, without famous bank robbers and fancied pistol touting lawmen."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The story of John Grady did not hold my interest as I thought it would when I bought this &quot;award winning&quot; book. It moved very slowly most of the time and I found it difficult to stay tuned. A few scenes were riveting but most of the book was a chore for me to finish. Melvilles Moby Dick comes to mind, another book that had far to many long spaces between the part that were compelling"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This is a stunning book. McCarthy does not make a false step. Sustaining the tension- filled narrative of danger and forbidden love, he pulls out all the stops on lyrical writing. Laconic, with integrity, we are won over immediately with the protagonist. And, choosing horses compete with choosing women and ultimately, one's life."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A wonderful book. Cormac McCarthy's writing reminds me of Jim Harrison's books. Echoes of Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe as well with the exuberant stylized prose. The conversation between John Grady and his lover's grandmother is one of the most vivid conversations I have ever read. Another scene involving a red hot pistol and a bullet wound will live in my memory forever. If you love beautful writing you will enjoy this book. If you are a fan of Jim Harrison's books you will find this trilogy a delight."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses is a deceptive book. The three norteamericano boys in Mexico are so innocent, yet so knowledgeable for 16 and 17. The world is too much with them. With this worldliness comes a tactile bridge between heaven and hell. Rawlins predicts the hell to come, but there is a bliss in the knowing. The lost boy Blevins is a pathetic character out of a Fagan experience. He isn't even himself. He's not known to us at all, yet we know him all too well.As we move though the northern Mexican landscape the richly drawn characters become part of the land; they blend into the earth and are just as brown and dusty as the land itself. Even though the evil that is done, we never know them as evil. What we do is not evil, but can set off a chain of evil that renders us hopless and helpless. As Blevins removed his clothes to avoid the electrical storm, he was to die as if the hand of God's lightening reached from the billowing thunderheads themself.McCarthy has woven into this tapestry the politics of Mexico, the politics of friendship, the poltics of gender relationships, and politics of horses.As the book takes us back to Texas and the XEW radio preacher on the Rio Grande shores, we now know that we are blessed in a strange way; there is no magic to the blessing. If we wait for magic only coffins will arrive at our doorstep."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"English 122 (extra credit) Mieko T.Young American cowboys, John Grady Cole and his bud Rawlins went to Mexico from Texas and sought their successful life on a Mexican ranch.

I just finished the The Road, and while I found McCarthy's stylizing and riffing annoying, the The Road redeemed itself, and the slog required, with a substantial payoff.Alas, such a payoff may indeed lurk within the pages of All the Pretty Horses. But I won't get there. I can deal, reluctantly, with the lack of quotation marks and McCarthy's bizarro patterns. Still, I need a little more nurturing from my authors than McCarthy is willing to give.The critics are correct. McCarthy can indeed write. \\"and holding his hat like some supplicant to the darkness over them all\\" and \\"[the train] came boring out of the east like some ribald satellite of the coming sun howling and bellowing in the distance\\" raises the hair on the back of my neck.Alas, if only he were to glue together the pearls of his prose with simple, direct transitions. Instead, he goes off on wild tangents such as (from page 5):\\"When the wind was in the north you could hear them, the horses and the breath of the horses and the horses' hooves that were shod in rawhide and the rattle of lances and the constant drag of the travois poles in the sand like the passing of some enormous serpent and the young boys naked on the wild horses jaunty as circus riders and hazing wild horses before them and the dogs trotting with the their tongues aloll and footslaves following half naked and sorely burdened and above all the low chant of their traveling song which the riders sang as they road, nation and ghost of nation passing in a soft chorale across that mineral waste to darkness bearing lost to all history and all remembrance like a grail the sum of their secular and transitory and violent lives.\\"I was out of breath reading this and I don't move my lips when I read. I wish you the best with All the Pretty Horses. You'll need it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Written in a laughably absurd, utterly contrived style, Cormac McCarthy's \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" raises a number of important questions, the first of which is: Was the publishing industry temporarily overrun by illiterates in 1992?Let's cut to the chase. You need only struggle as far as page 5 before you recognize why you're struggling. The sixth sentence on that page has 13 \\"ands\\" in it. Yes! The word \\"and\\" appears thirteen times in that single sentence! Is this a shallow/pretentious rebellion against grammatical decency or is the author just plain inept? It's preposterous (and painfully unreadable) either way.Just so you don't think I'm making this up, two sentences later, he drops this tortuous turd of a sentence on us: \\"He turned south along the old war trail and he rode out to the crest of a low rise and dismounted and dropped the reins and walked out and stood like a man come to the end of something.\\" Does Mr. McCarthy own stock in the word \\"and\\"? Does he stand to profit from its appearance in print? And what's with the simile, \\"like a man come to the end of something?\\" How does a man come to the end of something stand? Is he sort of looking around perplexed, wondering, \\"Hey, where did everything go?\\"My copy of this book bears a gold seal announcing that \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" won The National Book Award. Is that the Hemingway satire contest? Is Cormac McCarthy a Hemingway poseur? What's going on here?And, so, if you're particularly fond of the word \\"and\\" and you want to spend a lot of time reading sentences and sentences and sentences that have a lot of \\"ands\\" in them and it doesn't bother you and that's your idea of enjoyable reading and you think it's fun and you want more and it doesn't make you feel like a man come to the end of something, then this is your book! The And."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"When it comes to literary works like this, I align myself with Truman Capote who once said about Jack Kerouac, \\"That's not writing; that's just typing.\\"The flow of the words on the page, the images we are given, all of these things are well done. The flow of McCarthy's words are near hypnotic. It makes the story both good and bad.For example, I understand why McCarthy does what he does--the lack of punctuation and grammar and such--however, it often becomes confusing and misleading. His words flow like a river. Sometimes it slows; other times it's like being caught in a deluge. The problem with the latter is that the words take away from the plot. When this happens, it leads to the bad questions a reader should be asking themselves like, \\"what just happened\\" rather than the good questions such as, \\"what does this mean and how does it attempt to achieve Truth?\\"Now, if you want to talk about his riffs being remarkable, I dare you to compare McCarthy's longest sentences to any of Charles Dickens's--the first sentence of A Tale of Two Cities comes to mind. When juxtaposed, McCarthy's words seem like the ravings of a person who doesn't quite know what they are doing as opposed to a person who is a master of their art. It's like comparing Jackson Pollock to Rembrandt.It's not art because critics say it's art. It's art beacause there is skill and purpose and the sublime to a work that translates to everyone.Lastly, for a 3rd person close perspective, Cole is a very obscure character. McCormac's style does nothing for his character or for the plot. Rather, it seems to just serve its self and nothing more."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The great thing about this book is that it continues the stories of Billy Parham from THE CROSSING and John Grady Cole from ALL THE PRETTY HORSES, and puts them together at a later date.

The book stands on its own without them, but there's a lot of background that is occasionally referenced which makes the book even more enjoyable."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"The best fiction I've read this year.

Though to be sure, this is no comedic novel. It's a Western, and adventure with horses, guns and coming of age for the protagonist, John Grady Cole, the last of a long line of Texas ranchers. And that's the core of the book, the sense that America is shrinking, that there is no room left for cowboys or adventurers. There's a great line in the book that John's buddy Rawlins says to him as they set off to Mexico on their adventure. \\"I could understand if you was from Alabama you'd have ever reason in the world to run off to Texas. But if you're already in Texas. I don't know.\\""},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthy takes the reader on a journey to the depths of change within mankind, witnessed through the thoughts and actions of John Grady Cole.A boy of sixteen, John realizes his purpose in life and sets off with his \\"pardner\\" on horseback to a country that neither of them know anything about. The pace picks up when John and Rawlins take the newest member of their party, Jimmy Blevins, a boy even younger than they are. Blevins provides comical relief, but ends up being more trouble than he's worth when he gets them mixed up with the Mexican law enforcement. Recognizing the trouble that he's now in, John experiences a \\"coming of age,\\" a change from boy to man. He must look out for himself, provide for himself, and even fight for himself in his battle for survival in the harsh environment of northern Mexico.Cole's journey takes place in the untamed desert in southern Texas and northern Mexico. Sometimes following a trail, sometimes creating their own, Cole and Rawlins ride horseback through the desert, stopping to marvel at the small haciendas and the hospitality of the Mexican people. Their journey seems to end, at least for a time, at the ranch where they're offered work. John Grady Cole is a disillusioned young man who, unlike most people, knows the life that he's supposed to lead, and watches it slowly slip away. Not content just watching, he follows it to a simpler place. His buddy, Lacey Rawlins, won't let him go on his journey alone however, and helps to keep John Grady on his path. The bond that these two boys share is only enhanced by the presence of their horses, which they rely on and care for throughout the entire story. Enter Jimmy Blevins, a boy who gives them a few laughs and yet is a deadly marksman. Blevins has not yet come of age when he's brutally killed by Mexican law enforcement.The twists of the plot come with the addition of Blevins to the party. When his horse, gun, and clothes are lost after a thunderstorm, he's more than determined to get them back. Riding into the nearest town, raising hell and reeking havoc, he \\"steals\\" his horse back and the three of them are off, now fugitives of the law. Blevins splits from the two older boys, and Cole and Rawlins chance upon a ranch. At their inquiry, the hacendado gave them work around the ranch, mostly breaking and training horses. The tempo escalates when the police come and take Rawlins and Cole away, falsely accusing Rawlins and Cole of being accomplices to murder and the theft of a horse. They're thrown in jail where they rejoin Blevins, before he's taken out back and shot. The ending, while not surprising, still holds a few more hidden cards as the two boys are dealt justice the Mexican way.This book is easy to relate to because there is a part of John Grady Cole in all of us, even though most of us aren't so sure of our positions in life. I'd highly recommend this story as a way to peer into the journey so many of us are forced to take. This is a softened version of the story, one that we can stare at without worrying about being blinded. There are harsh realities faced and uncovered, but with the innocence of a sixteen-year-old boy concealing them."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"If you're not into reading other languages and you can't speak Spanish then All the Pretty Horses is not for you. In the novel the author does not use the same writing techniques that we use in English. Instead he is more cultured and uses a Spanish style of writing. The book is about a young man named John Grady Cole. He travels down to Mexico to this hacienda and falls in love with the owner's daughter. He now must suffer all things that love can bring. The story is one of romance and adventure. The character is sent to a Mexican prison for killing someone in self-defense. This is just one of the many adventures that he encounters. The author has written many novels with this sort of cultured writing style. Overall the book was intriguing and exciting. It took you on a cowboy ride to Mexico and back.

If you can get past his overly repetative and jumpy style then the story is pretty good except that he makes these 16 and 17 year olds way beyond their wisdom as he wrote with the mind of a daydreaming old man not in touch with teenagers.

As no one had reviewed it yet, I couldn't see what others thought about it. But apparently there are many fans of McCarthy's work as someone has even written a book about these books.I could get past McCarthy's lack of important syntax. It must be the rebel in him. I don't really care. I can certainly read and understand a sentence that has no quotation marks and a lack of proper capitalization. After all, that's the way we speak and we understand each other well enough. That's just what makes it such a small rebellion on McCarthy's part. Still, in a book I expect these things so the pretentions of McCarthy's writing bothered me.I could forgive these minor annoyances on EVERY page if the story was something better than simply boring. If it taught me something; if it made me think, laugh, feel, or examine my ideals; if I didn't resent McCarthy's small-minded rebellion against rules of grammar that are generally followed by every great and small writer in the literary universe and the utter snobbishness of him, I wouldn't have regretted spending the ten bucks for this ode to self-indulgent egotism.Like many others have written about other books, if I could have given this book less than one star I would have.Here's a list of things that are a better waste of time:1.2.3.4.

It had many hidden symbols that would effect us today such as raceisum."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"In the novel, All the Pretty Horses, Cormac McCarthy creates an unpolluted, untainted image of his main character's love interest, Alejandra, through the use of diction and stylistic elements. McCarthy states that Alejandra speaks &quot;english learned largely from schoolbooks...&quot; (123). This depicts Alejandra as well-articulated and well read. She obviously has not picked up any slang, and therefore it is inferred that she mainly associates with poised, sophisticated society. McCarthy describes that her &quot;hand was small and her waist so slight&quot; (123). Through the utilization of imagery here, McCArthy creates an almost child-like image of Alejandra, a petite figure that has yet to blossom into womanhood. In one scene in the novel, Alejandra sneaks out late at night with John Grady Cole, the main character. John Grady decides to bathe in the &quot;black and warm&quot; (140) lake. As Alejandra begins to join him, John Grady notes her &quot;clothing so pale, so pale, like a chrysalis emerging&quot; (141) from the water. Since white is the universal symbol of purity, the repetition of its connotation, pale, emphasizes her innocence. The simile employed here compares Alejandra to an infant moth. By comparing her to a newborn, she again seems childlike and naive. Also, by linking her to a moth, which is usually pallid, McCarthy reinforces symbolism of the color white and continues his unsullied image of her. In the same scene, John Grady thinks &quot;Do not speak to her. Do not call&quot; (141). By means of stream of consciousness, McCarthy makes it clear that John Grady is painfully aware that if he calls his love into the dark water, he will take away sowme of her wholesomeness. By using another powerful simile, McCarthy demonstrates that Alejandra burns &quot;like foxfire in a darkened wood&quot; (141). By relating her to an illuminating, organic substance, McCarthy fortifies her pure white aura. Later, through personification, McCarthy describes Alejandra's hair &quot;falling and floating&quot; (141) on the water. This exemplifiew her celestial, angelic persona."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy is, simply put, one of the best living authors around. The conviction that he uses for each page of his novels is astounding. In All The Pretty Horses, he gets into the mind of a young boy trying to make his own as a cowboy. The complete realism used in the descriptions of the Mexican setting, and the poetic nature of the prose make this an absolute must read for all fans of westerns, coming of age stories, and good literature."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"\\"All The Pretty Horses\\" is essentially a Western tale set for the most part in Mexico during the middle of the twentieth century. It is the first novel in the \\"Border Trilogy\\" that also includes \\"The Crossing\\" and \\"Cities of the Plain\\". The story follows three teenage cowboys from Texas who move there in pursuit of work on a ranch. They find themselves in a series of sticky situations, which lead to a murder of one of them almost cost the other two their lives. The life in Mexico turns out to be much more brutal than they had anticipated. Nonetheless, they go through all of their travails with a remarkable dose of stoicism and self-possessed composure. This hard-nosed attitude is probably one of the weaker aspects of this novel. It is not plausible for sixteen-year-old boys, even those who grew up as cowboys on a ranch in Texas. It also makes the narrative very dry and almost inhuman. It is hard to relate to individuals who show this little emotion even under the most horrendous circumstances.Cormac McCarthy is as varied in terms of the genres that he works with as he is with the styles that he employs. Most of his writing uses very stark and stream-of-conscience style of writing, with not much in the way of distinguishing the spoken words of one character from another. When there are only a couple of main characters around (like in \\"The Road\\") then this can be a very powerful and gripping narrative style. However, for the more dynamic stories that involve many different characters that change from one scene to another - as is the case in \\"All The Pretty Horses\\" - this can lead to a lot of confusion and makes his storylines very hard to follow. McCarthy is indubitably a literary genius, but many of his works (including this one) are not easily appreciated except by those who are willing to invest a lot of effort into reading them."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Title: All the Pretty Horses by Cormac McCarthyPages: 302Time spent on the \\"to read\\" shelf: 6 months.Days spent reading it: 3 days.Why I read it: After finishing No Country for Old Men, I wanted some more of McCarthy'svoice in my head.Brief review: Having read two phenomenal novels by Cormac McCarthy I was dying for a little more. I wanted more of his sparse dialogues, driving plot, and beautiful prose. So I started reading All the Pretty Horses. I was a little disappointed. Yes, the words came from McCarthy, but they were not as magical as other books I had read by him. In All the Pretty Horses John Grady Cole sets out on his horse from the ranch his mother is selling and travels to Mexico. He is the perfect wandering cowboy. He travels with his friend Rawlins, as they meander further and further south into Mexico.McCarthy gives a wonderful tale of Cole as he travels and works and falls in love. As with many of the other books I have read by McCarthy, trouble soon finds Cole and violence ensues. I love how McCarthy paints a life of hardship and injustice in the here and now, but that ultimately there is hope. I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would, but I actually love how All the Pretty Horses draws on themes of desperation and injustice and our longing for things to be right. The reader is drawn into a world that is not fair and we demand that things be set right. I think McCarthy does a phenomenal job of walking a line between gritty reality and the falsely optimistic.I know this book was good, I just did not like it as much as other books that I have read by McCarthy. I would recommend reading some of his other work instead (The Road, No Country for Old Men), but I believe fans will not be disappointed in this book, it did win a number of awards and was a national bestseller after all.Favorite quote: \\"He thought the world's heart beat at some terrible cost and that the world's pain and its beauty moved in a relationship of diverging equity and that in this headlong deficit the blood of multitudes might ultimately be exacted for the vision of a single flower.\\"Stars: 3.5 out of 5Final Word: Harsh."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"If you're looking to be bored out of your mind with another school reading assignment, don't pick up this novel. Warning: it will only entertain you. Cormac McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses was one of the most engaging stories I have ever read, thanks to the enchanting and whimsical prose. Each moment it grabs you right out of your comfy couch seat and takes you south of the border, straight down to Mexico. All of the elements of a classic Western are evident: a steamy romance, endless days of horseback riding through the desert and prairie, danger and new adventure around every corner...but they are presented in a whole new form, one that entirely seizes your senses and doesn't release them until you are driven from your seat to eat something. McCarthy's first novel in the Border Trilogy easily paves the way, with its fascinating rhythm and charming characters, towards a new era of American literature.The story follows young John Grady on his journey from his Texas ranch to the wild lands of Mexico in the late 1940s, with several mysterious and fascinating characters joining him along the way. McCarthy doesn't succumb to standard rules of novel-writing as he tells this story. There are no quotation marks in the prose, but this only helps the dialogue to blend more seamlessly with the rest of the text. His flowing sentence structure is reminiscent of the Beat writer Jack Kerouac; it's not difficult to follow, but instead allows the reader to stay in-tune with the twisting plot with little unnecessary interruption by punctuation. The characters themselves are filled with a contagious energy and spark, and the friendship between young John Grady and Rawlins is heartwarming. Many of the relationships developed or described in the text are relatable, thus increasing the pleasure received from the read.That being said, this novel probably isn't for everyone. At times the plot can seem to drag on forever; the multiple traveling descriptions can be interpreted as dull and dry. The occasional use of Spanish dialogue might throw others off if they think they have missed an important piece of the plot, but I feel it adds to the overall atmosphere of the story and helps to reinforce the setting. Some might feel that the frequent lack of punctuation hints at poor craftsmanship or laziness, although this is an artistic element that sets this novel apart from so many others. In conclusion, All the Pretty Horses is a rambunctious read for the adventure-lover at heart."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I thought through most of the book that I was reading the bestbook of my life. I know both sides of the Texas-Mexican border,and McCarthy must have lived there to write so (although Hemingwayfooled Italian historians with 'A Farewell to Arms', he'd never beeneast of the Piava Valley, especially not in the Isonzo Valley or theSlovenian Alps). McCarthy paints a picture of people and landscapewith words, so much so that the picture seems real.The weakness of the book: after the aunt's monologue I thoughtI was reading Hemingway's words from the mouth of an older man,not those from a 16-17 year old. Well, even Kafka didn't know how toend a book, and John Berger wrote that you can't have the end in mind, it has toevolve from the prior story. Spanish is written often whereSpanish fits, so you'd better keep your Berlitz book handy. ArchaicEnglish words are used as expected, so you'll need a very good Englishdictionary as well."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Love how each character has a role in the general struggle between romanticism and reason. Great and wonderful must-read for even the most jaded critic of the Western."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Going in, I was skeptical that I would particularly like this novel and made the choice simply on my enjoyment with previous novels and the promise of the premise of The Crossing that I could read after this.Horses and cowboy life are the kind of thing that I never knew I could enjoy, especially not in the amount that it takes to read an entire novel about. This, however, is truly a man's tale. McCarthy's striking prose mixed with his distinct style made it a joy to read, especially in the two middle sections where the action really picks up.It does take a bit to get going, though. There was also a part in the final section where the story was a very complex description of action with little dialogue that lost me a little. On the whole, this is a great story that runs you through a wide range of emotions and manages to surprise you in that trademark McCarthy way."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Great writing, great story, wonderful use of Spanish and English. When finished reading....rent the movie. Excellent!"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy's ALL THE PRETTY HORSES combines the plot details of Graham Greene's THE END OF THE AFFAIR and THE POWER AND THE GLORY. The difference is that where Greene placed the conflict within the confines of Roman Catholic theology (or better stated the inherent tension with RC), McCarthy removes God altogether.The result is eerily simila. The renouncing of love to keep an oathand the enduring of suffering become central motifs.Thankfully, like Greene, McCarthy's style is first-rate. The pagesturn quickly and the plot holds together.The only disappointing note is that Hollywood ended up making three poor film versions of the above books."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Frank Muller does an excellent job narrating this novel by Cormac McCarthy. Moreover, listening to the Audio CD allows the listener to sidestep the McCarthy's liberties with the punctuation e.g. the absence of quotation marks. This isn't to demean McCarthy's prose; far from it, he presents a nostalgic picture of Texas and Mexico in the 1940's. Indeed, one of themes seems to be how this \`country' is disappearing and being replaced by a modern, industrial one. The hero of the novel, John Grady Cole, is depicted as near mythical; we are left with the impression that such a young, courageous man would not exist today-if he ever did it all. This parallels a theme from a recent novel of McCarthy's, No Country for Old Men. Actually, the two novels are related on many other points as well e.g. the symbolic coin toss and how it represents Fate. While the parallels between McCarthy's novels seem clear, a particular one within the novel does not: how Francisco's story relates to John Grady's. Leaving that aside, to see the author work through such wide ranging questions (Culture's decline, Fate v. Free Will) is a joy and one of many reasons to read his work."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"You read the first sentence of a Cormac McCarthy novel and you know that this is not Grisham or Connolly or Child or Crichton or King, certainly not Patterson, or anyone else writing fiction today. And before the first page is turned he has launched into one of his frenetic poetic riffs that lurches and rambles and stops and starts and doesn't care about punctuation and you can almost hear your high school English teacher scolding about grammar and run-on sentences but you know that she could never even hope to string words together like this even if she dared. And then you realize that maybe you've actually never really understood the English language at all because no one before has ever ripped it and bent it and twisted it as beautifully as McCarthy does while making it all look so easy.So were it not for McCarthy's ferocious prose, \\"All the Pretty Horses\\" may have been just another coming of age story. But in McCarthy's special corner of hell, along with the obligatory introduction to \\"young love\\", passage to adulthood may include exile in a foreign country, being hunted on horseback across a barren desert, variously stabbed, shot, tortured, or imprisoned. John Grady Cole is a sixteen year-old son of a Texas rancher who, up until his grandfather's death, worked the ranch and developed an uncommon kinship with horses. With his grandfather gone, his father dying, and his mother flitting around the cultural scene in post-WWII San Antonio, John Grady sets out on horseback for Mexico with buddy Lacey Rawlings. What follows is an odyssey of restless youth across a rugged country, a bleak and sometimes bloody journey that is not without the humor and easy banter of young teenagers on their own; the \\"road trip\\" that turns nightmarish and accelerates the process of growing up into hyper drive.John Grady is an endearing character; there are no Holden Caulfields in the Texas borderlands. A stoic young cowboy, he has had the youthful innocence to which he is entitled ripped out too early, replaced by a work-hardened cynicism and homespun wisdom of the Texas plains. The reader cares for John Grady in the way of the classic Greek heroes, watching helplessly as the protagonist stone-by-stone lays the foundation of his own downfall. This is Cormac McCarthy, and therefore not a fairy tale; the reader would be nave to expect an ending with a smiling John Grady riding into the sunset with his girl's arms around his denim shirt. But since it is Cormac McCarthy, you can expect unparalleled prose that delivers its message with the power and subtlety of a cattle prod. An American classic - required reading."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I didn't realize until I looked at the Amazon site that Frank Muller has narrated so many books. They have 84 Muller listings here, primarily for Stephen King, John Grisham and other best-selling authors. The only other Muller audio-book I was familiar with was his rendition of King's &lt;The Green Mile&gt;, which was excellent. Muller surpasses that here, however, as he renders McCarthy's prose faultlessly. He captures the accents, whether they be Texan or Mexican, faithfully and unaffectadly. This is a great acting-job, natural, unassuming, perfectly in-flow with the narrative. His shift from character to character is seemless. Muller is the latter-day role model for anyone wishing to narrate books. There is ample reason why he is so prolific.The story itself lends itself to being told orally. It is a myth of the west, but I mean that in the greatest sense of the word. Mythic here does not mean unrealistic. Far from it. It is mythic because it represents higher truths, but tells a human story in as truthful a manner as possible. I hate to use a hackneyed term like &quot;describing the human condition,&quot; but it does. There are other high-school terms I could use, such as &quot;coming-of-age story,&quot; &quot;piquaresque novel,&quot; &quot;story of initiation,&quot; etc. , but they would all short-change McCarthy's accomplishment here. McCarthy represents what is increasiningly scarce in modern American letters. He is a truly original novelist. Yes, we can trace his roots, but he has acquired his unique voice by dint of much effort, trial, delving, maybe even bloodshed. He is one of those authors that after reading one of his works, we are left to ask &quot;How did he come by that knowledge?&quot; He doesn't just research a work. He must have, at least in part, lived it. For instance, in this work, I was left wondering how he could have aquired such an encyclopedic knowledge of all things having to do with horses. I worked on the backstretch of racetracks for five years and didn't know my nomenclature with anything like the authority he does.It would appear that Muller, like McCarthy has thoroughly done his homework. Never once in the course of this unabridged audio does he stumble over a word, much less a passage. He speaks Spanish almost as fluently as English, which is important for this work. In fact I would suggest that if you do not comprehend Spanish readily, you refer to the text-form of the book and maybe a Spanish dictionary before listening to this tape, though you can still appreciate most of it.My estimation of McCarthy, which was already high, as well as my opinion of Muller, were greatly enhanced by the experience of listening to these tapes.(This review refers to the unabridged audio-tape version of &lt;All the Pretty Horses&gt;. I prefer printed versions of good books, but see nothing wrong with listening to books when we dont have our hands free. Cars, obviously. I know what you were thinking!)"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I found this book on an empty, dusty bookself at the back of my high school library, it's cover and first few pages torn away and the corners burned round. I thought that either someone was very bored and destructive or frustrated by the difficulty of the first few chapters (this only after flipping it open to find out it's title, the side being illedgable). After reading it I realize it could even more easily have come from the frustration of wanting more! This book kept me reading from cover to cover and still awake enough to wish it were double it's size. While reading it I had no clue as to it's popularity or award, but I knew it deserved one. John Grady Cole is an amazingly believable hero. I found myself trusting him and not the author to carry the book, knowing that he would come through no matter what. Even as the dialogue turned increasingly to spanish I felt that there wasn't a need to understand every word, I knew Grady enough to know what he would say. After getting a friend to translate a bit I found that this was true. I can only hope the movie is even half as good! I'm going to buy my school a copy to replace the destroyed version that I found."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Since the early 1900's, America has greatly progressed industrially and technologically, thus causing the early 1990's publication of the western novel, All the Pretty Horses, to seem out of place. This untimliness, however, is no indication to the quality of the book. Cormac McCarthy demonstrates all the characteristics of a traditional Western: adventure, love, damsels, murder, horses, and a hero, while still maintaining the elegant language and style of writing he has created. Set along the Texas-Mexican border in the late 1940's, All the Pretty Horses relates young John Grady Cole's discoveries about religion, love, and life as he runs away from home and becomes a man. The idealistic Cole embodies the desires of all young adults, freedom and understanding, and sets out to satisfy them. Through several experiences that an average teenager would not have encountered, he realizes that reality can be cruel but maintains his amazing determination to live his life without the burdens of society.McCarthy's magnificent wording and motifs demonstrate the many themes of hospitality, religion, freedom, and the quest for knowledge. The language appears to be deterring because of the author's choice to delete the majority of punctuation marks, however, if he had left the words in proper English format, the novel would have lost its realism and power. Unlike Charles Dickens, who is infamous for his lengthy, soporific descriptions, McCarthy utilizes his language to depict the Mexican landscape in a way that appeals to the reader. Not everything in the novel is pretty; as an adventure story, the book still enbodies the basic blood, guts, and gore; it simply describes them more completely than an average fiction novel. This quest for realism can become overused at times (i.e. entire dialogues written Spanish where occasionally a character may offer some form of explanation but usually leave the reader wondering). McCarthy's realism also extends to his multiple color motifs. Almost every pigment in the color wheel represents a quality in the novel, and because the author describes everything accurately, at least one of these recurring motifs appears on every other page. This does make analysis of the the novel fairly simple, but the overwhelming amount of color can become repetitive. McCarthy has mastered a wonderful command of language and exemplifies creativity well, but by stating the themes outright, he removes the opportunity for the reader to demonstrate his own ability to understand.All the Pretty Horses embodies all the requirements of an interesting, adventurous novel that anyone could appreciate for its exciting plot and insightful discoveries of human nature. Whether searching for a wonderful book to read purely for entertainment or attempting to discover a piece of literature that is relatively simple to analyze, one should seriously consider All the Pretty Horses as an appropriate choice."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Many people compare, fairly or no, Cormac McCarthy's &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; to William Faulkner's literary work. What is neglected is the strain of Flannery O'Connor that runs throughout the novel as well. At any rate, &quot;Horses&quot; more than stands on its own as a startling achievement. It's prose is more accessible than Faulkner, and its themes less esoteric than O'Connor. &quot;Horses&quot; is an immaculate novel, dealing with the extreme facets of the everyday and the ways in which people become who they are.John Grady Cole, a 16 year old boy, dispossessed of his family lands, wanders off into Mexico, accompanied by Lacey Rawlins, a close friend. Astride their trusted horses, Redbo and Junior, the two young men ride, searching for occupation and meaning. It may be somewhat idealistic that two ranch-hands like Cole and Rawlins should ride about, discussing throughout the novel things like the profundities of religion, life, and human relationships on so advanced a level, but McCarthy's grasp of vernacular - English and Spanish - makes the whole completely palatable.McCarthy's writing technique leaves nothing to be desired - his evocative use of landscape draws the Texas-Mexico scenery off the page and into immediate experience. Impressionistic and yet utterly tangible, the cold of the evenings and the heat of the days is described as it is felt. McCarthy's characterization is just as remarkable. Minor characters like the various groups of laborers met along the way, Perez the mysteriously powerful political exile/prisoner, or children bathing in a ditch - all bring realism and depth to Cole's struggle into selfhood.The most wonderful thing about &quot;Horses&quot; is that McCarthy doesn't beat you over the head with his major themes - they exist as constant undercurrents - humanity's relationship to tradition, the divine, to each other - these are the elements that course and pulse through the novel. Epic knife-fights in a Kafkaesque prison, emotional wounds that never heal, a covert love affair with Alejandra (the daughter of a powerful Mexican landowner), philosophical-historical conversations with her aunt Alfonsa, a problematic relationship with 'Jimmy Blevins,' a possessive young boy - all of these moments in the novel are saturated with fundamental thematic significance.This is not a book to simply read. This book must be lived with, carried, held, gazed upon and treasured. Give it full reign of your mind and let the unknowable horses of your imagination take you into yourself."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A lot has already been said about this novel, so I'll address my review to those unfamiliar with Mccarthy's work. If you've never read Mccarthy before, this is a great place to start. The plot is tight, engaging, and easy to follow, and the language is gorgeous. If you enjoy this book and want to move on to others, read the others in the border trilogy before tackling \\"Blood Meridian.\\"Some people will take issue with Mccarthy's grammar, sentence structure, use of Spanish, and punctuation (or lack thereof). Mccarthy takes a lot of poetic license with his writing, and chooses words as much for their sound as for their meaning. The sentences are written with attention paid to rhythm and \\"breath,\\" meaning that they don't always look or sound like conventional prose. This will be displeasing to some. As an example, the first line of the book reads: \\"The candleflame and the image of the candleflame caught in the pierglass twisted and righted when he entered the hall and again when he shut the door.\\" Now, Mccarthy could have just as easily said \\"the candle flickered when he entered the room,\\" or something like that, but the effect, aurally, is just not the same.Read the first page of the book. If you don't catch fire at the beauty of it, then maybe this book, and Mccarthy's work in general, is not for you."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy has been both praised and damned for his lyrical, poetic, non-grammatical, punctuation-less, rare-word-studded prose, and this style is very much in evidence here. From the opening sentence to the last page, this style is ever present, becoming almost remorseless in its tone and evocation of time and place. If you've never read one of his works before, it might take you awhile to adjust to it, but once you do, the images it paints in your head will become brilliant and indelible.The other renowned McCarthy trait, that of celebration of violence, brutality, of a harsh world where only the most determined survive, is present here also, but for this book it seems as if this fades a bit into the background, under the cover of a compelling coming-of-age story of a young sixteen year old horse-loving cowboy John Grady Cole who wanders off to Mexico in search of employment and finds his first love. Along the way we are treated to quite a bit of philosophical ruminations about religion and life's obstacles, problems, and purpose, frequently delivered in very short sentences of dialogue that are almost baldly stated, with little back-up ratiocination to justify their conclusions. It's not until nearly the end that we are treated to a multi-page discourse on these subjects, delivered by the girl's elderly aunt as almost an aside to the main story, but this section is really the heart of the book, and colors and limns all of Cole's actions and fate.Cole's character is well defined, for all that we never really get inside his head (another McCarthy trait), as his minimal statements and large actions create the picture of just who and what he is. Unlike many of McCarthy's characters, Cole has a strong moral compass quite capable of withstanding the vicissitudes and chance disasters that happen along the way, a compass that shapes Cole as a most atypical McCarthy actual hero. Cole's traveling companion Rawlins and his love Alejandra are not so well defined, are almost stereotypical characters there to support the story and little more, while Blevins, the chance pick-up fellow traveler to Mexico, seems to be the embodiment of McCarthy's opinion about what should (and will) happen to the weak and foolish.There is a fair amount of un-translated Spanish here. If you don't know the language, this may be a little off-putting, but I found most of the meaning of these passages to be derivable from context or Latin roots, but in few places I had to turn to my Spanish-speaking wife to find out what was being said. But missing some of this will not hurt your overall understanding of what's going on, as these sections rarely have great significance.This is a gritty, realistic story. There are scenes within this that point out in no uncertain terms just how mean, dirty, brutal, and despicable people can be. Nor is there any Pollyanna ending, merely a continuation of the drive to live, and what's done is the past, unchangeable. But reading this just might form an indelible image in your mind, one that will color all your future impressions of life.---Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"What can't this young feller do?

Ah, isn't it great to have a writer who honestly tells us how the West really was."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of an old friend and had difficulty putting it down. The descriptions of Mexico and horses were beautiful. The plot was engaging and the characters, John Grady Cole in particular, were like old friends by the end of the book. The story was an exciting and suspenseful page turner. From the standpont of pure enjoyment, I can't imagine anyone not liking this book. I liked it so much I went right out and bought The Crossing."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I was skimming through the 100+ reviews of this fantastic novel when I stumbled across one from a reader in San Diego who claimed that the book lacked romantic detail. I have to say that this is one my of my favorite aspects of the book. Had the author delved too far into the romance, he would have effectively ruined it. Yes, I wanted to know more, but in true modernist/minimalist style, every word was chosen with care and the dialog was electric. This is one of my favorite books of all time, but it is also my favorite love story. It is absolutely heart-wrenching and has some of the most beautiful (not gratuitous) expressions of love between two characters that I've ever read. Romance can easily ruin a great story by becoming the focal point of the novel. In many ways, this love story was the focal point for me, but only for the feeling it evoked. John Grady Cole was the center of this story and had this romance been over done, it would not have meshed with the rest of McCarthy's style. I honestly would not have wanted it any other way."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I took the time to read many of the reviews that were posted on this page before I decided to add my own. What shocks me most about it, is how many described the plot being boring or whimsical. I was apalled, nauseated, sickened,by this book. Yet the whole time I was captivated. I think it was a great story, and McCarthy's elements of intense description, which may have turned off some, only helped plunge me deeper into the surroundings of the time and place of this novel. The characters were very strong and I agonized through this novel,empathizing with their dashed hopes and dreams, their successes and failures. When Blevins met his face, I put the book away and declared that I had read enough,it was just too morbid for me. A couple hours later I picked up the book and finished it off. I admit I am a bit of an emotional reader, but I have never encountered a book with this force. I do plan to read the other 2 novels in the border trilogy with a better understanding of what to expect. I also will eagerly await the motion picture expected for Spring 2000, directed by Billy Bob Thornton, and starring Matt Damon (John Grady Cole)(would prefer a younger actor, like within 10 years of 16), with Henry Thomas as Rawlins (E.T. kid) and Lucas Black as the wild Blevins (Slingblade)"},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"This masculine view of the American cowboy in the southwest, circa 1935, All the Pretty Horses would probably be boring if penned by any other writer. McCarthy breathes life into this simple story through his masterful, though somewhat risky, writing.McCarthy's use of cattleman lingo and apparent distain for using quotes in his dialog take some time to get use to, but his artistry in breaking the high school rules of literature are invigorating. McCarthy has no qualms about sentences that take entire paragraphs, or pages, strung together with 'ands'. There is a unique rhythm to his writing as he blends brief sentences of prose with long. Intertwined with prose are some stunning glimpses of poetry.This is a story as the cowboy poets might tell it. The main characters are not the one-dimensional cattlemen often portrayed as macho men, though they are unashamedly masculine. The central character unselfconsciously accepts his tenderness, especially toward horses, and his insecurity with women and life at large.Taken as models for modern living the men in this book necessarily fall short. They are not literal role models but icons and symbols of true masculinity. This is man at his best: loyal, independent yet social, self-sacrificing, and willing to see the beauty within nature, horses and his fellow man.&quot;All The Pretty Horses&quot;, like so much of the 'great' literature of the twentieth century, is simple in its delivery yet vastly complex. It is the kind of book college professors could force students to agonize over as they dissemble the grammar and symbolism. It is also a book that anyone, especially horse lovers, can enjoy.Take the time, make the investment, and take the risk. You will be rewarded."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"When I was in graduate school, there was one writer on everyone's lips. Cormac McCarthy. &quot;Cormac McCarthy is the next William Faulkner.&quot; Not so. He still has a ways to go.McCarthy has oodles and oodles of talent. There is no denying that. And, why would someone want to? The book is original. The characters are great. The dialogue is fantastic - it really is extraordinary. What a wonderful concept:A book about Cowboys, in a time period that is both somewhat recent conventionally, but has all the trappings of the violent Old West. Kudos to McCarthy on that.My problem, is with the novel's self-absorption. A problem that I think has recently plagued James Ellroy, as well. The prose has style, but after a while, the prose also begins to grit.This is the first book I've read by McCarthy. I wanted to save his work for a time when I craved an outstanding novel. And, I want to read more of his work.Some readers will have a problem with McCarthy's style. I know people who have read 40 pages, and then tossed the book in disgust. I found his lack of punctuation somewhat liberating.So - this is a good book. But I don't associate McCarthy with Faulkner or Melville, or any of the great literary minds of the past.It is what it is..."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"\\"All the Pretty Horses\\" is one of the most beautifully told stories I've ever read. Not only is the writing here packed with imagery, but the textures of the words used to describe the images are as lush and as enfolding as anything F. Scott Fitzgerald ever wrote--even when McCarthy's describing the driest of desert plains, the most desolate of ruins, or the emptiest of lives.The book tells the story of two young friends who leave home in 1948 Texas to ride south into northern Mexico in search of something. What happens along the way is tragic and amusing, lovely and gripping, real and amazing. McCarthy seems to paint every scene perfectly, yet he does so using the fewest amount of words possible, and the simplest of details.\\"The gray and malignant dawn.\\" \\"Stars falling down the long black slope of the firmament.\\" \\"The shelving clouds.\\" \\"Their windtattered fire.\\" \\"Narrow spires of smoke standing vertically into the windless dawn so still the village seemed to hang by threads from the darkness.\\"I often judge great ideas and great writing by the amount of envy I feel when reading them--as in the feeling of, \\"Man, I'd wish I'd thought of that!\\" Using that system of judgement, this book is one of the best I've ever read: it crippled me with jealousy. Paralyzed me.Long sentences shroud the reader in the events of every scene, and the author's trademark quote-sign-less dialogue gives every conversation a very biblical feel.I read this book out loud to my wife, and was tickled at how often she'd want to drop everything just to hear what happened next. This is the second Cormac McCarthy book I've read after the very violent \\"Blood Meridian,\\" and where that book was night, this one was day. This even has a love story.If you read it though, be prepared for occasional bursts of writing so good it feels as if you've been punched in the stomach and can't speak or breathe...writing so good you'll fumble for a pen to underline words and sentences and paragraphs...writing so good you'll scan the room for anyone to read it to out loud...writing so good your own will seem forever inadequate...writing so good it will haunt you forever."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"As most of the reviewers have said, this is a terrific book. Cormac McCarthy has a unique writing style that is perfectly suited to the Western genre and he knows how to pace a story. It is a very well written book and well worth reading it for that reason alone.What really makes this book special to me though is the theme of the book. It is the early 1940s and the Wild West has been fenced in, cars have taken over from horses and even the sprawling ranches of Texas are converting to large oil fields. John Grady Cole is a young man who longs to be a rancher and make a living taming horses and herding cattle, but he is prevented from doing this by his mother and the changing nature of his home, so he rides to Mexico with a friend to find the life he always wanted. Along the way, they have many adventures and relationships that keep the book lively, but I love the image of a boy standing on the border of what he has always known (Texas) and what he thinks he wants (Mexico) and hurdling that line and going after his desires. It is a very romantic idea, but one that McCarthy really makes come to life in the book.I can not recommend this book highly enough and I think any lover of good writing, Westerns, coming of age tales, or just great fiction will agree that it is worth the short time it takes to read it."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy's tale of adventure and reckless abandon was written with such detail and clarity I felt like I was there in the Mexican desert with the characters. It is a moving tale with moral undertones that speaks volumes to the endurance of the human spirit. Although the beginning of the novel was rather slow and the dialog a bit hard to get used to, I was unable to put the book down after about three chapters."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"I am a young, female, high school teacher. I am always on the look-out for excellent novels to read with my junior/senior all-boys AP Composition class; I have found such a novel in All the Pretty Horses. This &quot;coming of age&quot; story contains all of the elements I need: adventure, sexual exploration, (appropriate) violence, friendship, father/son struggles, and mother/son struggles just to name a few. The prose is difficult and begins slowly, but with determination, this novel can carry ANYONE away. I hope that my students will enjoy this novel as much as I do. As for the people that gave this novel ONE star....you need to start reading literature. This is not an Oprah book....it takes a little more patience than you allowed and more than 45 minutes to decipher. Give it another shot....it is better the second time around, as are many great novels."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"Cormac McCarthy has written a story that compels attention. His deliberate mixing of styles sometimes annoys, sometimes tickles, and sometimes flatters the reader. Unless you've got decent Spanish skills, you'll want your diccionario more than a few times. And you'll need to be patient with McCarthy when he drawls his spells of insensitivity while the characters in the story are sleepy or otherwise insensate describing their actions in long run on sentences that would clearly benefit from missing punctuation that appears to have been removed deliberately by an author who wanted the reader to feel in his soul the vapidness that possessed the characters at the point in the story. Excesses of style that impede comprehension may earn an occasional smile, but they aren't lovable.The story stands on its own as a character study of a laconic superhero fashioned from no particular roots. The women in the stories plainly love him, and his close friend stays with him through harrowing adventures, and he is in turn loyal to those close to him. The story is amusing, but too much larger than life. One customer offered a useful observation that suggests \\"Cole ..John Cole\\" likes his martinis shaken, not stirred -- while still at the age of 16. Clearly this character is destined for sequels.All the Pretty Horses, while fun to read, is clearly a contrived story. It won't rank on a list of all time important fiction. But if you've got time - y su diccionario - on your hands, it's worth a look."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"McCarthy is always deliberate in his writing, ploddingly so at times, but he always keeps the reader engaged. However, at some point toward the end of this novel, with a long soliloquy by one of the characters, he seems to have taken the reader off the trail and lost interest. It was difficult to understand what the point was. Still, singed in my brain were the descriptions of the austere, stark mesas of the ride. Unfortunately, it all fizzled out for this reader."},{"Title":"All the Pretty Horses","review":"A very good, touching, sobering story.

After watching the TV series, Addicted, I was very interested to read about Kristina's life and bought this book. It is a page turner. I have a short attention span with books, but this book flew by. It was so interesting to see how Kristina's life evolved and where it brought her to, which is to help others. I truly believe it is her calling to help others with addictions. It was interesting to see her and her mom's account of each side of a day and to look at life through both of their eyes.

I could not put it down. I have been living in the downward spiral of my son's addiction for the past 3 1/2 years. I loved the way I could read both yours and then your mother's perspective on the same period of time in the addiction. I wonder if my son feels the same way that you did. He certainly would never admit it to me if he did - not at this point anyway. Even though I think I'm a pretty strong female. Stronger in my assertiveness with my husband, and in my career. However, I have not yet found the strength to put my son out. He has been in residential treatment, and several outpatient programs. He was also in Harris County's version of residential treatment for 13 months. He unfortunately has been caught by the law every time he chose to ignore it. Your story has a happy ending. I hope that ours will too....someday. Right now I just need to find a way to be ok - even if he never truly recovers. I too have a younger son, and a wonderful husband that still need me. We have given over too many years already - putting our lives on hold until Gary gets better. It's time for us to start living for us again. I will recommend this book to everyone I know in the same situation. It is by far the best, most helpful for me at least of the many substance abuse/co-dependency books that I have collected over these last years. It was so courageous of you and your mother both to tell this story - in such detail - certainly all of which is not pretty. You must be so proud of your life now, and I can only imagine the pride that your mother feels. I hope that I'm able to feel that one day."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This story is hard to read as a mother. as I felt this mother's pain.

Both Kristina and Constance have given my daughter and I so much hope. I have never written to an author before but felt compelled to write to both Kristina and Constance, and they both were kind and caring enough to write back to me.

This book, \\"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare\\", I started reading and other than fixing dinner in the evening and other chores I had to do, I could not put it down until I finished it. It is so personal, the feelings by the daughter, the feelings of the mother, you don't even have to be an addict or recovering addict to get a lot from this book. I, myself, do have an alcoholic son, but the feelings between the mother and the daughter fit exactly the feelings of myself and my mother when I was from 12 yrs. old until I married at 16 yrs. old, thinking that would be the easy way out.I also bought this book for my mother, who is 82 yrs. old, because my alcoholic son is also her first grandchild and she worries and prays and worries and prays for him all the time.I recommend this book to not only addicts or families of addicts, but even to teenage girls and mothers, just because they have the same feelings as Kristina and her mother had in the book.I would give my right arm if I could get my son to Kristina Wandzilak for help, but my family will not even agree to do the first conference call.

All high school students and their parents should read this book. If people had a better understanding of addiction as a disease, there would be a lot more support and less shame for those with the affliction.

This book is about one woman's struggle with addiction, how it affected her life, her family, health, her personal safety, how she's grown from the experience through recovery, and now uses her gift to help others struggling through their own hell. Every addict has a different story but similar experiences with addiction, and Kristina paints an excellent picture of her vicious cycle struggling with substance abuse. It's important to keep an open mind, and remember the author is telling the story from her point of view. I enjoyed her writing style and looked forward to reading each chapter. The book is very moving and I would recommend this for anyone who knows someone with addiction, is in recover (for inspiration) teenagers (Drug/Alcohol prevention), and those who want to learn what it is to have an addictive personality and what they go through."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Having lost a sibling to alcohol and drug abuse at a very young age, I wish that this book had been available when he was struggling with his addiction. Perhaps our family could have had some knowledge of the help that was available through Al-Anon. This book is a remarkable account of courage, and I encourage any family facing these issues to pay close attention to what Constance went through to heal herself and protect her other children from this terrible disease and the horrors that go along with it. To date, I have not read anything that even comes close to touching my heart and soul the way that Kristina and Constance touched mine when I read this memoir. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"The Lost Years is an absolute must read for anyone suffering from addiction, or who has a family member or friend suffering from the disease of addiction. Straight from the heart, The Lost Years provides a detailed, honest look into the disease of addiction and the long road to recovery. The Lost Years is the best book on addiction that there is."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Excellent book reflecting the most important aspect of life:Facing our best selves, overcoming addiction, choosing to live and love.Impelling, heartfelt reading providing hope and tools forrecovery.

I had to put it down 5 times and just bawl my eyes out. It took me only 3 days to read it which is SUPER fast for me. My self bing a recovering addict it is a heart wrencking yet inspirationally story of how far you can go do and still pull your self out. Good for the mother who was able to give her Daughter the tough love she needed. As difficult as it was."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I highly recomend this book for anybody who has a family member or friend of abuse. It is very inspiring, and hopefull for those people who are also the addict, it proves your life can become normal again. The character Kristina found she could lead a very productive life and help many other families. I now have hope for my loved one."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Being a recovering alcoholic myself, this compelling story really hits home! It tells the REAL life struggles of addiction. From the first page to the last page, this a memoir you will not want to put down! I recommend \\"The Lost Years\\" to anyone who has struggled with addiction, or to any family member who has seen their loved ones go through the stages of addiction! When reading this book, you actually feel as if you are Kristina. The cold, lonely life on the streets. You can feel the fear, anger and the downward spiral into hell that she was on! You can feel a mothers' tough love with her daughter! This is an awesome read and it gives a person hope, and let's the addict know that people DO recover and the person suffering with an alcohol/drug addiction, can get better to live a happy, sober, productive life!! Thank you Kristina and Constance for a terrific, well written story!!Deb Earleywine"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book gives an excellent look into the uncertain feelings of a teenage girl, and how her choices changed her life. Her events and life walk are depicted from her view, and then from her mother's view. There is an instant snap back to that awkward teenage time. Where do you belong, how do you fit in, and how do you cope? The popular kids (the IT group) share the same fears as the ones who seem to 'not fit in.' It does not matter the way others see you; what matters is the way you see yourself! The way teenagers find comfort is the turning point...some bully their way through and others turn to substance abuse. Either way, it is a dark place that requires the courage and will to come out of (whether one is using bad behavior or substance abuse) or you will most certainly disappear (end up all alone in this world or die). The selfish part of life allows one to foolishly think he/she is the victim and put the blame on the people around him/her. This true view story illustrates how naive reactions and destructive behaviors can shatter a family. This is a must read for parents of approaching teens. This could happen to you!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I have read many books on the subject of addiction from both the addicts experience and the parent. This book is the first book that spoke to the path of recovery for both parties interwoven sequentially where you could see the process to recovery for both parties and how they are really the same."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is wonderful! It details the decent into addiction as well as the battle out and it does so from two perspectives-- mother and daughter. I highly recommend this book. It is very well written and informative."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Amazing book! I could not put it down and loved the honesty that these two women demonstrated!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book brings forth the powerful message of denial...all family member who live in a fantasy world denying the inner voice that speaks of the sadness, anger, disconnect that we ignore because we are wanting life to be perfect. We need to get to hear more stories of the pain and agony the life of the addict and their family so we can stop the denial and begin the healing. This was a very hard book to read, and so worth every challenging moment."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book was wonderful! I finished it in one day. It kept my interest from stsrt to finish. Not only did it deal with a very serious subject, but the story was presented in a way to hold the reader's interest. I admire this family for their healing and accomplishments in helping other addicts and families of addicts. Having a son who is an alcoholic, this book really was special to me."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This was a really good book. It was extremely hard to put down. The only complaint I have about the book is that the ending was a little to much like a fairy tale, almost to the point that it wasn't entirely believable. Happy endings are nice, but no one has a perfect life no matter what you want people to believe."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"The authors of this book - Kristina and her mom, Connie - write from their hearts. It's obvious that they've dug deep into themselves and tell the unflinching truth, even if it means casting themselves in the worst light possible. However, the book was written in such a sophomoric fashion that it really took me out of the story. I think a better editor would have greatly benefited this book. Of course, Kristina and her mom are not authors, and that's where a good editor should have stepped in. The text was riddled with grammatical errors, poor sentence structure, and flat prose. It's a pity, considering the writers are such honest storytellers."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"The shipping time was less than a week and the book was in perfect condition!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I heard these two on a late-night radio talk show and they seemed compelling enough (then again, at 4 am, on deadline and eager for any distraction, cleaning my kitchen floor might have seemed compelling).Anyway, this is the usual Lifetime Television-caliber addiction saga:1. Perfect teen daughter feels at odds with the world2. finds that slugging her parents' booze gives her the confidence and social lubrication that was always lacking in her life3. shocks parents with boyfriend-from-the-wrong-side-of-the-tracks4. turns to hard drugs and prostitution5. hits rock bottom6 (or 7). goes to rehab, has a bad attitude7 (or 6). finds God7. goes back to rehab, has a remarkable, soul-searching turnaround9. writes the de rigueur semi-tedious alternating she-says-she-says tome with her mom.8. Oh, and, natch, she now devotes her life to, what else, addiction and recovery.Sprinkle this with the obligatory contrast of perfect siblings, getting thrown off the swim team, the inevitable parental divorce and other endlessly fascinating suburban snippets -- you get the picture.There is some charm, originality and restrained character in the daughter, but the mother's contribution -- both in her endless, soulless chapters in the book and in her appearances in the daughter's scribblings-- is so dreary, self-serving, flat and dull that I was ready for a bottle and a needle myself.Unless you're really jonesing for an addiction book and there's NOTHING else around, give this one a miss. Yawn.Don't get me"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I couldn't put it down! This story captures the reader with its' honesty and raw emotion. The daughter sinks to the depths of addiction while the mother fights her own battles. Each of them emerge as complex and complete people you come to care about."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Great \\"read at one sitting\\" narrative. As all other reviewers mention, the story is written and structured to move you, withsome gripping emotion, quickly through the book. No point in rehashing all the positive elements already noted: It is a modern day Go Ask Alice that benefits the community of parents, etc trying to understand addiction and recovery. But does anyone else notice a certain flatness in the portrayal of nearly all the people in this story? The mother's writing itself seems,for all the angst and suffering, fairly shallow. Yes she loves her daughter and her family. But very little is revealed, really,of the siblings, or of Ben or of Ben's parents. All these short ping-pong paragraphs rob us of the chance to really learnabout the other central characters in this family life. Especially of the father. Mom seems to have made sure we learned nothing about his thoughts, other than he thought her frigid and prude, which was the conclusion one arrives at long beforeshe reveals (with no humor or self awareness) his sentiments. So dad had problems: Yes, and so...?. I noticed he paid for everything--housing, cars, condo, support, treatments, education, etc. Mom lacks deep emotional intelligence: she never seems to dig past her husbands \\"rage\\" into just why he was angry? But I guess as long as the checks keep coming, there is no need to ask. I think the mother failed her family, or at least her readers, by building a tight box of expectationsand shallow social comparisons--she rarely seems to connect deeply with anyone (other than daughter). All in all a good read, but the mother is nearly insufferable. In the end, the daughter has clearly grown/forgiven, but the mother is still very angry: cannot accept that her daughter wants to build her relationship with her father into a positive one in the future. Full custody, alimony, child support still was not enough--very vindictive/judgmental/angry mother...."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This is a wonderful insight into the ugly world of addiction. It was a great read and hard to put down. If you're interested in a great story of hope and recovery, then this is the book. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I couldn't put it down... anybody who has a close one involved in drugs, should read this book (and have them read it too...), the daughter shouln't be alive today, she was just lucky...

I read it in a day and a half and I am not a big reader. It is a moving book that thatI could relate to as a person with long time recovery and a reminder that I am not alone.

The Lost Years is the first story in awhile that I read within 1-2 days and felt it so compelling, I couldn't wait to see where the journey would lead and how it would play out. I want to know what happens to everyone depicted in this book. I appreciate the way it is written - switching off from both perspectives so honestly, full of emotion, almost like I was right there in the moment - it has brightened my day and given me strength when times aren't feeling so promising. How Kristina and Constance endured and kept faith in each other (and in their own lives) during the darkest moments is humbling and grounding. I cried at the defeat and triumph. Through my own struggles with alcohol, addictions, family, and trying to make sense of this world I related to many of the stories, experiences, and feelings depicted - thank you for such a gripping, readable and cathartic book."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is truly inspiring and has helped me look at my family's addiction in such a different light.Thank you both so much for sharing your stories, it has absolutely changed my life."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Thought it was teh mom who was drug dependant but ended up being the daughter but good any ways. thanks"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is so powerful and a must read for those families suffering with addition. It changed my life."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Although this book was obviously written for addicts & co-dependents to share their paths to recovery, in the end I found the biggest lesson being that tough love works if done properly.Kristina goes from being a popular student with a bright and promising future to an alcoholic & drug addict. After her parents have exhasted all other options, and lose some when Kristina turns 18, they are left with no other choice but to tell her to leave & not come home until she's ready to go to treatment.But as a parent, we know how hard that can be. And this book is written by both the addict daughter, & co-dependent mom as they both travel down the road of their own recovery.The authors take turns telling us their thoughts & feelings (which differ greatly) on each step of the journey.How does it feel, as a parent, to throw your child into the street, knowing they have nowhere to go & no money for food or shelter? How do you stick to your guns when every maternal instinct screams to you to find her & bring her home? How do you cope with the feelings of guilt when you realize that perhaps you inadvertently contributed to your childs addiction?How does it feel when your mother - the one person you thought would never do such a thing - tells you that you are no longer welcome in the place you've always called home? And with a raving addiction, and no money for food & shelter, how do you survive & to what lengths will you go before you admit defeat & call mom to say she was right?This book answers those questions, & more."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"My daughter is an addict and I have tried to read several books dealing with addiction over the past couple of years but always got lost or bored with the content. The Lost Years was not such a read; in fact, I could hardly put it down from the very first page to the end. This book is a must read for anyone whose life is affected by addiction, whether you are the one trying to help the addict or you are the addict, you will find the wisdom, strength, encouragement, and honesty that you need. Thank you Constance for making the hard decisions you had to make to help bring about Kristina's recovery. You have opened my eyes to see the part I have been playing in keeping my daughter from getting free from addiction and you have given me encouragement to also make those hard, \\"tough love\\" decisions. And thank you Kristina for being so open as you shared your experiences and what you were thinking at the time. This book has truly been life changing for me."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"An amazing book. I read it in a little over 24 hours. I knew that Kristin had gotten better before the book was written so during the part where mother and daughter talk about the difficult years, I just could not put the book down until I knew she was ok again. As a mother and a daughter I could understand both points of view and the best part about the book is it's parallel recounts of the same experiences as described by mother and daughter. I felt every emotion there was to feel. I cried with the daughter during her difficult times, and I cried with the mother during hers. They are both such strong women, true survivors who show us that nothing is for granted, things can happen to everyone and that there is no stronger bond than family. One of the most emotional moments for me was when Kristin crawled through the window at night of her mom's apartment and curled up to sleep on the floor next to her bed after which Mom put her hand on her back and they lay there in silence yet having said everything there needed to be said at that moment. I think about what I would've done in those various situations. I don't know, I've never experienced anything like that (I am married to an addict, but in different ways, and I am going to learn more about codependancy). Yet I am elated and happy to know that both authors are doing well now and helping to get other people on their feet. Thank you for sharing your story with us and teaching us about hardships, love and forgiveness."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book was recommended to me while I was in Marin County over Christmas. My good friend in Marin was a neighbor of the authors. I have a granddaughter who is in trouble with drugs and fits the profile of the daughter in this book to a tee. I read the book, passed it on to a friend here in Indiana and ordered a new one from Amazon to be sent to my daughter in Oregon. My daughter has read it and the book inspired her to take action with her teenager immediately, or I should say, take action with herself immediately. The very honest diary, The Lost years, shows the reader that there is nothing that the Mom can do when her child is in trouble with drugs.... she can only take care of herself. We all know this to be true but reading it from both the Mom's feelings and the addict's feelings proves that it will end when it ends. In this book, there is a happy ending. That gives us all hope."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"That's a warning label. I picked up the book at 10:30 at night....And read to the wee hours. I just couldn't put it down. When I finished early that morning, I was emotionally drained. This is a contemporary Odyssey - tracing the journey of two wounded, unlikely, reluctant \\"heroines\\", no, two warriors - through the back ally's of our cities, the gritty underside of life we from the suburbs pass by every day, looking the other way. Hoping misfortune doesn't strike our nice upper middle class family. But addiction strikes everywhere, regardless of class, education or breeding - stealing away years. Going to work that morning, my eyes were open to the miracles and transformations that do happen. I was grateful my sister and niece survived and inspired by the courage, humility and grace that also are every day events when our hearts are open."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"One of the most moving books on recovery out in print. Gives the perspective of the family impact of addiction, as told by her mother which is rarely given in a book on addiction. I would highly reccomend this book for any treatment center and it's patients, family members, persons in recovery or any one interested in this topic. Kristina's story is touching, warm and gripping. Hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Powerful! Powerful! The bold, honesty of these women is just absolutely powerful. To read about forgiveness, pulling yourself off the ground and rising up, is just powerful. I am truly speachless. I finished this book in one day. I could not put it down. You definately do not need to be in a situation of drugs and alcohol to read this book and be touched. I reccomend this book to every parent, mother, daughter, friend. It is Powerful."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Crucial to say that this riveting book will embrace you and won't let you go. As I read I felt myself involved as if it were my own family. Its so simple, just one slip or excuse and anyone could be falling over the edge. I learned a great deal from this book and it made me look at my family, our interactions, and myself. Not everything contained in a beautiful, affluent, faultless packaging is what it seems. It's important for us to be reminded.Succinct, intelligent, engaging, valuable read for anyone."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"As a mom of a child in the disease of addiction The Lost Years describes the reality of the situation - I resonated with so much that the mother said and feel that what Cristina was going through is amazingly similar to waht my son is experiencing even though the circustances are quite different. I was wary of reading this book because my life is scary enough but it helped to know that it takes time for the family and the addicted person to recover, and that there is so much hope. Also, the plug for Al Anon could not be more accurate. The program is saving my life. I am recommending to all I know in this situation."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"There have been so many memoirs about addiction recently, that I groaned when someone told me \\"you've got to read this book\\"! but I decided to give it a try, and I am so grateful I did. I work in the field of addiction, and I now give this book to all the families of alcoholics and addicts I work with.For the first time the story is told not just of the addicted person but of her family as well, and it's brilliantly done. Instead of the usual grizzly details of addiction, this memoir tells the story of how an ordinary girl from a \\"nice\\" family can end up homeless and addicted to meth, and how she regained her life and her spirit, but that's just half the story as anyone who works with addicts knows. The mothers story is heartbreaking and rarely told. This whole family was affected by Kristinas addiction, and the whole family had to find a way to recover from it's effects. There's very little out there for families who love someone struggling to get sober, and this book offers hope and solutions."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I am the mother of 4 daughters, the youngest is now nearly 17 and we recently discovered she's experimenting with pot. We took her to a review with the authors of The Lost Years and when she normally would act bored and irritated, she was sitting on the edge of her seat listening to every word. The book is written so well, honest and straight forward, it engages you immediately. It's a painful read, but worth every second to see the human spirit triumph! When I finished it, I left it in the living room and noticed my daughter has it in her room and is halfway finished. I think it is a must read for teenage girls and their mothers - if they aren't dealing with the same issues they will know someone who is, and will be able to give them real life examples of hope and inspiration. We can't bury our heads in the sand - this is real stuff!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is amazing. I went to a speaking about this book where both of the authors attended, and it was life changing. As soon as I was done with the meeting I went to the nearest bookstore and bought it. I seriously could not put it down. I recommend this book to anyone because it will literally change your life. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is so wonderful, the author has so much courage to display her life's passion on paper. At some points it is very powerful so be prepared, but every piece adds up to a fantastic book about a difficult journey through drug addiction and the worst things that can happen to a person, but the proof that she got through it all is sooooo amazing!!! It made me truely appreciate my sheltered and clean cut life. They came to my school to tell us their story and it was the best lecture that we have ever had!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is moving, inspiring, and a must-read for everyone. The authors spoke at my school, they are truly amazing people with a story that needs to be heard."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I heard these women at a book signing at my daughter's school. I went home, read the book, and could not put it down. I am ordering it for 3 people I know. You don't have to have an addicted family member to read this book. All parents, children, teachers, etc. should read it. Kristina's description of her teen years and how she felt different and shy is very helpful to other teens. Constance's realization of how she could have possibly protected her daughter from being an addict is a red flag to other parents. Share this book with everyone you know."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I listened to this mother and daughter speak at my school and what they said was amazing.

I was completely mistaken. Their incredible story is expressed in such a raw and vivid manner that it provides a fresh perspective on the age-old topic of addiction. A highly recommended read."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst NightmareThe Lost Years reveals such insight to the chaos of this family disease. And very importantly--the recovery each member can achieve. For those impacted by addiction, it's a depiction of our experiences.

I was assigned to read this book for a Substance Abuse course and I was a little bit apprehensive to read another book about addictions, but this was not just another book; it was different. The Lost Years gives remarkable insight into the mind/heart/soul/motivations of a young woman addicted to alcohol and cocaine and also the mother's side of the story. I picked up this book in the morning and by the end of the afternoon, I had finished it. I truly could not put it down. A gripping story and a great read for anyone, but a MUST READ for professionals in the field. I think that I will be a better counselor and a better person for having read Kristina and her mother's story. Thank you so much for this book!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is so clearly one whose time has come. Waiting for a decade to pass before writing the story down allowed the events to be processed and fully digested. Feelings on all sides were clearly no longer raw, hostility had passed, and growth had occured which gave way for honesty and truth to shine through on every page.This book gives people hope that change - in many forms - is real, attainable, and sustainable.Read it! You will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book presents, in heartbreaking detail, what it was like for a mother and daughter as the daughter's addictions spun her life totally out of control. I knew she survived, because it said so on the back cover. Still I feared for the daughter's life at times, and couldn't imagine how she would ever make it back to any sort of normalcy. The gift is finding out how she did, and what her mother did/didn't do to \\"help\\" her. This book is horrifying at times, yet ultimately hopeful."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"An amazing, honest account of addiction. This is a gift for anyone affected by substance abuse. Riveting and moving!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Our daughter was falling into the world of addiction, and a good friend of mine bought this book for us. The timing was perfect as we were in the early stages of trying to figure out what to do for our daughter. It turns out that reading this book was the first thing we did, and it was the foundation of all of our actions. It gave us the understanding and courage to do what was necessary to help our daughter, and she is well on the path to recovery. It is a must read for anyone who has a loved one living with the disease of addiction, and I recommend it for every parent who truly loves their children as it may very well give them the knowledge to help their child someday. As we found out, addiction has no boundaries, it can aflict anyone. Absolutely the most important book I have ever read. It saved our daughter's life."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This is a great book for anyone in recovery or anyone trying to understand addiction and the life of recovery.

I simply could not put this book down. I have been to many Al-Anon meetings, a Kaiser program, psychologists, but this book has helped me the most.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a child with an addiction."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"As someone in recovery myself, I felt that Kristina's story is inspiring and thought-provoking.

It's real, honest and impossible to put down. I've marked pages I go back to and read over and over. This book is different than all the rest because you see BOTH sides of the story AND it is gut wrenching honest. Thank you Kristina and Connie for writing this book that we know must have been terribly hard to re-live."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I truely could not put this book down. It is written with such truth and paints a poetic piture of the tragedys and triumps involved in addiction.

I have purchased many copies since reading it for friends and family because it is so powerful and healing."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I have watched the show \\"Addicted\\" and wondered about her life and her journey and was thrilled to find her book. Words can't describe the emotions I felt reading her story a very inspirational.

I have read many memior style books, most of which were specifically about addiction. I have loved most of the books but this one really touched me. The way it was written, going back and forth between mom and daughter, brought a new perspective to the story of addiction. It was amazing to hear each author describe the same situations and events from such contrasting points of view. This book brought me into their heartache so vividly I often found myself crying. It is an absolute must read!!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I highly recommend this book for any family that has a member with an addiction. It shows how it is truly a family disease. You see it from both the addict a nd the mothers view.

It was honest and hard to read at times. It was wonderful to read the mother's perpective of this journey through her daughter's addiction. I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with a child's addiction."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book, though extremely heart-wrenching, tells a story of absolute courage and hope. It is about a much-loved daughter/sister being caught up in the web of drug addiction and the depths of hell she walked through before coming out the other side victorious. It is a story of a mother's courage in letting her daughter go when she finally realized the family home could not protect her and that her presence in the home was causing damage to all within. It tells of a daughter's courage in overcoming the bonds of addiction. It is a story of hope for those lost in the world of addiction - for not only is the addict lost, those who love the addict become lost as well. I have not reviewed this book on its literary qualities as I am not qualified. I am qualified, however, to review it on its message of hope for those of us who need this message."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is powerfully griping & holds nothing back. Mothers/children that suffer with addiction will benefit from this book. You get a true look @both sides"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"A harrowing tale told with honesty and clarity. Each voice feels true and illuminates the dilemma a family endures when a member self destructs. It is possible for redemption to occur."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This was a great book! There are a million books out there on addictions written by the person who has experienced it. This book shared both the addict/daughter views as well as the mothers account of what was going on inside her when her daughter was addicted. As a mother, I highly recommend this book if you are going through any addiction issues with your child. It will not only open your eyes but you will come out of this story feeling empowered as a parent."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I just finished this book and think that every teenage girl and woman should read this. Kristina and Constance's candor and self revealing story is unbelievably inspirational. Every family dealing with addiction should read this, but I think it is an important read for any home with a teenage home (siblings, parents, etc). This is a moving, at times, heart-breaking story. You will laugh, cry and hurt with both Constance and Kristina. I am so moved by this story! A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Thank God for this book. If you are a mother struggling with a teen-age daughter's addictions, this is the book for you. The book was written from the heart by a brillant young woman who pulled herself out of the \\"living hell\\" of drug and alcohol addiction and a brave mother who realized that the only way her child would recover was if she allowed her to do it on her own. It is a blessing and a miracle they both survived the ordeal to write the book. I am sure you will be inspired by Kristina's and Constance's compelling story. It offers great insight and hope for all of us.Mary H-BTexasApril 2008"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This is a great book. It reads more like a story, but has a lot of good information in it. The daughter especially writes well. Her ability to describe her experiences is extremely well done. You feel her. The mom also is a good writer. The only thing I think she could have done better is explain how she went from one extreme to the other with her daughter. I think for the average mother out there they might find her approach rather harsh. I agree with her approach, but think maybe a little more details as to how she became so firm would be helpful for some mothers. But, overall I really liked this book and would highly recommend it. I think it is a very hopeful book, but not for a weak stomach because it is very graphic as to what a drug addict on the streets can and does go through. It is heart wrenching, but very real. Great job to both authors."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Anyone affected by addiction and everyone who is to work with addiction must read this book. The honesty with which the story is told is so rarely found and so invaluable in understanding the depth of addiction. This book has changed both my professional and personal life."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I read the first two pages of The Lost Years and didn't want to put the book down. It was fascinating to read the two sides of the stories simultaneously and electrifying to see how close mother and daughter were linked even when they were not in communication with each other. It's one of the best \\"tough love\\" stories I've ever read. And, what an inspiration to any parent with children who are \\"lost\\" and to any person that is fighting any kind of addiction."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Reading this book made everything in my immediate life wake with the significance of one who has just been told she is dying but being given a chance to live again. The reader is caught breath by breath in the story of a woman who undergoes a tremendous ordeal in her battle with addiction and family secrets. She reminds me that life is not always beautiful, but truth is always reveletory and carries beauty just beside it. This isn't a book, it is an experiential journey through the eyes of one woman who is every young, passionate, confused woman in our culture!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book was amazing! A story of addiction and recovery, from BOTH sides: the mother and the daughter. I read it in 2 days... it was so good. A must-have for anyone with children-- learn from this mother's experience how to recognize addiction, what to do about it, and what NOT to do about it. Even if you don't have children or any experience with addiction, you WILL be touched by this story. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"The lost years should be a required reading for all teenagers and their parents. This nightmare that Kristina and her mother went through unfortunatly is not unique. What is unique is the way her addiction was handled. The strength and dedication of Kristina's mother must be followed by all parents in the same situation. The strength of Kristina in overcoming her addiction was remarkable. This true story read like a novel. Couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I read this book while I was in a treatment center to battle my own struggle with drugs and addiction. While much of our story was different, the feelings and struggle she translates through her words reflected my own in a shockingly similar way.The hope and inspiration I took from this book not only allowed me to walk through my own fears and become inspired to do whatever it took to better myself but also encouraged me to establish an honest and close friendship with the one person who I had hidden my true self from the most. My mother."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is incredible. I'd read a lot of stuff about addiction, but nothing like this. It's honest, straightforward, and I stayed up until 4 am becasue I just had to finish it!I'd never read something where you get to see both sides of the story. It's so beautifully written, you can tell how much the mother loves her daughter, and how she found the strength to walk away from her, because she knew she couldn't do any more to \\"save\\" her is heartbreaking and really inspirational all at the same time.Addiction affects so many of us, and this book is the only one I've read which really nails it."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I am an avid reader and to this day, this book is by far my favorite. Thank you Kristina and Constance for writing this extremely personal, tragic and hopeful book. I own more then one copy that's how much I love it. I would recommend this book to anyone, you do not have to have a personal struggle involving drugs to have this book move you - speaking from experience. I am so thankful I bought this book."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"An excellent read in general. However I, like Constance, was facing the issues of dealing with an addicted teen/young adult. The honesty and insight of Kristina and Constance gave me the courage I needed to do the hardest thing I have ever had to do. I appreciate their written work and have already suggested this book to others facing the heartache of addiction. I read it twice, back to back. In reading their story I was reading my own. The very emotions and situations the mother faced, I faced. This is a wonderful, encouraging, empathetic writing and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I first heard about Kristina through her TV show Addicted. Wow, it is horrendous what she went through and survived until today to become am addiction specialist. I found it fascinating reading her mother's point of view which may help other parents of drug addicted children. Fascinating read"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is a true gift to me. I love that it comes from both the mother's and the daughter's points of view. Really showcases how each other's thoughts are so very different. Very heart-felt and touching. I grew to love them both and feel what each of them were feeling. As a parent dealing with this same subject, I found it enlightening and encouraging. A must-read for anyone dealing with an addicted child."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I saw a few programs on The Learning Channel called \\"Addicted\\". I was intrigued by Kristina's opener briefly explaining her life on the streets and on drugs. I wanted to see if she had written any books about her life and I found this one. I thought it was a very powerful book. She and her mother are both so open and honest. It's a heart wrenching story with a happy ending. I highly recommend this book. It would be very beneficial to any family facing addiction."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Item was exactly as described and a at great price. Item was received very fast and was expertly packaged. Would love to do business again."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Great depiction, written with honesty and courage, of Kristina's path from addiction to recovery, interwoven with the powerlessness, pain, and eventual emotional recovery of her mother. An honest depiction of the pain and suffering resulting from addiction, and rare view of both AA and Alanon as they worked to support both Kristina and Constance in making positive changes in their lives.Enormously helpful, but also frightening story. I recommend it to young people struggling with alcohol or drug addiction, to parents struggling with how to respond to the addiction of a child or to therapists or others seeking to understand more deeply the process of recovery.Rusty HendlinLicensed Marriage and Family Therapist"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I found this book after watching Kristina's series, Addicted, on Netflix.This should actually be REQUIRED reading for Al-Anon Family Groups as it is so powerful and it shows that the \\"next right step\\" may not ever be an easy one, but is worth the pain.Bless Kristina and her mother for having the courage to fight this disease."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Shockingly honest and nothing is off limits in this account of a young woman's slide into alcohol and drug hell. Equally honest is the mother's account from her own set of lenses and how she eventually came to terms with her daughter's addiction and the painful decisions she made which led to her daughter's recovery. It is a book of hope and courage with both mother and daughter showing just how courageous one needs to be to become \\"clean\\" and stay \\"clean\\". You won't put it down. Bravo for telling a painful but bold story about addiction and recovery."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is a must read for anyone interested in addiction in any way. As I read this book I became more and more attached to the characters and it became impossible to put down. This book gives hope to any reader."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Both authors courageously reveal how both addiction and codependence operate, and how each must be untangled. Although the story is painful, the healing, wisdom, and insight reached by the end will provide hope and encouragement to addicts, as well as their friends and families."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was the most honest, heart wrenching and inspiring book on addiction i have ever read. I loved how it was laid out to show both aspects of addiction; the addicts point of view and the co-dependants point of view. Or in this case, what happens when the co-dependant does the right and most dificult thing....to let go. I could sum up this whole book in one word: BRAVO!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. Kristina is honest and transparent about her struggles and her road to recovery. Constance allows you to experience all that she felt as a mother watching her daughter on this journey. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a powerful true life story of hope and redemption. It has meant the world to me and my family."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is a wake up call for every parent. There is so much going on in this book. The mother's story of blind belief and then the slow realization and acceptance of the truth of her daughter's addiction. What it took, personally, for mom to change who she was and her life inorder for her daughter to believe she too could recover. A very moving and powerful book."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is really a must read for anyone who has had or loved someone with an addiction of any sort. It is a story of rock bottom despair, and coming back to life again. Powerfully told, this true story can inspire all of us because everybody loves somebody who has had or has the demon that is addiction."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"A story full of very raw emotion that will sometimes make you cry, and other times will fill your heart with warmth. The authors Constance Curry and Kristina Wandzilak who are mother and daughter, are both extraordinary women and their story is extremely touching. You will not be able to put this book down, both women share some of the best and darkest moments of their lives, and it is incredibly captivating."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Having seen the Mother & Daughter on the TODAY Show, I was aware of their story. But reading the details was mesmerizing. Usually these stories are told from one perspective - the addict. Being exposed to the family dynamics prior to addiction, seeing the mother's agony, the daughter's desperation, and how all of this impacts the family, should help families who have experienced issues with addiction gain insight to the bigger picture."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I found that I could'nt set this book down! Having a daughter myself, I kept imagining being in the position of this mother and daughter. Truly a nightmare! It took two very strong people to get to the outcome of this story. Very good book!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"It illustrates the raw, baffling power of this disease. This book is an emotional, gut wrenching ride through a family's struggle. A must read for families, ministers, counselors and medical personnel so they can more thoroughly understand addiction to combat it. It is mandatory reading for the family's I work with."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I found this book particularly compelling and from the heart. Only a writer who had really lived through these events could relate them with such heart wrenching conviction."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"A must-read for every parentOf all the addiction memoirs that I have read in the last two years this is one that goes straight to the heart of the matter. Genuine, honest, accessible and heart-breaking are just a few of the words that I would use to describe this powerful book.Written as a joint account of the lives of a mother and daughter during the troubled times of the daughter's addiction and recovery, it is the mother's side of the story that turns out to be the more poignant since she had it all, then lost it, and ultimately had to find her own way out of the mess that her life was in. She took courageous steps to protect her other children from the damage that her addicted daughter could inflict on her family, the most devastating of which was, time and again, to turn the addict away from her door until her daughter learned she had no choice but to be rehabilitated. Very few loving parents can do this and then command the compassion to restore a beautiful relationship with such a prodigal child.It must be rare too that an addict who has been so near to death as she had been from the serious diseases of alcohol and drug addiction should later become so unselfishly involved in helping others suffering. To live with the daughter, as one does in the later pages of this book, whilst she struggles through the recovery process and begins the struggle to re-connect with her family is a testament to the hope that exists and lives within all of us. It is the hope born of a belief that we can change our lives from the worst to the very best and it proves once again that where there is love there is life and where there is life there is always hope."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This is the book I have been waiting for! This is the Owner's Manual for anyone affected by this family disease. So often family members want someone else to change! Bravo Constance! You sought help, put the focus on yourself, set clear boundaries and clear consequences and your family got well. This book is a gift to all parents in a BIG way. Bravo Kristina! You followed your treatment recommendations and got well too. Your book is now mandatory reading for all the teens and all the parents in my teen drug treatment program as well as my graduate students in Counseling Psychology. I predict very big changes as a result of this book. Thank you!Larry Fritzlan, LMFT - Director, Adolescent Recovery Services."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This book is well written, easy to read and almost impossible to put down. The subject matter relates to almost all of us. Who among us has not had such an experience or know someone who has, or is going through a similiar situation? I have a better understanding about how this happens and have been given hope that it does not always end in a negative manner."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I have worked in the field of Chemical Dependency recovery for almost 30 years and have read & heard 1000's of 'recovery stories' but there is something about this one that hooks you in & doesn't let you go. It is heart-breaking, courageous and ultimately inspiringly clear-sighted. It's one of the best descriptions of how one family member's co-dependency recovery can alter an addict's destructive life course and also what it really takes to get and stay clean & sober. Kristina is unflinchingly honest, brave and vulnerable as she describes what it was like to climb back from the black pit of addiction and go on to become one of the best Interventionists in the country. The work she does now saves lives and families, alters the course of generations of alcoholism and is motivated by such sincerity of purpose.For anyone who's ever wanted to understand the insanity of addiction, or how the progression occurs, this is the book for you. I keep multiple copies on hand to give out to anyone who's interested in a 'short course' on what Twelve-Step recovery is.This book is a treasure!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"After a year and a half in treatment and two attempts of making it on her own in the real world, my daughter relapsed one more time. Her therapists helped me come to grips with what needed to be done. After cutting her financially off and having her car taken away from her, her therapists told me... \\"read The Lost Years. It will show you why you have to do what you are doing!\\" My heart was broken from hearing myself say the words--- we are finished with you financially... and having to tell her that if she didn't do what was recommended for her, she could go out on the streets. I never thought we would have to get to this point. Well- we did! The Lost Years came into my life at a time when I needed a book to not only show me that what we were doing was the right thing but how to do it without feeling guilty. As Constance said..\\" another senselessness of addiction....\\"... \\"when they need you the most you have to turn them away...\\" Constance is the strongest most admirable mother I know. As I finished the book, tears were streaming down my face. If only my daughter could do what Kristina did!! Alanon has taught me that no person is hopeless. Kristina shows us that. What Kristina and her mother went through was pure hell but they got to the other side of it. They walked through their fears into recovery for both of them and a wonderful life for their famiy. We all need to hear these success stories. We all need role models and these two fine women are they! Thanks for sharing."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Riveting! This blow-by-blow memoir is so vivid, so wrenching, that you will live the nightmare along with drug and alcohol addict Kristina and her mother. For those with little or no experience in this netherworld, the most intriguing aspect of the book is getting inside these women's heads. Why does someone start drinking at the age of 13? How can a smart, talented kid fall so low so fast? What does a parent do when a kid doesn't want to help herself? One twist of fate at any of dozens of points, and Katrina's life might have gone differently: she might have snapped out of it, or she might have ended up dead. Even though you know she recovered before you start reading, you can't help being drawn into this page turner.Luckily, this horror story has a happy and inspiring ending. Even so, it's hard to imagine how any one person, let alone two, could experience that much pain and abuse and not simply die."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"This is singularly the most compelling book I have ever read. It was so gripping that despite my 6.00am appointment and knowing I would return to the task of getting 3 kids organized I kept reading it until finished (somewhere around 4.00am).It is the most beautiful story of redemption and love. You do not have to have issues with abuse to read this book...forgiveness, love and redemption are all acts that we need to give and receive in our lives. The two authers have given us a blue print in their extrodinaryly honest protrayal of how anyone can take the journey back from shame, anger and isolation by telling us their story in a sometimes brutally honest manner.I do not believe anyone who reads this book will not be moved by it, nor do I believe that lives will not be changed by reading this, mine certainly has.To the authors, thank you for showing me how healing, taking responsiblity for actions and being truely honest is."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I could not put this book down. As a recovering addict myself, I felt I was reading mine and my mom's own story. The book shows how the disease of addiction not only effects the addict, but the whole family. I have sent this book to my mom, and two friends. I urge everyone touched by the disease of addiction to read this book, and then send it on to a friend."},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"Each of the women bare their hearts in this wrenching story of a mother and daughter's journey to the depths of despair and back. I know the truth of this startlingly vivid memoir because my daughter and I went through a similar journey. We both read the book and felt it resonanted deeply for us.Kristina and Constance recount their perceptions and feelings about the same events in alternating chapters. The insight that this gives a reader provides a remarkable and very moving experience.I cannot recommend this book enough to anyone who has a family member who has been sucked down the drain of self-loathing and drugs. This book provides a window into a world of family dysfunction and addiction and will help people to understand how hope is possible and how healing and redemption can take place in the face of all odds. Kristina and Constance's triumph is incrediblly inspiring!"},{"Title":"The Lost Years: Surviving a Mother and Daughter's Worst Nightmare","review":"I read this book start to finish in ONE day, for the simple fact that I could not walk away from it. The way Kristina and Connie write, gives the reader a real connection with both of them. You live the nightmare right along side the authors with every page, and the powerful finish to the story makes you want to stand up and cheer! I gave it to a friend to read whose sister was addicted to drugs, and she then gave it to her husband and parents. Her husband later said to me, \\"this should be required reading in the schools!\\" The horrifying details Kristina provides would deter even the most addictive personality. What an incredible story. Get ready for an amazing, and ultimately beautiful emotional rollercoaster."},{"Title":"Handbook for Proclaimers: Year B","review":"What can one say....a well written book, and I use it most every week.Has wonderful overview of the readings.

That's what is so great about this book, you don't jsut get wonderful info about the school and its academics/athletics.diversity, etc, but also about the area in which the school is located. I think this is also such a great read because it is written by a student at the college.

I also gave this as gifts to all my girls...DH"},{"Title":"The story of Aunt Becky's army-life","review":"With the sesquicentennial (2011-2015) of the Civil War (1861-1865) soon to be here, I purchased this book because of Sarah Palmer (aka Aunt Becky) was from my county. It is also a good one to read for anyone interested in what Civil War female nurses went through during this time."},{"Title":"The story of Aunt Becky's army-life","review":"At first I couldn't imagine Aunt Becky leaving her two young daughters to travel with the army for years. I gradually came to understand a few things.1. She was recently widowed. She had family that I assume cared for her daughters.2. She had two brothers that went to war and she basically went with them and stayed with their company, though she rarely was able to meet up with them.3. She felt called to do her part and also to help her brothers if they needed her.She sacrificed tremendously, wearing the same dress for years, (maybe there were two and she alternated, but she spoke of only her \\"bed ticking dress,\\" often going hungry, sleeping in a soaking wet tent, on a soaking wet cot. She spoke occasionally of Mrs. Dix, (Dorothea Dix?) and she was paid at the end of the war, but not without fighting for it and immediately gave some of it away to her \\"boys\\" that she had traveled with and cared for.It is actual recorded history, not what we think happened or probably happened, but what did happen, from this woman's perspective.I love journals and diaries for this reason.It also helped me understand the feelings of why the war was fought and what it meant and did to the country.Also in those days nursing was not considered fit work for women and was done by men. At first she wiped brows and held hands, but it wasn't long before she was dressing wounds and helping in surgery.I highly recommend this valuable piece of history."},{"Title":"Phantom World","review":"My review will be biased, as I am a Mark A Roeder fan. I enjoyed Phantom World very much. Mark writes in a style that I can relate to when I was a young teenager. Mark keeps the reader involved in the whole story. The plot is fresh and never gets boring. I always need to have a box of tissue standing by as I do cry a lot reading Marks books. Mark has written several very excellent books and this book is no exception. I hope to see more books coming from the pen of Mark A Roeder. I have nine of his books now.Roger L. Hollenbeck"},{"Title":"Phantom World","review":"The introduction to the book says that this is a a departure from his previous books, and that is very correct. Throughout the beggining of the novel I forgot there was not a relevant gay character, it seems the author concentrated on the straight boys in the story, while thats not bad, it is different from his previous books in the gay chronicles. Perhaps the intent is to show every shade in the field of growing up and dating, but it seem to loose a bit of the charm from the gay characters in the previous novels.The book itself reads in the same way as the rest chronicles, from the style to the change of point of views, it is an enjoyable read, but definetly not the best. If you are starting out the chronicle Id recommend startin in order from the soccer field is empty."},{"Title":"Phantom World","review":"LOVED IT... LOVED IT... LOVED IT... what can I say I loved it, I loved how Toby met his best friends and future love interest... i loved that you couldn't always tell a book by it's cover in Toby's attractions and i loved how Toby and his best friend stayed true even though they had both loved and been hurt by the same boy... Family truly does suck some times but in the end it's the family that you choose who mean the most when they stand by you. I think that sometimes you need the world of hurt to make things better."},{"Title":"Phantom World","review":"This is an important book. While not my favorite book by Mark Roeder, I thought it handled the pitfalls of meeting someone off the internet very well. I liked the charcter of Toby, and even Mackenzie at the end.

Don't know what all the fuss is about - Munroe is overrated, although middle-aged women seem to enjoy her books."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"Typical anti-male diatribe disguised as a work of literature. This was assigned reading for one of my college literature courses over twenty years ago, and the memory of the distaste I felt while reading it is still fresh in my mind. The symbolism and 'moral of the story' is heavy-handed and overtly obvious.

A depiction of small-town life like Sherwood Anderson's, it makes the small-town mundane luminescent with meaning.

The descriptions were good, and the insight into the thinking of the main character was interesting, but there was no plot development, just a description of this young girl's deprived life but told with a hope that her intellectual potential might bring about a change in her life. When that just falls flat, at the end of the book the reader is left with nothing in the way of productive insight or inspiration or any satisfying closure."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers that the characters and the story were generally enjoyable to read. Though it did take me a bit to get invested into the book I found myself deeply involved with them, of course Del primarily, toward the end. The descriptions of Del's adventures and curiosity were tangible and brought back childhood memories and feelings. However, I expected a much different outcome; I expected this curious, intelligent, intellectual Del to develop into a different woman. I can't help but wonder if this book is popular among women who are looking for reassurance in their decision to follow relationships rather than personal ambitions (and maybe that is ok to a certain degree). Hate to sound cynical, but I was outraged at Del's decisions toward the end of the book and in my opinion she made some serious and more importantly, uncharacteristic decisions that really ruined the book for me and made me wonder how this is a major book for women. I couldn't tell if it was condoning her behavior or simply displaying it as the constricted and likely course for women of a time period and even to (I think) a lesser extent today. Still I think that Del's character in the last chapter was entirely too emotional and irrational given her previous actions and thoughts. I myself am in my mid-twenties and I know that life options for women now are not what they were for women in their 50s, 60s, even 40s today, so perhaps it is more relatable for those a little older, and maybe it is important that I've read it to gain a bit more understanding about where we've (women) have come from; but I'd hate for a young girl today to read it and think that she should emulate Del."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"I hadn't read Munro prior to this \\"novel\\" loosely woven from a series of short pieces connected by sequence and character, but found this work delightful.

Prompt delivery, also."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"Alice Munro is truly the master of the short story. &quot;Lives of Girls and Women&quot; deserves to be on everyone's list of must-read books. Munro is an exceptionally talented writer, one who can take ordinary situations and turn them into something wonderful. Here, she presents a traditional coming of age story, then spices it up with her own unique brand of dry, subtle wit and a host of zany characters. In &quot;Lives,&quot; we follow Dell Jordan from childhood to young adulthood as she struggles with her identity in a small town in southern Ontario. Along the way, we meet many colorful characters, including Dell's Baptist boyfriend, her social outcast mother, a suicidal music teacher, and a lecherous friend of the family. &quot;Lives&quot; is more of a collection of short stories than a novel, but each story is like a puzzle piece. In the end, each piece fits together to create a massize jigsaw puzzle of Dell's life. I have read &quot;Lives&quot; three times, and it is one of my favorite books - addictive, humorous, and thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"What an amazing book! This not merely a good book for middle-aged women, or good instruction for girls, or any such claptrap. To label Munro as good \\"women's lit\\" is demeaning to women and demeaning to \\"The Lives of Girls and Women.\\" (Plus it makes men who enjoy reading her a bit funny.) It's a great book! In any category!Munro is a master of characterization and narrative structure. Del's description of her mother, for example, reveals: (1) Del's feeling of discomfort at her own place within Jubilee's hierarchy and environment; Del wants to fit in, and her mother embodies the eccentric within her own self. (2) Del's mother's strengths, pulling herself from abject poverty, putting herself through school, starting her own business in conservative postwar rural Canada - this woman evokes our admiration, despite the disgust of our narrator. It's these multidimensional portraits that makes Munro so great - yes, a character (Del's mother) can earn our admiration, disgust, and pity all at once...Then in the building of conflict, Munro ALWAYS surprises us. Every scene is fresh, new, interesting, every culmination of conflict resolves in ways we would never expect. Take the time when Del was being molested by her mother's boarder's boyfriend. One day she goes off with him in his car out to the country, and we're expecting some \\"Bastard Out of Carolina\\" child-raping exploitation and subsequent weepy victim hood. But Munro makes a left at the light, has the man simply masturbate in front of the child, who for her part is excited, charmed, and repelled by the sight and is grateful to be introduced to the mystery of the penis.And lastly, Munro refuses to depict her women in the same, old tired way. Her women are not dragged around by the hand by handsome strangers, as they so often are in movies. Her women are not victims of rape, incest, or peer pressure, as in way too many contemporary novels. No, Munro's women are real. They have drive, ambition, and a deep desire to be seen as people.Definitely one of my favorite books, ever."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"I was forced to read this book during the final exams for my H.S.C. but actually found that it was very enjoyable. It is the touching story of a young girl growing up in Canada in the 40s, who yearns to be an artist, and her journey towards womanhood. The format of the story is unique and the characters are likeable and real enough to believe in. This is a well-told semi-autobiographical novel which stays in the memory long after it's has been read."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"I couldn't possibly say all I want to say about how good this book is. I am Alice Munro's biggest fan and this is my favorite of her books. Many of her later stories are larger in scope, more ambitious in their reach, but this book is truly a gem. Get lost in Del's world. Munro creates a lush, astounding, painfully, gorgeously real world. Read this book and then read it again. And give it to every one of your friends."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"One of the most insightful and remarkable short story writers living today, Alice Munro's stories are like events, rich, beautiful and knowing. &quot;Lives of Girls&quot; traces the life of one girl into womanhood, supplying a blueprint, in many ways, of how to write a short story. Munro is a master, and this work is one (of many moments) of her at her greatest."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"I first read this book when I was 15, for an high school english class, and have returned to it many times since. Munro is a deceptively simple writer whose style is subtle, witty, and rings of truth. After many reads, I still find something new each time I pick Lives of Girls and Women up. Another Munro favorite: The Beggar Maid. Fantastic writing and use of the short story form."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"I think I saw on youtube, that some religious schools banned this novel. Man those guys are easily offended! I think actually this novel is quite innocent. I mean it's just a little girl who honestly seek some answers to her existential questions in the established religions in her town. Then when she grows a little older she naturally becomes interested in the question of sex, and explore that. What could be more natural and innocent?! I think Alice Munro's voice is charming and entertaining. Especially the part where her school performs an operetta is catching and memorable.There is a very strong scene in the end of the novel, which actually the whole of the novel centers around. This scene takes place in the Wawanash river when Del Jordan is bathing with her truck driver boyfriend Garnet French. In my opinion Alice Munro in that scene carves out an eternal and everlasting moment in the history of litterature. To me the scene is perhaps not so much about religion specifically, but more about human society in general.As with some great artists, there is something superior and untouchable about Alice Munro. For a rather plain person like me, this strange stuff, is a source of recurrent intellectual itchiness, because I will properly never be able to touch it, define it and put it in a box.Is the books Ontario town, Jubilee, perhaps inspired by her experiences in the Ontario town, Wingham?"},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"This is the first book I've read by Alice Munro, and I've found it to be really impressive, and I'm definitely going to seek out other writing. She's undoubtedly good.Munro's coming-of-age story resonates with a real sense of truth and has important things to say about the experience of women during the 40s. The main character is torn between her own passions and intelligence, and the guide of her likeable oddbod intellectual mother, and the conventional house-wife role that her best friend Naomi so vigorously adopts. It's an age-old predicament of most heroines - her inner sensibilites vs. what is commonly acceptable - but its wry observations and emotive language sets the novel apart. Munro's frank approach to sex is also refreshing."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"The jacket describes LIVES OF GIRLS AND WOMEN as Alice Munro's only novel. But this is misleading, since the book's seven chapters read more like a sequence of the short stories for which Munro is justly famous, and the whole seems more like an autobiographical memoir than a fictional narrative. The setting is the small town of Jubilee in Southern Ontario, not so different from Alice Munro's own birthplace of Wingham. Like Munro herself, the narrator, Del Jordan, is the daughter of a fox fur farmer, and is of a similar age, passing through adolescence in the 1940s. Each chapter focuses on a different year in Del's life, from fourth grade through high-school graduation. She is a normal girl from modest surroundings, and her experiences are by no means unique. Yet she has a mother who, for all her eccentricities, believes in ideas and education; it soon becomes clear that Del (like the author) is destined to break clear of the limitations of these surroundings and become a writer.Munro's writing is straightforward and evocative, but it relies on small realizations rather than big events, so the book may seem dull at first. It began to take wing for me with the fourth chapter, \\"Age of Faith,\\" describing Del as a young teenager becoming interested in religion. \\"Changes and Ceremonies,\\" the next section, is about the school musical and what appears to be a budding romance between the producer and the school music teacher -- a touching story set off by the gentle sadness of its ending. In the final two chapters, \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" and \\"Baptizing,\\" romance is no longer something that Del observes from the outside, but a force that she must fit into her own view of herself, as she struggles with the changes in her body, confusing emotions, and the effect she has on men. One result of Munro casting the story as fiction is to enable her to treat Del's sexual discoveries much more frankly than she might have felt free to do in an autobiography. Temporarily derailed by love, Del's plans do not work out entirely as she had hoped, yet there is no doubt where she is heading in the end.Just as Alice Munro has used her birthplace as a source of wisdom without allowing herself to be confined by it, so Del Jordan leaves home only to return in spirit. A touching epilogue shows her looking back at Jubilee, consciously altering its details for the sake of her fiction, yet poignantly aware of the life there that she cannot capture on the page. It is a surprisingly postmodern device for 1971, but it gives this charming hybrid a context that has one foot in art and the other in everyday reality."},{"Title":"Lives of Girls and Women: A Novel","review":"Alice Munro is widely known as a short-story writer. However, in her career there supposedly be a novel: \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\", first published in 1971. In one of her rare interviews - to \\"The NY Times\\" in the 1980s - she says that to her view this book is more a series of interconnected stories than a novel per se. It is not because she says so, but anyone familiar of the structure of a regular novel is able to know that this is not really one of them.There are elements that belong to the novel dynamics - the same narrator, the same group of characters and so on - but, then again, they could belong to short stories either. As a matter of fact, each of the \`chapter' of \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" ends in itself. In other words, each of them has a beginning, middle, and an end. However, it is not the vital to decided whether this book is a novel or a collection of short stories. Either one will not change how brilliant it is.The second book published by Alice Munro, this is one of her best accomplished works as a whole. Her posterior collections have some of her best short stories ever - but as a whole they do not keep the same level. However in this one, none of the chapters is better or worse than the following one.Throughout a 40-year career, Alice Munro has established herself as one of the most important writers currently working. Her stories deal with ordinary people, whose lives would not be supposedly interesting. But, in her pages, this lives become unforgettable.In \\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" we follow the upbringing of a girl in rural Canada - this could be an autobiographical book, but it is not the point to discover it. We accompany Del Jordan since her childhood until her days as a young woman expecting to go to the university and chance the pattern in her family's life.\\"Lives of Girls and Women\\" are, after all, a book about changing times. At some point, Del's mother notices that \`there is a change coming I think in the lives of girls and women'. More than thirty years after its first publishing, the book proves that those changes came to stay."},{"Title":"Routing in the Internet","review":"I bought this book with high hopes. Huitema's first edition was exceptional, covering in detail protocols in use on the Internet at the time. What it lacked in theory, it made up for in practical applicability. When combined with Radia Perlman's _Interconnections (1st Edition)_ and access to the IETF RFC database, readers had access to all the information they could ever need about Internet routing.Then Perlman's 2nd edition was released. What _Interconnections_ had lacked before in practical details is more than addressed in that amazing book. One might hope that Huitema's 2nd edition would catch up to Perlman's in theoretical detail, making both books equivalent references for the field of Internet routing.Unfortunately, this is not the case. Huitema's second book reads much like the first. The &quot;2nd Edition&quot; enhancements seem to center on coverage of &quot;new technologies&quot; such as label switching and quality of service. None of the background that _Routing on the Internet_ lacked in the first edition is made up for here, and I found some of the coverage of new technologies to be superficial or poorly presented.Moreover, the presentation of the material is simply bad. The book is poorly edited, with grammatical errors throughout the text and fairly unclear writing. Worse, the diagramming style is extremely inconsistant. Throughout much of the book, the diagrams used appear to simply be typeset ASCII pictures!There are also points in the book where it appears that dated, inappropriate text from the first book was literally pasted into the second book. For instance, at one point the author asserts that &quot;not many companies are making money off of Internet routing devices&quot; (paraphrase), and &quot;a company called cisco&quot; (which he continues to lowercase) is a vendor of the most popular routers. Since he laters makes mention of Ipsilon, I'm guessing he hasn't just been asleep as Internet routing companies rampaged across the NASDAQ.Huitema is at his best when giving his opinions about aspects of Internet technologies. His recommendations are usually spot-on, and the historical background he provides about protocol development rivals the similar, excellent content in Perlman's _Interconnections_.However, with _Interconnections 2_ on the shelves, I can't see a good reason to shell out ... for this book. Huitema covers some technologies that Perlman doesn't, but Perlman covers essential technologies (such as switching and multicast forwarding) far better than _Routing on the Internet_."},{"Title":"Routing in the Internet","review":"There is a general rule of 80/20. It means 80% of networking books cover 20% of the available networking technologies because they are most common. The average book about internet routing includes 10% of RIP and IGRP, 25% of OSPF, 20% of EIGRP, 20% of BGP and just few words about multicasting, IPv6, resourse reservation, Internet architecture, mobile hosts etc. Another common feature of such books that they give you static shot of current state.Usually it's more then enough for day to day operations and many people are completely satisfied. But some people want to learn a bit about other 20% and see piture in motion. This book is exactly for them. Probably it doesn't help you much in Cisco router configuration, but you can learn internet history and future from the routing point of view. You can learn a way how routing protocols are developing, what are the current problems and what to expect in a recent future.This book was included in the CCIE library set and many people were really disappointed because it isn't focused on Cisco routing and switching. In opposite, the most part of this book covers everything that is usually not included in Cisco books. From CCIE or Cisco prospective this book is not really interesting, but it has another goal.A few more words about this book. It was written by French guy, and he is not Cisco employee. His style is completly different from e.g. Cisco press books'. Cisco wants to show you how well and smoothly it has solved problems, and this book wants to show you what are the problems and drawbacks of current solutions. Cisco gives you answers and this book sometimes just states questions without answers. It's more academic review then manual. Keep it in mind if you are going to buy it.The final words. Sometimes the language is dull and too dry but if you want to know current state of the internet evolution this book gives you information which is hard to find in any other single book. This book is very good but it's goal is different. It's like the most part of passengers have questions about tickets and they ask ticket agency. But some of them might want to learn more about airplane itself. They can find very good book about airplanes. It's also interesting book but it's definitly different and optional reading for the traveler. The same about this one. It's optional and not the highest priority book but it really gives you a lot of new information about internet routing."},{"Title":"Routing in the Internet","review":"My manager instructed me to learn about BGP.

It is not for someone who is new to Routing and wants to learn the protocols, as he assumes a certain level of knowledge. He reminds me of my professor at college, if you went into knowing nothing you would just come out confused. For someone at the CCNA/CCNP level wanting practical advice with a Cisco slant, without having to read the Cisco course books (which really only teach you how to pass the exam) I would recommend James Macfarlane's book over this.

Daws gives a quick sketch of Hawaii before James Cook arrived. He talks about the way the Hawaiians greeted the ships and gives snips from journal entries.When it comes to the reign of the Kamehamehas, Daws does a wonderful job of showing the practical brilliance of how Kamehameha the Great and Liholiho mastered the game of diplomacy--allying themselves with England, France, and the United States in ways that prolonged their independence.Daws also does a masterful job of showing how the once innocuous missionary families brought about the ultimate fall of the monarchy. Few authors can relate this story without showing passionate bias, but Daws succeeds. (Both Hawaiian activists and members of old missionary families will be offended, I think.) Daws avoids the common prattfall of painting King Kaulakaua and Queen Liliuokalani as saints, and Stanford Dole and Loren Thurston as demons.Some have complained that Daws's book ends with statehood. Books need to end somewhere. Statehood was the right place to end because Hawaiian statehood is an entirely different epic.Daws's book is a nearly perfect introduction to Hawaiian history--a survey book that covers all of the bases. After finishing this book you may want to move on to more detailed books on the fall of the monarchy (see the works of R.S. Kuykendall), ancient Hawaii (see \\"Ruling Chiefs of Hawaii\\" by S. M. Kamakau), and the attack on Pearl Harbor (see \\"At Dawn We Slept\\" by Prange and Goldstein).I absolutely recommend \\"Shoal of Time\\" for anybody curious about Hawaiian history. I especially recommend this book to tourists coming to the islands for the first time. Reading this book could improve a visit. Knowing the significance of Iolani Palace and other sites cannot help but improve your visit.If you are visiting Oahu, I also recommend purchasing a copy of \\"A Walk Through Old Honolulu\\" by the late O.A. Bushnell. This long out of print pamphlet gives a concise history of the buildings that speckle a small walkable distance in downtown Honolulu...."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Anyone who has read James Mitchner's Hawaii, which includes just about anyone who has visited the islands, and is in need of a historical fix (as in correction) ought to read Gavan Daws excellent Shoal of Time: A History of the Hawaiian Islands. Daws has done what Mitchner could not with his admirably popular, historically inadequate, sprawling epic, told the whole story.Through no fault of the author in any historical fiction the emphasis is on the fiction, as it should be; as a result the history is bound to suffer in some form. This is a disservice to both history and the authors who choose to write about it, especially if people then believe \\"this is what happened, and how.\\"Daws' book should be the book everyone who visits Hawaii should read at some point, especially if they have read Mitchner. Unlike Mitchner, the history Daws tells begins not with pre-history which to a certain degree can be sketchy and speculative at best (native Hawaiians had no written language, rather their stories/legends/beliefs/accomplishments were told and passed on orally from generation to generation via complex and myth laden chants). Rather Daws chooses to begin his story with the \\"discovery\\" of Europeans by the Hawaiians to turn a phrase. The history begins with the arrival of the ill-fated, but well intentioned, Captain Cook, as he stumbles into the Hawaiian islands in the late eighteenth century while looking for something else.As in Alan Moorehead's The Fatal Impact, this is where the real story begins, as this cultural collision portends ill for the Hawaiians as they then become even more belligerent eventually uniting under a single king with the help of a few well intentioned outsiders along.Again as in Moorehead the act of discovery becomes an act of destruction. Whalers, missionaries, planters, immigrants (Japan, China, Portugal, Philippines etc.), politicians, and various and sundry hangers on descend on the island to carve and shape what was once perfect into something much different. Something much changed and still evolving, like the islands themselves.All of this ultimately results in the overturning of the monarchy in the interests of what's best for Hawaii, but not necessarily the native Hawaiians.Shoal of Time is a compelling read. The full story is fascinating, disturbing, enlightening and sad as the Hawaiians are pushed out of their own history into some shadow existence where they tentatively remain today.Mitchner got some of it right. Daws gets it all right."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"An excellent writing style by a knowledgable author combine here to give the reader a feeling for how and why Hawai'i moved from isolation to its current status.

You've got to make hard choices about what to include, and what to leave out, and your choices often speak volumes about you as a writer of history and about the audience you intend to reach. Gavan Daws excellent book, Shoal of Time, does an admirable job in presenting as much history of Hawaii as possible in a manageable single volume that is (relatively) free from overt bias. He starts with the &quot;discovery&quot; of the islands by Captain Cook in the 1700's, moves through the Kamehameha monarchs and their often bloody battles (this section is one of the book's highlights), continues with the work of the missionaries (for better or worse, sometimes with tragic consequences), importation of oriental workers to help with the great sugar plantations, and finally finishes with Hawaii as a territory, WWII, and statehood. Dawes is mostly concerned in telling the various political intrigues that are woven throughout Hawaiian history: monarchs vs. monarchs, missionaries vs. &quot;hedonists&quot;, foreigners vs natives and others; by concentrating his efforts in this direction, he accurately depicts the history of the islands as one fraught with controversies over citizenship, ownership, and how the fledgling territory and state is viewed by the world at large. Both Great Britain and the United States play significant roles and each at one time lays claim to the tiny republic; Dawes must be given special accolades for presenting the (at times) unsavory annexation attempts by both nations as factually and as completely free from bias as possible. An admirable job of storytelling, yet there are one or two subject matters that Dawes could have at least touched upon that would have made Shoal more complete, including: (1)ancient, pre-Cook Hawaii, (2) more discussion about islands other than Oahu and Maui, which take up close to 90% of the book, and (3)the rise of Hawaii as a tourist and cultural mecca, in the 1950's and beyond, and how such a rise will affect the future of the islands and the growing sovereignty movement. In short, Shoal of Time is a very fine work, and should be one of your first purchases when assembling your library of island history and Hawaiiana."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"It is true that Daws has a western scholar's perspective, he is, after all, a western scholar. This hardly invalidates the history he has written any more than it would invalidate a history of the continental U.S. not written from the perspective of the native people. Similarly, it is unfair to criticize a book because it is not all-inclusive. This book outlines the history of Hawaii between Cook's discovery and statehood. Anyone who would like a history of Hawaii before 1778, or a history of Hawaii from a Polynesian perspective, or would like more details of people and events from this period should read a lot more books. Kuykendall's three-volume History of the Hawaiian Kingdom (available at the University of Hawaii Press) is wonderful and should probably be considered essential reading for anyone interested in this period of Hawaiian history but at over 1700 pages it's a bit of a slog (Kuykendall's one-volume history of Hawaii from pre-discovery to statehood might be a good alternative but I have not read it so I cannot say).The Shoal of Time is extremely well written. The author's dry wit and clever turns of phrase make this very enjoyable reading. I can see where it would be possible for someone to read this book and not understand the use of irony and sarcasm. When Daws says something like, \\"Toward the end of his life Lorrin Thurston reviewed the accomplishments of the \`mission boys' and he found, unsurprisingly, that they were a \`splendid body of men'\\", he certainly doesn't mean that he himself thinks they were a splendid body of men. It is obvious throughout that Daws has no great admiration for the missionaries and their descendants. The businessmen who overthrew the monarchy are portrayed as hypocritical, self-serving schemers who paid lip service to Christian virtues while assuming that the poor of the world were put on God's Earth to supply them with laborers. They believed that what was best for themselves was best for everyone and that they were entitled to their wealth by way of their superior intellects (and race). In other words, they were pretty much the same as right-wing businessmen today. As we watch modern-day developers build multi-million dollar condos along the beaches and as a new wave of wealthy haoles takes over the islands, the primary lesson presented in the Shoal of Time should be well learned: The one thing at which the rich excel is taking care of their own interests and you should not expect them to do otherwise."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"We arrived on Oahu June of 2004 for a 3 year military tour. While one of the critics indicates this book does not fully explain the (in my own words) hostile take over of the Hawaiian monarchy, he also does not tell you that Hawaiian history while plentiful is not well published.Unlike the American Civil war for which there are hundreds and thousands of volumes of work, there are just a handful of well written published Hawaiian history books. This is why the reviewer did not also suggest alternatives.I was stunned by the limited amount of material available to read. And for the reviewer who criticized the incomplete research of the Hawaiian newspapers - I look forward to reading the book you write from this research. I hope the next decade brings more and more published work of this great island nation.Shoal of Time does what few other books do. It gives a reasonably thorough look at Hawaiian history. It is a great place to start for those interested in Hawaiian history and a great diving board for those wishing to write their own works.Again hundreds if not thousands of books on the American Civil war from 1861-1865. A handful of Hawaiian history books for the entire period of history.I would celebrate if the the Sovereignty movement produced some well written books of their own. Instead, during our three years living and traveling throughout the islands, it was limited to a few newspaper articles and some protest type gatherings. There is a definite voice among the Hawaiian Nation movement, but one that is not clearly understood by the rest of the 49 states.No one book can be all things to all people. This one is an excellent \\"history\\" book. Daws tells the story of Hawaii with his voice.Hawaii is a story which isn't finished and the richness of its history leaves plenty of room for others to pick up their pen and bring it to life for those of us who are readers."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Daws' Shoal of Time is a frequently-read introductory piece to Hawai'i's history, but readers must beware of the slanted historiography which fill its pages. Daws begins with James Cook's visit to Hawaii; yet Hawai'i has 2000 years of history predating this European visit, and native sources (notably the scholar Samuel M. Kamakau, in the original Hawaiian language editions) indicate that Cook may have not been the first non-Hawaiian to 'discover' Hawai'i. The decision to start his history at 1778 erases the preceding 1,778 years of lives, deaths, loves, politics, etc.Similarly, Daws ignores nearly all of the Hawaiian language sources, including more than ninety Hawaiian Language newspapers published from the 1830s to the 1940s, in which the vast record of the Hawaiian people is recorded. In pursuing this monolingual history of a multicultural place, Daws depicts Native Hawaiians as passive participants in the vicissitudes of history. He misses, for example, the thousands of petitioners rising up against American annexation of Hawai'i in 1897 and 1898. He also writes in celebratory tones about the build-up of American military in Hawai'i throughout the 20th century, without an analysis into the powerful political economy of dependency and militarism which is the backdrop for this period.Hawai'i's history is very complex, and deserves a more careful reading than Daws is willing to provide here. Instead, his popular book is an apologia for American empire, without an appreciation for the voices of empire's discontented islanders."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Everyone I know who has read Daws' book seems to agree with the other reviewers at this site that this is an excellent presentation of Hawaiian history. I've bought this book as presents for family and friends, and I keep going back to my dog-eared copy to re-read certain sections, such as the narrative of the infamous Charlton Affair.One criticism I might offer is that the book was written in 1989. An update would be appreciated."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"This book is a detailed academic history of Hawaii, focusing on political forces. It begins with Captain Cook's first sighting of the islands in 1778, and continues through statehood. Topics covered include: Kamehameha I, missionaries, the whaling economy, the sugar economy, immigration, annexation, and World War II. In preparing this volume, Daws referred to thousands of primary sources, some of which are listed in end notes at the back of the book. There is also an extensive index.Parts of the text are extremely detailed, so much so that it sometimes becomes hard to discern the big picture. At the same time, Daws doesn't cover every development, leaving some questions open about exactly what happened, why and when. The story is told from a Western point of view, and some Hawaiians may find this bias off-putting. Nevertheless, bringing all the threads together as Daws has done here is a major achievement, and the book is well worth consulting for those with a serious interest in Hawaiian history."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Understanding the history of America's states is an important part of understanding why America is the way it is today and how it can face the problems of the future. Shoals of Time provides a basis for understanding how one of the two non-contiguous states became a state and more importantly a history of the culture and the problems that the people of Hawaii faced from the time Cook landed on the islands up through the passage of statehood. As a history text Shoals of Time provides a model of what history is about.First, Shoals of Time gives the background details necessary for the understanding of the turmoil and conflict that emerged when two very different cultures clashed under less than ideal circumstances. The stories that Daws incorporates into the book to describe the impact of European influence on the vastly different culture of the South Pacific are detailed enough to enlighten the reader as to how and why the conflict occured. At the same time the details are not so minute as to keep the reader from being focused on the big picture, which is the second asset of this book.History is more than names, dates, and places. It is a story of people, whether it be told in an economic, political, or social manner, it is the story that matters. Daws provides a superb story for the reader to follow. He neither loses the forest for the trees, nor the trees for the forest. The details shed light and tell the overarching story of the Hawaiian islands and give outstanding insight into the push for secession that exists today in the islands.Hawaii is a beatiful place to visit, but knowing the history of what happened and where in this paradise makes the islands that much more intriguing and that much more spectacular."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"As an annual visitor to the Big Island, this book really brought home to me much of the history behind the place I visit or drive by regularly. I'm not sure how to describe Daws' style, but it's great - you're reading history and fact without feeling entirely like you're reading a history book! More like the story of an ever-evolving family. What a book!"},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Not much to add to the rest of the reviews except to say if you'r e looking for a well written account of the history of hawaii this is the one.

It reads well and is hard to put down if dip into it."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"This is a pleasant, informative book -very worthwhile, particularly if you're planning a tripto the Islands (which all of us should do at least oncein our lifetimes)."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"If you are curious in learning about the actual history of Hawai'i this is not the book to refer to. It is a good book for students to distinguish bias and actual facts is the thing to look for especially in academic texts and history. The thing is the real \\"history\\" of Hawai'i does not in fact START with Captain Cook as some people proclaim. But other than that this books backs up some of its claims with excerpts from some of the men's journals. This book doesn't offend me, I look at it as a difference in opinion. It's very biased as I mentioned above and I do agree with the comments of how the author seemed to imply the women were objects or property of the men (which were EXTREMELY untrue) and the actions and behavior of native Hawaiians portrayed in the book. The best \\"truth\\" about Hawai'i you can get is the Hawaiian courses you can take from actual Hawaiian instructors. They are very intelligent and will give a largely unbiased account of history. But it is best not to believe everything that you read in this book."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"I love the way the author presented his own idea in this book. His opinion makes the book much easier to read. Though I have some trouble on the vocabularies he used, Shoal Of Time is no doubt an excellent hawaiian history text book."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Reading Shoal of Time by Gavan Daws is like having to sit at the dinner table until you ate all of your spinach. You know it's good for you to finish, but...The grinding pace is primarily focused on the political and government foundation of Hawaii. Within an historical context, I expected to learn about the effects of great changes that occurred in a relatively short period of time in Hawaii's history such as* the influences of foreigners on Hawaiians* the missionaries, religion and the Western education system on Hawaiians* Hawaii's industrial revolution and waves of foreign work forces* leprosy, disease and germ impacts* the political agendas of contemporary native HawaiiansIndeed, most of these subjects were touched upon, but Prof. Daws quickly retreats to hampering the reader with tale after tale of white vs. white lawsuits, inter-government bickering and island newspapers squabbles amongst themselves.He doesn't give a sense of how ordinary Hawaiians embraced, revolted or tolerated these immense changes to their way of life. For example, a very important time in Hawaii's history was the process of land distribution. I found lacking any explanation of the process of obtaining a kuleana or homestead. Instead, Prof. Daws describes Hawaiians as eager to sell their shares closing this section with, \\"The commoners had their moment, and it had passed by, they were left with not much more than a terrible sense of deprivation\\".The book was at its best when describing Captain Cook's arrival, surprising reception, and ultimate demise. The long line of Kamehamehas was detailed, each new king evolving and further joining Hawaii with the rest of the world. We learn of the many countries expressing interest in annexing Hawaii as their own territory. Revelations exposed of 19th century racism of Americans towards Hawaiians in general and Hawaiian royalty specifically. And, at long last, the journey toward statehood.In the end, I can't recommend this book because it couldn't maintain my interest. If you are looking for a detailed history having lots of information about cabinet members, political policies, government process, and Hawaii's ruling class, then this is the book for you. Expecting an ethnological, cultural, or social history is a mistake here."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"invaluable info for my hawaiian history class took over a month to get here, but worth the wait."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Daws has written an interesting, well-written, and compelling history of the Hawai'ian islands from their discovery by Captain Cook through statehood. Captivating and illuminating throughout. The author, a native Australian, brings an admirable lack of bias to his presentation. Dry humor and irony pervade the book.Only one quibble, and that for the publisher: as in many books published in Daws's timeframe, Hawai'ian's thirteenth letter, the 'okina (glottal stop, symbolized by a reversed apostrophe) is omitted from Hawai'ian words. Today that is recognized as misspelling, and the University of Hawai'i should republish in more up-to-date and phonemically correct transcription.Highly recommended to anyone interested in the fascinating history of the Islands."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Shoal of Time does many things well. It outlines the basic names, dates, facts of Hawaiin history. It tells a mostly compelling narrative of the evolving political changes of the islands from the late 1700's to the statehood. The author appears to be largely unbiased and nonpartisan to the various sides of the political fights he describes.However, the book feels very dated at best and casually rascist at worst. For example, \\"history\\" begins with the arrival of the white European Captain Cook. From that point on, most of what is desribed is from the accounts of white Europeans with distinct agendas. Whether it was the military sailors, or Protestant missionaries, sugar plantation owners or permanent settlers hoping for annexation, these parties had a mightily biased and unflattering view of the native Hawaiins. Yet page after page of these unflattering views is simply presented without being challenged or put into context.Thus the author at various times calls the natives lazy, uncommitted, drunken, foolish, incapable of work, childish, and always sexually immoral. It seems almost every page contains an unchallenged and unexamined reference to the native women behaving like whores. Early on, the women are so sexually crazed that they basically force themselves on the fair sailors who arrive in port. Over time, the author repeatedly cites the natives \\"disgenuous\\" character of \\"giving away their women.\\" (To sailors, to whites, to \\"coolies\\", \\"orientals,\\" etc.)One might ask why it it assumed that the women belonged to the men to \\"give away\\" at all. One might also ask why interacial sexual relations are seen as evidence of loose morals on behalf of native women, but not of the outsider men. One might ask a lot of the assumptions and casual rascism here, but the author certainly does not.Nothing makes it appear that any of this is intentional. But the narrative of the story he chooses to tell essentially ignores the perspective of the native Hawaiins. (After all, there is no story until the white man shows up). By ignoring native language sources, his story is effectively told mostly through the thread and perspective of white Europeans and Americans out to conquer the islands and reshape them to suit thier own agendas.In the end, this leaves a very one sided and disatisfying overview of Hawaii, one of the most multicultural places in the world."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"This book is a must read for any one studying or interested in Hawaiian history.

None-the-less, I live much of what is presented in this valuable book, or at least understand more because of reading it, as well as other books written from both native Hawaiian and other perspectives.\\"Shoal of Time: A History of the Hawaiian Islands,\\" published over 15 years ago, is considered by many to be a classic. What happened during the approximately 150 years between Kamehameha I and Hawaiian statehood is presented in lapidary detail. Focusing primarily on the tsunami of changes in governance, land ownership, and international influence, \\"Shoal of Time\\" gives the context (and consequences) in social and religious terms.Told mostly in historical narrative, well-referenced and scholarly, this is no James Michener light reading. There are some engaging stories carrying the narrative onward, but this is a book for those with a deep interest in Hawaiian history since about 1780 and who enjoy a full, intense description of what happened, who were the actors, influences on events, the competition of many countries for control of the Islands, and an extensive cast of characters.The story is told, one should understand, with intent to be balanced, fair, and neutral. Gavin Dawes, a respected professor of history, succeeds well, but by some would not be considered adequately to reflect Native Hawaiian feelings and perspectives.Companion reading might be Kiana Davenport's \\"Shark Dialogs,\\" history in the form of a novel and recent books published by the movements for restoration of the Hawaiian kingdom.Highly recommended----I usually send this book and a few others to visitors who want to know more about Hawaii than the best retaurant in Waikiki."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"This is a great book for anyone who loves the islands. It's an easy read, and very important to know the information."},{"Title":"Shoal of time;: A history of the Hawaiian Islands","review":"Daws presents a thorough, scholarly account of Hawaiian history since the first European contact. His language is direct and enaging. He avoids the trap of assigning unusual motive or blame to any of the actors in this real-life drama and neither novelizes the facts nor tries to make the events fit a larger thesis; these things happened and there you have it. I found all the parties involved in this amazing story presented as people with the usual forces driving them: hunger for money, love, power, freedom, land, God's favor, etc. The Hawaiians, Europeans, and later immigrants from all over the world all jostle for a piece of this paradise - some trying to grab it all, others grimly holding on to any little bit they can. There is no need to dramatize the facts, they are sufficiently riveting as told and Daws shows great restraint in keeping the narrative unadorned without being academically sterile. His attempt to keep the descriptions engaging results in his use of some blunt terms that some may find politically incorrect or offensive. Be warned! Also be prepared to be charmed for life by the tragic grace of Queen Liliuokalani and awestruck by the brilliance and daring of KamehamehaI bought this book to give myself a quick background before my first trip to the islands but got more: a story fascinating in its own right and instructive of larger issues. In fact, I found the book to be a microcosm of the development of the United States as a whole but played out in a much smaller theater and thus more easily understood. Anyone who reads this book will come away with a better understanding of what \\"democracy\\" really means and how powerful forces trying either to nuture it or to destroy it play out in real events.
